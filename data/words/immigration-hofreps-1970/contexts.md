## Contexts in which the word "immigration" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* 29 August: **Immigration** Task Force (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland) - Tabled by  Mr Grassby.

* We saw the Government, from the Prime Minister downand apparently in a speech yesterday even the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)-  appreciating the significance of private enterprise.

* At the lowest level there is the simple question of illegal **immigration**, illegal fishing and so forth.

* Sir Laurence  said that instead of doing this we are bringing in, by mass **immigration**, more pick and shovel workers, for pick and shovel methods.

* He accepted the wine tax and voted for it as did the remainder of the South Australian quartet comprising the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  and the honourable members for Wakefield and Boothby  (Mr McLeay).

* In addition to that we have the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who, if he had not been deported, is at least temporarily away from the country.

* f refer honourable members to the **Immigration** (Education) Bill to which my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  referred during the first session of the Parliament in 1970.

* I now deal with an area of specific interest to me at the moment because of my involvement in **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* I am staggered that the honourable members from Tasmania should sit so still and silent in this place and not try to at least get the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  to do something about the position.

* I also acknowledge the statement made by the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the Member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Moss Cass),  when I tabled the Committee's seventh annual report.

* Where is the $500m for rural loans at 3 per cent about which the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  howled through the countryside trying to delude sincere people that this was the treatment they would get?

* The problems of local govern ment have increased due to booming population growth which has been caused partly by an unplanned influx from **immigration**.

* As Minister for **Immigration** I am faced with the fact that they have established themselves.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is sitting at the table looking as if he will give forth.

* In a way I suppose I am using the debate on this Bill as an opportunity to ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* I suggest that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and his Department might have a further look at this matter and that the former  President  of Lebanon be allowed to visit Australia.

* -Last week the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  acting on behalf of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Senator Greenwood)  announced the intention of the Government to amend the home savings grant scheme.

* Obviously that must be done through the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Nobody on the Government side has explained to us yet how the Government intends to maintain our **immigration** intake if it abolishes the tariff system, which some honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  want.

* He has not explained the tardiness of his approach to the question or the tardiness of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The next man is the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  and after him my good friend the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp)  although I hope I am wrong in saying this because he certainly does not deserve to be dismissed.

* Even the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  may assist us in this matter.

* The balance of approximately $50m is proposed to be expended on Aboriginal programs by the Department of Education for study grants, secondary grants, overseas study grants and expenditure in the Northern Territory; the Department of Health on health and medical services for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory; the Department of Labor and **Immigration** on the Aboriginal Employment Training Scheme; and the Departments of Housing and Construction, Northern Australia, and Urban and Regional Development on various services and facilities.

* In the long term, the consequences of the loss of this human potential and potential consumer demand will be reflected in fewer employment opportunities in this country unless we are prepared to engage in a massive **immigration** program to try to fill this great land of ours.

* 1 was concerned about this when I was Minister for **Immigration**.

* We have had one investigation conducted by Professor Wilson within the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs since 1970.

* I refer to price control, **immigration** and industrial sanctions as examples.

* We have the Grants Commission in the first instance, and under the generous hand of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  the Regional Employment Development scheme has blossomed and is providing vast amounts of money to local government, also in questionable circumstances.

* The activities of Labor's Department of Postwar Reconstruction and Department of **Immigration** provided a sound basis for Australia's early post-war development.

* I have already had some discussions through the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council with  Mr L.  J. Mooney who is the  President  of the Australian Council of Local Government Association and through him and with his co-operation the Association is at the present time carrying out a survey of all local government bodies with a view to ascertaining what their needs are, what their desires are and how we can help in the supply of migrants or, if you like, the diversion of settlers from these inner city areas.

* I accept that what the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has been saying has been said in good faith, and I can assure him that it is no reflection on him personally that we are pressing for this amendment.

* I think it is particularly instructive to look at the situation in Leeton, which is in the electorate of Riverina so inadequately serviced by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* I request the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, who is sitting at the table, to ask the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to have a look at this matter with an open mind to ascertain whether we might be better off by removing the sales tax on these items so as to improve the profits of the retail trade and retain or bring back employment opportunities in this country.

* I have no objection to people migrating to Australia under the new guidelines put forward by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  and L welcome them.

* The distinguished member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  is uncertain as to whether or not he is any longer able to represent the concensus in the Australian Labor Party on its attitude to **immigration**.

* Mr Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation because the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and, later, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  who represents the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson),  misrepresented me during question time.

* The evidence of the Government's panic is the campaign of fear and hysteria being drummed up by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly).

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  takes great pride in the fact that every month he is employing more people under the RED scheme.

* It was the Labor Government which effectively dismantled the old National Labour Advisory Council because the then Minister for Labour and **Immigration** believed that he knew more about industrial relations than anybody else and it was not necessary to have it.

* The point was made by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  that when matters of public importance are brought forward from time to time - and this has been quite frequently in recent weeks - it is noticeable that they relate to issues which are being debated by the Government or the responsible authorities and others involved.

* Full employment and **immigration** go together.

* In my inimitable way I have written a paper which perhaps is not as over-powering as the persuasiveness of my claims on the Regional Employment and Development scheme as outlined by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  today, but at least it is a concrete contribution.

* Indonesia's continuing help in forestalling unheralded arrivals of refugees is very much appreciated, for it is much easier for Australia to take in a significant number of refugees, I believe, when this is done in an orderly way and under proper **immigration** procedures and not arriving unheralded on our coastline.

* Professor Walsh is  Chairman  of the Great Barrier Reef Study Committee of the Australian Academy of Science,  Chairman  of the Advisory Committee on the Environment to the Australian Government through the Minister for the Environment and Conservation,  Chairman  of the Research Advisory Committee on the Crown of Thorns, past  Chairman  of the Joint CommonwealthQueensland Crown of Thorns Starfish Inquiry and a member of the **Immigration** Planning Committee.

* On 1 1 November, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in the elected Government,  Senator James  McClelland, announced that government sponsored students from Vietnam and Cambodia were eligible for resident status whether or not they had completed their studies- a significant departure from previous practice.

* If the statistics which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has given are correct, the **immigration** programme of which we boast - and rightly so - is a concealed failure because apparently there are more abortions than there are people coming into this country, after deducting the number of departing migrants.

* Neither the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz)  who introduced the Bill in this chamber, nor the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  who made the original announcement, nor the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who in this place represents the Minister for Health, ever explained exactly what will happen to all of the pharmaceutical benefits which are at present costing the Government between 50c and $1.

* On 18 November the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in response to a question which I placed on the notice paper some months ago stated that deportation orders had been signed against 30 Chileans who were illegally resident in Australia and that other cases were under consideration.

* When these were being ironed out by the then Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, the Honourable Clyde Cameron, he was, as the House will recall, unceremoniously removed by his Leader.

* To achieve this and to prevent many migrant children from growing up to become secondclass citizens, I propose to consult my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, on ways and means of reviewing the Child Migrant Education Program in conjunction with State and independent school authorities, so that it will fully meet the needs of migrant children.

* Contrary to the views that are expressed by a number of Ministers, including the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is in the House at the moment and who so frequently says that the policy of the Opposition would be to retain a large percentage of unemployment, let me assure the Government and the Minister that it is not the policy of the Opposition to have unemployment.

* Today we have a different approach by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who represents the Minister for Health  (Senator Greenwood)  in this place.

* I also indicated at that time that I would look to see whether anything had been done by my predecessors and I found that the honourable member for Bowman had asked a question of the previous Minister for **Immigration**, now the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, in 1970.

* I would like to think that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation would try to encourage the dairy industry to look at the possibility of a European-type veal production, particularly in Sydney where we have an enormous continental population as a result of the **immigration** program that has been operating since the Great War.

* The largest increase was 188,000 in 1969-70 but this was a year of very high **immigration**, when net settler arrivals totalled 159,000, including 72,300 workers.

* That was said by none other than the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who says he likes to look after everyone.

* The comment of the previous Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, was that he would resign if his Government ever allowed the registered unemployed to reach 250 000.

* It is a matter to which every honourable member concerned must apply himself, members such as those from South Australia, including the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  who has maintained the silence of Dean Maitland on all matters of rural affairs.

* Many of the schools were built in the 1890s and today we have a massive **immigration** programme with migrants nocking into these schools which have no proper facilities to cope with them.

* Following the tabling of the report of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs last week, honourable members will be aware that in Australia at the present time there is a considerable number of people who fall into the category of prohibited or illegal migrants.

* My colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** will be tabling today the report of  Mr Justice  J.

* It has sought access to funds through the Regional Employment Development scheme operated by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Has he been told that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is forecasting that unemployment will show a big increase in the next few months and that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is forecasting that 300,000 Australians will be out of work in January?

* This will probably overshadow what occurred one or two years ago and would cause quite a strain to those persons and would cause great strains on our infrastructure here including our **immigration** program and our schools.

* It has refused to review the **immigration** program in spite of the continued tightening of the labor market.

* This is necessary in order to bring these allowances into line with those payable to trainees under the national employment and training system which was recently introduced by my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* In fairness, I must say that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stands firmly behind principle- any principle which will serve him for the moment.

* 9 on national income and expenditure, the wages share of gross domestic product at factor cost is 60.4 per cent after adjustment for changes in work force composition as outlined by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** in its publication entitled: Share of the National Product' which was published in 1 975.

* The plain fact is that a member has not the time to read them for the simple reason that by the time he has dealt with constituency matters - social services, telephone complaints, complaints about **immigration** and the like - there is no time left to undertake the study, research and reading that he should be doing.

* Of course, the honourable member for Grayndler questioned his Party's **immigration** policy and he had very good reason to question it in view of some of his Party's policies which seem to be shunted around at the present time.

* In recent months a number of rackets have been uncovered by the officers of the Department of **Immigration** which have involved bringing people to this country in circumstances which are clear exploitation of migrants.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  stated to the House a couple of days ago, one benefit of the Regional Employment Development scheme is that it has enabled the CES to work test a substantial number of registrants by offering them jobs, in this way testing the validity of their registration.

* There is on the notice paper a motion that the House take note of papers in relation to **immigration** presented by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly).

* After 25 years of a massive **immigration** scheme we still have not sorted out what ought to be done properly to recognise overseas professional qualifications.

* The tragedy is that during the first year of the Australian Labor Party Government the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  adopted an encouraging stance.

* I would have thought that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have fought tooth and nail within the Ministry to ensure that benefits were raised to a livable level, knowing that the proportion of unemployed coming directly or indirectly under his Department's care.

* This thinking was introduced again in this place by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  who seemed to be saying that he wanted the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to make sure that any ships coming into the Port of Darwin would be unloaded by Transport Workers' Union labour rather than by Australian Waterside Workers' Federation labour.

* The statement by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  is in face a restatement, albeit in condensed form, of a statement made by the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  in the Senate the week before last.

* **Immigration** cannot for much longer be expected to supply great numbers of professional, technical and skilled workers necessary in these fields.

* I think we learnt that lesson the hard way by the disastrous efforts of the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Whilst I had discussions with Thai officials- the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and others- in regard to refugees generally, which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to discuss when I report to him on those discussions, I also raised with the Vietnamese Vice-Foreign Minister the question of 400 applicants who had been approved for entry to Australia by my colleague but regarding whom there has been little progress achieved by our representations to the Vietnamese.

* B. K. Miller, M.L.C., Minister for Tourism and **Immigration**, Tasmania; the  Hon.

* I want to ask the honourable member for Grey  (Mr Wallis)  and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  as well as the other honourable members opposite who represent country electorates, why they, together with the honourable members of the 2 Parties on this side of the chamber who represent rural seats, are not at least voicing their objection to the increased charges that are being levied in almost every way on the communications structure of people who live in outlying areas.

* The fact is that  Mr Speaker  Cope acted with great restraint on that occasion, and no fair minded person would disagree with the contention that he was left with no option other than to name the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* It is widely recognised in the Australian community that the legislation introduced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as Minister for Labour and **Immigration** in 1973 was a significant breakthrough in the quest of working women to achieve equality of opportunity.

* The honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  might have imagined it was an **immigration** debate for all the interest he was taking.

* We have brought forward positive policies in relation to **immigration**, education, all areas of government, exercising a degree of restraint in the national interest.

* 1 firmly believe that the Minister, not the Secretary, should have the final word, as is the case, for example, with **immigration** referrals.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  and many others have carried out vicious attacks on the Opposition's suggestions for sound economic management.

* Yet in December 1 974 the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Cameron,  announced in a Press statement a program of relocation assistance.

* In many respects it is probably more heart-rending than the decisions that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has to make about families who have settled here, have had children born here, and then, having exceeded their right of residency, are deported.

* on earth; that we have eagerly supported the most unpopular war in modern times, on the ground that Asia should be a battle-ground of our freedom; that we fail to oppose the sale of arms to South Africa; that the whole world believes that our **immigration** policy is based on colour and that we run one of the world's last colonies.

* As it is proposed to move this amendment in the Senate the Opposition is quite prepared in the meantime before this legislation goes to the Senate to agree to withdrawing the motion for the deletion of sub-clause (3) if the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is handling this Bill tonight, perhaps with the assistance of departmental officers, can show good reason why this sub-clause is necessary for the administration of the Corporation.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  on the clause relating to this, last evening referred to the injunctive process.

* The Opposition has some real reservations, and perhaps before replying to our remarks on this measure the Attorney-General  (Mr Enderby)  will reflect that in 1973, when his colleague the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who is now the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  introduced amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, it was the intention of the Government then so to amend the Act as to allow it to appoint an unlimited number of judges to the Industrial Court.

* This is one of the clauses on which I would like an explanation from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Nobody can deny that there is a rump in the Australian Labor Party and one of them - the Minister for **Immigration** (Mr Grassby) - is sitting on the other side of the table.

* Unfortunately, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is not listening to me.

* As a result of the work of these men a community health service has been provided, an office of the Department of Social Security has been established, new roads have been put in to service the area- I will deal with the Old Beach Road at a later stage and will tell the House just what did occur in regard to that road- grants have been made to the Clarence Council, an office of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has been set up as well as Social Welfare offices.

* I read into the words of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  the intention that nothing will be changed.

* If we are going to put **immigration** in reverse and send people to live somewhere else because we cannot get them jobs here in factories, which are the only places in which they can get jobs, we are going to be in a pretty sorry state.

* In terms of the Federal powers relating to customs, **immigration**, disease control, defence, poaching and fishing the control of these waters is obviously a Commonwealth responsibility.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  was sitting in the House until a few moments ago.

* We have had the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  making statements in total disagreement.

* It has been denied the opportunity to debate the lack of confidence in the community and unemployment which ranges in estimates by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the  Deputy  Prime Minister from 150,000 to 200,000 people.

* Members of the Opposition heard something last night and they will hear something more tonight which will show beyond doubt that this Government and this Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  are not committed in any way, shape or form to unemployment.

* Probably the most shameful episode of the period of conservative **immigration** policy occurred just before we assumed office in 1972.

* It is also quite clear that the labour force is not as docile as it was when this country was implementing massive **immigration** programs.

* The threat is more acute in those cases where there has been large-scale **immigration** of ethnic Russians, such as in Latvia, whose people and language have already been overwhelmed in the main cities.

* I go a little bit further and deal with statements made by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and an unfortunate statement made by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  for whom nobody on this side of the House has any ill will whatsoever.

* This great programme was initiated by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  in bis capacity as Minister for **Immigration** in the post-war Chifley Government and has been carried on successfully by various governments since 1949.

* I know that my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, in the administration of the numerical multifactor assessment system of determining eligibility for permanent entry into Australia, takes fully into account the occupational needs of industry in Australia as one of the basic factors of the NUMAS scheme.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  came into the chamber last night to listen to the tirade of the Leader of the Opposition, splendidly bedecked in a coat of cross-bred merino dorset horn, which every honourable member would remember.

* That projection was based on a net **immigration** gain of 50 000 people per annum and an assumed continuation of the presently low level of fertility.

* Late in 1975 the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Senator James  McClelland, requested  Mr R.  M. Northrop, Q.C.-as he then was- to report on the views of the parties to the industry as to what they saw as the problems associated with the existing arrangements and the action they considered appropriate for the Government to take as to future arrangements.

* From time to time we will hear people associated with the **immigration** policies of this country and some industry leaders saying that we need more skilled tradesmen; that the only way we will get skilled tradesmen is to have a greater inflow of migrants.

* Along with the Prime Minister of Australia and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  they attacked the Vietnamese Government for what they called 'profiteering' from refugees.

* Thirdly, we took action to ensure that we would reduce the **immigration** inflow in order to minimise the impact upon employment figures because over the Christmas period approximately 190,000 people will come into the work force from secondary schools and from tertiary education levels.

* After we had had serious fights with the Victorian Department of Education about the requirements of that Department in that teachers had to come to Australia for an interview - one of them was teaching in Ethiopia - the Victorian Teachers Union doubted the applicants' qualifications; then we had our final tussle with that remarkable revolutionary, the then Minister for **Immigration**.

* I am wondering whether in the interests of the smooth running of the House he would content himself with allowing me to record now in Hansard his wish to speak to the Bill and whether in view of the circumstances he would forgo his right to speak and allow the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  a few moments to reply to the questions properly put by the honourable member for Oxley.

* On 25 May 1972 the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  said very diabolical things about a wine excise which the previous Government imposed.

* Mir GRASSBY (Riverina- Minister for **Immigration**) (4.34) - There must be a sense of dismay in the community at large when it becomes known that the Opposition has decided to stonewall on this measure which is designed to give Australians some protection from monopolies and from exploitation.

* It can be for one of two reasons, either that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  does not know what the Bill provides for in its legal implications or it is being deliberately inserted to enable a federal organisation to exclude from its branches the opportunity to participate within a State industrial jurisdiction.

* Therefore the only way in which - 
-Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of a special crisis among woodchip loggers and bushmen in Tasmania in that many loggers with costly trucks and equipment worth from $50,000 to $150,000 have become unemployed because the 3 woodchip companies in Tasmania have had their exports to Japan drastically reduced by the Japanese paper companies?

* Those we call our allies are aware of our **immigration** policy that excludes most of those with coloured skin.

* Recently I wrote to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  to the Minister for Primary Industry and to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  because of his interest in the wine industry and in the fruit industry, pointing out this anomaly.

* I intend to refer the matter of orientation courses, their content and the length of time they should occupy, to the **Immigration** Advisory Council.

* I am referring to the fact that there is too great a lack of coordination at the moment, for instance, in the taking of statistics relating to unemployment, between the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

* -I think that the interjection of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has absolutely nothing to do with this debate.

* say once again, as I have said in previous debates in this House, particularly this year, that we should really be looking at the 2 sets of figures that are available for unemployment, paying much greater attention to the figure from the Bureau of Statistics than we do to the figures from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** which are collected through the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* While I accept the Minister's statement that the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  is much affected by these inquiries I feel also that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  must have a continuing interest because of certain criteria his Department applies for admission.

* Regarding proposed section 158M, it is simply not sufficient for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to say that the Commonwealth Electoral Office is obliged to dispatch ballot papers to all members.

* In past decades of high **immigration** and rapid industrial development, there was a general presumption that all foreign investment should be welcomed.

* The latter suggests that the ethnic element must be a permanent feature of this land and this pre-supposes that **immigration** will be a continuing thing at the levels we have seen previously and that we will have a continuing quantum of new Australians within our community.

* Thus in 1971 a backbencher was able to claim that during his 2 years in Parliament there had been no full scale debate on urban development, pollution, conservation, education, road safety, transport, social services, the rural crisis, tariffs or **immigration**.

* I am not putting that to be vexatious but just to ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for an answer to the question.

* In this regard, apart from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, responsibilities for specific Aboriginal programs are carried by the Departments of Education, Health, Labor and **Immigration** and Services and Property, the Public Service Board and the Australian Council for the Arts, which provide services in consultation with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

* - - 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has received a projected estimate from his Department that the raw actual unemployment figures at the end of December will be in the vicinity of 400 000, that is after making allowance for the influx of 250 000 school leavers into the labour force at about that time.

* Anyone examining this Bill will not be helped very greatly by the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Consequently, another investigation was ordered by the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Senator James  McClelland, in October 1975, and was conducted by  Mr Northrop,  as he then was.

* I refer the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the clarion call he issued yesterday, calling on Australian women to procreate or perish.

* Only last week the Western Australian Clay Brick Manufacturers' Association instructed the Department of **Immigration** to defer the movement of new bricklayer applicants.

* Is the **immigration** policy of the Commonwealth, which continues to place pressures on the States, one of the reasons for the refusal of the States to accept the proposed new agreement?

* I ask the Minister for Urban and Regional Development to take up with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  the fact that some assistance could be given to country towns which do not have sewerage under the regional unemployment grant scheme.

* It was because of this problem that I asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  by way of question the other day for special and particular attention to be given to this problem facing primary producers.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, only represents the Minister in another place who is responsible for the former Department of Urban and Regional Development, a portfolio which once had some muscle in the Cabinet.

* Inflationary pressures, lower birth rates, reduced **immigration**, changing patterns of consumption expenditure as incomes rise and the industrial development of other countries in our region, have all contributed to a major change in outlook for manufacturing industry in Australia.

* In recent years many residents of the municipalities mentioned have had Australian citizenship conferred at non public ceremonies conducted by delegated officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Indeed, the Commonwealth Government is involved because of its responsibilities for **immigration** and entry laws, for Commonwealth benefits that are paid for medical services and for general public health.

* Surely it would not be terribly difficult for the airlines to provide the Taxation Office or the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs with the number of outgoing travellers who qualify to pay the departure tax and to make that payment to the Government.

* Now the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  seeks to weaken the Commission's capacity to protect that public interest.

* I am glad to see that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  along with the Minister for Education, is paying attention to that aspect as well.

* The honourable member for Lalor named the coordinator of the Turkish program, a  Mr Arthur  Inchehara, claimed that he had been an unsuccessful preselection candidate for the New South Wales Liberal Party Senate ticket, and also claimed that he had been appointed by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  because he was politically safe.

* In formulating these texts, the Department of **Immigration** had the advice of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Attorney-General's, Treasury, Labour and National Service, Social Services, Health, Education and Science and Civil Aviation.

* This matter has been dealt with very adequately by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who led the debate for the Government.

* The departments from which the Committee has taken evidence during the year in connection with the Auditor-General's report and Treasurer's Advance include Aboriginal Affairs, Administrative Services, AttorneyGeneral's, Capital Territory, Construction, Defence, Education, Environment, Housing and Community Development, Foreign Affairs, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Industry and Commerce, National Resources, Overseas Trade, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Science and the Treasury.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The only person I know in this House who seems to have any xenophobic tendencies is the honourable member for Mcpherson  (Mr Barnes)  who spoke in that way last night when speaking on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration**.

* I would assess - certainly it is the emphasis given by the Settlement Division of the Department of **Immigration** - that a man ceases to be a migrant when he becomes a citizen of Australia.

* In spite of these provisions, not only the AttorneyGeneral but also the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the former Minister for **Immigration** are falling over each other to secure for this young lady, a Miss Morosi, subsidised government accommodation.

* Does a Liberal-Country Party Government intend to reduce expenditure on the **immigration** program?

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that his Government's spending cutbacks have resulted in the termination of the 12-month course for interpreters and translators at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology?

* Assessment of eligibility under the subsidised health benefits plan and the issue of SHB entitlement certificates are carried out by the Department of Social Security, not the Department of Health, in respect of all these groups with the exception of migrants whose certificates are issued by the Department of **Immigration**.

* The Minister  for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who moved the motion mentioned that it arose out of the recommendation of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation.

* Before moving into the area of my special concern, **immigration** and ethnic affairs, I shall make a number of general remarks about the Budget.

* If I may say so, I then concluded those remarks by saying that as far as I was concerned and this Government was concerned we do not propose to alter the liberalised policy we now have in any basic way because I believe it is working and working well and is far more generous than the **immigration** policies of the other countries in the world which most often tend to criticise our policy.

* In case there is any quibbling on the part of any Government supporters as to the accuracy of what I say about the deficiency of the system of social service benefits in this country I will quote from a report of the Committee on Social Patterns of the **Immigration** Advisory Council entitled 'The Departure of Settlers from Australia'. '

* My role on the trust is one of co-ordination to ensure that the Federal agencies throughout Australia, such as the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, are able to help the trust in the disbursement of funds.

* -My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I want to raise for the attention of the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick),  his representative in this place and, indeed, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  a serious situation which has developed in many schools in my electorate and, I suspect, in many schools in Victoria where there are pupils with ethnic backgrounds.

* Population policy, including **immigration**; natural resource policy, including exports of natural resources; science policy, including research policy; technology policy, including pollution control; educational policy and urban policy will all be influenced by the comprehensive environmental policy.

* It will carry no weight with the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  or at least with the people who elected them on the last occasion but will think better of it on the next, because they know that they have now elected to this Parliament a Government that is concerned only with votes in large cities and is not concerned with the remoter country towns, provincial cities or the people who live in the rural communities - not just the farmers but the totality of people who live outside the great metropolitan areas.

* In 1973 the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  introduced amendments to the Liberal-Country Party Government's Act of November 1972, and if those amendments had been carried by the Senate they would have been both far reaching and expensive and would have added to the pace setter role of the Commonwealth Public Service, which at that time was Government policy.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  told the House this afternoon that the Regional Employment Development scheme has been a significant factor in the Government's stimulation of the economy.

* When the elected Cabinet agrees on those recommendations- it is that elected Ministry which must have the final say- those plans about growth rates must be converted into energy needs, manpower needs, **immigration** needs and education needs in order to make decisions on what should be the key industries, decisions on the protection of full employment in this country and decisions in many other related areas.

* I admire and respect the sincerity of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar)  for his concern on this matter, and that will be discussed at a later time.

* With our **immigration** policy and the growth in the number of young people, the demand for homes will increase.

* Her  particular worry, which I told her I would bring up briefly in Parliament at the first available opportunity, is that she says she wrote to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  in December last and has had a telegram from his secretary to say that the Minister will look into a matter of adoption, but she has not yet had anything else from the Minister.

* It was members of the Country Party and some of our colleagues in the Liberal Party, headed by the honourable mem-., ber for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon),  who secured it, although the first man to rush outside and claim credit for it was the honourable member for Riverina, who is the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* One would almost have thought that the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  on this Bill had not been considered by the Opposition because, ironically enough, the Minister referred to the actions in 1968 of the present Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  as the then Minister for Primary Industry in drawing attention to the amount of money that had been contributed by the taxpayers under the terms of the Government's guarantee for stabilisation purposes in the period up to 1968.

* These include a payment of $2m to the Medical Research Endowment Fund and contributions to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and to the Howard Florey Institute of Experimental Physiology and Medicine, $500,000 each; $ 1.1m for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** for additional staff; $ 1.35m for the Australian Film Corporation; $723,000 for the Interim Committee for the Children's Commission, $650,000 for additional staff for members and senators; $500,000 for grants to eligible organisations under the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act; $537,000 for Expo 75 at Okinawa; $lm subsidies on ship construction and amounts of $6.2m and $5.3m for the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Education Services respectively for additions to staff establishments and other increased costs.

* We recall that, when he was Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Senator James  McClelland, a man who acted realistically and responsibly, predicted that the outcome of Labor's policies would be 400 000 persons unemployed.

* At the moment in Parramatta we have 13 Commonwealth departments in rented space such as the Department of Health, the Australian Electoral Office, the Commonwealth Employment Service, the Bureau of Customs, the Family Court, the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, two Medibank offices, an office of Qantas Airways Ltd, two social security offices, a branch of the Taxation Office with 1,000 people working in rented space and Telecom Australia.

* After a person reads an advertisement, the next step is for him to see the Australian **immigration** officers in the United Kingdom to be counselled, to make specific inquiries and to be given literature^ - for example, a pamphlet on wage rates and employment opportunities, which is amended at least 3 or 4 times a year and contains all the information to which the honourable gentleman alluded and which is available to the potential migrant - before even making a decision to apply to come to the country and before coming into contact with a selection officer and a counselling officer who are there to see that the potential migrant has available to him accurate information about current conditions in Australia.

* I have used the argument elsewhere - I do not know exactly where it was - that you might imagine that you were in the seat adjoining the electorate of Hindmarsh, represented by that gentle, fragrant soul, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* 1 regret that I only walked into the House a few minutes ago and that I have not had the time as I usually do to let the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** know what I was going to say.

* Another area which will be pruned is the Australian Trade Union Training Authority which was set up by the Labor Government under Minister Clyde Cameron when Minister for Labour and **Immigration**.

* I hope that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  will note my remarks and when he replies to the debate on this clause will give a clear statement of the reason for this differential between non-State and State schools.

* The post-war **immigration** program means that the average Australian today has an ethnic origin of groups and nations all over the world and not the predominant British group as he formerly did.

* When the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  brings amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act into this Parliament they deserve better consideration and more sympathetic consideration than the Opposition has been prepared to give them, particularly in light of the experience gained by practitioners and others who particpate in the conciliation and arbitration procedure.

* 3363 which was provided last week the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  said: 
Furthermore, the Department of Foreign Affairs had unfinished business to pursue in the light of a protest note received in about August last year from the Government of Yugoslavia.

* I saw that despite the protests of several preceding Foreign Ministers, and incidentally Ministers for **Immigration**, the then Attorney-General had not accepted their advice or pursued the inquiries which they had raised with him.

* What I have done as Minister for **Immigration** is to authorise the suspension in a number of areas of the easy system of tourist visa issuing which was introduced a few months ago to facilitate the movement of people to Australia with the least possible formality and the least possible amount of bureaucracy.

* I do not think the reputation in this House of the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  is one that could be based on reticence, but where is he today?

* The only degree of sincerity the honourable member for Wannon displayed was in the only real contribution he made to the debate, when he pointed out to the House - I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** - that somebody somewhere made a typographical error.

* If the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has to set up a special office to collect the departure tax quite a considerable amount of the tax collected would be eaten up in overheads.

* Finally, does this announcement reflect the only reply to the statement made by the Minister for **Immigration** that there was to be allocated a sum of $500m available for long term lending at 3 per cent interest?

* So far as I can recall from the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  no examples were given of the need for that discretion to be given to the Registrar.

* I venture to suggest that if the Labor Party had remained in office for another 2 years and had had its full 3-year term of office from May 1974 to May 1977, the words of  Senator James  McClelland, when he was Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, would have been brought to absolute truth.

* Many of those people who voted for Labor in the last elections now realise 4 months later that the situation has grown so bad in Australia that we have had to drastically curtail the **immigration** program started after the Second World War by a previous Labor Government.

* Whilst we spend - and must spend - large sums of money on **immigration** there is an even more urgent need to assist the large family that is already here.

* We have been so concerned that today in Canberra a meeting is being held of the adult migrant education officers of the States and the officers charged with educational  responsibilities in the various State branches of the Department of **Immigration**.

* I am also disturbed by the recent revelation by the Minister for **Immigration** that a sum of $lm has been donated to the Liberal and Country Parties by foreign interests with a view to defeating the popularly elected Government.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has given us the usual hysterical speech.

* I am happy to tell the honourable gentleman that I understand it is the intention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  to make such amendments, which will give further effect to methods of dealing with the social mischief which he described so eloquently in his second reading speech.

* I might say in reply to the honourable gentleman that it is the policy of the Department of **Immigration** in cases involving the introduction of specialist labour for short-term periods to check carefully with my own Department, the Department of Labour and National Service.

* When the present honourable member for Hindmarsh was Minister for Labour and **Immigration** legislation was introduced to facilitate the amalgamation of unions.

* Additionally the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the treaty will provide for the broader co-operation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements in the Protected Zone.

* With **immigration** flowing strongly, there should be a further large addition - more than 3% - to the work-force.

* The sad thing about it is that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  when Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, implied that really most of the losses had occurred during the civil war between the Fretilin and the Democratic Union of Timor.

* Taking into account the way in which the Government adjusts its **immigration** policy, it is not correct that in all cases the arrival of migrants lessens the employment opportunities for Australians who are unemployed.

* Minister for **Immigration**; it is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs because it involves an agreement between Australia and other countries in the region.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Cameron,  today condemned the practice of maritime unions demanding payments to allow the movement of ships around the Australian coast, and then paying the money into union funds rather than to the crew members of the ships involved.

* Why the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  persists in leaving out school leavers from the unemployment statistics, I will never understand.

* It is all very well for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to say: 'Do not worry, we will retrain them.

* There has been less communication and more abuse between this Prime Minister and the trade union movement or the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the trade union movement than I think we have seen in any government in the history of Australia since 1945.

* I have written many letters on this matter to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  pointing out individual schemes within my electorate.

* Honourable members would be well aware of the list of acceptable occupations for the purpose of **immigration**.

* Does the Prime Minister agree with the former Minister for **Immigration**?

* The Australian Labor Party believes in a high standard of living, full employment, an expanding economy and a continuation of the **immigration** programme, lt is the Labor Party's belief also that workers are entitled to good conditions, long service leave, annual holidays and adequate wages.

* I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* To find a situation where this applies one has only to think of my friend the Minister for **Immigration** and honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  and many other people who, in the interests of the nation, have the capacity to take a courageous decision when it should be taken.

* It is ridiculous, almost to the point of suicidal folly, for us to be thinking in terms of **immigration** programs when we are literally paying abortionists to slaughter potential population.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, whom I note is wearing a white buttonhole today.

* Because of the concern about this matter I have set up a task force under  Dr Sidney  Sax which will include representatives from the Tertiary Education Commission, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Department of Education and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* A few weeks ago the shadow Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  and I criticised the long delay in concluding lower air fares arrangements to Greece and Italy.

* I will refer to what was stated by the previous Minister for Labor and **immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he quoted from a Treasury minute in the year 1971-72.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  seems to be becoming sensitive in his second youth.

* I think that we must have a very firm look at our **immigration** policy.

* Will he so inform the Minister for **Immigration** in connection with his refusal to grant a visa to  Mr Gregory?

* 45 of 1972, relating to the Australian Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* Also 1 wish to refer to the remarks of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who talked about jobs for the boys.

* A co-ordinating committee has been established in each State under the Regional Director of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and involving representatives of the voluntary organisations concerned, the Good Neighbour Council and the adult migrant education sections of the State Department of Education.

* I believe it was right for Ken Wriedt to go out and screech his head off on behalf of the cockies; and I had a right to go out and defend organised labour as the then Minister for Labour and **Immigration**.

* 1 ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether it is a fact that he or any other Australian citizen on a visit to countries such as Italy can fly there and back without hindrance from Australian quarantine laws.

* As the honourable gentleman would be aware if he has followed the statements made by the Government, the administration of the **immigration** pro gramme has been remarkably sensitive to the situation of employment in Australia.

* However, if the program is introduced in part without the proposals that are intended to make it a more efficient and a well worth while operation then I think we will be making a big mistake because in the time I have been in this House - and it has only been short - matters relating to the Post Office, in common with social service and **immigration** matters, have been the major matters of complaint that have come to me and that I have had to raise on behalf of my constituents.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and I met the principals of the Australian Capital Territory Medical Association in his office in Canberra when he was Minister for Labor and we offered to go through with them in detail any of their industrial complaints.

* The Minister for Labor arid **Immigration**  (Mr .Clyde Cameron)  said that he would sooner resign than preside over 250,000 persons unemployed.

* The first report from the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council produced evidence which requires a total reappraisal of the plans for the future development of our major cities, of growth centres and of population distribution and redistribution.

* The honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Holding)  will oppose that provision, but I am sure that his colleague, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the former Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, who is so assiduously preparing something here, because of his experience at an earlier time must, without doubt, recognise that there is a very great need for action to be taken.

* Do post offices perform any services tor Commonwealth Government departments in addition to those connected with (a) electrical registration - Department of the Interior, (b) alien registration and application for naturalisation - Department  of  **Immigration** (e) registration for national service - Department of Labour and National Service, (d) War Service Homes loan repayments - Department of Housing, (c) taxation forms, lax stamps and tax books - Department of the Treasury, (f) applications for age, widow and invalid pensions, child endowment, supplementary, assistance, pre-natal allowance and pensioners reduced television and radio licence - Department  of  Social Services and (g) applications for war widows' pensions and war widows' reduced television and radio licence - Repatriation Department.

* There are also men from Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission - everything from the Material Handling Advisory Committee to the Australian **Immigration** Planning Council and the advisory committee to the Atomic Energy Commission.

* It is a good thing that we have an **immigration** programme because the maternity allowance of $30 to $35 has been unchanged since 1943, almost 29 years ago.

* Great credit must be given to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  because he has done so much to bring our labour legislation into line with that which exists in other parts of the world and also in line with the International Labor Organisation Convention.

* I understand from the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that this Bill is expected to provide some $10m in income for the rest of this financial year and some $13m for a full year.

* I am aware of what the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  actually said and my remarks would have correctly represented what he said.

* 1 submit that **immigration** ought to be stopped until unemployment has dropped below the current level.

* Three of them who came back via Mexico finished up in Canada, and the Canadian **Immigration** Department caught up with these people and deported them to the United States of America.

* That is the phrase which the Minister for **Immigration** accused me of leaving out and so engaging in selective quoting.

* I do not know where the idea of a Cities Commission fits in with the Labor Party's idea of reducing the **immigration** intake and its advocacy of a zero population growth, limiting families to 2 children, as has been stated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on various occasions How do we build a country in that way and how will development survive?

* I have listened to the speeches of members from Tasmania and to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and I wonder why they are not supporting this amendment because what it seeks is to take the whole issue out of the region of vague promises and to get it written in black and white.

* Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of the possible closure of Port Augusta as a shipping port as a result of the cessation of the shipment of Tennant Creek copper ore and concentrates through that port?

* The Prime Minister is unable to control the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The Ministers for Education  (Mr Beazley),  Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  were all excluded on this ground, and responsibility was given to the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen).

* As the honourable gentleman said, Ministers for **Immigration** of all political persuasions have adopted that practice in the past.

* I remember so well the honourable member coming to me, when I was Minister for Labour and **Immigration** and in charge of the Regional Employment Development scheme, and asking for support for the restoration of that magnificent old building.

* Of all the projects Labor carried out under the RED scheme- many very fine projects were carried out under that scheme- none was more deserving of support than the restoration of Jondaryan Station 
 I preface a question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** by saying that I have read with interest the proposals that he has persuaded the Government to put to the forthcoming Moore conference on wage fixation.

* The people who live in Hume and in country areas generally want to know what proposals the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** - or his spokesman in the House, the Deputy Prime Minister - have for alleviating non-metropolitan unemployment.

* -I rise in this debate on the estimates of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to refer to the schemes which have been operated by the Department over the past year.

* This must require more capital intensive industries in the future, and the only prospect of changing the trend would appear to be the reintroduction of a much more positive **immigration** policy combined with family development policies to encourage more, young people to have larger families.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, in his role as the honourable member for Barker, brought a delegation to see me about a fortnight ago.

* Is it a fact that this Committee discussed such matters as trade with the People's Republic of China, **immigration** and selected treaty matters?

* The bells already have tolled for 2 former Treasurers, and others including the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Those were the words of the then Minister for **Immigration** when he introduced a Bill which was aimed at pocketing for the use of the Commonwealth Government funds which rightly belonged to the Australian producers.

* The motion is deliberately limited to matters of Commonwealth responsibility, in that this Parliament has the constitutional power to make laws with respect to external affairs, emigration and **immigration**, and trade and commerce with other countries, for instance, civil aviation.

* The difference between my Government and its predecessors is that we are trying to solve the matter and at last we have a Minister for **Immigration**, an Attorney-General and a Foreign Minister who are co-operating to that end.

* Migrants have been asked to study these booklets and to bring them to Australia, where copies are also available at offices of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** for further reference.

* The publications distributed to prospective migrants are: 'Australia' 'Assisted Passages to Australia ' 'Your Journey to Australia ' 'Customs and Quarantine in Australia' ' Migrant Accommodation in Australia ' 'Employment in Australia' ' Housing in Australia ' ' Education in Australia ' 'Health and Social Security in Australia' ' Wages, Prices and Taxes in Australia ' ' Health Insurance in Australia ' 
Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware that during 1974 the unemployment rate in Australia moved from approximately 1.2 per cent of the work force to approximately 4.5 per cent?

* I join in this debate to support the arguments of the honourable members for Corangamite  (Mr Street)  and Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  and to ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to give very serious consideration, as I know he will, to accepting the amendments moved by the honourable member for Corangamite.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security should draw up a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek Welfare Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Society for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.

* I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for **immigration**, Australian families, the numbers of children born in Australia and the rights of Australian children, old, young and even unborn.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question which arises from his visit yesterday to an inner suburban school in Melbourne.

* They were: The Department of Foreign Affairs, the AttorneyGeneral's Department, the Department of **Immigration**, the Commonwealth Police and ASIO.

* I do not wish to delay the Committee at any length on this occasion because I know that the Minister for **Immigration** wants to get on with the Bill and with other business.

* One person changed his name to White Australia and another changed his name to Stop Asian **Immigration** Now.

* We recognise that there are many people in this country who come from other lands, but surely the spirit of **immigration** is that if a person adopts Australia as his homeland it is his bounden duty to act in the best interests of Australia and Australians.

* It has long been a general rule in **immigration** cases that the specific reasons for the refusal to grant a visa should not be disclosed.

* The Commonwealth is responsible for the important functions of defence and **immigration**.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question.

* They include economic growth, population growth including **immigration**, defence, development of industry, Aboriginal advancement, development of education, improvement of health facilities and equity in the tax system including estate duty and personal income tax.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Is it a fact that over the last eight weeks only one white person, and about 100 non-white persons, have been detained at the Villawood Detention Centre?

* Since the corresponding occasion  3  years ago there have been  2  changes in the positions of Treasurer, Attorney-General and Ministers of Health, Labour and National Service, **Immigration**, Navy and Army and  3  changes in the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Education and Science.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** the following question: In view of the fact that many thousands of nonEnglish speaking migrants make up a significant part of the Australian work force, will the Minister take steps to make available appropriate explanatory material in the relevant languages showing the rights as well as the obligations of employees?

* If the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is at the moment handling the Bill in this House looks through the departmental files he will find representations from me in respect to those products.

* I have added in representations of my own that we urgently require a Department of **Immigration** representative in this electorate.

* I am a member of the Government parties' **immigration** and ethnic affairs committee and I know that we have a serious problem with our population growth.

* While 1 concede that all members on the other side do not sympathise with the attitude of this particular group - and I commend the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  for his question to the Prime Minister on Tuesday - it seems to me that there is an attitude of racial superiority prevalent amongst some honourable members on the other side that is demonstrated in the Government policies toward South East Asia - in particular Vietnam - towards New Guinea with its paternalistic colonialism, its **immigration** policy and its inability to carry out a concerted attack on the question of Aboriginal advancement.

* lt has been answered almost invariably by a kind of pop politics from the other side, as in the disappointing speech made this afternoon by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  and the equally disappointing one from the honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley),  who 1 do not think even knew we were discussing the Budget.

* The present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, when his Party was in Opposition made great play about what the Labor Party would do as far as primary industries were concerned if it were in government.

* Thank heavens the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has adopted a more responsible and humane position.

* This is indicated by the fact that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr MacKellar),  when introducing it, spoke for only three minutes.

* From these figures tables are produced which project the labour force under various assumptions, including constant participation rates as of August 1978 and projected participation rates from long term trends and **immigration** assumptions.

* What has not been told to this House by the Treasurer or by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  who is Minister assisting the Treasurer is, which are the sorts of companies that are likely to be advantaged by this new device or by the opening of the gate to the convertible note once more.

* I express my complete support for a proposition stated by the then Minister for **Immigration**,  Sir Hubert  Opperman, on 23rd September 1965, who, when refusing visas to the East German pentathlon team said: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has asked the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  to move this amendment because the Minister knows full well that his second reading speech was not in conformity with the Bill.

* My colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has made a similar statement.

* It may well be, as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said in this House, that this will reduce inter-union disputes and legal difficulties.

* These include the Parliament, Aboriginal Affairs, Agriculture, AttorneyGeneral, Foreign Affairs, Health, Labor and **Immigration**, Manufacturing Industry and the Media.

* I believe that it did not do the Leader of the Opposition any credit to use the descriptions that he did in regard to the policies pursued by this Government or to the way in which I, as the Minister, have administered the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* -I refer the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to an explanation he gave on 30 August this year in which he said that migrants coming to Australia fell into four categories- family reunion, refugees, those entering by virtue of the Tasman agreement and persons who were selected because of their occupational skills.

* 1 know that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in his second reading speech touched on the allocations for the first 6 months of 1976-77, but the situation will be quite critical in Queensland after 1 July because of the situation I have outlined.

* We are confronted with these problems in Australia - particularly, of course in Sydney and Melbourne - and they are rapidly being compounded as more and more people, whether from natural increase, **immigration** or drift from the country areas, come to where job opportunities exist.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** been drawn to the action of leading Australian retailers in immediately increasing their profit margins on goods already held in stock and paid for when shop assistants were granted a long overdue increase bringing a senior's wage to a modest $102 a week?

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**: Did the Australian Labor Party promise prior to its assumption of office on 2 December 1972 that there would be better industrial relations if it were to assume office?

* We have the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  that former battler against the evil, sinister world of big business, now self-righteously shouting to the world the virtue- the absolute necessity- for business and industry to make profits.

* He cannot even run his Ministersthe Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  who do what they like and have his full blessing.

* But the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKeller)  was also in the chamber.

* That responsibility rests with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  whether this is the case.

* They may go to the Commonwealth Departments of Social Security, Labour, Repatriation and in some areas Aboriginal Affairs and **Immigration**.

* I appreciate the presence in the House of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  representing the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson)  to whom I indicated that I would be talking on this topic.

* Regular studies are carried out on the returnee rale by the **Immigration** Advisory Council.

* The Treasurer, as a former Minister for **Immigration**, would know the number of people who do not represent natural increase in our population but who are adding to the population in the States.

* He will know and the House will know that the survey of child migrant education was initiated by the previous Minister for **Immigration** and myself because we were concerned about many of the problems that had been revealed in the report.

* It was interesting to note that the Migrant Task Force for Victoria, established by the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  gave emphasis in its report to the fact that no more than 20 per cent of nonEnglish speaking migrant children in Melbourne were receiving the special sort of language assistance that they needed if they were to take proper advantage of the educational opportunities available to them or, failing taking proper advantage of those opportunities, merely functioned on an even level with the children around them who had no language disability.

* In addition there is the regional employment development scheme- RED- which is administered by my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and which is also designed to fund moneys to towns like Launceston in Tasmania so that they can better improve facilities in those towns-the infrastructure, the building of recreational community halls and houses and that sort of thing- so that the people in them have a better standard of life.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs a question.

* He has held the office of Attorney-General, Minister for **Immigration**, Minister for Labour and National Service, Treasurer and Leader of the Opposition.

* I know that discussions have taken place between my Department and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I have not shown these figures to the Minister for **Immigration**, who is at the table, but I have shown them to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  who has approved of their incorporation.

* I am quite prepared to hear and debate a statement on **immigration** but I am not having it tied up with the question of me answering a charge that has been made against me in this Parliament this morning.

* As my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, pointed out the other day, the Opposition has been refusing Ministers leave to make statements on similar important matters.

* There has developed a tendency to obtain a labour force either from inexperienced peasants imported under the Commonwealth **immigration** scheme - Professor Dunphy quoted an employer as saying to him: 'If new Australians cease to come in, where will we get our labour for these sorts of industries?'

* MIGRANT EDUCATION  Mr BIRRELL-  Can the Minister for **Immigration** confirm that the Melbourne education task force has advised him that only 20 per cent of Melbourne's non-English speaking migrant children are receiving adequate educational opportunities?

* We are told by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who is at the table at the moment, that the statistics show that 130,000 people are unemployed, but his confrere in Queensland,  Mr Jack  Egerton, the Queensland  President  of the Trades and Labour Council, estimates the true figure to be 200,000.

* I give an important example: The Government's national employment and training scheme does require the recruitment of a relatively small number of officers to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to help implement the scheme.

* Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware that there is a great deal of criticism in Victoria against his Government's Regional Employment Development Scheme as well as substantial delay in payments of unemployment relief, particularly to those who are classified as being retrenched because of Government decisions?

* **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  under his Regional Employment Development scheme, gives people work as census collectors.

* After the honourable member put his case- I thought he did so quite properly, quite fairly and quite well- I was then pleased to hear the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  say that he welcomed the discussion because it was non-partisan and it was an endeavour to get to the root of the problem that besets these people in our community.

* -I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* We were informed of serious delays caused by the need to refer minor matters to numerous coordinating bodies in Canberra, including the Public Service Board, the Department of Finance, the Department of Administrative Services and on occasions various interdepartmental committees, as well as major parent departments such as Foreign Affairs, Trade and Resources and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Earlier this year I came back to this country and the only person picked out of the airplane load of people to be examined thoroughly by officers of the Department of Customs and Excise and **Immigration** in Brisbane was a little girl from Papua.

* I know that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  who usually represents in this chamber the Minister for Health  (Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson),  is away at the present time.

* Last year the League of Rights played on dormant racist feelings in the community by its overt support of the South African sporting teams and it attempted to gain some political mileage over minor changes in the Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* In view of the cutbacks in the level of **immigration**, what action is his Government taking to overcome these shortages, apart from the proposals in relation to industrial training initiated by the former Government and which are necessarily not short term in their impact?

* For the respective periods of these absences, the following arrangements will apply: The Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren,  is Acting Minister for Services and Property; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart,  is Acting Special Minister of State; the Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Grassby,  is representing the Minister for Primary Industry; the Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister for the Northern Territory,  Mr Enderby,  is Acting Minister for Northern Development; the PostmasterGeneral,  Mr Lionel  Bowen, is Acting Leader of the House.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, himself a former Minister for **Immigration**, was party to the continuing negotiations.

* I have had word from the Director of ICEM in which he says: 
My question, which is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, refers to the income maintenance scheme through which employees retrenched through the policies and actions of the Government have received the average weekly wage for a period of 6 months.

* I will be interested if the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** can answer this part of the question: Why is a private soldier in the Citizen Military Forces while attending a 2-week compulsory camp and working considerably in excess of 8 hours a day entitled to receive only $8 a day for that service?

* But allied with this I must speak, with regard to my own electorate, about the amount that is appropriated to assist starling in those organisations or in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** which have so much responsibility in these matters.

* Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of the recent dispute involving the sacking of 17 women at Dreffin Everhot Ltd, a manufacturing company in Bayswater, Victoria, in respect of which charges have been made by the sacked women that they have been sexually discriminated against?

* My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that many Lebanese refugees who have had their visas approved in Australia have been stranded for months in conditions of extreme economic and emotional hardship in cities all over the world and are unable to have their papers processed by our overseas officials?

* We see, from page 16 of the Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** policies and population tabled last Thursday, that the annual increase in the labour force for 1976 was somewhere between 100 000 and 115 000 people.

* Is it a fact that Australia 's reliance upon **immigration** as a source of skilled tradesmen denies training opportunities to thousands of unemployed young people, causing unnecessarily high levels of" youth unemployment?

* However, the Department of Labor and **Immigration** provides some relevant information in the form of statistics on unfilled vacancies collected by the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* I think I should add that I have taken the opportunity of contacting the Perth migrant task force recently set up by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  so that this matter can be listed for their consideration and for their assistance in due course in bringing appropriate warnings to the attention of migrant groups in my State.

* This will barely offset the rises in costs due to inflation and will not take into account the increase in the population of children in schools, an increase due to **immigration**, our own birth rate and also the longer time children are now expected to stay at school.

* I was reinforced in this view recently when I noted that those States made a statement upon **immigration** which has long been accepted as a Commonwealth function.

* What is it that is wrong with a secret ballot by postal votes that causes the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to delete those words from the Bill and use the word 'ballot'.

* by leave- In general, I do not think that we have very much to criticise in a large part of the substance of the statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* We have heard the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  say that commissioners will be appointed for fixed terms, taking away the independence that they ought to have, the independence that has traditionally been part of this kind of operation so that governments could not lean on individuals.

* But to answer specifically the honourable member's question, I do not think the organisation could be properly described as having the support of the Opposition, because my information is that in 1952 this gentleman was railing at the then administration and the Department of **Immigration** for having the temerity to permit into Australia Catholics and Italians.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  in answer to a question today put forward a similar proposition in respect of visas for visitors.

* As the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out in the second reading debate, the clause suggested in this Bill goes beyond what was seemingly intended by the Government and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in his second reading speech.

* As a consequence the National Health Bill which the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  introduced into this House on 16th September will need to be withdrawn and redrafted.

* We all know what happened to him when he supported Australia's **immigration** policy Kapow!

* In addition there will have to be an added impetus in respect of selected **immigration** to build up our building force.

* Is he aware of the figures of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** which show the following percentage change in each quarter from January 1973 to December 1973: March 1973 quarter 2.2 per cent, June 1973 quarter 0.6 per cent, September 1973 quarter 1.5 per cent and the December 1973 quarter minus 0.7 per cent?

* It is necessary to understand the background of what might appear to be a simple, technical measure if one read carefully the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* In fact, this has occurred despite the fact that Australia has embraced a stagnant or very slowly growing work force and **immigration** rates have been altered to bring down the unemployment rates.

* I turn now to the question of **immigration**.

* This Government through a number of schemes, not the least of which was the Australian Assistance Plan which has now been challenged by Liberal State governments - 
I raise as only one example the decisions that are made by the Department of **Immigration** to indicate how this gells or does not co-ordinate with the decisions that are made in Treasury from time to time about the rate of growth of the economy.

* Often, the increase in popolation is the direct result of Commonwealth policies, particularly with regard to **immigration**.

* My question, which I address to the Prime Minister, follows on 2 questions asked by my Leader of the Treasurer and the Minister for **Immigration**, both of whom read in this morning's Press statements on policy affecting their own portfolios by 2 other Ministers.

* First I want to say to the honourable member and the House that the parents have been in touch with the Department of **Immigration** and have received a reply from the Department.

* My question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** refers to the Darwin dump barge dispute which for months has been steadily strangling a dozen or more towns and settlements along the 800-mile Northern Territory coast.

* For years I sat on the other side of the chamber and listened to blasts from the present Minister for Transport and the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  telling us why we would never get industrial peace while there are sanctions and the force of arbitration in industrial law.

* I place on record my appreciation of the wonderful work done by the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in introducing the RED scheme and for taking such a wonderful, personal interest as he did in following the progress of the various schemes in the country districts especially.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table to make a full inquiry into this matter.

* In particular the Commissioner mentioned the agencies of bankruptcy, **immigration** and foreign exchange.

* My colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  is responsible for administering the legislation covering the departure tax and he will be reviewing the operation of that legislation.

* Even Commonwealth departments like the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of **Immigration**, the Office of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Social Services have but a nominal skeleton staff of trained social workers.

* This inquiry was ordered by the Minister's predecessor, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  after considerable controversy in the Press and iti this Parliament over the treatment of junior cadets at the Royal Military College.

* Will the Prime Minister answer this parochial question from an undistinguished back bencher with 50 years honorary service in the Australian Labor Party: Is it the intention of the Government to relax the **immigration** laws of this country to allow Japanese workers to be employed in the motor car industry in Australia?

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** who represents the Minister for Health in this chamber.

* The main engines of urban growth in Australia in the last 20 years have been the Federal Government's twin projects of rapid industrialisation and large scale **immigration**.

* If it had been, an unfortunate person named  Mr Salemi  would have been able to appeal against the decision of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* For example, I could have said today or at any time that I heard the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  say that he would import one million Japanese to work in the Riverina district picking f r ait.

* I am sure the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is just as well aware as I am that it threw union organisations into serious turmoil.

* The first committee consisted of representatives from the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Attorney-General's, Customs and Excise, Defence, Foreign Affairs, Health, Labor and **Immigration**, Northern Territory, Agriculture, Special Minister of State, Transport and Treasury and the Public Service Board.

* It deals with the alleged failure of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to uphold the 30-year agreement by Australian governments to maintain full employment.

* The delays are due to the fact that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** is determined that it will see that there is no slipshod manner of handling both of these matters.

* On arrival the Primary Officer, Customs, consulted with the Senior **Immigration** Officer on duty who gave approval for temporary entry to Australia on the basis that the people concerned were diplomatic or official personnel being formally met by an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* The Prime Minister will have seen statements made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** following, and presumably based on, the Government's Budget to the effect that unemployment will reach 400 000 and that inflation could reach 35 per cent next year.

* But I point out to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is sitting at the table- I understand that he is in the inner Cabinet- that if ever there were an institution in Australia today to which honourable members opposite owe a debt of gratitude, it is the insurance industry.

* I congratulate the present Government on having divided the administration within the Public Service of the former Department of Labor and **Immigration**, ending an amalgamation instituted by the Labor Government.

* That is one of the underlying themes, indeed the main underlying theme, in this statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs does not see itself as a provider of cash relief and does not intend to take up such a role.

* Again, the events associated with the replacement of  Mr Cope  as  Speaker  revolved around the proposition that the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  had been offered information by an officer on the staff of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Government hopes to be able to offset the present population situation by **immigration**.

* I ask either the Minister for **Immigration** or the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Is it a fact that a man described as a businessman well known in Croatian circles in Melbourne was in Canada recently when his Australian passport was seized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and he was issued with a document which allowed him only to return to Australia?

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question.

* I listened to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in reply to a telegram from me said: 
There is provision in these Bills for money for the Regional Employment Development scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme- which is not all that neat- and structural assistance.

* We will support these appropriations because if we did not we would be committing the same act of blatant betrayal and callous unconcern towards the hundreds of thousands of unemployed Australians whom this Prime Minister and his ally, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  have thrown on to the dole lines after promising so vehemently that it would not happen.

* -Does the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** intend to intervene in the hearing of the metal trades claims now formally notified to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on which  Mr Justice  Moore has announced he will arbitrate?

* -I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I noticed that in this House the other day the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  referred to the difficulties of adoptions arranged overseas and the need to have those adoptions recognised.

* We know what has happened over the last year through inflation, through rising taxation, through the wage policies of the Government, through the pace-setting principles of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The Government goes all out to people the cities, with its **immigration** programme, but then washes its hands of what is to become of the people.

* I have availed myself of the opportunities I have had since 1956 of trying also to strengthen greatly the fabric of Australian manufacturing industry because here is a tremendous base of our strength - the base in which most employment is to be found and therefore the base upon which our **immigration** policy depends.

* The information about prices for blocks of home building land in the latest edition of the booklet 'Housing in Australia' produced by the Department of **Immigration** - (British edition published in May 1972, No.

* The prices given are as follows: 
Why was the Royal Commission not told to investigate the prima facie fact that on 26 July, for example, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  knew that money was being extorted by threat, and knew that the threats were a criminal act, yet they did not refer this matter to the Royal Commission.

* -By way of preface to my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs I refer to his decision to allow Australian residents who leave Australia on foreign passports to re-enter Australia without re-entry permits after absences of up to 3 years.

* Under Section 6 of the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children) Act, the Minister for Social Security is the legal guardian in Australia of children who come within the provisions of the Act.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The letter 'Z' is used for statistical purposes only and denotes a person granted a visa for entry to Australia as a migrant under policy relating to non-European **immigration** adopted by the Government in March 1966.

* I address my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* In relation to the Yugoslavs, one person ordinarily resident in Western Australia was deported from New South Wales and incorrectly counted twice being included in the statistics of each of the two Branch offices of the Department of **Immigration**.

* For example the Departments of **Immigration**, Repatriation and Social Security each give assistance in restricted, or largely restricted ways, which deprive the great bulk of the community from the benefit of such services.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** fulfilled his undertaking given to the Parliament on 4 April formallyto ask the Prime Minister to raise with the Premier of Queensland the 7 specific complaints which were made against Queensland police and gaol service personnel by some of the 14 Fijians recently deported from Brisbane?

* While the provision of grants for training within industry, which is the province of my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  was excluded from the Kangan Committee's terms of reference, it will be recognised that the program we are putting forward will be of some consequence in providing the buildings, the equipment and the trained staff to cater for those people who undertake courses of training or re-training at technical colleges under the national employment and training scheme.

* They should apply for assistance to the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister.for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has often claimed the support of all members of Parliament for the RED scheme because all members have supported individual projects.

* Just as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has presided over the greatest unemployment in history and just as the Federal Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  has presided over the greatest inflation rate in the history of this nation, so the Minister for Transport has presided over the greatest destruction ever of the shipbuilding industry in this nation.

* -As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said, most of the amendments are consequential on those which the Opposition moved in the House of Representatives and which were accepted by the Government and the Senate.

* The Government has cut down on **immigration** so as not to add to the level of the unemployed, and for doing that we are criticised.

* They must be able to take decisions without reference to higher authority and must scrupulously observe all **immigration**, customs and financial regulations.

* -I want to analyse 2 aspects with which the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  dealt.

* If the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  responds to the gentle stimulus which we have provided by earlier amendments and by this amendment and brings in legislation of a permanent nature before 1 July 1976 then of course this legislation would cease to have effect as from that date.

* Of course throughout the 1930s the **immigration** to Palestine was greatly increased through the Nazi terrorism.

* Of the $45.4m now sought for capital works and services, the major requirements are $2m for emergency classroom accommodation for the Department of **Immigration**; $l.lm for the purchase of residential properties at overseas posts; $33m for the Postmaster-General's Department to meet the cost of new wage rates and improved conditions of service together with' increases in the prices of materials; $7.2m for the Department of Services and Property, of which $1.7m is for acquisitions of freehold properties in the Australian Capital Territory and $4.1m for acquisition of properties for overseas posts.

* Indeed, recent statements by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  would rather support that view.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** whether entry visas have been granted during the period since the Labor Party came to power to representatives of the PRG and African liberation movements.

* That is the very reason that I went to see the work of the Minister for **Immigration** in the offices of the High Commission in Nicosia.

* I ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs concerning the arrival and entry of an American gangster under a name different from that under which he was convicted.

* With respect to the total **immigration** intake, as I have said before in this House, I am not at liberty at this stage to say what the Government's deliberations will be, but I shall keep the honourable member's comments in mind.

* We wanted to work towards an objective of l.l per cent increase or thereabouts from natural growth of population and **immigration** intake.

* **Immigration** as an expression of territorial insecurity has now outlived the circumstances which inspired it.

* The interrelation of population distribution in toto - the whole population distribution of any political area - and of urbanisation - the process by which towns grow and by which, in recent history, an increasing proportion of the total population finds itself in those towns as distinct from the countryside and which in turn affects the issues of **immigration**, decentralisation and quality of life - must be recognised and given practical attention.

* We still have a continuing **immigration** programme.

* I should like to ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  whether he could let the House know when legislation flowing from the report of  Mr Justice  Sweeney might be before the House because, as we heard earlier this morning, it is an important matter and one that has gone forward for a long while.

* The establishment by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** of offices on the eastern shore of the Derwent have assisted thousands of people.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has stated several times in this House that my electorate has one of the highest job vacancy ratios.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question.

* Perhaps the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  who comes from somewhere in the Melbourne area, might even spend his weekends by the side of a swimming pool.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Committee also recommends detailed examinations to determine, firstly, whether Australiabased staff at 8 **Immigration** posts should be withdrawn and the posts covered by a system of regional representation and, secondly, whether 25 positions at Trade Commissioner posts are justified by the essential workload at the posts.

* This paper attempts to analyse the contribution of **immigration**, internal migration and natural increase of the growth of the 10 urban centres of more than 100,000 people for the period 1966- 1971.

* The present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  at one stage produced an entirely new Bill.

* The availability of tradesmen under the **immigration** program is a diminishing factor.

* It has blocked our policies on housing, **immigration** and many other subjects.

* The pulldevilpullbaker attitude of the various cliques and personalities - the Prime Minister, the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the Treasurer, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Labor Caucus - have ensured that sound economic and financial policies by the Labor Government are impossible.

* To put it in Rolf Boldrewood's language in 'Robbery Under Arms': 
I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** a question.

* My question which is addressed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** refers to the reported continuing increase in housing costs.

* Yes, it is true that I arranged for copies of the Platform to be sent to senior officers in the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* Yet trends in unemployment- confirmed by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)-  indicate that average unemployment will be around 40 per cent higher this year than during 1974-75.

* -I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs a question.

* -Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs been drawn to a report that a number of Iraqi representatives are about to visit Australia for a breakfast?

* This 80 per cent will not include usage in collecting refugees, as announced by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  this week; nor will it include usage for overseas personalities such as British royalty, heads of state from friendly countries and other official guests who come to this country.

* The honourable gentleman questions the role of the Department of **Immigration** and my own Ministry in relation to the provision of permanent housing in the community is not a matter which falls within my responsibility or indeed the responsibility of the Commonwealth.

* The lower birth rates, the reduced **immigration**, the changing patterns of consumption expenditure as incomes rise, and the industrial development of other countries in our region have all contributed to a major change in outlook for manufacturing industry in Australia.

* -My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and is supplementary to the question asked of him by the honourable member for Melbourne.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Given that **immigration** is presently contributing some 20 per cent of tradesmen entering the Australian workforce and given the known willingness and suitability of thousands of young Australians to undertake trade training, one would imagine that any rational and sane government would be committing itself to a major reorganisation of trade training and financial support.

* I would like the Minister for **Immigration** who is also the Minister assisting the Treasurer to say whether this Bill is the first step in the opening of the flood gates.

* The numbers of single persons and of family groups of particular sizes are available for assisted migrants but in the case of unassisted migrants the figures used in this answer represent an estimate recently made by the Department of **Immigration**.

* I  address my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether he has had any discussions with the Minister for Urban and Regional Development about the shortages of building tradesmen such as painters, carpenters, tilers, builders labourers and planners.

* I suppose that it is almost, but not quite, in the nature of a mortal blow to the honour.ab'e member for Riverina, the Minister for **Immigration**, to find that I am losing the fatherly advice of the 'modest member'.

* The Department of **Immigration** will help them with the teachers and with the material, but at least the time should be made available in the workshops.

* The question of restricting other than through a Court order under the Family Law Act the right of persons to depart from Australia is the concern of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, as well as the Attorney-General.

* Consular, commercial and **immigration** activities from the areas formerly handled by the post in Bombay, have all increased since its closure in 1976.

* My Department, and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, attempt to make dual nationals aware of the problems they might encounter on return to their country of birth.

* It also provides thoughtful, informed and some very trenchant views on the policy options available to Australia on crucial matters: How we should adjust to the rapid economic growth now taking place to our north; how we should conduct our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations; how far our interests coincide with general Western interests in relation to the Third World; what our posture should be in the United Nations and other international forums; what principles should inform our policies on such matters as aid, human rights, **immigration** and refugees.

* The growth in domestic demand and employment has been strong, stable and sustained, and it has been due essentially to the Government's unwavering commitment to full employment, its pursuit of wide-ranging manpower policies, including **immigration**, and an effective national employment service.

* The report of the Commissioner for Community Relations has been in the hands of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for at least 3 weeks.

* The questions that we have raised concerning the matter of interest cannot be discarded in the way in which the honourable member for Maltee, the  Deputy  Whip of the Liberal Party, the honourable member lor Angas and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  have attempted to do.

* After ali, it has long been the policy of this Government that the **immigration** requirements of any country are matters solely for the judgment of the country concerned.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Opposition believes that this is the only way in which we can register with the Prime Minister, the Minister for **Immigration** and the Treasurer, our concern that the place in which policy statements should be made is the Parliament.

* At the meeting of **Immigration** Ministers in Adelaide just recently, it was unanimously accepted that a new thrust and a new effort would have to be made to correct some of the serious deficiencies in migrant education.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* First, there is the question that might be summarised as **immigration**.

* -I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and refer to the problem of illegal entry into Australia by persons who have not obtained proper entry visas.

* That was the Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Al  Grassby.

* Yesterday, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stated that most people did not appreciate how population growth has slowed down in Australia.

* It merely declares the position of the woman and her relationship with the Department of **Immigration**.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said in this House on thousands of occasions, when governments learn to keep their noses out of industrial relations perhaps the unions and the employers will solve the problems.

* Subsequently- in October 1975- the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration** requested the  Chairman  of the Stevedoring Industry Council,  Mr R.  Northrop, Q.C., as he was then, to review the attitudes of groups having an interest in the industry.

* His post-war achievement was marked by the commencement of an **immigration** scheme which I believe will immortalise him.

* He said: 
-I direct a question to the Acting Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The amount will be determined in consultation amongst the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, myself and the Treasurer, before going to Cabinet.

* It is not possible to provide an accurate assessment of total administration costs for collecting the tax in 1978-79 pending finalisation of a staff review by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Public Service Board.

* In relation to the first part of the honourable gentleman's question, at the time of the debate on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** last year 1 circulated to honourable members the complete details, if not for the last 3 years then certainly for the previous 12 months, of the number of deportations and the countries from which deportees came.

* A. J. Forbes, M.C., M.P., Minister for **Immigration** on Sunday, 21 May 1972.

* The total expenditure on publicity and information services incurred by the Department of **Immigration** (under Division 330/2.06) in 1969-70 was approximately $2,565,000.

* Were the questions raised in the letter still unanswered when the Minister for **Immigration** replied to my similar question without notice on 7th September, 1971 (Hansard, page 808).

* The Committee, under the chairmanship of  Dr Sidney  Sax,  Chairman  of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, included representatives from my Department and from the departments of Education, Employment and Youth Affairs, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and from the Tertiary Education Commission.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Scheme was approved by the then Minister for **Immigration**, the Right Hon.

* (a)  Mr Grassby  ceased to be Minister for **Immigration** on 12 June 1974.

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971-1973 I present the annual report on migrant education for the year ended 30 June 1975.

* No records are kept by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs which would enable it to determine the numbers of persons granted citizenship in each of the ethnic groups who are enrolled in the various electoral divisions.

* A total of $169,200 has been allocated for **immigration** information activities in the United Kingdom in 1 976-77.

* **Immigration**, Works and Civil Aviation.

* -There is one thing about the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Other Labor Party members are not even here to defend the Government because they are so ashamed of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who has sat over the greatest unemployment in this nation's history.

* If you want one opinion about the state of the work force and the unemployment level ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* This Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is, like his Prime Minister, always blaming somebody else and does not take any blame himself.

* Unlike the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the Treasurer is prepared to admit where he is wrong.

* I have had to rise to my feet on at least two or three occasions to draw to the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** by means of motions similar to the one we are debating today the stupidity of his and the Government's policies.

* Let me repeat those words so that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** might at least understand them.

* He is such a failure that the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party said: 'Please do not send the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to Queensland to campaign for the Queensland election.

* Let us have no more humbug from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is one of the architects of these destructive policies.

* I believe that when the Prime Minister reshuffles his Cabinet- it is a pity that he cannot shuffle some of his Ministers out of the Ministry, but he has not the power to do it- he should make the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** Minister for Public Works or give him some portfolio right out of the public arena.

* In it  Mr Kelly  states that I resigned as Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 20 November 1979: 
I believe that there is general agreement that Australia must continue to build up its population which is now approximately  I2i  million.

* Equally clearly, this is not sufficient and Australia must proceed with our controlled **immigration** programme and bring into Australia the most suitable people available, having regard to the economic circumstances from time to time.

* I believe that it is a matter of great regret that the long standing bipartisan policy on **immigration** was abandoned by the Australian Labor Party at its Launceston Conference this year.

* The controlled **immigration** policy instituted many years ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and supported until recently by the great majority of the people on the other side of the chamber appears to have been discarded.

* It has been a vital part of the success of our **immigration** programme that migrants be regarded and treated in all respects as human beings, not merely as statistics in terms of population growth or increased work force.

* I pay a very sincere tribute to the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and to  Sir Tasman  Heyes for the magnificent work they did in the early post-war years in launching what has been the largest and most successful **immigration** programme of any country.

* During the years I served as  Chairman  of the Commonwealth **Immigration** Planning Council I was very closely associated with both the Minister and departmental officers in Australia and overseas, and I have first hand knowledge of their dedication and efficiency.

* The major proposed increases of expenditure on **immigration** in this Bill relate to migrant education services.

* That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Grayndler making a statement on the **immigration** policy of the Australian Labour  Party as  I know  it  and interpret  it.

* The only **immigration** requirement in such circumstances is sound health.

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971 I present the annual report on migrant education for the year ended 30 June 1976.

* If so, did he receive it from his predecessor, the present Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs who acted as Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development for several months, or did he receive it from the Corporation.

* The Departments of Foreign Affairs, Health, Education, Aboriginal Affairs, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Home Affairs and Finance are currently represented on the interdepartmental committee.

* A total of 794 persons who had entered the country legally and who have since contravened the Commonwealth's **immigration** laws were deported in the period 1 January1978 to 20 March1979.

* 1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for **Immigration** whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly migrants who found that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: 
My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Hashis attention been- drawn to an incident in December 1971 at the **immigration** barrier at Heathrow Airport in London involving  Sir John  Pagan, New South Wales Agent-General in London.

* The Minister who ultimately generates the demand for housing and who maintains the long term underlying demand is the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* He is cutting away the **immigration** program.

* 1 suggest to the Minister for Housing that he should be in very close consultation with the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I know that the Minister for **Immigration** is highly preoccupied with hi.-' thought that fine feathers make fine birds, but he should endeavour to work in very closely with housing operations over the whole continent and see that he does co-operate and bring bis programs carefully in line with future housing programs.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** studied reports that foreign terrorists are infiltrating Australia to interfere with the Opera House opening?

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said, this is a machinery matter.

* What steps has he taken since 2 December 1972 to give effect to the promise of the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** referred to in Question No.

* -Just very briefly, on behalf of the Opposition I should like to thank the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for his cooperation in making this a better Bill.

* Women should stay at home and have children instead of going out to work, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Michael  MacKellar, said yesterday.

* The  Chairman  of the Committee sought consideration by the Attorney-General, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the recommendations made in the report 
Was the statement he is reported to have made based on advice provided to him by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs; if so, when and by what means did he receive the advice and what was the precise content of the advice.

* Since then regional Committees (comprising the Public Service Board, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs) have been established in each State and Territory to interview all Council staff and assist in finding alternative employment.

* In addition, Council staff are being referred for consideration for any positions for which they have relevant qualifications and experience that arc advertised as open to persons who are not officers of the Service, such as the recently advertised positions in the post arrival areas of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* With the passing of this legislation, this will be necessary not only to protect our fishing resources but also to control illegal **immigration** and smuggling.

* If so, has the Minister allocated an increase in any funds under his control to combat the reported activities of racist groups (such as the **Immigration** Control Association) in schools; if not, will the Minister do so.

* High **immigration** was particularly destructive of social well-being in times of high unemployment in Australia.

* Of the Australian Conservation Foundationwelcomed  the condemnation by the Federal Labor spokesman on **immigration**,  Dr Cass.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
1 do not know.

* The Tasmanian Minister for Tourism and **Immigration** has advised me that he is replying to representations concerning Lake Pedder as follows: 
-I will refer the honourable member's question to my colleague the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** will resume his seat.

* Unemployment, according to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has reached a plateau.

* The implications of these recommendations will be considered by the Migrant Education Committee of the **Immigration** Advisory Council at its next meeting to be held early in October.

* Did he publicly state at Sydney airport, in July 1973, that **immigration** inquiries at Australian Government offices in the United States of America were a record; if so, why.

* For the information of honourable members, I present a review of the activities of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the year ended 30 June 1976.

* I am rather amazed that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  did not give any explanation for moving these amendments.

* Clause 8 states: 
For the information of honourable members I present a review of the activities of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for the year ended 30 June 1978. 
and (2) Under Australia's migrant screening procedures, all applications are assessed to ascertain whether applications meet basic eligibility criteria for **immigration**.

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971 I present a report entitled 'Child Migrant Education 1978-79'.

* -The former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the  Hon.

* It is, however, believed by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** that the introduction of schemes, such as the National Employment and Training scheme and the Regional Employment Development scheme and the general manpower planning schemes which were developed by the previous Minister, have encouraged persons to use the Commonwealth Employment Service more regularly for the purpose of obtaining employment.

* The Department of Labor and **Immigration** recognises the deficiency in the Commonwealth Employment Service figures, and that Department has strongly urged the Australian Bureau of Statistics to undertake its employment survey on a monthly basis rather than on the present irregular basis.

* If so, does he agree that there is a wide discrepancy between his answer and the statement made in the House yesterday by the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who said that the Government learned only last week that the unemployment figure would reach 400 000 in January?

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether it is a fact that a number of Australian citizens, of Czechoslovak origin are having difficulty in securing visas or visitor permits to return to Czechoslovakia to visit relatives.

* The Bill before the House seeks to amend the **Immigration** (Education) Act which was first put before the House in 1970, debated to the second reading stage in 1971, and became law in 1971.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is at the table has detailed some of the action that the previous Government took.

* An amendment was moved to the Bill by the then shadow Minister for **Immigration** and present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  but the only real sub stance to the Opposition's case was that there was no provision in the Bill for capital expenditure in terms of the building of extra classrooms.

* I should point out that at that time the shadow Minister for **Immigration** had this to say about the scheme: 
I think we can assess whether the scheme has failed by having a closer look at the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**, which was presented in this House just recently.

* He spoke about the difficulties that had been experienced and said: 
I think the Minister for **Immigration**, who is sitting at the table, will agree with me when I say that that is a substantial endorsement of the policy of the previous Government.

* However, as the Minister for **Immigration** has pointed out, it is obvious that more needs to be done.

* I was interested in the reference by the Minister for **Immigration** to a survey of child migrant education in schools of high migrant density in Melbourne.

* The survey was undertaken by the Victorian Education Department, the Catholic 
Education Office in Victoria, the Commonwealth Department of **Immigration** and the Commonwealth Department of Education.

* As a result of this investigation, as the Minister has said, Cabinet has approved a joint submission by the Minister for **Immigration** and the Minister for Education to extend the child migration education program to include provision for supplementary accommodation.

* Children are raised in a non-English speaking environment and on reaching primary school arc unable to participate in school activities ... On 11 January 1973 the Director-General of the Queensland Department of Education approached the Department of **Immigration** for funds to establish pre-school facilities for migrant children in existing centres in West End and Paddington in Brisbane.

* Perhaps the Minister could tell us from his knowledge of Cabinet activities whether the application has been successful-  the State Department of Education has indicated they would like their original submission to the Department cf **Immigration** reconsidered.

* The Minister for **Immigration** in his second reading speech referred to one aspect of the problem; that is the urgent need to extend to the fullest possible extent the present system of teaching migrant children English as quickly as possible.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that proprietors of fish and chip shops, among others, are having great difficulty in obtaining unskilled workers and that these proprietors are being disadvantaged by the present **immigration** policy of excluding such likely workers coming from overseas on the grounds that such workers are still available in Australia?

* 1 am advised that the then Minister for **Immigration** did not attend, in April 1970, a meeting celebrating the Anniversary of Croation Independence, nor has he ever done so.

* The silence of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments.

* The silence of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments.

* Also, Australian **immigration** officers visited Guam and are now in Hong Kong.

* For the information of honourable members I present a paper entitled:  **Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population.

* 1 ) The nationalities of applicants approved for **immigration** under the entrepreneur policy up to 30 June 1 978 are indicated in the following table.

* Be it resolved that this Conference calls on the Commonwealth Heads of Government to persuade those countries to establish and maintain non-racist **immigration** policies.

* I do not recall stating that **immigration** inquiries at Australian Government offices in the United States of America were a record.

* -Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of a report that under his administration of the national employment and training scheme 22 persons have been specially trained for unskilled positions?

* I submit it is more than expecting an immigrant only to settle into the Australian community for the purposes of the **immigration** laws.

* On 6 March 1975,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, who was then Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, prefaced his remarks in his second reading speech on the Bill by saying that it meant that: 
Why the Government must take these measures will remain something of a mystery, for within TUTA the broad union movement sought an operation which expressed itself simply as a desire to gain the skills and competence to more effectively and efficiently represent their members.

* As the then Minister for Labour and **Immigration** put is so succinctly in 1975: 
We now come to the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  in which he stated in the first sentence: 
That is as clear as crystal.

* But I do not believe that it is really fair to criticise the Minister for **Immigration**.

* It is imprecise; it does not conform with the Treasurer's Budget Speech or the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Mr V. White Department of Labor and **Immigration** 
Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications  (Question No.

* 5522)  Mr Whitlam  asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Mr CLYDE CAMERON (HindmarshMinister for Labor and **Immigration**)-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation.

* -The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has indicated to me that he wishes to make a personal explanation.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Initially in this debate one cannot but comment on the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Very pertinent remarks in the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  indicated that.

* I ask the House to look at what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, as he then was, now Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, said in an interview reported in the  Australian Financial Review  on 2 1 November 1975.

* He said: 
In his second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for **Immigration** and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  said: 
Has the Minister for **Immigration** received complaints  about delays in issuing passports?

* I will demand that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** be heard in complete silence.

* What has been the cost of terminating or re-negotiating the lease of each diplomatic, consular, **immigration** and trade post which has been closed this year.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 15 March 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 3 1 May 1 979: 
For the information of honourable members I present a review of the activities of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to 30 June 1 977.

* More recently, we had the case of the exMinister for **Immigration** who joined the Prime Minister in overseas visits.

* We had Burmese selling our **immigration** papers on the streets.

* If they do so they will see that whenever the Prime Minister or  Mr Grassby  visited South East Asia there was an enormous increase in applications for **immigration** to Australia.

* I might also ask the honourable member for Grayndler whether he remembers his persistent attacks upon the Leader of the Opposition on the question of whether or not the approach of the Leader of the Opposition to the **immigration** problem fits in with the Labor Party's platform.

* Let me take the deceitful boast of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* Departments who participated in the interdepartmental committee were Attorney-General's, Business and Consumer Affairs, Health, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Administrative Services (Commonwealth Police), ASIO, Prime Minister's and Cabinet and Home Affairs.

* Mackellar because the honourable member was under the impression that the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  had given leave for the document to be incorporated and the Minister for **Immigration** would not.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
That is enough reference to history.

* We saw the presence of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair), Senator Withers,  the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock), Mr Speaker,  and even the Premier of Western Australia and a number of others.

* -I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* A. Calwell was Minister for **Immigration**.

* It is in regard to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition which has nothing to do with the portfolio of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* On which dates did  Mr Grassby  (a) cease to be Minister for **Immigration** and (b) accept appointment as a special consultant.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1 977: 
wn asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April 1978: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs upon notice on 2 May 1 978: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 1 March, 1979: 
The honourable member has asked me 2 questions.

* The drill for considering the next migrant intakethis is for the financial year 1974-75  -  is that the matter is first discussed by the program committee of the **Immigration** Planning Council.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1 979: 
, (3), (4) and (5) The events referred to have not been drawn to my attention as Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 1 November 1979: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The honourable gentleman must ensure that his remarks are relevant to the matter before the chair, namely, the question that the House take note of the paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The Government's Green Paper and the Borrie report tend to suggest that the major input in the future will be from **immigration**.

* I am pleased that we should continue our **immigration** program provided it brings in people who are compatible with the work force, who can work, who can contribute to our society or people who ought to be admitted on humanitarian grounds.

* We must stimulate proper **immigration**, namely, **immigration** that is compatible with our economic requirements.

* In the short time remaining I wish to pay tribute to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who has produced a totally new approach to the problem.

* Has he had discussions with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on this question: if so, when, and with what result.

* Australia does not maintain an **immigration** office in Rhodesia.

* As I have pointed out, the appropriation for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** is $ 142 m which virtually will be used for unemployment purposes.

* I appeal to the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to have a look at this matter.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
When I gave my answer in the House to the honourable member for Sydney last week I did not have information that the Embassy in Lebanon was about to be closed down or would be closed down.

* I informed the House at that time that the Embassy had moved from its official quarters to a hotel in the middle of Beirut and that the persons dealing with the **immigration** inquiries there were doing so at some considerable risk to themselves.

* I am amazed at the statement of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch).

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Has the Government reached any decision on the question of accepting some Asians from Uganda?

* When persons make representations concerning **immigration** matters I provide them with information concerning those matters.

* Minister for **Immigration** (5.40) - I refer to clause 12 which reads in part as follows: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable Member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
To help you with the facts, may I tell you that  Mr Justice  Sweeney did not present his final report to the Parliament until 25 May 1976?

* I ceased to be Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 6 June 1975. 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1977:

am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
Demography, I believe, is one of the most interesting studies that the committee entered into because in terms of demography one analyses the social predispositions and the vigour and dynamism of the people being studied.

* In those circumstances this population and **immigration** statement is a very important one, but it is also a little distorted.

* It ought to be understood that **immigration** is part of a population policy; **immigration** is not the totality of a population policy.

* Yet as I look through this Green Paper I see that 1 per cent of it is devoted to a consideration of population policy and 99 per cent is devoted to **immigration**.

* In this respect I believe in the words and in the philosophy, which were enunciated so well after World War II, that **immigration** is a very valuable addition to the Australian population; it ought not to be a substitute for it.

* We acknowledge immediately that they might do these things purely for economic reasons, but the simple facts are that in at least four of the countries of eastern Europe which were beset with very great population problems and to which **immigration** is not allowed their birth rates have increased substantially over the last 4 years.

* All that I am saying is that I hope the Government as part of its consideration of a population **immigration** policy does not put those considerations and countries aside altogether.

* In respect of the **immigration** part of the program, the trotting out of the old argument that **immigration** itself causes inflation or causes a decrease in capital stock, that kind of argument was taken care of, defeated and put aside at the Premiers' Conferences in the early 1950s- in 1953, 1954 and 1955.

* It is also clear from the document that the committee looks at **immigration** not as a short term measure but as one which continues for decades.

* I finish where I began and I say that in consideration of a population policy I hope the Government remembers- and I know that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have it on his mind as always- that population consists of 2 ingredients: The excessive number of births over deaths and the net settler arrival figures.

I inform the House that in the absence of  Senator the  Honourable Ivor Greenwood, Q.C., the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, the Honourable M. J. R. MacKellar, Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, will act for him.

* Although we have a relatively fully employed economy we still do not have enough workers, so much so that we are running an **immigration** programme to get more workers.

* However, I feel some revulsion when I read in the Press statements by various spokesmen for industry who support the continuation of an **immigration** programme - and this may well be justified - but, this is something that will be established by a current inquiry.

It was interesting to note the remarks of the honourable member for Paterson  (Mr O'Keefe).

* He said that the Opposition was divided on its **immigration** policy.

* 1 believe that a full scale debate on **immigration** cannot be conducted under the circumstances which prevail in an estimates debate.

* I  believe it is important that from time to time we should examine the accepted norms of policies such as **immigration**.

* Because **immigration** has been largely bipartisan over almost the entire period of mass **immigration** to Australia since the Second World War, the policy itself, its aims and the manner in which it is carried out have not been subject to question.

* Because most members of this Parliament are agreed basically on **immigration** policy there has been no real examination of the cause and effect and the results of our post war **immigration** policy.

* It would be a worthwhile exercise and in the national interest for a real inquiry to be conducted into our **immigration** policies, the effects, the benefits and such detractions as **immigration** has brought about in the Australian community.

* Some time ago, about the beginning of 1970, Professor Wheelwright claimed that our **immigration** policy was absorbing such a large amount of available investment capital within Australia in order to provide the social structure to cope with an unnatural increase in population that the nation had been forced to allow overseas capital to obtain control of substantial proportions of our industry.

* I believe that it would be worth while to examine whether the conventional wisdom which has existed for so many years in relation to **immigration** is in fact wisdom or just blind ignorance.

Budget system that imposes taxation increases with one hand and grants certain reductions with the other.

* For reasons that were explained by the Minister for **Immigration** and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  and explained in technical detail also in the 48th report of the Commissioner of Taxation, 9 Bills have to be presented on a sales tax measure because of the way in which the tax is imposed.

Then we come to that grey haired  old  mare, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who put in his 2 bits worth.

* Immediately the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who is supposed to be the expert on this matter, was asked a question about the Prime Minister's statement and he said: 'I do not agree.

* It states: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971 I present a report on provisions for child migrant education for the year ended 30 June 1978. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 6 October 1979: 
On behalf of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, and for the information of honourable members, I present the first annual report of the National Training Council for the year ended 3 1 December 1974.

* Minister for **Immigration** 
I think the question asked by the honourable member discloses some confused thinking on this whole question of the shortage of skilled tradesmen and, indeed, across the wide range of skills required by Australian industry and commerce.

* My colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is constantly in touch through his Department with my Department on the requirements of Australian industry.

* -My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We have had a devaluation of the Australian currency by 12 per cent, and this from a Government which swore black and blue that the value of Australia's currency was the cornerstone of its economic policy.

* We have the Regional Employment and Development program which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  proudly refers to as the RED program.

* In rising to speak to these estimates, I was concerned to deal firstly with the estimates for ethnic affairs provided for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* It said that a Liberal-National Country Party Government would establish a Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and that the migrant integration services being performed in the Department of Social Security would be transferred to the new Department.

* It is one area that comes within the responsibility of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* The Office has been shifted from the responsibility of the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  to the responsibility of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Honourable members have spoken about the effect of **immigration** on unemployment and about the priorities of this Government.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  made a particularly useful contribution to the whole question of the morality of **immigration**.

* There can be very little doubt that the great majority of the members of ethnic communities are very much concerned about the **immigration** program that this Government is now about to undertake.

* When he is developing proposals for which he does have some direct ministerial responsibility, such as **immigration** plans, he should have some care to take these factors into account.

* Looking again at the Minister's responsibilities directly for **immigration**, it would be mealy-mouthed to speak in a debate such as this without drawing attention to the very real concern felt about the performance of his Department in several significant areas.

* It may be that in times past no great demands were made on the abilities of the officers in the Department of **Immigration** to respond quickly on difficult policy decisions.

* Unfortunately in the second reading speech on this Bill the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who represents in this House the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt),  did not realise that the Prime Minister had had such a Press conference.

* In the debate on the Budget, the kicking of the rural community at the hands of the Labor Party and by the honourable member for Riverina, the present Minister for **Immigration** who has completely welshed on those who elected him to this place, was stressed by member after member on this side of the House.

* The deplorable exercise of irresponsibility demon strated in this place a few seconds ago by a man who is currently the Minister for **Immigration**, a man who has failed in his responsibilities to his electors demonstrably through the Bill that is before us, through the Budget and the neglect of rural interests which that Budget represented, is one of the damnations that must apply to this Government.

* I wonder how the Minister for **Immigration** - I am told that he is a current financial member of the Australian Journalists Association, a journalist of some sort presumably in the past - regards this exercise of irresponsibility on the part of one of his ministerial colleagues and how he regards this treatment of the Press, the giving to them of a statement which has not corresponded with the truth of the assertions of the Budget.

* If the Government's left hand - particularly the Minister for **Immigration**, representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this House, belatedly it is true; and I really wonder whether he is not ashamed to do so, but then again perhaps he does not represent his electorate - catches up with what the right hand, the Prime Minister, is doing or saying, perhaps then the Parliament can be told.

* -Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that suggestions have been made that the Government is contemplating allowing the Vietnamese refugees known as 'Boat' people to become residents in the electorate of Sydney?

* Essentially, it is a challenge to the professional integrity of  Mr J.  R. Wilson, a senior lecturer at the Sydney University, who has been appointed to undertake the cost benefit analysis which was announced some months ago and, by inference also, it is a challenge to the integrity and the judgment of the distinguished academics, bankers, industrialists and trade union officials who constitute the membership of the Commonwealth **Immigration** Planning Council which recommended the study and agreed to  Mr Wilson's  appointment.

* Indeed, I do not find it strange or unacceptable that the economist to whom reference has been made has a view on **immigration** - a matter of professional interest to any economist; nor do I believe that whatever views he does hold - and I must say that I am unaware of them in any detail - in fact will prejudice the objectivity of his research.

* I am sure that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who has been to Europe, will agree that what is shown on that map is a Third World country, namely Malta, is in fact Sicily.

* I also refer to a document dealing with news reports of relevance to migrants which was produced by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I think that an **immigration** program that leads to that sort of situation is shocking.

* But more disturbing than that is the comment that the fall in **immigration** has dried up the traditional source of labour for the farms.

* One of the contractors said that stepping up the level of **immigration** is the only way in which to provide enough workers for the market gardeners.

* I am pleased that a royal commission has been set up by the Government on the initiative of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  to inquire into this matter.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 

 - Mr Chairman, I wish to answer something that was said by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr 
As Acting Minister for **Immigration** I supply the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
The following are the major source-areas for **immigration** under the Special Passage Assistance Programme: 
The statement was based on a report by the **Immigration** Planning Council which said, inter alia: 
The confusion and uncertainty created by the Prime Minister's actions in dismembering the Department of **Immigration**.

* The level of **immigration** from Iran will depend upon- 
No.

* The post-arrival welfare of migrants is no longer the resonsibility of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I regret one thing as a result of leaving this place, one might say, a year early.

* It is an **immigration** case that should have been finalised long before this.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  knows the story.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided me with the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* In view of the reports from Vietnam of further boat loads of refugees being anticipated, can the Minister guarantee that Australian **immigration** procedures and policies will be sufficient to cope with these boat people as the trickle becomes a flood?

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-There are a couple of issues to which I should Uke to refer in the few minutes we are given to debate the appropriations for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)-  I am sure he agrees with me that such a disincentive should not exist for former citizens of Germany to become Australian citizens- to initiate discussions again with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* They make particular reference to the Mafia and therefore it is relevant to this discussion on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The honourable member should not be debating organised crime; he should be debating the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I make this final point on the question of **immigration**: I am not one of those who believe **immigration** ought to be cut out.

* I am one who believes that an excellent argument can be made, for economic and other reasons, in favour of continuing **immigration** on a significant scale.

* I cannot remember who signed the particular articles; indeed I am not sure that they were signed at all, but they contain ridiculous propositions with which, deplorably, the Australian Conservation Foundation associates itself, to the effect that before the Government increases **immigration** it must consider the subject in the light of the Federal Environment Protection Act.

* Surely, if that is so, the same sort of thing should be done before it decreases **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on IS March 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on IS August 1978: 
-We have recently seen tabled in this Parliament the report of the National Population Inquiry, commonly known as the Borrie Report.

* In other words, if the **immigration** cutback by this Government were to continue Australia's population growth would stagnate at the present figure of around 13 million.

* It is just over 12 months since the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable Clyde Cameron, announced the Whitlam Labor Government's new restrictions on migrant entry into Australia.

* As a result of this Government's policies the **immigration** program has been reduced from a peak of 185 000 in 1970 to an anticipated figure this year of approximately 45 000.

* Having created, by its tariffs and other policies, the largest pool of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression, the Government somehow believes it can cure the problem, or at least alleviate it, by cutting down on **immigration**.

* A vigorous and directed **immigration** program could well help re-stimulate the economy.

* An expansion of **immigration** would immediately lead to increased consumer demand.

* Not only has it failed to establish any connection between reducing **immigration** and improving the unemployment situation, but it has placed in jeopardy both our social structure and our long term national development.

* The former Minister for **Immigration** and now the Minister's Advisor on Migrant Affairs,  Mr Al  Grassby, has even gone on record as stating that Australia has the capacity to support 100 million people.

* When the late member for Melbourne, the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, who was a good friend to many in this House, first designed and implemented our post-war **immigration** policy we had a population of some 7 million.

* I believe that the policy of the present Government towards **immigration** is wrong for a number of reasons.

* The reintroduction of a vigorous **immigration** program could do much to revitalise Australia.

* I call upon the Government to rethink seriously its present **immigration** policy.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on 9 May the following questions: 
-I compliment the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Oldmeadow)  on the speech he made on this Bill.

* The second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  reeks with nauseating hypocrisy.

* The Minister stated: 
Just who does the Minister for **Immigration** think he is kidding?

* If I had stated that sort of thing when I was Minister for **Immigration**, the bright young men of the Press would have laughed me out of court.

* While the Minister fiddles, or rather talks, our traditional **immigration** program is crumbling into ruins.

* Mesmerised by the Minister's words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality British migrants of European origin, that the composition of our **immigration** program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them.

* That is what the Minister for **Immigration** has been doing while he has been talking.

* What it means in essence is that while the Minister has been big-noting himself by claiming the previous Government's initiatives in migrant integration as his own, and emphasising the importance his Government attaches to **immigration**, he is by his actions in relation to the program storing up formidable integration problems for the future.

* I have already exposed the explanation given by the Minister for **Immigration** for the hypocritical humbug that it is.

* He has used words during his speech which have likened the Minister for **Immigration** to Hitler.

* He has used words;- 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 1 May, 1978: 
There has been criticism about costs.

* The scheme was started with a bit of a rush, but by the time we had finished I believe the people who were working on the RED scheme, the staff from the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, had learned a lot about it.

* I pay credit, particularly for the tremendous job done by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, to people such as Greg Castles, Kevin Steele and  Mr McKenzie,  all of whom have done a fantastic job in getting this scheme going.

* Therefore, the Commission will give detailed attention to the development in other areas of social policy of an appreciation of the welfare implications of such matters as incomes policy, the taxation system, recreation, housing and **immigration** policy, urban development .

* Originally it was part of a much larger Bill, the first one of which was introduced by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he occupied that portfolio after the election of the present Government in December 1972.

* But one thing can be said against that background: At least the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is a trier.

* asked the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I note that it has been claimed that certain solicitors have charged large amounts for services related to **immigration**.

* If people have complaints about solicitors or organisations which they believe are charging unfairly for services which, I reiterate, are available free of charge to people who come to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, then in the case of solicitors they should make the facts available to the Law Society in the State of residence and in the case of any organisation they should make the facts known to me.

* asked the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
In this regard miniature declaratory certificates of citizenship are available from the Department of **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The following agreements affecting **immigration** have been made with other countries since 1945: 
asked the* Minister for Labor and **Immigration** the following questions, upon notice:

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians is governed by paragraph 5 of the United 
The attitude of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is as follows: 
Why has not the Soviet Union honoured the Helsinki Pact with reference to freedom of **immigration**?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
How many (a) black and (b) white Rhodesians have been granted residency under Australia's **immigration** program during each of the last three years.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
In view of the lateness of the hour I shall not delay the Committee other than to say that the Opposition is in accord with the explanation and the amendments as they are now framed.

* Again may I say that we are delighted that the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory is presenting these amendments to the Bill and has given us a reasonable explanation of them, which I am afraid his predecessor, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  failed to do.

* I take the opportunity in this debate to make some reference to the reply of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to a question about the entry into Australia of Domenico Barbaro.

* Newspaper headlines this week and an answer given by the Minister for **Immigration** this morning provide even more grounds for concern about  Mr Grassby  's suitability to hold down even a clerk's job in the Public Service, let alone the position of a $44,000 a year commissioner who is supposed to mediate in cases in which it is alleged that racial overtones might exist.

* This morning the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in effect informed the House that his Department has strenuously advised  Mr Grassby  that deported Domenico Barbaro, who is currently serving 14 to 18 years in prison in Italy, should not be allowed to re-enter Australia because of his criminal background.

* Finally, so far as the Department of **Immigration** is concerned, I believe that its officers should be congratulated if this migrant is the type of citizen selected - healthy, ageless and so confident that he will live long enough to share in the welfare state of liberalism.

* All sorts of funny business about **immigration** permits are said to be in the pipeline, but of course the Government has the files.

Publication of **Immigration** Literature in Foreign Languages (Question No.

* 2380) 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Now that all the factories built in wartime have in some way been disposed of the decentralisation move must not stop.

* We are looking to increasing our population by large scale **immigration**.

* The Liberal Government which came to power in 1949 adopted Labor's **immigration** programme but not the associated regional development and decentralisation programme of the Department of Postwar Reconstruction.

* The Prime Minister is assuming a blind continuation of present population nonpolicies and the continuation of large scale **immigration**.

* He does not ever seem to realise that his own Department of **Immigration** is now cutting back severely on **immigration** because of the present unemployment situation.

* **Immigration** has added another 0.8 per cent.

* The Commonwealth, the body which is responsible foi **immigration**, has an internal debt which has remained nearly static during this period.

* We will progressively cut back on **immigration** to help us get on with the job of solving the problems of the cities.

* Unfortunately the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  is distracted by the problems of the Labor and **Immigration** portfolio which he handles in this House.

* 1 wish to inform the House that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  left Australia on 16th May for Europe.

* After the meeting in Paris, the Minister will visit Britain, Eire, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Malta, the United States and Canada to discuss with the Government's concerned problems and other matters relating to **immigration** programmes.

* During his absence, the Minister for Housing  (Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin)  is Acting Minister for **Immigration** and the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  will represent the Acting Minister in this House.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: 
Yes, I am aware of newspaper reports to the effect that my Department is suggesting an increase in the **immigration** intake to 100 000 in the next year.

* These, of course, will be discussed with other relevant departments and with the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council before a submission is put to Cabinet.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Another problem exists with refugees from Indo-China who miss school sometimes for years.

* The Federal Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs does provide language courses for the refugees.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Education are now working closely together and we must hope that they will find solutions.

* -I would have thought that after being the shadow spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs for 17 months the honourable member would have understood that this matter comes within the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education.

* I might say that no request was received by the Australian Department of **Immigration** to prevent the departure of this man, and certainly no request was received from the Government of New South Wales.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  administers, amongst other Acts, the Migration Act 1958-73.

* Much as the Minister would like it, the question is not how the House of Commons should act in relation to one of its own members; the question clearly lies with the Australian Government and its Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has the power to enforce that requirement and he should exercise it.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We regarded it as a matter of diplomacy - not public relations or gunboat diplomacy.

* The previous Government had for many years been concerned and had acted to develop not only a resources diplomacy but also a trade diplomacy, an **immigration** diplomacy, an international transport diplomacy and many other diplomacies.

* Do any Australian passports allow the holder exemption from normal **Immigration** and Customs procedures on re-entry into Australia.

* Is that not also the case with the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)?

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether it is a fact that the application of  Mr K.  T. Li to enter Australia has been refused.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs upon notice: 
It inferentially declares incompetent, or alternatively, engaged in a conspiracy to withhold information from their Ministers, senior permanent heads who are well known to me and for whom I have the utmost respect.

* Why could not a telephone call have been made to  Sir John  Bunting,  Sir Keith  Waller,  Mr Harders  of the Attorney-General's Department,  Mr Armstrong  of the Department of **Immigration**,  Mr Davis,  the Commonwealth Police Commissioner, or  Mr Barbour,  the Director-General of Security?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Has the Minister for **Immigration** any idea of the number of deserters from foreign ships in Australian ports in the last 3 years and from which countries the deserters originated?

* Would the Minister tell me also whether it is not the normal practice for a captain of a foreign ship before sailing to report missing a crewman to the responsible Customs official who, in turn, reports the incident to the **immigration** authorities and State police, who endeavour to effect the arrest of the deserter by warrant with a view to his deportation?

* Minister for **Immigration**:Statement Made In Manchester  (Question No.

* 115) 
-I address my question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Yes, I can.

* Of course sponsored **immigration** is no new thing.

* It has been a very important part of our programme, almost since the beginning of the post-war **immigration** programme.

* We propose to continue sponsored **immigration** as long as there is an **immigration** programme, particularly as it affects family reunion.

* The only reason why it has been necessary to raise the point that sponsorship patterns differ widely from country to country is that the Australian Labor Party has announced that it will base its approach to **immigration** virtually on sponsorship by friends, relatives and employers in Australia alone, in other words, virtually confining it to sponsorship.

* In a situation in which the apologists for the Labor Party tend to say that whatever the Labor Party says it will do things will remain the same, I think it important to say in relation to **immigration** that if the Labor Party does what it says it will do there will be a significant and radical change in the composition of our **immigration** programme.

* I am hopeful that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Cameron)  in his wisdom will finally get around to doing something for these areas but I am somewhat doubtful.

* I daresay that in fact the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** with his usual cunning has managed to exclude their numbers from the list of actual unemployed.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on5 April 1978: 
Our High Commissioner did make representations to the British Government relating to the then provisions of the **Immigration** Bill as they related to patrials.

* -It must have come as a great surprise to this House to learn that this Green Paper was the first that had been presented to the House in its history on the question of **immigration**.

* It is, I think, noticeable that of all things **immigration** has been the most bipartisan matter before this Parliament.

* Sure, the great **immigration** program of the recent decade was carried out under the aegis of a 
Liberal Government, but it was Arthur Calwell from the Labor Party who set that program on its course and we can regard this as a real bipartisan policy.

* The honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  very rightly pointed out that **immigration** was only one of the ways in which the population was increased and the optimum reached.

* This can be changed by **immigration**.

* So **immigration** has tailed off and it is no longer significantly contributing to the increase in our population.

* **Immigration** is, of course, a matter of individual people besides being a matter of total population.

* So there is reason why Australia should grow and there is reason, therefore, to have an **immigration** policy of a quite different order of magnitude from that which we have today.

* We have legislation on the statute books because of what the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  did when he was shadow Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Tony Cable was lent to  Mr Fraser  by his previous employer, Keith 
asked the Minister ot **Immigration**, upon notice:

I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social welfare policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian family codes and **immigration**, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia.

* Once eligibility on occupational grounds has been established and all the other criteria for **immigration** met, these applicants and their families are approved for **immigration** and issued visas on which the appropriate eligibility category code is entered.

* In this case the departments of Customs, Labor and **Immigration**, Manufacturing Industry, the Treasury, Overseas Trade and my own department were involved.

* Can the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** inform the House of any developments that have taken place this morning concerning the industrial dispute involving the Transport Workers Union of Australia, the Professional Musicians Union of Australia, the Australian Journalists Association and the visiting American entertainer Frank Sinatra or, as the Minister may know him, Old Blue Eyes?

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
On 31 August 1972, the Honourable Member as Minister for **Immigration**, announced that new measures for migrant selection and counselling were being planned.

* My statement of 31 January 1973 referred to the fact that these new procedures 'had drawn on the expertise of senior officers within the Department of **Immigration** which had been anxious to improve selection methods and training of selection and interviewing officers' and announced that they were to be brought into general use in migrant source countries forthwith.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 30 May 1 979: 
The members of the Cabinet and rural Labor members of Parliament have abandoned their electors.

* The Minister for Northern Development, the honourable member for Dawson, has abandoned his responsibility to his electorate and the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  has abandoned his responsibility to his electorate.

* (Government supporters interjecting) 
Please do not try to' reason with .the Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Speaker;  he is immune to it.

* I affirm the statement that I made to my Federal Member of Parliament and which he repeated in Parliament; namely: I have never had an official letter or communication from the Department of **immigration** concerning my husband's deportation.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether it is a fact that officers of his Department when applying for overseas postings may be at a disadvantage due to the length of their hair and their mode of dress.

* I am interested to note that the Government is in the process of co-ordinating the results of various programs that have been conducted by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as well as by departments such as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Postal and Telecommunications Department.

* Some months ago the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  wrote to us and gave us guidelines as to what we were to say at those ceremonies, gently rapped our knuckles and said that we should not be political.

* In closing, I would hope that at some stage, instead of leaving it to the Galbally Committee, advisory councils and so on, we can have what the British Parliament has, namely, a parliamentary committee that looks at these questions of **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

Rising to speak in support of the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** I first of all want to pay a tribute to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch).

* We have had many very good Ministers for **Immigration** but the present Minister has brought drive and enthusiasm to this portfolio.

* This, together with the hard work of his Department, augurs well for the future of our **immigration** policy.

* As one who has been associated with **immigration** ever since I came into the Parliament I pay a tribute to the tremendous job they do and their keenness to co-operate with honourable members irrespective of party affiliations in every way and on every occasion.

* Undoubtedly Australia's record in the field of **immigration** is a very proud one.

* It compares more than favourably with the **immigration** records of other nations.

* It is because of our efficient **immigration** policy and the thoroughness with which we have attempted to assimilate these people that the great majority of them have become very good Australians.

* There have been accusations, as I have said before, that our **immigration** policy perhaps has aggravated unduly the trend towards inflation and rising costs, but we must balance that against what we have gained.

* Our **immigration** programme has been exceedingly successful, principally because we have moved with the times.

* As I said, the whole of our **immigration** programme has been aimed increasingly at making it possible for all the people we are bringing to Australia to become Australians as quickly as possible, to he assimilated and integrated into the community.

* Our **immigration** policy is a story of increasing success.

* I support the proposed expenditure for the Department of **Immigration**.

* One would be led to believe by the remarks of the honourable member for Isaacs that the cause of all the problems of the building industry should be laid at the feet of this Government and its policies, including the responsible attitude that it has taken to the Australian **immigration** scheme which a former Labor Government introduced in the early years after World War II.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
The 1975-76 advertising publicity and information budget Division 365/2/06 proposed for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** includes $350,000 for advertising.

* A provision of $23,000 for migration advertising on behalf of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** is also included in the appropriation for the Department of the Media.

* Previously this particular item was included in the appropriation of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* The planned Labor and **Immigration** advertising program for 1975-76 includes $ 100,000 for staff advertising and $250,000 for promoting employment opportunities particularly for youth, handicapped persons and aborigines, and for apprenticeship and industrial training.

* Prior to the amalgamation of the Department of Labour and the Department of **Immigration** in mid- 1974, aggregate expenditure by both Departments on advertising comparable with that included in answer to question ( 1 ) is as follows:

* -I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he regards as reasonable the response of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to the very serious problem of unemployment throughout Tasmania?

* Will the honourable gentleman tell this House and the Tasmanian people that, consistent with the response of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, this Government is prepared to spend on employment projects throughout Tasmania no more than this Government was prepared to spend for the purchase of a major painting?

* I ask the honourable gentleman in a serious sense not to make a mockery of the plight of those who today are unemployed but to imagine for one moment the reaction of a person unemployed, listening to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in relation to the projects which he has just put down - 
-We are dealing with a tragedy of very grave proportions.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is to be congratulated for the very close attention he has given to this matter in the past year or so.

* I look at the letter tabled in this House today by the honourable member for Melbourne who is the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** matters.

* It left us with no **immigration** policy properly referrable to refugees.

* Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah-Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs)- The honourable member for Lang  (Mr Stewart)  raised the case of the sister of a group of people who was alleged to have been told that she would not be allowed to come to Australia.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Too many strikes and disputes are caused by a breakdown in communication between workers and their bosses, between workers and their union, and between unions and the bosses.

* I sincerely hope that this Bill- the brainchild of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**- when it is finally implemented can help by educating all members of society in restraint and co-operation.

* The senior Australian **immigration** officer remained in Beirut until the Embassy staff was withdrawn.

* Locally engaged staff, except for one or two people who endangered their own lives were unable to reach the hotel in which the **immigration** officer was operating.

* It was virtually impossible for those in the Lebanese community who may have sought to reach the **immigration** officer to do so.

* I have already given instructions that an **immigration** officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia.

* As soon as the situation in Beirut stabilises to the point where the Embassy staff can return and operations can begin again, a task force of **immigration** officers will be sent into Beirut.

* Mr Brogan, the Senior Migration Officer who was in charge of the **Immigration** Office in Beirut, is now in Athens.

* He has been directed to co-ordinate **immigration** arrangements for those Lebanese who reach countries outside the Lebanon.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has advised that statistics on the number of people who, over the last five years, have entered this country without an entry permit, are not readily available.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Most importantly, what action does the Minister or the Government now intend to take to have processed all **immigration** applications from the war-torn country of Lebanon?

* I notice from the most recent consolidated statistics of the Department of **Immigration** that for the period 1945 to 1972 inclusive the numbers of migrants regarded as permanent  and long term arrivals, by country of last residence, are as follows: Greece  210,000,  Italy  404,000.

* In respect of (a) the Department of **Immigration**, (b) the Postmaster-General's Department and (c) the Department of Supply, what was (i) the number of persons employed under the Public Service Act and other Acts at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973, (ii) the number employed who were permanent, temporary or exempt officers or employees, at each of the above dates and under each Act, (iii) the total establishment under the Public Service Act and other .Acts at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973, (iv) the number of positions oh establishment that were vacant at (A) 30 June 1971, (B) 30 November 1972 and (C) 30 May 1973 and (v) the number of new positions created since 30 November 1972 under the Public Service Act or other Acts, and the number that had not been occupied up to 30 May 1973 or which were vacant at 30 May 1973.

* If the legislation were set on its proper course, if the Government were serious about getting the grass roots of this problem and looking at the issue of unemployment, its effects, and the rationalisation of industry together with the co-ordination of education programs for the purpose of achieving rationalisation side by side with retraining, and if the legislation had the scope to deal with population policies, the size and shape of population for the future and where those policies fit in with the **immigration** program and the availability of employment, we would -

in consultation with and as required by the Department of **Immigration**, to prepare or assist in the preparation of general publicity and information material to serve as a background against which specific campaigns to attract and inform immigrants can be carried out.

* We still have a record **immigration** inflow compared with that of any other country.

* In fact that is less than the amount provided last year, and in his second reading speech the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  justified that on the basis that the amount was set out in a Labor Budget anyhow and this Government did not feel like increasing it.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
What is a responsible wage policy?

* The shadow Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has said that on a number of occasions.

* The words 'sabotage' and 'gutless' are not quite the words that one would expect from the social background of the shadow Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, but nevertheless they are commonly used in the House today by people of a similar social background.

* As the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is at the table I refer to a couple of extraordinary additional estimates which are found in this Bill.

* Honourable members will remember that when the coalition parties went to the people in December 1975 one of their great promises to the migrant communities in this country was that they would re-establish a Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs as a focus for their concerns.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice:

That the people of Australia were misled during the last election campaign and the period preceding it oan be easily demonstrated by this piece of legislation.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  were the greatest pretenders of all great pretenders - no more, no less.

* I do not know where the Minister for **Immigration** was during the Budget discussions - he must have been representing the electorate of Riverina by hiding behind the door somewhere.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I refer to the importance of Australia's **immigration** programme and to a recent Press article concerning migrant departures from Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 18 October 1979: 
The second statement to which I want to refer was made in this House on 23 May 1973 during a debate on rural industries.

* It was one of a number of statements in the same vein which were made by the now Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* This is the statement of the Minister for **Immigration**, to which I want to refer: 
asked the Minister  for  **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I found it difficult to hear most of what the honourable member said.

* I did see some reference in the Press only a few days ago to this question, and a question was asked of my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, the other day about the illegal importation of cheap coloured labour to be employed as cheap house help in wealthy people's homes.

* I was misrepresented by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  on the television program 'Federal File' on Sunday, 9 September.

* As I recall it, I wrote to the Minister for **Immigration** on 3 September referring to an earlier letter of mine of 2 September.

* I wrote: 
The point of misrepresentation, of course, was that at no time in relation to the correspondence with the Minister for **Immigration** did I place any embargo on my capacity to make this matter public, particularly in the circumstances in which the fact of this publication came about as a direct consequence of a copy of a letter which was sent to me.

* That letter, dated 28 August, I believe makes some quite serious allegations which the Minister has not answered and which I believe he should answer because the Opposition has been pressing for a statement from the Minister for **Immigration** on Australia's **immigration** progam and it has not been forthcoming.

* As you are aware,  Mr Speaker,  we have heard more about Australia's **immigration** program from  Mr Grassby  overseas than we have heard from him in this House.

* At the outset I would like to correct the misinterpretation and distortion of the policy of the Australian Labor Party on **immigration** as given by the Minister for 
**Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  a few minutes ago.

* I address a question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**, fs the Minister aware that in the first 3 months of this year 30,000-odd Americans, which represents an increase of over 30%, have made inquiries about the possibility of migrating to Australia?

* The principal matter I raise this evening concerns the reply of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to a question asked of him by  Mr Dawkins  last week.

* In the course of his answer on 24 September the Minister mentioned that a conference of Ministers for **Immigration** in November 1973 agreed on South Australian rules respecting the nomination of migrants.

* No evidence was produced by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to back up these statements.

* Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Grayden.

* On 26 September 1974, in answer to a question from me, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said: 
That answer gives the clear indication that those rules were adopted and were in force.

* I refer next to a telegram from the Minister for **Immigration** in Western Australia.

* The telegram states in part: 
Following instructions by the former Minister for **Immigration** a review of these conditions was undertaken - 
In response to that statement,  Mr Grayden  sent the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** a telegram and he sent a copy of it to me also.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has not done that.

* Landall offered to co-operate fully with the **immigration** task force operating in Western Australia.

* The  Chairman  of Lan.dall,  Mr Clark,  wrote also to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 19 August.

* This is what  Mr Clark  said: 
I put this question to the House,  Mr Speaker:  Is this the action of a company which, in the words of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, was engaged in some very questionable activities or was a questionable company in more ways than one?

* Why did not the Minister mention the additional protection given by rules 12 and 13 in the new rules brought down by the new Minister for **Immigration** in Western Australia.

* There are wool selling organisations, transport organisations, wool classing, storage facilities, and the people who shear the sheep, the members of the great Australian Workers Union, which spawned such great people as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young),  all products of the AWU.

* Certainly the Government is concerned at any diminution in the assisted migration programme from Great Britain because British migration has been, and we would wish it to continue to be, the cornerstone of our **immigration** programme.

* So in summary I say to the right honourable gentleman and to the House that we are determined that migration from the United Kingdom should continue to be the cornerstone of our total **immigration** programme and that steps are being taken to realise this objective.

* Negotiations between the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs and Labor and **Immigration** commence immediately on the transfer of responsibility for the Special Work Projects Scheme to the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
 I have been advised by the Minister for **Immigration** that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
(a) Nothing Australia does in regard to its population will significantly affect the world population situation.

* This work, which is being financed by the Department of **Immigration**, is being carried out at the Australian National University under the supervision of Professor W. D. Borrie, Director of the Research School of Social Sciences and a demographer of international standing.

* Did the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** say, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, on 17 September 1972, that a Labor Government would adopt the 1970 submission of the "Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations to produce an appeal to an Administrative Court of Appeal in order to enforce the public's right to access to official records and documents established under the legislative scheme a Labor Government would implement.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  who usually represents the Minister for Health in this place, was, to my mind, obviously wrong in his estimates of the effect of the proposed increases in patient contributions on the total amount involved.

* Last week I asked a question of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* I can assure the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Government generally that they have proved to be extemely good migrants.

* I principally want to oppose your ruling,  Sir, because  the question in this instance commenced: 'Would reported differences of opinion on **immigration** matters between leading members of the Opposition lead to a change in policy by the Government?'

* We argued strenuously that we should aim at a population growth, as a result of both natural increase and **immigration**, of some 1.1 per cent.

* The figure of 1.9 per cent comprised 1.1 per cent from natural causes, and 0,8 per cent from **immigration**.

* The **immigration** policy of the Government seeks to rid the nation of the inconsistencies, inequalities and discrimination that we believe should no longer be allowed to exist when we are seeking to bring people from various countries and to welcome them as citizens in their own right in Australia.

* If the Opposition were not so biased in its acceptance of the fact that this Government has been prepared to do what its predecessor had not been forthright enough to attempt, despite the statements that previous Ministers and the present leaders of the Opposition made when they were in office, it would acknowledge that the present Minister for **Immigration** has been prepared to tackle this problem and to recognise the fact that these things need to be done speedily.

* They know quite well that even some of the anti-unemployment policies that were followed in the early days of the Labor Government were partially disowned by  Senator James  McClelland, when Minister for Labour and **Immigration** in the final months of the Whitlam Government.

* 1 wish to raise three or four matters tonight in the consideration of the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** but firstly I feel that I must not let the opportunity pass without referring to one of the statements made by the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury).

* He referred to the fact that the Opposition's bipartisan policy on **immigration** had been abandoned.

* I repeat that remark and say that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it has cast itself adrift from the discriminatory practices into which this Government has allowed itself to lapse in the interpretation of what we hoped could have continued to be an **immigration** policy that did not discriminate against people for malicious reasons.

* I want to refer to several aspects of **immigration** policy that I believe give the lie to some of the instant policies of the Government of recent times and which indicate very clearly the breakdown of what we hoped could have continued as a fair and reasonable bipartisan policy on **immigration**.

* I remember the former Minister for Education and Science and the former Minister for **Immigration**,  Dr Forbes,  setting about the establishment of a task force to inquire into the needs of migrant education.

* The man considering whether he will take advantage of this initiative finds that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  only a few weeks ago tried to convince Cabinet that it ought to support or at least not oppose an application before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for an increased wage for metal trades workers.

* In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's rather snide introduction to the question, let me say that yesterday I was talking about the future population of Australia, the effect of the fertility trends which are now present in the population, the likely fertility trends in the future, the contribution that people born in Australia can make to population growth and also the contribution that **immigration** can make to population growth in Australia.

* That is why I have asked the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council to have a look at matters of this kind.

* The normal **immigration** criteria were relaxed for Lebanese who had suffered hardship as a result of the conflict within the Lebanon.

* The task force will remain in Cyprus for 3 months and the special **immigration** operation in Nicosia will then be reviewed.

* It has been a constructive approach to the question of **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* Other honourable members have stressed the importance of **immigration** as a contributor to the economic well-being of the Australian nation.

* The honourable member made the statement in fairly direct terms that **immigration** equates with unemployment.

* He advanced the simplistic argument that if **immigration** is increased, inevitably it will increase unemployment.

* If I can take as a guide the number of representations the honourable member makes to me in relation to **immigration**, I am sure that he was not arguing that we should be stopping family reunion migration.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Speaking in the House of Representatives on 8th September 1949 the then Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Calwell,  said: 
To abandon Government nominated migration would, therefore, have the effect of reducing settler arrivals by at least 50 per cent.

* Firstly, the Government would lose effective control of the **immigration** programme and in particular it would lose control over the composition of the programme.

* Secondly, the Government would be precluded from using the **immigration** programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development.

* I want particularly to comment on the loss of effective Government control over **immigration** which would result from Labor policies.

* Effective control of **immigration** requires firstly, that the composition of the migrant intake in terms of sources, skills and integration prospects is suitably balanced, and secondly, that action should be taken by the Government as and when necessary to ensure that the numbers and types of migrants coming to Australia are in harmony with our needs.

* In these important respects Labor's **immigration** policies would provide insufficient control.

* According to the Leader of the Opposition the Labor Party would set a numerical upper limit to **immigration**.

* The second of the major defects in Labor's **immigration** policies is that the government would be precluded from using the **immigration** programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development.

* With only sponsored migration the government would also be prevented from using the **immigration** programme as an effective instrument of population policy.

* In this context it is relevant to remind the Parliament that the Government has commissioned far-reaching population studies which are premised on the availabality to the Government of effective control of **immigration** as a means of implementing population policies.

* In summary, regardless pf whether sponsorship is confined to relatives or is more widely based the Labor Party's policies would mean that firstly the Government would lose effective control of the **immigration** programme.

* Thirdly, if sponsorship were to be confined to relatives **immigration** would fall drastically - so much so that we would face the very real prospect of being unable to make good our own population losses through emigration.

* Fourthly, if broader based sponsorships were adopted the level of **immigration** would still fall sharply to begin with.

* It concerns the effects of Labor's .**immigration** policies on the Australian economy.

* Moreover, having voluntarily relinquished effective control of **immigration**, a government which implemented Labor's **immigration** policies would be largely powerless to redress the situation.

* The Government's stand, as reported in the  Australian,  was that Australia would not allow refugees to settle in this country unless they could meet normal **immigration** standards.

* This is not an unusual stand to take but I believe the position must not be looked at in any harsh, illiberal or rigid way because in many cases for humanitarian reasons those normal **immigration** standards and requirements must be flexibly administered.

* The headings of discussion in the Conference were: The Enlarged European Community and the Commonwealth', 'World Security', 'The Future of Territories in the Commonwealth', 'Commonwealth **Immigration** Policies', 'Parliamentary Government (in its various aspects)', and 'Economic Problems and Social Problems', the last two being taken in committee session.

* Nevertheless, the delegation did take part in debate on the European Economic Community, World Security, the Protection of the Environment, Commonwealth **Immigration** Policies and the Status and Role of the Parliamentarian in contemporary society.

* Apart from the appropriation by Parliament, as I indicated in brief this afternoon legislation is not strictly necessary for the purposes of this Bill as no coercive powers are being sought and the activities of the Department of **Immigration** in arranging for the expenditure of moneys in fact would be well within the executive powers of the Commonwealth with respect to **immigration**.

* Because in the last 20-odd years we have been supplementing our natural population increase by **immigration** the expansion of the cities has been accelerated.

* I think that the Government will have to look seriously at whether our **immigration** quota is too large to allow our urban development programmes to adapt to the rapid population increase, although, as the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has mentioned, the incidence of crime amongst migrants is much lower than in the Australian born population.

* First, we propose to reduce the **immigration** program for 1974-75.

* Subject to existing commitments, we shall be aiming for a total intake of not more than 80,000, of which assisted **immigration** would be not more than 40,000 - that is, approximately 10,000 less than last year.

* 1 preface my question to the Minister for **Immigration** by drawing attention to his statement yesterday - I do not want to misquote him - to the effect that he was issuing instructions that migrants would be accepted only if they had special skills so that their acceptance would not aggravate the unemployment situation.

* I draw his attention to an advertisement appearing in the United Kingdom Daily Mirror' newspaper of 28th April 1972 which says: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Guilt by association is one of the great tactics you use.

* A previous Minister for **Immigration** stood on a platform and behind him was a picture of a famous Nazi Party leader.

* That former Minister for **Immigration** is now somewhere else.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I can certainly inform the House that no special concessions of any type were accorded to  Mr Burchett  in relation to his entry to or departure from this country.

* So far as the final part of the honourable member's question is concerned - it related to the value of an Australian passport - I want to say quite clearly to the House that the value of an Australian passport is that it identifies the bearer and his citizenship to representatives of other governments, to our own representatives overseas, to carriers, to **immigration** officials at ports and airports on entry to Australia, and to this extent it is valuable because it greatly facilitates the travel of the bearer.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Government is not conducting any such campaign.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is in the United Kingdom, I think, at the moment.

* It is a pleasure for me to rise in support of this measure which has been introduced by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I think it is about high time that the Government - and I hope this is understood - put the axe into the **immigration** programme.

* What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate facilities for processing **immigration** applications from persons fleeing hostilities in the Lebanon?

* In 1943 Arthur Calwell was promoted to the position of Minister for **Immigration**.

* His  work as the architect of the **immigration** policy at that time was of incalculable benefit to Australia.

* -The whole issue of **immigration** is one which has some accord politically and, indeed, throughout Australia at the present time.

* It is very much in character with the founder of our **immigration** policy,, the late Arthur Calwell.

* I think all parliamentarians with any knowledge and experience about these things will concede that he was very forward looking when, as Labor Minister for **Immigration**, he initiated this program.

* The unity ticket now, having had that creative work done way back in the early post-war years, is to give effect to the spirit of **immigration** and to make the passage and pathway for our migrant people more easy or reasonable.

* It is an enormous phenomenon of our time that three and a half million people from 100 countries have come to our country, as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has said.

* According to that statement, current staff is about 1,100 persons, of whom about 900 are locally engaged and about 350 are engaged in **immigration** matters.

* Accordingly I question the need for maintenance of the 350 persons engaged in **immigration** matters.

* I believe that at that time if a person could convince the **immigration** authorities that he was fleeing from communism he was OK. All he had to say was 'I hate communism' and that was nearly a passport to come to Australia.

* I now turn to the **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  was in the chamber a short while ago.

* The Minister may have resigned when he was appointed to the Treasury portfolio but he continued to hold positions as consultant in two companies- in 1969 to 1971 while he was Minister for **Immigration** and the Minister Assisting the Treasurer and in 1971 while he was the Minister for Labour and National Service.

* I just pose to the House the question: If it is good enough for a Minister to be in receipt of a sum of $4,800 as a consultant's fee while a Minister of the Crown, is that a standard which the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  now says can apply to the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr MacKellar)  or to the present Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 March 1979: 
I want to make only one other point on this costing.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  to my way of thinking made a complete fool of himself this afternoon.

* That will mean a total increase of 6.7c per gallon for many of the constituents whom the Minister for **Immigration** represents.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We cannot continue for ever to import from elsewhere the technical know-how that we in this country require and expect to gain first-band benefits from secondhand knowledge.

* It is also true, as was fairly clearly pointed out in the Vernon Report, that one of the restricting factors on increased national productivity is a high level of **immigration**.

* I ask Government spokesmen whether they are prepared to reduce the level of **immigration** into this country merely to provide the country with a greater percentage figure of increased productivity.

* -On 2 June 1977 I raised in this Parliament an **immigration** fee racket which was being practiced by a Sydney solicitor, a  Mr D.  P. Khoury who practices under the name of Benjamin and Khoury at 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point.

* I have made all these documents available to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who has agreed to their being incorporated in  Hansard.

* We are one of the few countries that could consider the option of vastly expanded **immigration**.

* It is possible that the net benefits of such **immigration** would outweigh the difficulties in employing migrants.

* This Bill is straightforward, as stated by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  in his second reading speech.

* Again, I believe that matter will be explained in full by the Minister for **Immigration** who is at present at the table.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1978: 
Ombudsman Amendment Bill, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Amendment Bill.

* It was thought some dme ago that there may be some cases relating to **immigration** decisions which could be the subject of a judicial review, and the Government was sensitive about that and did not want to have a situation in which anybody could review a decision of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* These were two of the factors which prompted me to initiate the establishment of a committee of officials, under the chairmanship of  Dr S.  Sax,  Chairman  of the Social Welfare Policy Secretariat, from the Departments of Education, Health, Employment and Youth Affairs and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Tertiary Education Commission.

* So did the present Leader of the Opposition as Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: 
I had an interesting experience some time ago when 1 tried to chair a discussion between the late  Dr Evatt  and the late  Mr Townley  over an **immigration** matter.

* I understand that at the recent citizenship conference you criticised the Australian Government for its **immigration** policy on 2 scores.

* and (3) The High Commissioner and  Mr Maudling,  the previous Home Secretary, have had several talks during the last 2 years about Australians entering the United Kingdom particularly when the British Government's **immigration** legislation was being drawn up.

* On 12th May 1972, on behalf of the 6 Agents-General, the High 
Commissioner wrote to  Mr M audling  about the administration of the British **Immigration** Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by **immigration** officers at ports of entry.

* I am informed that the High Commissioner is to have a meeting with  Mr Carr  on 19th October 1972. 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on S April 1978: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The new matters that had not been debated before in the Association dealt, first with the problem of race relations.

* For the first time Australia's **immigration** policies were not criticised at an international level.

* Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by family planning and birth control measures, and that if family planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian **immigration** programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood.

* During the last days of the previous session I asked the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  whether he would call for a re-evaluation of our **immigration** policy in the light of doubts expressed across the broad spectrum of public opinion as to its efficacy.

* However, one extraordinary response came from an unexpected quarter in an article which appeared in the 'Bulletin' of 8th August under the heading The Great **Immigration** Cave-in'.

* This incredibly illinformed, unresearched, deliberately misleading and mischievous article, the author of which not surprisingly preferred to remain anonymous, referred to questioners of the sacred cow of **immigration** as 'a melange of academics, commentators and low ranking politicians'.

* This unknown author dismissed our fears of overcrowded cities, pollution, lack of conservation, inadequate social services and shortage of schools and hospitals as just a matter of planning and priorities, entirely ignoring the fact that had there been this sort of planning and priorities the debate about **immigration** may never have commenced.

* The article concluded by quoting representatives of migrant organisations who publicly welcome the inquiry announced recently by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  but who in private are said to be 'incredulous, scornful, angry and disgusted' by what they regard as an attack on immigrants.

* 1 have been greatly heartened by the announcement by the Minister for **Immigration** that he proposes a comprehensive investigation into the effects of **immigration**, ils aims and objects.

* I understand that the survey proposed by the Department will include a cost benefit analysis of **immigration**, desirable populations levels for Australia and the effect that increased **immigration** will have on our environment and urban problems.

* The Minister is to be complimented on his response to recent public disquiet over the effect of **immigration**, lt is a measure of his flexibility and sensitivity that he has been prepared to initiate such a comprehensive inquiry.

* I would also like to thank him for the courtesy he has shown me by inviting me to discuss with him privately my reservations about **immigration**.

* 1 have a strong suspicion that it may be not as objective an analysis as it should be but an attempt to prove that increased **immigration** is desirable, lt would have been better, in my view, if the analysis were done by a body of experts outside the Department.

* Ardent advocates of increased **immigration** have been quick to rush to the defence of the present policy and have actually called for the Government to up the ante.

* Organisations such as the Chambers of Manufactures, which have never been known for their humanitarian concern for the plight of the under-priviliged, nor for that matter for anything but their own profits, have been in the forefront of those urging increased **immigration**.

* The hysterica] outbursts of late by the traditional supporters of the Liberal Party - the employers' organisations - against unions, blaming them, together with over-full employment, for the inflationary spiral, is hardly conducive to an objective assessment of our **immigration** policy.

* I hope that this survey will allow us lo examine more closely the cost of **immigration**.

* Estimates, outside the direct cost of $77m that the Department of **Immigration** has budgeted for, are so varied as to make any effective analysis or final evaluation little more than guesswork.

* In 1945 when the then Minister for **Immigration**, the Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced a programme to bring migrants to Australia in vast numbers the population of Australia was a little over 7 million.

* To fully understand my reasons for seeking a review of the **immigration** policy 1 think we need to examine the basic philosophies behind the present policies to see if they are still valid for Australia of the 1970s.

* As one whose prime motivation in entering politics was to try to break down the prejudices between peoples of different race, religion, class, colour, culture and nationalities, 1 regard the new broadening of the Australian's attitude towards people who are different as the greatest single contribution by the **immigration** policy.

* Mr Deputy Speaker,  you may well ask: If I am so enamoured of our past programme of **immigration** why then am 1 now questioning that same policy?

* **Immigration** would probably argue that the Government no longer puts forward this theory as one of the reasons for continued and expanded **immigration**.

* The final argument against any slowdown or cut back in **immigration** is based on the 'economies of scale of production theory'.

* What those who ask for a re-examination want is not necessarily an end to **immigration** but an end to open ended programmes without goals or objectives.

* Why was the economy allowed to deteriorate to this point when the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has been estimating for months that unemployment would rise as much as it has.

* Why was no action taken when the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** wrote to the Treasurer urging a change of course?

* My constituent,  Mr Noel  Ginn of Universal Street, Eastlakes, asked me to raise a matter which concerns **immigration**.

* I mentioned it to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who I think may be here later.

* This requires heavy investment in social overhead capital - housing, services, roads, schools and hospitals - although it is often overlooked that **immigration** also increases the total resources available for investment.

* Many economists argue that we could improve our standard of living by cutting back the **immigration** intake.

* Not only does **immigration** make possible technical and financial economies of scale; it also provides us with a more flexible, mobile and adaptable work force; it generates new skills, know-how and entrepreneurship; and it acts as a spur to technological innovation.

* R. F. X. Connor, and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, The  Hon.

* On 9 July the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said that the Minister would land the money.

* The Department of Labor and **Immigration** has opened an office in the same area, as has the Department of Social Security.

* -The allocation for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs appears to be one of the very few areas which does not seem to have suffered from the severe cutbacks in the recent Budget.

* I can understand the smile on the face of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, and why he is feeling very pleased with himself.

* Convinced that increased population is vital to the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding **immigration** programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* It now merely supports an **immigration** policy which is administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance, which shall include the avoidance of discrimination on any grounds of race or colour of skin or nationality.

* The Labor Party not only wants to cut **immigration** but also to limit the natural growth of the Australian population.

* The Committee sees merit in a transfer of responsibility for an expanded special work projects scheme from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and has recommended accordingly.

* The transfer of the scheme to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** will involve a necessary increase in staff in the Aboriginal employment sections of that Department.

* The failure of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to uphold the 30 year agreement by Australian Governments to maintain full employment.

* I therefore ask the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  who is the Minister assisting the Treasurer and is in charge of the Bill, why this promise has not been fulfilled.

* The history of the matter dates from 28th October 1966 when I received an answer to the following question: 
Only yesterday, the Minister for Housing who, by an ironical coincidence, currently is acting also as Minister for **Immigration**, was good enough to send to me a circular advising - to use her own words 'with pleasure' - that Australia was set this year to exceed the migrant intake target of 175,000.

* For example, Western Australia in the past 4 years has had an average 7.5% of the Australian population but an average migrant intake of 13.18.% In this situation, already strained for accommodation and already subject to the heavy disproportionate migrant intake, comes this crunch on the activity of the building industry in Western Australia and a drop in construction of approvals of 45.% 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and relates to the Asians who have been ordered to leave Uganda and the suggestion that Britain may approach Australia to accept some of these people.

* The formula which will implement the new **immigration** policies was endorsed and will come into operation in all States.

* The final point I make is that the meeting was so useful that it was decided to hold a further conference of Australian Government and State Ministers for **Immigration** in November.

* The speech of the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  was what I would describe, again in colloquial terms, as a lead balloon.

* In fact, I suggest that by innuendo he accepts that the Government and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have done a very fine job indeed.

* An Australian **immigration** officer was located in Damascus in April and action was taken to strengthen **immigration** representation in Cyprus.

* In May 1976-1 am going through the historyspecial staffing arrangements were made at Australian posts in Athens, Nicosia, Cairo and Ankara and an Australian **immigration** officer was attached to the staff of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Damascus.

* In June, the Government decided that a more rapid service could be given to Lebanese applicants by transferring the **immigration** officer in Damascus to the Australian High Commission in Nicosia.

* In September 1976 the Minister announced that a senior officer would be sent to Nicosia to report on the most effective way in which Lebanese **immigration** to Australia could be organised.

* The Coast Guard Service could appropriately be placed under the control of the Department of Customs and Excise with provisions for adequate liaison with other relevant departments, for example those departments responsible for health, fisheries, **immigration** and rescue services.

* A newspaper report there dealt with the fact that the customs and **immigration** officials learned of the plot to smuggle the Chinese into Australia and they acted as a result of the information they received.

* I refer to a recent report in the 'Sunday Mail' of 12th March this year which stated: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I promise the Leader of the House that my comments will be brief because I know we have a difficult timetable to keep.

* **Immigration** has thrown a great burden on the States and on education in particular.

* I rise to bring before the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  an immediate problem in regard to the Chester Hill Public School which is adjacent to the Villawood migrant hostel.

* I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I refer to the Minister's statement which indicated a reduction of about 10,000 in this year's **immigration** target.

* What is the estimated saving in the cost of the  **immigration** programme this financial year as a result in the reduction of numbers?

* In view of the reduction this year is it to be taken that the Government proposes drastically to curtail the **immigration** programme for the year 1971-72?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1978: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I claim to have been misrepresented.

* On page 3 of today's  Australian  there is an article reporting the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  the Federal Opposition's spokesman on **immigration**, as saying that a Federal Government report critical of migrant education had been virtually suppressed and quoting the migrant newspaper  La Fiamma  as describing the report as 'the gravest scandal in migrant history'.

* In other areas we have been able to prove- I ask honourable members opposite to look at the  Hansard  for Estimates Committee B- the enormous conflict between the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs about the criteria being used for allowing migrants to come into this country.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has now taken over.

* **Immigration** under the Entrepreneur Policy  (Question No.

* I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs  (Mr Adermann)  who is listening to this debate would say that there is, in fact, very little difference in what the shadow Minister for **Immigration** has been saying about the way the Australian Government ought to respond to refugees and what the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  himself has been saying.

* The last thing I want to say is that under the **immigration** programme we have placed a tremendous burden on the States and on local government.

* The honourable member for Corangamite made it clear that we certainly wanted that, but, as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in his second reading speech, we also want a great deal more.

* My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to that recently answered by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Aside from the matters which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has mentioned what does the honourable gentleman, now looking back, say to this increasing number of trade unionists to explain why this country today has a level of inflation unprecedented in recent years?

* What does the honourable gentleman say to those hundreds of thousands of school leavers - 
I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is it a fact that members of the Japanese Government economic mission in Perth recently indicated that the future of Japanese investment in Australia's development of raw materials and industry may depend to a great extent on Australian **immigration** policies?

* Yesterday in this House the administration of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and the nature of assistance being provided to help Australia's record numbers of unemployed, were canvassed.

* With unemployment at a level of 3 1 1 000, even though the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  might foreshadow there may be some reduction in the present month, there is still no reason for complacency by the Government.

* I refer now to the opening of the post in Damascus, which is the thrust of the question so far as **immigration** is concerned.

* Should a decision be taken to reopen that post, following the report that I receive from  Mr Starey,  the officer who was left in charge of Beirut, we will of course expedite the entry of Australian **immigration** personnel, and the diplomatic officials would follow later on.

* What I would stress is that that stance in monetary policy was not a measure adopted to counter emerging inflation, which just dropped down from heaven or came in by ripples from another shore, as it was put by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the delinquent but compliant Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for **Immigration**) - I wish to make a personal explanation.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: 
A matter involving such political considerations deserves the continuing interests of all Australians.

* The increase in our labour resource by **immigration**, announced recently by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  at 180,000 this year, is regarded as the greatest rate of increase which this country can satisfactorily absorb.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I want to take the statement by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  at its face value and forget party politics completely.

* Taking his offer at its face value- one could do nothing other than that when one looks at that gentle, caressing, Celtic countenance of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**- I would suggest that proposed new section 133A (5) gives almost total power to the Registrar of the Federal court.

* It was explained that, prior to the migrant education function being transferred to my Department, the Migrant Action Committee had sought funds for the salary of a full-time coordinator for its home-tutoring program from the Minister for **Immigration** and subsequently the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and that the request has not been approved as such an appointment would normally be made to the State Department of Education as part of the co-ordinated home tutor scheme rather than to an organisation operating independently of it.

* It has been suggested that on this side of the chamber there is some desire to curtail the **immigration** scheme which was launched so magnificently a generation ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell).

* That **immigration** scheme has added  2i  million people to our community.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** opposed quite vigorously the industrial court legislation of the Liberal-Country Party Government when he was in Opposition with his colleague, the then honourable member for East Sydney.

* At the same time as the then honourable member for East Sydney was growing old, the honourable member for Hindmarsh, the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, was having his own fight with the Australian Workers Union.

* One of the tragedies of the honourable member for Hindmarsh is that he has carried that fight into the Parliament as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
At the present time the AIS has 11 officers serving in Asia, fifteen in Europe, six in the Americas and two in the Pacific.

* A very good example of this occurred last year when  Mr Grassby,  the then Minister for **Immigration**, visited the Philippines and told them that the White Australia policy was dead and buried.

* Within days not only something like 40,000 Filipinos were at the gates of the Australian Mission but also there was a similar situation in Rangoon where there were 10,000 Burmese beating at the gates of the Australian Mission and Australian **immigration** application forms were being sold in the streets of Rangoon.

* The explanation for this Bill is not contained in the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  but rather in the ministerial statement made by him on 22 August 1979- or should I say that in that statement we find the excuse for this Bill.

* It seems to me that the real justification for this Bill is to raise money to offset increased expenditure on **immigration** services.

* The Australian Information Service has assumed responsibility for **Immigration** publicity functions and 27 journalists were transferred from the former Department of **Immigration** (9 overseas, 18 in Australia).

* I need only instance the migrant education program operated through the Department of **Immigration** and the provision of $16m for this purpose.

* This happened to me with an **immigration** matter.

* A youngster was virtually made to stay at a school because of some interpretation of the policy of the Department of **Immigration** - a ridiculous situation.

* One must feel very sympathetic for the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* I only hope that the terms of the speech put down by the Minister for **Immigration** receive very wide coverage throughout his electorate so that his position can be well judged.

* I wish to take the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  up on one point.

* The answer by the Minister for **Immigration** is not acceptable to me.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I would need an hour to state the situation.

* Take the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  an outstanding orator with great knowledge of industrial relations, forthright with unions and employers, who in every way gives an inspiring example of what should be done by Ministers of integrity and honesty.

* I move: 
Was it in accordance with Government policy for the then Minister for **Immigration** in April 1970 to attend a meeting celebrating the anniversary of Croatian independence.

* I bring visitors to my room and show them the little 8 ft by 8 ft room that I used to share with the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* Honourable members can imagine what it is like being left in one small room with the Minister for **Immigration**, who used to turn his radio on full blast, had an 1810 typewriter which he used and would have 3 Italian visitors from his electorate drinking wine while I was supposed to be preparing a speech for the next day.

* My colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and I are in close touch on this matter.

* It will be recalled that I countered by reporting to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  under whose control the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  comes, the way that a Queensland lady felt following the claim of the Commissioner that in Japan the Japanese are taught that all Australians are racist.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has written to me, informing me- his letter is dated 22 September- that under the Racial Discrimination Act such inquiries are to be made only by the Commissioner himself.

* The letter goes on to state: 
Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  because he and his colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  have done more in the last few months for the Australian building industry than the Opposition did in a quarter of a century.

* It has taken this Minister for Housing and Construction and the current Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to get the co-operation of those unions and the employers to train and retrain people in the industry.

* I want to deal with just one of the points raised by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* The argument of the Minister for **Immigration** that the whole thing was ironed out by what happened in the informal arbitration proceedings before  Mr Justice  Mason is completely fallacious.

* The House may recall that even before the Attorney-General made his statement in the Senate I took the opportunity to ask the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  to give an undertaking, firstly, that no naturalised Australian citizen would be deported, and secondly, that even nonnaturalised Australian citizens convicted of some crime would not be deported to any totalitarian country if they had some political reasons to fear a return to that country.

* The Minister for **Immigration** gave that undertaking.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I have not had any direct discussions with the Victorian Minister of **Immigration** or his officers since the meeting of the State Ministers some time ago.

* AH the State Ministers for **Immigration** will be meeting in Adelaide on 9 November and any of the matters that call for co-operation will be dealt with there.

* -A few days ago an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council,  Mr Jim  Kaldis, claimed that the Government's **immigration** policy was discriminatory and in particular that it discriminated against people coming to Australia from Greece.

* Mr Kaldis  took the figures for the last financial year, as published in the report of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, and claimed that these figures showed that the new points system that has operated from 1 January was discriminatory.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  made a certain number of points when he made a statement a few weeks ago- a very courageous statement- which put to the Australian people the realities of the position facing us.

* He said that if we were to try to achieve the pre- 1 974 situation in the labour market, we would be looking towards an increasing labour force as a result of **immigration** of some 20,000 people a year, a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates, which is considerably below what it is now, no change in the participation of young people and education in the work force, respectively, and no normal additional participation following an increase in the demand for labour.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Problems are always created when differing races are thrown together by circumstances and the problem is not unique to South Africa.

* We are all aware of the position in Britain and America and this is the reason that previous Australian governments, including Labor governments, have maintained a restricted **immigration** policy.

* Of course, the present Hawke-Whitlam axis has changed Labor's policy in this regard and Australians may well have similar problems if a Labor government with an open door **immigration** policy ever comes to power.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I seek leave to make a statement on the matter referred to by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* If so, does the Taxation Department liaise with the **Immigration** Department to ensure that these persons are traced.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-Having listened to my good friend the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  sickening us on many occasions, I trust that he will have the decency to listen and so learn something about one of our very great rural industries, about which he knows nothing and cares less.

* The Green Paper on **immigration** policy and Australia's population tabled by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 17 March stated: 
I did see reports, particularly in the Melbourne  Age,  of remarks which were attributed to my colleague the Minister for Productivity.

* I have never advocated an **immigration** program which at this stage would result in a large number of semi-skilled and unskilled people being brought to Australia.

* If the honourable member discusses the matter with my colleague I think he will find that my colleague and I are in very great agreement as to the sort of **immigration** program Australia needs at this stage.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has been talking about them.

* Under the Migration Act a person may be deported only if he is a prohibited immigrant, he is an alien or a migrant who has been convicted of a serious offence or he is an alien or migrant whose conduct has been such that, in the opinion of the Minister for **Immigration**, he ought not to be allowed to remain in Australia.

* He was chairman of the **Immigration** Advisory Committee.

* It is not generally known that he went overseas virtually to hand pick the ships which were to bring the first migrants to Australia under the great plan of Arthur Calwell when he initiated the **immigration** program.

* 1 apologise to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  representing the Minister for 
I shall address myself to one aspect of the estimates for the Postal and Telecommunications Department and that is ethnic radio.

* In the House on 23 March the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  stated: 
No one was very happy with that suggestion because no one likes to have this sort of uncertainty hanging over him.

* There was the incorporation of ethnic radio into the Australian Broadcasting Commission, an organisation already reeling under the indiscriminate savagery of this mean-minded penny-pinching Treasurer, the individual who determines not only the policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs but also the policy of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* It may be, as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs maintained in this House on 16 September, that some 250 submissions from individuals and ethnic groups were received, but the Minister completely begged the question when he went on to state that these submissions with very few exceptions recommended that ethnic radio be funded by the Government.

* It is to the credit of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and he also advocated this alternative.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on 16 September guaranteed that ethnic communities would be given access to the programming and direction the programs should take.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether his attention has been drawn to the case of an American,  Mr James  O'Leary, his wife and 13 children, who entered Australia on a 2-day visitors' visa and who are now living on their broken-down boat which is moored in a Queensland swamp.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** been drawn to the statement made at the annual meeting of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd on 1,1 September by the company's  chairman, Sir Ian  McLennan in which he said that the Federal Government had decided to allow BHP to resume its overseas recruiting campaign?

* I refer the Minister to a statement which he made on 22 May in which he said that the needs that had been put forward by such companies as BHP had been referred for consideration as part of the recommendations being formulated by the **Immigration** Planning Council on the level of intake for next year.

* However, it was answered by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  following a short conversation on the front bench.

* The Minister for **Immigration** went on to say: 'We asked them what they were doing here.

* For 25 years there has been no funda- mental dispute concerning the principles underlying Australia's **immigration** policy.

* They were first enunciated by the present right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  by successive Ministers for **Immigration** and by every Government since 1945.

* The tragedy is that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and his influential, intellectual friends, among them the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  have proposed a complete - even if disguised - overturning of the principles of **immigration**.

* In January this year  Mr Dunstan  stated without any equivocation whatsoever: 
It is perfectly clear, and undeniable, that these men played a leading role in the formulation of the policy on **immigration**, a policy on which they want an inquiry and a policy that was adopted by the Launceston Conference only weeks ago by 44 votes to one.

* Let me state the **immigration** philosophy which has been rejected, and I quote from Hansard of 2nd August 1945 what the present right honourable member for Melbourne, the first Minister for **Immigration**, said.

* He said: 
**Immigration** is, at best, only the counterpart of the most important phase of population building, natural increase.

* The Leader of the Opposition and his new shadow Minister for **Immigration** now propose its submergence.

* These completely new **immigration** principles are merely another way of saying in migration first come, first served.

* All I can say is that the Leader of the Opposition either deliberately misrepresented the position because he was in a hot seat or he has a deplorable knowledge of **immigration** trends.

* Every country surely has the right to a substantial control of its own **immigration** policy.

* uncontrolled and risky **immigration** policy.

* These were the very characteristics of **immigration** to Australia in the late nineteenth century - in Queensland we know it - and to Britain in the 1960s.

* Every Australian Minister and shadow Minister for **Immigration** has, until now, pressed the desire for a socially cohesive, homogeneous community.

* The honourable member for Grayndler,  (Mr Daly),  who a short time ago was 'axed' as the shadow Minister for **Immigration**, and more especially the right honourable member for Melbourne, who was Australia's father of **immigration**, have always followed and believed in those principles.

* An **immigration** policy followed by successive governments - both Labor and Liberal-Country Party- 
An **immigration** policy followed by successive governments - both Labor governments and Liberal-Country Party governments - and a policy which has served this country well, would be totally repudiated, and that is the intention.

* The great tragedy is that these new principles which have been enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition and followed by some- 
Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of a report that Australia's $25,000 a year community relations officer,  Mr Grassby,  claims that he is handling more than 300 problems a week from troubled migrants?

* Does he have any authority to take any actions not available to other public servants, particularly those in the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, who continually deal with the problems of migrants?

* As my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has pointed out, people who are now entering the workforce may well need re-training several times during their working life.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I was very interested in the remarks of the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman).

* I agree with a number of remarks he had to say regarding **immigration**.

* My electorate has a large migrant population and problems are often placed before me which are forwarded on to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and his Department.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I address my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Unquestionably, his greatest mark on today's Australia is the **immigration** program he pioneered.

* He spent 4 years as Australia's first **Immigration** Minister and established a program which succeeding Ministers have been proud to continue.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs a question which concerns his Press statement of 2 1 May announcing that Australian residents can now sponsor the **immigration** of their parents even if the parents are not dependent upon them and are outside the acceptable occupational categories.

* An argument we used to hear frequently, and still do, about **immigration** was that we must have an **immigration** programme so we will have people to do our work.

* I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of **Immigration** of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of child welfare.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Over the next period- let us hope that it will be no longer than five years- the people of Norfolk Island, through their elected representatives, will be able to control most of the things that affect their daily lives.

* For instance, in relation to **immigration** Norfolk Island must not become a back door to Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  remains a point of conjecture.

* He has been given recently the position of shadow Minister for **Immigration** and so he is determined to see that a job is created for him in the unlikely event of the Opposition Parties attaining government - I do not blame him for putting up these phoney arguments in respect of a department of which, one day, he hopes he will be the Minister.

* Long before that unhappy day comes he will find that the present Department of Labor and **Immigration** has been so well integrated and will be working so well that to give him the portfolio that he is striving to obtain would be to create enormous chaos and impose upon the migrants unnecessary hardships and disadvantage.

* To process the application requires the establishment of an **immigration** team, including medical personnel, to travel to the camps and to assess the people on the spot.

* It is not possible to deal with the nominations received from people in Australia as one would deal with a normal **immigration** sponsorship.

* Leaflets in these languages will be available at overseas posts and offices of my Department in Australia by the time the revised **immigration** categories and procedures come into effect on 1 January 1979.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* We face the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  across the House.

* believe that the general approach we have made to **immigration** has been fairly effective but that our most miserable failure has been in the way we have approached particularly :he children who have arrived here as a result of the migration scheme.

* There can be no denying that **immigration** is an absolute Commonwealth responsibility.

* I am putting this on the record and  1  hope that the Minister for **Immigration**, Treasury officials and all the other people concerned take notice of it.I know it is probably not the Minister's fault.

* - Mr Speaker, earlierI was discussing the **Immigration** (Education) Bill and the Opposition's proposal that the Government should have made provision for capital works.

* **Immigration** programmes must, of course, always be responsive to changing circumstances, and against the circumstances recently outlined to this House by the Prime Minister the **immigration** programme has in fact been modified.

* Many thousands, indeed millions, from other countries have found homes here, have contributed greatly to the economic strength of Australia, added to our cultural heritage and made this a much better nation as a result of their **immigration** or the **immigration** of their grandfathers, relatives or forebears to this country.

* -My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I simply conclude by commenting on some points made the other night by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  about **immigration** and migrant education in Wollongong.

* It was not opened by the previous Government, and I can assure the honourable member for Cunningham that the volume of **immigration** in the last two years has not been so dramatic that the situation has changed monumentally in Wollongong.

* The Minister Assisting the Treasurer is my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  who has been sitting in the House.

* I thought that the honourable member for Dawson would have been aware that the Minister for **Immigration** is also the Minister Assisting the Treasurer.

* It is a little sad to see the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  this once socalled gladiator of the ordinary working man and woman and of the trade union movement acting as an apologist and making excuses for the Government's appalling policy in allowing 5.2 per cent of Australia's population to become unemployed.

* It is all right for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to espouse the international situation and to talk about how the ripples come across the water and effect Australia.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was the man who led the Public Service in demanding increased wages and all types of conditions which put intolerable pressures on the rest of the community thus reducing its capacity to employ people.

* It is of no use for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to say that the Senate is the cause of this and that there is a threat of a possible double dissolution of the Parliament and another election.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has made plausible remarks about wanting to look after the work force.

* Nobody should be more ashamed of having let down the workforce and of having betrayed the trade union movement than the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who is sitting at the table.

* I have indicated that it is not normal practice to disclose the details of discussions that have taken place between Papua New Guinea and ourselves in this area and in relation to turning down, in consultation with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the request for asylum for those people who have now obtained asylum elsewhere.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** another question on Australia's restrictive **immigration** policy.

* The Australian Government is involved through the Department of **Immigration** in the adult education program at the Brunswick North Primary School.

* The Department of Education is involved though in a capacity of giving advice to the Department of **Immigration** in preparing learning and teaching materials, and it assists with teacher training.

* -The population of Australia and **immigration** into Australia is a vitally important topic.

* Because the long term future of this country is concerned with the population and **immigration** problem and with other problems such as the energy problem, I rise with a heavy heart because in the short time in which I have been a member of this House I have not seen an example of the way in which the programs and procedures of the House can be perverted to match what we have seen tonight from the Opposition.

* I have in mind that an imaginative distribution of programmes such as these might well have some appeal for the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Snedden).

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1978: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Is government **immigration** policy designed to prevent a person who was established to have been an anti-Jewish propagandist and a Nazi collaborator during the Second World War and who was regarded as a war criminal by the Government of Yugoslavia and the War Crimes Documentation Centre in Vienna from entering Australia?

* I thank the honourable gentleman for his gracious welcome to me and to my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** when we visited Ballarat yesterday.

* -My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* If the committee's report has not been presented to the Government, why has the Government gone ahead with major restructuring of migrant services, including the transfer of the telephone interpreter service, the Outreach program and migrant services sections from the Department of Social Security to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, before receiving a report which presumably would be advising the Government on these very matters?

* Can the Minister for **Immigration** reconcile his policy of an increased migrant intake in the next financial period with the published opinions of his colleague the Minister for the Environment and Conservation that Australia must limit its population growth?

* Is it a fact that the present policies of the Minister for **Immigration** are helping to exert extreme pressures on the environment, as stated by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation in an extensive paper published recently in the national Press under the heading 'Staunch the Migrant Flow'?

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the basic reasons for the introduction of Australia's excellent **immigration** policy by the Chifley Labor Government in 1946 and continued by successive Liberal governments, are considered by many people to be no longer applicable to Australia in the 1970s?

* Will his Government bring down a white paper on **immigration** so that a cost-benefit evaluation of assisted **immigration**, now estimated at being between $500m and SI, 000m.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I address my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* A number of migrants in my electorate have contacted me indicating that they believe that if the migrant task force is permitted to operate in a positive way without simply becoming a rubber stamp for the Department of **Immigration** it will offer a great service to migrants in general.

* The question was directed to the Minister for **Immigration** but naturally it concerns my Department.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and I would not have different views on what ought to be done in cases such as the one referred to by the honourable member.

* There is all the difference in the world in giving a Minister a right to answer a particular matter, such as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who may speak on the matter of **immigration** which is raised in the debate, and in providing for a Minister a period of 10 minutes in which to put on a political tirade against the Opposition or against someone else which normally would have been part of the adjournment debate.

* Following the great **immigration** intake, the great bulk of those immigrants went to the over-centralised cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  began by telling us how he was delighted to see migrants become wanted and valued members of the Australian community.

* If the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs were concerned about these matters he would be concerned about migrants- particularly women migrants- who go to hospitals, who speak no English and who find no translators to translate their requirements to the staff.

* for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Well, I am using the honourable member's own words.

* I heard him answer a question from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is at the table.

* I should like to turn now to some of the things that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said in introducing this Bill on 25 July.

* Rather than the Minister being prepared to face the prospect of a double dissolution on that Bill by presenting it again in its entirety- 
Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch I was about to deal with some of the remarks made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** when introducing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No.

* At page 652 of Hansard he is reported as stating: 
The Minister at the table, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, says that this is what this Bill is aiming to do.

* In an earlier speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 21 March 1974, when he introduced the same Bill into the House, he said: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 September 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that the Australian office in Cyprus is refusing to issue visitor visas to legitimate tourists seeking to visit Australia?

* I am authorised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  to say that if the honourable member wishes it the Minister will be happy to have consultation with him.

* The Minister and I would meet with the honourable member together with representatives from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to consider this and any other matters he wishes to raise.

* I have seen reports in today's newspapers which carry a statement from the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs alleging that Australia is laundering the entry of Rhodesians via South Africa.

* The Opposition spokesman seems to be at a loss to understand the fact that those people coming from the camps in Malaysia and Thailand are put through the process by **immigration** officers and are given resident status.

* It is likely that pasengers arriving at Tullamarine Airport on BOAC Flight 812A on 5 September may have taken up to two hours to complete customs and **immigration** formalities.

* When the tour folded they suddenly discovered **immigration**.

* I think I am right in saying that 12 months ago I was probably one of the first in this Parliament to question **immigration**.

* I asked the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr Gorton,  a question about it, and at that time he said he was shocked to hear that a member of the Labor Party was questioning **immigration**.

* In the last 12 months the whole of our community has been questioning **immigration**.

* We have not said categorically that **immigration** is bad.

* What we are asking for now is that there be a breathing space so that we can have another look at where we are going in **immigration**.

* I think one of the best contributions made this evening was that made by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  because he sees the weaknesses and the strengths in **immigration**.

* It is  a  moderate approach towards **immigration**.

* I desire to ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question.

* Now that the question of an **immigration** policy is seen more in the context of Australia's manpower and economic programmes as well as part of the overall view of population growth and decentralisation, I ask whether the Government has in its long term planning considerations given any attention to long term population targets?

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
If we measure the contribution we find that Hawke was responsible for achievement while the Minister was hoping to aggravate the situation as part of the plot of the Government to try to create industrial affairs as a major election issue.

* The Minister for **Immigration** who interjects, but who, without any conscience or without any sense of moral responsibility, has tried to inject crude racism into the impending election campaign centred about **immigration** policy.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 

 - Mr Deputy Speaker, what we have just heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  is one of the most damaging indictments of Australian Labor Party policy on **immigration** that I have ever heard.

* I would have thought that if we were going to talk about **immigration** it would have been the shadow Minister for **Immigration** who would have raised the matter.

* Perhaps he is going to take over the **immigration** portfolio.

* Let us look at this total **immigration** intake because it bears close scrutiny if we are to analyse just exactly what goes on.

* On the other hand, the immediate effects of **immigration** might be to raise the unemployment numbers in particular categories of labor.

* The general evidence from Australia 's own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that **immigration** does not - 
In practice, high **immigration** has been associated with booming economies.

* It can be argued that the economic booms cause the **immigration**, not vice versa, But, it is clear that the migrant flows did not destroy the booms.

* My own view is that increased **immigration** at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits.

* The Opposition's **immigration** policies are unclear.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
Does the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** still say, as he did in his letter of 27 June, that the Government's economic policies will cause unemployment?

* Has the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Overseas Trade - the  Deputy  Prime Minister - yet convinced the Prime Minister of the probability, if not the certainty, of unemployment as a result of Government policies?

* Is that the reason for the reintroduction of import licensing for certain industries as it was announced yesterday which was, I think, point 4 in the policy matters proposed by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in his letter which the Prime Minister claims to know nothing about?

* I appreciate that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is now at the table may not know that.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** prepared to go along with the permission which the Minister who was at the table a moment ago granted?

* A major investigation into the departure of former settlers was undertaken by the Social Patterns Committee, of the **Immigration** Advisory Council during 1966/67.

* In September, 1971, I asked (he **Immigration** Advisory Council to undertake a further enquiry which is currently in progress.

* Where these investigations indicate that further changes should be made, new procedures will be implemented to ensure that the methods and standards employed by the Department of **Immigration** for the selection of immigrants are up to date, adequate and appropriate to Australia's needs.

* The procedure to be taken in such cases is that the Department of Housing and Construction refers the tenders concerned to 4 other advising departments- Treasury, Customs and Excise, Labor and **Immigration** and Manufacturing Industry- for their views as to whether or not the tender as recommended by the Department should be accepted.

* The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Carlton)  yesterday in his maiden speech, which we all thought was excellent, did venture his point of view that **immigration** may well be rapidly expanded in this country.

* That was borne out by the fact that it so dramatically cut **immigration** into this country.

* These include airport congestion, bad weather, airport curfews, unexpected industrial disputes, aircraft defects and even the operations of government authorities as some people have often experienced with **immigration** controls abroad.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Hasluck as the Minister for External Territories started removing adverse discriminations some of these people died hard.

* 1 think that the reality of the powers of the Minister for **Immigration** in Papua New Guinea may answer this.

* I hope that the Minister for **Immigration** would have as a reality in his hands, without it being an arbitary or damaging power, the right to allow or disallow continued residence because this is important for the maintenance of good race relations.

* There is no suggestion that I would seek to prevent the migration to Australia of people who meet Australia's **immigration** requirements but who cannot speak English.

* In fact, on 21 April this year, at a meeting between me and State Ministers concerned with **immigration**, a joint statement was issued which drew attention to the fact that English language ability was an important factor in successful settlement.

* At the end of that decision, for the first time since Federation and for the first time since the end of the Second World War when our great **immigration** program commenced, the  President  directed and found it necessary to order formally that his decision be printed in several languages, because he thought it proper that everybody affected by that decision should be able to read it and understand it.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Has his attention been drawn to reports today which suggest that the arrival of more than 130 Spanish migrants in Brisbane has given rise to fears by State Labor Party leaders and trade union leaders that Australia's **immigration** policy will aggravate the local employment situation there?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 May 1978: 
I ask the Foreign Minister a question which I have asked him and the Acting Minister 5 weeks and 8 weeks ago.

* The Sub-Committee on the Middle East of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has now reported that its  Chairman,  the honourable member for Fremantle, wrote on 24 August to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that there are strong humanitarian reasons for the re-establishment of a reasonably sized **immigration** team in Damascus and that he wrote on 1 October to the Foreign Minister concerning diplomatic representation in Damascus and aid to Lebanese refugees in Syria and Cyprus.

* I therefore ask: What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate facilities for processing **immigration** applications from persons fleeing from the Lebanon?

* **Immigration** for some time now have been consistently asking the Australian Bureau of Statistics to undertake a monthly survey of employment because they, like I, recognise the deficiency in the present figures.

* Neither the previous Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, nor I, are guilty of attempting to mislead this Parliament.

* So far as (d) is concerned, detailed statisticsin the form requested are compiled and published quarterly by the Bureau of Census and Statistics  and  by the Department of **Immigration**.

* Also, I believe we would have to consider, as referred to earlier by the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  the proposition that we would have to look at some of our **immigration** quotas and decide what is the **immigration** target we need most of all in order to integrate migrant intake with the other aspects of our economic planning.

* On 22 May 1977 the Government decided to establish an advisory body to advise the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on refugee policy and operations.

* This body is the standing interdepartmental committee on refugees, comprising senior officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs (which chairs the committee), Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social Security, Finance, Health and Education, with other departments and the Public Service Board being co-opted as necessary.

* Frankly, I am pleased that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKelllar)  in his second reading speech did stress that if we are going to control our environment the only way we can control it is by a spirit of co-operation.

* I think that cooperation has to occur between the Australian 
I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* When I returned to my office on Monday, 2 September, at about 9 a.m. my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  rang me in Newcastle in relation to this matter and put to me the proposition that we should have a royal commission.

* It is the wish of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and myself that this matter be fully investigated and exposed.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  knows, as we all know, that there is a sweetheart agreement.

* I have not heard that there has been any difficulty in arranging postings for officers of the Department of **Immigration** on that score.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Firstly, there has been a quite deliberate attempt by this Government to prevent adequate debate on matters that involve its own Ministers in a disgraceful and corrupt practice.

* The charges are fairly against the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  and fairly against the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* It is especially important since there has been complete silence from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for a period of 6 to 8 weeks- silence over a much longer period, possibly over a year, if the allegations of  Mr Elliott  of the Seamen's Union are correct.

* Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** an opportunity to clear their names in relation to this matter.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said quite plainly that the only thing wrong with the extortion, with the indemnity payments, was the direction of the funds.

* That again emphasises the need for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to clarify these matters.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled'Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic' delivered by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 1 7 September 1 972.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Migration Bill 1973 introduced by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is strongly supported by the Opposition parties.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  says: 'Like **immigration**?'

* The **immigration** power was given to the Commonwealth at Federation for very good reasons, and the same considerations to which I am referring - the lack of contact at the local level, and the creation of a hospital system which is malleable and adjustable to individual circumstances and the felt needs of particular communities of people and particular areas - was one of the principal reasons why the hospital power was left with the States.

* Incidentally, I have heard of a huge and overwhelming reaction to the vicious comments made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I strongly suggest to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** not to set foot in that area for a long time to come, because he might come back- 
I inform the House that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, who left Australia yesterday to attend the second conference of South Pacific Labour Ministers being held in Auckland, will return on 29 November.

* In his absence the PostmasterGeneral,  Senator Bishop,  will act as Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Transport,  Mr Charles  Jones, will represent the Acting Minister in this House.

* 1 ) The **Immigration** Information Branch of the Australian Information Service prepared the booklet,  The Newcomer and the Law.

* The Department of Social Security became responsible for post-arrival services for migrants following the abolition of the former Department of **Immigration** in 1974 after work on the booklet had begun, and has therefore become nominally responsible for it.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* By way of preface, I should like to inform the House that when I was Minister for **Immigration**, information came to me and to my Department that heroin smuggled into Australia came principally via New Zealand.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is representing the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt)  in this chamber, has been gagged by the  Deputy  Government Whip.

* Has the level of **immigration** been adjusted because of economic circumstances in Australia.

* I ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I know that my colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, has done the same.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Does his Department render financial assistance to the States to provide low cost housing for migrants brought to this country by the Department of **Immigration**?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Several weeks ago I asked the Minister for **Immigration** a question regarding a racket involving illegal migrants from Colombia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1978: 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that it took a passenger one hour to pass through the **immigration** procedure at Tullamarine Airport, Vic, on Wednesday, 20 September 1978, at approximately 9 a.m.

* For instance, people who urgently need to be naturalised can expect to have their applications processed by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs within a reasonable period.

* The Opposition welcomes the signing of this Agreement which has been outlined in some detail by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr 
Lynch).

* The Agreement also represents, as the Minister has said, a completely new depature by the Government in furtherance of the **immigration** programme in that it is the first agreement with a Communist country.

* There has been and, I hope, generally will be full and constructive support of the **immigration** programme by both sides of the Parliament.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* In other words, does he believe that employers' participation in this vital part of our **immigration** program is being carried out?

* I present also a transcript of the conference held at Brisbane on 11 May 1973 between myself and State Ministers for **Immigration**.

* For the information of the House I would mention that the next conference of **immigration** Ministers will be held in Adelaide on 9 November 1973.

* 2) 1979 which introduces certain charges to recover some administrative costs currently being incurred by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Certainly the United Kingdom and the United States of America have adopted the practice of trying to recoup costs that it is possible to identify as being directly associated with a request from a person using the services of their **immigration** offices.

* When officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs are not present.

* It has adopted a new attitude towards **immigration**.

* During the remarks that I made last evening before the adjournment of the House I referred to an **immigration** inquiry as being a departmental inquiry.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  has advised me that that statement was incorrect.

* The Minister for **Immigration** is going and so is the Minister for the Media  (Senator Douglas McClelland).

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* In reply to a question the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said that he could think of a number of industries that would be candidates for the extension of public ownership.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-Will the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs outline the restrictions imposed by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on the appointment of teachers from overseas sources to independent schools in Australia?

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** aware that there is considerable anxiety among applicants for positions as multi-lingual welfare officers with the Department of **Immigration** at the delay in finalising the appointments?

* The **immigration** administration under the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has been a failure.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I preface my question which is to the Minister for **Immigration** by referring to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department off **Immigration** should operate a more effective system of screening and selection in order to limit the arrival of undesirable migrants.

* Will the Minister for **Immigration** give special consideration to the people who came to Australia on tourist visas under the policies of the previous Government because they were not eligible to apply for **immigration**?

* The Minister for Labour and National Service is representing the Minister for- **Immigration**.

* It was for that reason I ruled that the Minister was entitled to answer the question as he would have answered it had he been the Minister for **Immigration**.

* If the Department of Labour and **Immigration** has this information, it will be in a much better position to advise applicants for adult retraining as to what training will best guarantee their future security of employment.

* At any election for half the Senate, for the whole of the House of Representatives or for the whole of both Houses I have no doubt what the public will think when they are faced with a choice as Treasurer between  Mr Hayden  and  Mr Lynch,  when they are faced with a choice as Minister for Labor and **Immigration** between  Senator James  McClelland and the honourable member for Corangamite, and for Prime Minister between the present one and the aspirant.

* -The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will answer that question.

* My question, which I address to the Minister for **Immigration**, concerns the national population inquiry.

* I notice that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is at the table.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* -I think the question I answered, I answered on behalf of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, who was then ill.

* I will refer it to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Has the Minister heard or seen reports of statements by his colleague, the Minister for Productivity, about the attitude of employers towards **immigration** to Australia?

* Discussions have taken place between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Labor and' **Immigration**.

* Under the previous Government we saw excesses of spending on a multitude of feasibility studies and surveys; we saw a lack of consultation with people who were to be directly affected by growth centre proposals; we saw enormous increases in commitments on land purchases, as was just mentioned by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Is it a fact that illegal immigrants entering Australia now represent 10 per cent of the total planned annual net **immigration** rate?

* Does this not represent a substantial interference with the proper planning and administration of this country's **immigration** policies?

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I refer to a resolution adopted by the annual convention of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party that the Department of **Immigration** should operate a more effective system of screening and selection to limit the arrival of undesirable migrants.

* Would the Minister comment on this resolution and indicate- 
Does the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs know of any person or organisation giving advice to illegal immigrants not to come forward and seek permanent resident status during the current amnesty as this would lead to deportation?

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* What is the source of information and expressions of view included in the publication  For the Ethnic Media  issued by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs?

* It would be far better to stop **immigration** immediately, except to those people who have guaranteed employment or who are family dependents and do not affect in any way those persons who are in employment already, who are reuniting a family, or who are seeking employment in a restricted market.

* During the course of a personal explanation after question time yesterday, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  said that members of the Opposition had alleged that he had made a misstatement and was telling a lie in regard to the report of the Nimmo Committee.

* My remark referred to the context in which the Minister for **Immigration** made that statement which was in answer to a question which claimed that there was a multitude of inefficient and expensive socalled voluntary funds.

* I point out that the Nimmo Committee stressed that this multitude of funds is inefficient and costly particularly because of- 
i direct my question to the Minister for **immigration**.

* What is the present ratio of skilled workers in the **immigration** programme?

* -My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Has the Department of Labor and **Immigration** lifted its estimate of the number of unemployed next year from 400 000 to 450 000?

* The labour needs of Australian industry are the subject of continuing consultation with the Minister and Department of Labour the **Immigration** Planning Council (On which industry leaders and the trade unions are represented), State and other appropriate authorities.

* -Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware of newspaper reports recently that his Department is considering recommending an increase in **immigration** to Australia from 70 000 to 100 000 next year?

* according to answers given to me recently by the Minister for **Immigration** since 1966 2,500 of them have been granted permission to remain in Australia.

* The Minister for **Immigration** pointed out to me in a reply to a question that occasionally European parents working in Asian and Pacific countries wished to send their children to school in Australia while they are still too young for entry as migrants.

* If we applied this line of thinking to our **immigration** programme, it would mean that anyone who got off an aeroplane from England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland or wherever he may come from would be asked, when he reached the bottom of the gangplank: Does your country need you?'

* I ask the Minister for National Development  (Mr Swartz),  who is at the table, to convey these sentiments to the Minister for **Immigration** and to ask that in future he not differentiate between Asians and Europeans in this vital sphere.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** to confer with the authorities in New- South Wales to ensure that 2-year residencies are recognised as important and integral parts of their training in future.

* By contrast with this 40- strong branch in the Department of Social Security, the 'ethnic affairs' unit of the so-called Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs consists of a letterhead and about three or four officers rushing around getting in each other's way.

* Is this really a ploy to take migrant welfare out of that Department without the Minister's knowledge, so that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, with its four or five relevant officers, can establish a monopoly over ethnic affairs?

* Such a course of action would serve further to confuse migrants and the Public Service as to just who is responsible for ethnic affairs in this countrySocial Security or **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Perhaps the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar),  who represents the Minister for Social Security in this place, could enlighten us one of these days instead of leading migrants up the garden path and placing them in a situation where they have to rely on a letterhead and four or five officers to look after their needs in this country.

* We are not making any complaints about the efforts that have been made by officers in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs whether here or overseas.

* I give credit, as the honourable member for Melbourne did, to the officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs both locally and overseas.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-This question was raised with me originally in New Zealand in October last year when the New Zealand Prime Minister expressed concern about what he believed to be a possible exodus of Australians across the Tasman seeking employment in New Zealand, thus creating unemployment in that area.

* Since then I have had talks with the New Zealand Minister for **Immigration**.

* Neither category would be entitled to entry in the normal course of **immigration** procedures.

* In the face of that, there is one thing that can be said for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and that is that at least he is a trier.

* I wonder why when a debate of this kind is proceeding in the House on a Bill introduced at least for the third time by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** the honourable gentleman is not in the House.

* I notice that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has returned to the chamber.

* I wonder whether this is because it is thought that under the existing legislation amalgamation is too hard and whether those who might be parties to further amalgamations simply have been holding off in anticipation of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** eventually tiring out the Opposition and the Senate so that, at his fourth try, his legislation will be passed.

* The **Immigration** Planning Council at its meeting on 18 March 1974 considered the labour market situation at that time and recommended an **immigration** program for 1974-75 based on a gross settler arrival figure of 135,000 persons.

* His  case is currently being examined by the Depanment of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs with a view to considering his application for permanent residence.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) What programs does the Department of Labor and **Immigration** or statutory authorities under the Minister's control administer which enable individual groups or people in the community to apply for grants from the Australian Government for a specific purpose.

* What is the total amount of money paid out for all such programs administered by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** or authorities under his control.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and concerns refugees.

* asked the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
Department of **Immigration**: Offices in Canberra (Question No.

* The objective of the programme during the course of the next 12 months will be to hold the **immigration** programme at this favourable level.

* This programme was recommended by the Commonwealth **Immigration** Planning Council and is based upon an appreciation of Australia's national needs and objectives, the availability of suitable settlers for Australia and our capacity to effectively integrate those people who come here.

* Mr Deputy Chairman,  I suggest that the order for the consideration of the proposed expenditures agreed to by the Committee on 12 September be varied by postponing consideration of the proposed expenditures for the Department of **Immigration** and the Department of Labour.

* It should be noted that in 1974-75 and 1975-76 my Department incorporated functions of the present Department of **Immigration** but the **Immigration** figures have been excluded in the comparative table to facilitate a comparison of expenditures by my Department as it presently exists.

* as many recent immigrants have a moral obligation to support dependants, mainly parents, left behind for various reasons including Australia's **immigration** laws, will he reconsider the decision to abolish the rebate.

* I have attempted to ask during question time whether the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  intends to rectify the situation, but to date I have been unable to obtain the call.

* I ask the Acting Minister for **Immigration** whether he has interpreted a recent statement of public interest referring to **immigration** which says: 'the avoidance of any discrimination on any grounds of race or colour or nationality.'

* In fact, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  stomped around the countryside promising loans totalling $50m at 3 per cent interest to farmers.

* They will take advantage of the next poll to show their disapproval of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Government's position has been ably and capably defended by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and myself.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
Where and when have there been meetings of the **Immigration**.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* What would the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr MacKellar)  do if relevant information went from his Department to another department without his knowledge and without his concurrence?

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is there a serious sex imbalance in Australia's **immigration** program?

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) There has not been a meeting of **Immigration** Ministers since 4th December 1972.

* The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages in other areas such as health and **immigration**.

* Labor and **Immigration** make it available to the public?

* So that it can be known whether the copy of a letter which I hold in my hand is accurate and a correct fascimile of the letter from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, will the Treasurer undertake to table the letter?

* The Treasurer, the Ministers for Labor and **Immigration** and Manufacturing Industry, and additionally, in the case of SANMA applications, the Minister for Urban and Regional Development 
Quite recently a statement was made by  Sir Ian  McLennan of BHP that if the ship building industry was not profitable BHP did not feel that it had any responsibility for Whyalla.

* The majority of its work force has been recruited overseas, with the Federal Government making the major contribution to the cost through the Department of **Immigration**.

* Apart from that, there is a radical departure from previous policies in that there is a reduction in the overall **immigration** quota.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
I rise to support this Bill which was introduced by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant).

* I would also take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  on the removal the other day of the discriminatory sections dealing with Aboriginals that existed in the **Immigration** Act.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 April 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What steps have been taken to enable the migration programme to contribute to policies of regional development as indicated on page 38 of the statement on **Immigration** presented to the House of Representatives.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* 1019)  Mr Morris  asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1  June 1977: 
Since the introduction of the new **immigration** policy and NUMAS, substantial numbers of non-immediate relatives have been assisted in meeting the general **immigration** criteria by concessions in NUMAS for persons who are nominated or otherwise assisted by family members resident in Australia.

* I think it is fairly significant that this is the first Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** policies and population ever presented in the Federal Parliament.

* It is easy to think about **immigration** policy in relation to employment or unemployment, population, demographic distribution and a whole host of other things, but this is the first time it has brought these aspects together in a single document where the language is, I believe, easily understood and where the length of the document is not so great as to deter people from reading it.

* It was a significant feature of earlier times that the **immigration** policies of previous governments were conducted largely in a bipartisan fashion.

* Unfortunately, in my view, that situation changed in recent years but hopefully the debate today has restored some of the objectivity and some of the bipartisan nature of previous approaches towards **immigration** policy.

* I think that a common feature has been the understanding, realisation and expression of support for the marked changes which have occurred in Australia particularly as a result of the consistent large scale post-war **immigration** program.

* The change consists of a pronounced slowing of natural increase and low net and gross **immigration** rates.

* Under present circumstances, taking into account the fertility patterns which are emerging in Australia, **immigration** is likely to be the only controllable variable in the population growth rate.

* On the evidence that is before us at the moment the **immigration** variable is the only controllable variable that is available to governments in terms of population policies.

* In relation to this an **immigration** variable is significant in terms of placement of people as well as numbers.

* The labour force growth rate most likely will decline even with a medium **immigration** program.

* By a medium **immigration** program, I am talking about a net gain of SO 000 per year.

* It would obviously be too long a task to go through the contributions of each  speaker  but I note in passing that the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  who is the Opposition spokesman on **immigration**, attacked the proposition that Australia should look to higher population rates and attacked the proposition that we should be looking at net **immigration** rates of approximately 50 000 per year.

* In fact, very few honourable members who took part in this debate suggested that we should not continue with the **immigration** program or that we should not look to a greater population in this country.

* I believe that it will be even more successful if it brings about in the community at large a better understanding of the background to **immigration** policy development and as a result of the increased knowledge of that **immigration** policy development, a series of submissions to the Government which will reflect community views.

* As a result of that reflection of community views, the Government will be placed in a much better position to development **immigration** policies which will be acceptable to the nation as a whole and which will bring about the development of Australia, not just in the short term but, most importantly, in the medium and long term, of a size and of a nature which we would all support.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  will be speaking in this debate.

* This seemed to be something of a surprise to some of them because every time this kind of motion is launched by the Opposition, around the headlines of the world goes the suggestion from responsible people in Australia that we are racists, and then those who have not visited this country or studied our **immigration** laws get an impression.

* He said - he had not consulted the Government - that it was only the **immigration** laws that were racist.

* This is something that our own people tend to say, because in Ceylon  -  I have studied the **immigration** laws of Ceylon and other countries of the South East Asia area - I know that the **immigration** laws are a good deal harsher than are ours.

* This is one reason why NEAT is so maligned and one reason why the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, with the best will in the world, could not cope with the strains and demands placed upon it.

* I wish to make clear that the criticisms which I direct are not at the officers of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** but at the Government for making across the board tariff cuts of this magnitude and expecting NEAT to be able to cope.

* The policy has changed somewhat from that set out in a ministerial directive of 6 December 1974 when  Mr Clyde  Cameron was the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* This is one reason why we hear stories of one part of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** compensating employees and management for structural adjustment programs consequent upon tariff reforms and another part of the Department training people for jobs which have been rendered redundant because of the tariff reforms.

* In some cases I have raised them with the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and with the previous Minister.

* In my reply of 20th August 1970 to representations made to me on behalf of  Mr William  Martin by the honourable member for Calare I informed him that I would discuss with the Minister for **Immigration** the matter of the loss of German pension when the recipient becomes an Australian citizen.

* and (4) It is understood that in the course of discussions on a wide range of subjects, at Bonn in July 1969, an official of the West German Ministry of Labour requested the then Minister for **Immigration** to take up with the Australian Goverment the question of a social security agreement.

* **Immigration** is a subject which 1 have raised in the House.

* **Immigration** was a subject which was discussed in a seminar conducted by the Institute of Political Science in January.

* of the question of **immigration**.

* I was pleased to note that the Government planned to keep the **immigration** quota at 140,000 migrants for the coming year.

* Whereas the Leader of the Opposition has been most guarded and vague concerning Labor's policy on **immigration**, it must be remembered that he replaced his shadow Minister for **Immigration**, who is at present sitting at the table on the Opposition side, when he was expounding policies similar to the policy of the Government and that the Labor Premier of South Australia has made a call virtually to open the flood gates to non-European migration.

* We want to continue with a vigorous **immigration** programme for the benefit of Australia.

* My colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  I am glad to say, shares the same sort of views as I had when I held that office, namely, that the Government should do everything possible to put the migrant on the basis of being able to integrate into our community as painlessly as possible.

* My colleague the Minister for **Immigration** has put forward in this Budget a programme for migrant integration and social welfare services.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is any increase in the level of Iranian **immigration** contemplated by the Government.

* Here we come again to the impact of **immigration**.

* We have attempted in Australia, and I do not disagree with it, an increase in population through both **immigration** and natural growth which is an alltime record for any part of the world, or at least any part of what we might call the western democracies.

* If the honourable gentleman had listened yesterday to his senior colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland),  he would have heard that Minister say that unemployment in this country is now set for a peak which will be around 400 000.

* Why did it bring in a Bill that is wide enough to give me, as Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, the right to sack Brian Tregillis, the Deputy Head of the Department which, of course, I could do under this BDI?

* Further proof can be obtained from the report of Australia's **Immigration** Planning Council which is investigating **immigration** programmes for the period 1968-73.

* It would appear that the Minister is just as mixed up in the **immigration** problem.

* Indeed, we have seen the amiable colourful Minister when on his overseas tours successfully confuse the Australian people, our Asian friends, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the ACTU, as well as his own Prime Minister and Government on **immigration** policy.

* So much for Labor's ambivalent **immigration** policy.

* Then we have the question of the silence not only of the Minister for Transport who is principally culpable in this matter but also of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Significantly there is a letter that was sent to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 26 July.

* As a result of that letter there was no evidence of any kind of action or activity by the Minister for Transport or by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** until the matter inadvertently appeared in the Press in Melbourne about six or seven weeks later.

* However I would like to refer to one matter that the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  raised in relation to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* The Minister for **Immigration** did raise with me the question of the allocation to South Australia and, in fact, wrote to me about it on behalf of South Australia.

* We did review the allocation in view of the case put by the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Sturt, the South Australian Minister for Forests, the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  and others and we managed to get an additional allocation granted by the Treasury as a special grant to assist South Australia in view of the splendid record it had in the field of forestry during the last programme.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The other feature of the situation that worries me is that I am certain- the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has not told me this but I am certain for reasons which I cannot disclose- that the action of the government does not have the support of the Department.

* I do not believe it has the support even of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 

 -Mr Deputy Speaker, I may say that there is not much to reply to in the speech of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Staley).

* The Special Broadcasting Service has been taken away from him, much to his resentment, and it is in the hands of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is not gracing the table today.

* It is the views of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs that we would have preferred to hear on this subject.

* defending an apparent challenge for control of ethnic broadcasting by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Michael MacKellar, whose hard-line tactics haven't endeared him to immigrant communities.

* The SBS is prone to the continued whim not so much of the Minister who ought to be responsible but of the Prime Minister and his Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Telephone calls from the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs have disrupted meetings which the Executive Director of the SBS has held with his officers over the nature of the ethnic television service.

* It is striking that many of the people associated with ethnic broadcasting and many of those appointed by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the advisory bodies, the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council and the State Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Council, are very prominent members of the Liberal Party.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-I think we ought immediately to expose one of the statements by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  which he made in discussing this clause, clause S. He repeatedly said that this clause will validate certain situations within organisations and unions in Australia.

* Having some knowledge- perhaps minute compared with that of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who is at the table- of the affairs of the Australian Workers Union and the battle that has gone on over the years between those 2 legal entities, I could not see the State union readily agreeing to transfer its funds to the Federal union; nor would the State union agree to allow itself to be absorbed into the Federal union.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: In respect of the amnesty for illegal immigrants presently in operation, how many illegal immigrants have come forward as a result of the amnesty?

* I notice that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is at the table.

* Has any consideration been given to protecting the jobs of Australian workers and saving new arrivals from the personal and economic disadvantages of unemployment by immediately restricting **immigration** to the spouse, children and parents of migrants already in Australia?

* I ask the Minister: If his name was Clyde Cameron and he was a Minister for Labour and **Immigration** and had a union objecting so strongly to the proposals of the Government, would he continue to implement those proposals?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Government is determined to pursue its policy of continuing **immigration**.

* A couple of weeks ago the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  claimed great credit and announced with a very great flourish that the Government would be bringing in about 180,000 immigrants a year.

* I want to raise the issue of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* It is rumoured that there is currently before Cabinet a submission which would effectively raise the level of net **immigration** from the current levels of 50,000 a year to 70,000 a year for each year until 1981.

* It is also to be hoped that the Government will make no decision before the promised White Paper on **immigration** policy is published and ample time is allowed for public discussion and debate.

* In my view there is no clear basis on which to announce major changes in Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Indeed, there are a number of concerns which should be taken seriously and resolved before a large-scale **immigration** program is resumed, on the lines of programs adopted in the 1950s and 1960s.

* This problem would be compounded still further if increased rates of **immigration** were adopted.

* It is hard to believe that there are not enough workers in Australia to fill these jobs or to be retrained to work on this development and that we have to emphasise the need to expand the nation's **immigration** policy.

* One does not have to be critical of the concept of **immigration** to be most concerned about current developments in Australia.

* Western Samoans with work permits have **immigration** privileges to and from New Zealand because Western Samoa formerly was administered by New Zealand.

* I might say that I have asked the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council to give continuing attention to this matter.

* certainly hope to use the **immigration** program to help correct the temporary imbalances in one or two groups.

* I want to assure the honourable member and the House that we will certainly use the **immigration** program to the best extent that we can to correct the imbalances which exist in one or two ethnic groups.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in the House of Representatives, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Is it correct, as reported in yesterday's edition of the Sydney 'Sun', that **immigration** officers in London are telling plumbers that they will live a life of luxury if they migrate to Australia where all plumbers drive big American cars?

* Finally I ask the Minister: If he is not in a position to answer my question now, will he initiate an immediate investigation into the allegations made in the newspaper article, and, at the same time, make available to all **immigration** officers, regardless of where they  aTe  stationed, up to date copies of the major Australian industrial awards in order that intending migrants can be advised correctly as to the Australian wages and working conditions applicable to their particular trade or calling?

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
At this moment, the Blowering Reservoir is not flooding or spilling.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  sent a telegram to his constituents indicating his weakness.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, who is a member of Cabinet, revealed by that action his importance in this place.

* The Minister for Minerals and Energy would listen to him only if he received a few hundred - perhaps a few thousand - telegrams from the constituents of the Minister for **Immigration** but would not listen to the Minister speaking alone and on his own account, I would like to know how many telegrams were sent out of the Minister's office and paid for at Government expense in regard to this operation.

* The most plausible assumption set out in the Borrie Committee report is that the net **immigration** intake will be approximately 50 000 a year and that the replacement rate of natural population will be approximately one.

* If we look at what is happening in relation to the population growth in Australia at the moment we find that the net **immigration** intake is significantly lower than the 50 000 postulated by Professor Borrie, and the net replacement rate is significantly lower than one.

* Even with a 50 000 net **immigration** intake and a replacement rate of one, the population of Australia by the year 2000 would be approximately 17.6 million, which is significantly less than the 20 million plus envisaged when the original growth centre concepts were being drawn up and plans were being made.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
The Attorney-General administers the Commonwealth Police.

* An article states that the Department of **Immigration** deservedly has a red face about the case which hit the headlines recently when lorfino was unable to support his family.

* It goes on to say that the publishers are willing to bet that the Iorfino family and the Department of **Immigration** officials dealing with the case were of a certain religious faith and that this may have involved circumvention.

* If that is so, it is not to the credit of that organisation in helping to circumvent the **immigration** laws.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1978: 
I want to make some comments about two departments within our government.

* One comment relates to repatriation and the other to **immigration**.

* I think it is a tragedy that there has to be a newspaper headline in many instances before we can get a common-sense approach to a policy matter in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  knows my opinion of and some of my thoughts on the Department.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
All right, but that is just the way he is and I suppose this House has to put up with it.

* The **immigration** program that had been started a few years earlier by the right honourable Arthur Calwell, a former most distinguished member of this Parliament, had not yet had an opportunity to flow through to strengthen the industrial base in many parts of Australia.

* Is it a fact that in an address to the New South Wales Liberals recently be stated that Australia's **immigration** policy as it related to coloured people could not be justified on moral grounds?

* Is he aware also that successive Ministers for **Immigration** have consistently, and quite rightly in my view, justified and supported the policy on moral, social and economic grounds evidently because of their belief that a government has a moral obligation to protect its own people particularly from racial tensions and friction?

* Will the Prime Minister also state what is immoral about a policy that admits almost 10,000 non-Europeans and people of mixed descent yearly, gives discretionary power to the Minister, has kept Australia' free from racial hatreds and is based on the same principles as the **immigration** policies of practically every nation in the world?

* I have not held discussions on the matter referred to with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** but as Minister responsible for migrant education I recognise the arguments for increasing foreign language content not only in school libraries but in public and regional libraries generally.

* .-e nature of the activities which have caused me concern would be known to the honourable member as a result of his experiences as a former Minister for **Immigration**.

* I want to drawn to the attention of the House tonight, particularly to the attention of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  whom I thank for coming into the chamber, a matter concerning Fijians in Brisbane last weekend.

* He was referring to the **immigration** policy of past years.

* I shall summarise some of his claims, bring them to the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** and ask him to give me and the House tonight the facts of this incident that took place in Brisbane last weekend.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* By way of explanation I refer to the Minister's statement advising  that the Government has decided to reduce the **immigration** programme by 30,000 next year, reducing the target to 140,000 settlers, including 100,000 assisted migrants and at least 40,000 unassisted migrants.

* Will he also state whether the Government proposes to phase out the **immigration** programme and that this is the first instalment in the process?

* Of course, on this issue there are deep divisions between the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  and it was those divisions which led to the dismissal as shadow Minister for **Immigration** of the honourable member for Grayndler, a man who has been described by his leader in this Parliament as one of the best informed men on **immigration**.

* The leader of the Australian Labor Party in fact said of the honourable member for Grayndler, in relation to **immigration**, that one could not fault him on that subject.

* Turning to the amendment before the Chair, there is in the view of the Government no need for a joint select committee to inquire into the Government's **immigration** policies.

* The Government's achievements in the field of **immigration** are a matter of record.

* Indeed, at the last Australian Citizenship Convention the Leader of the Opposition paid public tribute to 'the efficiency and humanity of the Department of **Immigration** under a succession of able Ministers'.

* However, there has been in recent times some misunderstanding - I hesitate to use the word misrepresentation' - of the Government's **immigration** policies and programmes.

* **Immigration** cannot and must not be viewed in isolation.

* The social, economic and demographic effects of these different components of population change vary quite substantially and changes in the size or structure of the **immigration** programme cannot entirely offset the effects of changes in the other factors.

* The particular importance of **immigration** lies in the fact that, of all the elements of population change, it is the one most effectively influenced by Government action.

* I want to say tonight that the Government has in the national interest adopted the broadest possible approach in formulating **immigration** policies and in giving effect to those policies through annual **immigration** programmes.

* It has developed extremely comprehensive consultative machinery on all aspects  ot  **immigration**.

* I do not want to stress that Government sponsorship of research into various aspects pf **immigration** dates back for more than a decade.

* These ' are imaginative and far-reaching initiatives, but they form only part of a quite impressive body of research applied or in progress throughout Australia into the various aspects  of **immigration**.

* The Australian National University has just published a bibliography and digest which constitutes impressive evidence of the scope and depth of research into **immigration** to Australia.

* But the Government will continue as it has in the past consistently and successfully to review its annual **immigration** programmes, to relate those programmes to Australia's needs, the availability of suitable settlers and our capacity to integrate them on arrival here.

* Despite what has been said tonight by Opposition membersI stress that our **immigration** programmes are not rigidly conceived, mathematically calculated and solidly pursued.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  will continue that process of review as circumstances may continue to change in future years.

* I will not comment on the question of the non-European policy which has been mentioned on both sides of the Committee, except to say in a quite reasonable way to the Opposition that if the Opposition believes that its policy is misrepresented it should take the opportunity to spell that policy out clearly with a sense of detail which has been lacking in every contradictory utterance which has come forward from the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  the honourable member for Grayndler, the Premier of South Australia, the shadow Minister for **Immigration** or the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell).

* Due to the present Government 's mismanagement of all things connected with **immigration**, language instruction is still grossly unsatisfactory, and we all know that understanding of the language is a major factor in job placement; counselling is backward and at present distrusted by those who seek to use it.

* We all remember the disbandment of the Department of **Immigration** and the dramatic drop in morale within the Department.

* The **Immigration** Advisory Council lapsed.

* With full-time attention required to keep trade union demands under control, the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  has been no different from his predecessor in apportioning only a fraction of his time to ethnic affairs.

* If  Senator James  McClelland can offer no more indication of his interest in **immigration** than letting commercial misfits such as Alice Cooper into the country I believe we have yet another example of appalling mismanagement or non-management on the part of the Government.

* I could go on at some length further to document the miserable series of failures which this Government has made in the area of **immigration**.

* I wish to turn to a few specific examples of this Government's treatment of ethnic minorities, in the Federal Budget for this year and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** estimates.

* For the Government which has made such a great claim about its concern for minority groups in the community, its determination to be rid of inequalities and its commitment to egalitarianism, the Treasurer's statements on **immigration** show those worthy principles to be reduced to something less than farcial.

* In another outburst of miscalculations it showed to ethnic people of this country exactly what its true attitude was, an attitude so cursory and so patronising that the Government Printer had to waste no more than 3 lines on the whole ambit of the **immigration** field.

* It was not just an insulting reference of only 3 lines; the content of the Treasurer's remarks on **immigration** was as logically incomprehensible as it was short.

* For those honourable members who may have yawned and missed the remarks, he said: 
Those people who have done their arithmetic on Department of Labor and **Immigration** appropriations will find that this 3-lihe move will save the Government $5,665,000 in 1975-76 in a projected Budget deficit of $2.7 billion.

* These measures, which are designed further to impede the necessary **immigration** flow to Australia, are solely and indisputably a result of the Government's amateur and totally inept handling of the economy which has resulted, amongst other disasters, in a totally unacceptable level of employment.

* We have stated that **immigration** must be taken away from the present Government's restricting manpower considerations and placed in a much more broad context of a vital component of the nation's overall population policies.

* As in so many areas the Labor Government's record in the field of **immigration** is abysmal.

* -Has the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs seen reports that visitors from the P &amp; O ship  Island Princess  who were in Australia for 10 hours were indignant at having to pay the $10 departure tax?

* asked  the  Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
One of the recommendations- it is interesting because the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, is responsible for this particular area- that was not accepted by the Government was the ultimate purpose for which the departure tax should be used.

* Consequently I now have no gripe with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs regarding that particular aspect of the Committee 's report.

* Does the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  realise that within one electorate there were some shires which did not get one allocation of RED money and yet the Commonwealth Employment Service office covered several who did.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 7 November 1978: 
Under which **immigration** category were they admitted and what was their nationality at the time of acceptance.

* It was virtually telling the honourable member for Angas and his colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who is overseas at the present time, to get off their backsides and do something for the industry.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice:  &lt;1) 'Have the discussions which he arranged between his Department and the Department of Education on ways of improving child migrant education taken place.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
 I am sure that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  will regret the rather extravagant observations he has made concerning one or two honourable gentlemen on this side of the House.

* The fact that one of my friends happens to be wearing a rose - it has been described by the Minister for **Immigration** as a royalist rose - I do not think would sear the feelings of the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  in the least.

* I simply observe to the Minister for **Immigration** that on some occasions I fear for his safety because I am sure that he could be imprisoned in a bowerbird's playground.

* For the information of the honourable members I present the report of the conference of Australian and State Ministers for **Immigration** dated 9 November 1973.

* Then, not having a great deal of success, trying through the Central Office and, still not having any success, trying through the office of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* I want to give a couple of examples of events which I think demonstrate either a lack of administrative ability in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs or a lack of sympathy for and understanding of those people who have had to flee their own country.

* **Immigration**,  upon notice: 
Which countries have **immigration** agreements with Australia.

* Which non-European countries have sought **immigration** agreements with Australia and what was the result in each case.

* -I direct my question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* 1 ) and (2) In May this year the Government decided that Australia's 1976-77 **immigration** program should be 70 000 persons.

* That was by far the smallest intake in the post-war **immigration** program.

* These forecasts assist **immigration** selection officers and officers of my Department dealing with applications for vocational training assistance.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** aware that that master racketeer, spiv, confidence man, company director and international crook, one Alexander Barton, who cheated Australian shareholders out of $21m before fleeing Australia is now travelling Europe on Australian passport No.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** familiar with the claim of some economists that it requires up to 2i persons to service the demands and needs of a migrant?

* The Indonesian Government has advised that final arrangements for the visit to East Timor by an Australian **Immigration** team will be discussed after the Presidential elections this month.

* The Australian **immigration** programme was initiated by a Labor government some 25 years ago, and it has been supported by this Government since that time.

* I think it is disappointing for many of us suddenly to get these revelations indicating the stark nature of the situation, **immigration** is important to Australia.

* Seventy per cent of the increase in our work force over the last 20 years has come from **immigration**.

* We are told by the **Immigration** Department that something like $650 is spent administratively on each migrant, but the net gain is said to be something like $10,000 for each migrant.

* If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of migrants from the point of view that **immigration** is not a one-sided affair.

* The success of Australia's **immigration** programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which migrants and their children encounter.

* Startling revelations about language problems of migrant children have now come to hand 25 years after the then Labor Government initiated our first **immigration** programme.

* There are lots of people who now say that we should now put a stop to or a brake on the **immigration** programme.

* It is clearly a possibility that we could make a knowledge of English a condition of their **immigration** arrangement.

* The figures I am quoting come from the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  and I think they have a very clear relevance to the Bill since we are talking about educating migrants.

* For these reasons we have decided not to move amendments of this kind to the legislation but we bring the problem to the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as being worthy of careful consideration.

* This has been recognised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said yesterday that both had diplomatic passports.

* The Minister said that the men were met at the airport by **immigration** officials and issued with documents.

* Were their guns not noticed by the **immigration** officers?

* I have noticed an increasing public debate in relation to the level of **immigration** intake.

* As honourable members know, last week I tabled in this House a Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** and population policies.

* The amendment moved by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  makes one inclined to ask what is the use of the operation at all?

* About 12 months ago the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden),  who was acting for the Minister for **Immigration**, tabled in this House a piece of legislation to cover migrant education.

* This evening the Minister for **Immigration** has told us that there was no need for the legislation because he had proceeded with the granting of money and so on without legislative authority.

* The direct cost to the farming community of his proposal would be $28m a year, compared with the cost of taking away the superphosphate bounty of S50m, less the tax deduction, which I have been led to understand by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  would produce a net cost of about S30m.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Let us now look at the number of buildings which have been commenced.

* During the last 3 years the net **immigration** intake into this country has been some 300.000 people.

* -Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware of the grave discontent in the Lebanese community in Australia arising from the lack of firm guidelines for the entry into Australia of relatives and friends who have had to flee the Lebanon because of the conflict in that country?

* On the question of **immigration**, there were those of us who, as we saw a state of full employment developing within the community, hoped that there would be an increase in the **immigration** quota to keep cost increases reasonable.

* We have not had an increase in the **immigration** quota but we do have overfull employment.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I was also a member in those years of vibrancy when he was in the full vigour of life and Minister for **Immigration** in the war Cabinet.

* Undoubtedly our **immigration** scheme, with its great contribution to Australia's development, must go down as his greatest memorial as a member of this Parliament and as a citizen.

* Those who like oratory and Australianism should read his speeches during the early days of **immigration**, particularly his speech on the Citizenship Bill.

* In directing my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs I preface it by complimenting him on the assistance I have had from him and his Department in processing applications for **immigration** to Australia from Lebanese nationals.

* In this chamber the Minister for Northern Australia,  Dr Rex  Patterson, will represent the Minister for Agriculture; the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Mr Lionel  Bowen, will represent the Special Minister of State and Postmaster-General; the Attorney-General,  Mr Kep  Enderby, will represent the Minister for Police and Customs; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Frank  Stewart, will represent the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation; and the Minister for Housing and Construction,  Mr Joe  Riordan, will represent the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* However, I would add, in amplification of what I said then, that Australia's existing **immigration** policy has allowed and will continue to allow some Asians to migrate from Uganda, in particular persons who are qualified in professions to practise in Australia and who can be absorbed readily in those professions in Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 November 1978: 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1977: 
-In this adjournment debate there are one or two areas that I want to cover.

* The first concerns comments on the National Employment and Training scheme by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan)  in his capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  in this House.

* I am sure that he can do something about it because this is an area in which the staff of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  have been doing their utmost to create positions.

* Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Meetings with  Mr Massimino  Del Prete  (Question No.

* 743) 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs a supplementary question.

* My question to the Minister for **Immigration** concerns recent criticism by non-Australians of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Will the Minister indicate clearly to the House that, contrary to the opinions of some international moralists, Australia's non-European **immigration** policy is our own business and is designed to preserve a community free from the tensions which characterise other parts of the world?

* He is the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  whose persistence in these matters is, I think, well acknowledged.

* The same thing can be said in relation to the Department of **Immigration** and the Department of Health.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* During the previous Parliament I suggested the setting up of a museum or a collection of articles showing Australia's **immigration** program and its history.

* Will the Minister investigate the possibility of such a collection and museum showing the history of Australia's **immigration** program being set up as has been done in the United States?

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* He will be aware that the then Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Grassby,  initiated preparation of the pamphlet entitled 'The Newcomer and the Law'.

* Since that time the section of the Department of Social Security which dealt with the production of such material has been transferred to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* In addition, I mention the Conference of Ministers for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs which was established in January 1968.

* It comprises the Commonwealth Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and State Ministers responsible for **immigration** or ethnic affairs matters.

* No foreign passport of itself gives exemption from Australian **Immigration** and Customs procedures.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Is it a fact that immigrants are encouraged to believe that naturalisation will entitle them to all the privileges of Australian citizenship?

* In joining the Opposition's case for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee on **immigration**, I want to remind honourable members this evening that in general Australia's **immigration** programme has operated in a satisfactory manner in the past not because of any great credit that this Government could claim but rather despite the Government.

* Let me remind honourable members that Australia's **immigration** programme was planned by the Australian Labor Party over 25 years ago.

* Its initial success was due to the brilliant and sympathetic administration of the scheme in its early years by Australia's first Minister for **Immigration**.

* Its continued success over the years has been due to the fact that successive Liberal Party Ministers for **Immigration** who have administered the programme have carried on the policy which was basically formulated and instituted by Labor's first Minister for **Immigration**.

* However, the Liberal Party has never had a basic **immigration** policy of its own, and it is not unusual, of course, that so many policies that we are able to illustrate effectively in this Parliament have come to fruition by accident rather than by plan.

* I quote not only my own words this evening when I say that this Government has no **immigration** policy.

* Dr Lloyd  wrote: 
The starting point ot an; economic analysis should be the recognition that the Australian Commonwealth Government does not have, and has not had, a coherent policy on **immigration**.

* The **immigration** programme' consists essentially of an  i  in migration target,  announced  annually by the Commonwealth Government, and assorted schemes for assisting migrants by paying all or part of' their fares to Australia.

* Yet the Government, which is bankrupt of ideas for the operation of a suitable pro gramme for **immigration** in the 1970s and afterwards, is hypocritical enough to endeavour to belittle the policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* I say proudly that the Labor Party has, and it always has had, a detailed and concise policy on **immigration**.

* Honourable members, and not only members from this side of the chamber, have referred to it, but not one speaker has been able to refer to any basic policy which the Liberal Party has on **immigration**.

* The Labor Party makes no secret of its **immigration** policy, or any of its other policies for that matter.

* Our **immigration** policy is published in a book of policy, and the policy of our 29th Commonwealth Conference is available for all to read.

* I support the amendment this evening just as I  supported  the honourable member  for Grayndler  12 months ago when he suggested, during a similar debate in this chamber,  that a  select committee should  be appointed to inquire  into **immigration**.

* We say, as the  Labor Party did  25 years ago, that the  Parliament should adopt  an honest, sensible  and Australian  approach to this nation's future **immigration** programme.

* As I said, 12 months ago during a similar debate I supported a proposal similar to the amendment which has been moved this evening and on that occasion I appealed to the then Minister for **Immigration** - of course, there is a different Minister now administering the Government's policy; the present Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  who is now sitting at the table, was the Minister for **Immigration** then- 
Changes in the Ministry are like a game of musical chairs, as the honourable member for Reid suggests.

* At that time I appealed to the Minister for **Immigration** to consider the plan to have a tame, departmentally appointed committee investigate Australia's future **immigration** needs.

* Such a time lag makes a joke of any benefit that could come from this committee's investigations because in the meantime - at least, during the last months of this Government - Australia's **immigration** policy will continue to drift along, changed to suit the whims of him who happens to administer the policy at any particular time.

* The most suitable group to study Australia's future **immigration** needs is one selected from among members of this Parliament, for it is in this Parliament that decisions on our future programme must be made.

* In quoting this example I will show how ineffective it is for any Government appointed committee of inquiry to determine any need for change in our **immigration** policy and how difficult it is to have the Government accept any recommendation for change that it might submit.

* I refer to a committee of inquiry which was set up by the Government's **Immigration** Advisory Council in 1968.

* The Committee should support the amendment, moved in relation to the estimates of this Department, seeking the establishment of a joint select committee to inquire into Australia's future **immigration** needs.

* Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** been drawn to an article in the 'Australian' on Tuesday, 13 th October, written by  Mr Peter  Ryan, in which he claims that  Mr J.  R. Wilson, who has been appointed by the Minister to head the inquiry into the costs and benefits of **immigration**, has prejudged the inquiry already by stating that he is in favour of **immigration**?

* Report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry in 1965, the Vernon Report, pointed out that **immigration** was a more costly source of skill than training additional craftsmen in Australia.

* The Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Training points out that although **immigration** has been a valuable source of skilled labour in the past it is not clear that intakes have always been sufficiently closely related to labour market needs.

* It also mentions the inflationary pressures that may arise from **immigration**.

* The alleged activities of the organisation FORCE referred to in the newspaper article are the concern of the Attorney-General, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Administrative Services in relation to aspects other than passports.

* It is not expected that the existing training centre at present occupied by the Department of **Immigration** will become vacant for some time.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: In the new citizenship oath or affirmation is it proposed to include the words renouncing all other allegiance'?

* 1 ) to (4) Officers of the Departments of Health, Finance, Education, Aboriginal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, **Immigration**, Ethnic Affairs and Social Security have met to ensure cooperative preliminary planning for the International Year of the Child.

* For many years the Leader of the Opposition made a passing reference to **immigration**.

* **Immigration** has been a great engine of growth within this country for many years and it has provided adequate increases, helpful increases to the work force each year.

* But the social philosophy of the **immigration** programme has been one which has influenced Australia socially as well as economically.

* Every **immigration** Minister, from the first Minister forward to the present Minister, has indicated that **immigration** in Australia provides a welcome addition to the natural increase in the Australian work force.

* Having regard to family code policies enunciated at Launceston, according to which the natural addition to the Australian work force following some second-rate left wing overseas intellectual proposition is to be reduced, he desires to increase **immigration** from non-European sources.

* He proposes that **immigration** no longer be an addition to the Australian growth programme; it is in fact to be a substitute for it.

* It is a change of a philosophy which is supported by the present shadow Minister for **Immigration** and was supported by the first Minister for **Immigration** in this country.

* I do not think we can show that an increasing area of **immigration** will create more unemployment.

* But at the moment I am not inclined to come down on the side of those people who say that we ought to reduce **immigration** simply on the grounds that it increases competition for jobs, though probably not on very good logical grounds.

* I welcome this debate tonight in the hope that people will continue to look at the subject of migration in its constructive aspects and learn from the last 30 years the lessons we should apply to a continuing flow of **immigration**.

* In a way **immigration** produces a different kind of Australia for us all to live in.

* Minister for **Immigration**) - by leave - I wish to inform the House of the measures by which effect will be given to the Government's announced policy of placing increasing emphasis on migrant counselling and selection and migrant education and welfare services.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
In view of the continuing conflict occurring in Lebanon, can the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs say what action is being taken to process more rapidly the thousands of applications his Department is holding on behalf of prospective immigrants from Lebanon?

* Has any consideration been given to enlarging our present staff in Beirut and to relaxing our **immigration** requirements to allow a larger number of Lebanese citizens to migrate to Australia on compassionate grounds?

* We had the division on **immigration**.

* He sacked the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  as shadow Minister for **Immigration**.

* He said: 
Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs 
-Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that the Queensland branch of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union has closed its books to membership by Vietnamese refugees?

* During his career here he was Minister for the Army, Minister for the Navy, Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Minister for Health and Minister for **Immigration**.

* Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** been drawn to a report of the plight of an English migrant family in Pascoe Vale, Victoria, which it is claimed has been refused accommodation in a hostel by the Commonwealth Department of **Immigration**?

* I had previously mentioned to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  that I would be raising this matter tonight and I am glad to see him in the chamber.

* I rise tonight to draw attention to their plight, to the inadequacies of the **immigration** programme and to propose immediate corrective action by our authorities both here and in the South American countries concerned.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** to review urgently the briefing given in South America to single girls applying to come to Australia, to ensure that they do not leave Peru and other countries with the wrong picture of Australia and the conditions here.

* This task forces could be made up of personnel retained by the Department of **Immigration** - very able and skilled personnel - and also representatives of the Good Neighbour Council in the 2 cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* I am grateful to the Minister for **Immigration** for being here tonight to listen to the report compiled after a full and extensive discussion of the problem with a representative cross-section of the girls concerned.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
No.

* 1 am advised that the Department of **Immigration** provides a comprehensive service to prospective migrants holding academic qualifications whereby an inquirer overseas may have his qualifications assessed by the appropriate authority before deciding to come to Australia.

* The Bilingual Education Consultative Committee comprises representatives of the Departments of Education and Aboriginal Affairs; the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates activities relating to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory comprises representatives of the Departments of Health Aboriginal Affairs, AttorneyGeneral's, Education, Housing and Construction, Labor and **Immigration**, Northern Territory and Social Security; and the inter-departmental committee which co-ordinates the delivery of health care to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory is made up of representatives of the Departments of Health, Aboriginal Affairs, Education and Northern Territory.

* The Government considered that with the changing pattern of **immigration** into Australia and the Government's own initiatives in **immigration** policy giving priority to family reunion and sponsored' migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of migrants and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM.

* &lt;3) The decision was taken after consultation between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and **Immigration**.

* The Department of **Immigration** made provision some lime ago for the issue of miniature certificates as evidence of Australian citizenship.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 
-I thank honourable members.

* Give me a letter to our colleagues the AttorneyGeneral and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** '.

* The apprentices referred to in the report are not, strictly speaking, employees of my Department They commenced their trade training in the Department in 1975 under the Additional Apprentices Scheme administered by the then Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 

 Mr A. D. Fogarty; Department of Labor and **Immigration** 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1978: 
Government spokesmen, particularly the **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  take every opportunity to point out alleged dire consequences if we do not boost **immigration** intakes to unrealisticafly high levels.

* Firstly, I point out that I have never outlined a figure which the **immigration** level should reach.

* Secondly, the same article states: 
The Government's argument is based on questionable assertions made in the recent 'green paper' on **immigration** policies and Australia's population, which was prepared by the Minister's own department on his instruction.

* I point out to the House that the Green Paper was prepared by the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council of which the  President  of the honourable member's own party, the Australian Labor Party, is a member and he was in agreement with that Green Paper.

* I understand from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** that no more interim grants are to be made in this area.

* Dr Wilenski  's appointment as permanent head of the Department of Labour and **Immigration** was attacked on the grounds that he is a member of the Labor Party and worked as my Principal Private Secretary.

* What is (a) the total office size, (b) the rental cost for (i) the year 1977-78 and (ii) the period 1 July 1978 to date, (c) the administrative costs, and (d) the number of staff temporary and permanent, in occupation of the following Commonwealth offices within the Electoral Division of Parramatta: (A) the Acoustic Laboratory of the Department of Health, 68 Macquarie Street, (B) the Australian Electoral Office, 28 George Street, (C) the Commonwealth Employment Service, 30 Darcy Street, (D) the Bureau of Customs, 30 Darcy Street, (E) the Family Court of Australia, (F) the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, 23 George Street, (G) Medibank, S3 Phillip Street, (H) Medibank, Church Street, (I) Qantas, 20 Macquarie Street, (J) the Department of Social Security, 68 Macquarie Street, (K) the Department of Social Security, Level 6, Westfield Centre, (L) Telecom Australia,5th Floor, 30 Darcy Street and (M) the Taxation Office, 126 Church Street.

* This growth has been in the main accelerated by the establishment of the **immigration** policy by the then Labor Government and its continuation over the years by a succession of coalition governments.

* His  place in our history is assured as our first Minister for **Immigration**.

* The **immigration** policy critical to the prosperity, development and security of Australia in the 50's was equally admirably suited to our requirements in the 60's.

* 1 consider the problems that have been revealed in recent years in relation to migration have developed, not simply as some suggest, because of the continuation of the policy, but rather because of the inability of recent Ministers for **Immigration** to adapt the policy to what may be most readily, although perhaps not most suitably, described as the principles of supply and demand.

* The announcement by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  that a review of **immigration** policy is to be undertaken is most timely but 1 suspect it was not very well considered before being determined.

* I preface my question by reminding the House of the great contribution that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs made in drawing up and introducing the Regional Employment Development scheme when he was Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971, I present the annual report on migrant education for the year ended 30th June 1972.

* In regard to the number of personnel serving in Australia House I point out that of the total of just over  1,000,  some  380  are engaged in the **immigration** side of the activities of that House.

* The significance of this **immigration** activity is illustrated by the number of personnel there.

* The Minister's own Department of Labor and **Immigration** has argued against flat rate indexation.

* If average weekly earnings rise by 20 per cent in 1974-75 - that is a modest figure; the rate is more likely to be 25 per cent - 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I ask: Following the recent discussion on **immigration**, can the Minister assure the House that there will be no change in the Government's policy of facilitating the reunion of families through sponsored **immigration**, while at the same time continuing the policy of Commonwealth sponsorship of migrants from countries from which there is no tradition of family sponsorship?

* -My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Yet the following day the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in reply to a similar question from the honourable member for North Sydney claimed that he did not know what the honourable member for North Sydney was talking about.

* **Immigration** Staff at Overseas Posts (Question No.

* 1550) 

 Mr E. G. Whitlam Asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 
Compiled at request by the Statistics Group of the Legislative Research Service from issues of  Monthly Review of the Employment Situation  published by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I commend the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for introducing this legislation into the House.

* As the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  who is the shadow Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, has said, if we were initiating trade union training we would have done it in a somewhat different fashion, in consultation with the trade union movement.

* I recognise the arguments which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has put and which I think he needed to put in the early days.

* I am not sure why the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is sitting at the table and is responsible for this Bill because it is obviously not an **immigration** Bill.

* Yet we have the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs taking charge of this legislation as though he does not realise and the Government does not concede that it is not an **immigration** matter but an imposition on the workers of this country who are going away for an occasional holiday.

* They have also mentioned the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* They have not had the grace to acknowledge that he has ministerial commitments and is presid ing over the Commonwealth **Immigration** Planning Council meeting in Melbourne this afternoon.

* Figures given in 1969 and 1970 by the former Minister for Health - the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  - who introduced this scheme indicated that there were approximately 184,000 specifically low income families living on the minimum wage or $6 above it - these figures are in black and white - who would have been entitled to full or partial subsidy for the cost of health insurance.

* The superseded Minister for Health, the present Minister for **Immigration**, says that the figures are misleading.

* Little wonder that the former Minister for Health so deceitfully resorts to distorted figures to cover up the failure of the scheme of which he spoke so highly when in the House on 14th April last year he said: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether he has seen the Hobart newspaper report which says that an Australian citizen, Con  Patiniotis,  on holiday with his family in Greece was inducted into the Greek Army despite assurances from the Greek authorities that he would not have to serve.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I rise to support the expenditure of $66,286,000 as set out in the estimates for the Department of **Immigration**.

* I congratulate the Government on its **immigration** policy.

* **Immigration** is one of the most important matters that we have to administer as a Government.

* Of course there are critics and in the main this criticism centres on the proposition that **immigration** inhibits economic growth, that our policy is based on just getting numbers and ignores quality.

* Other critics regard **immigration** as the cause of pollution, of the urban sprawl, inflation and so on.

* Some critics say that **immigration** is the root cause of Australia's problems.

* Inflation is neither confined to nor worst in Australia and the other great countries of **immigration**.

* The attitude that our **immigration** programme is simply some kind of numbers game is completely wrong.

* Great damage could result from Australian politicians speaking in neighbouring countries without exercising the utmost care to be factual about Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Anyone who has travelled in these countries knows that there are many misleading stories about Australia's **immigration** policy, I have been in the East, the Near East and the Far East and I have heard these stories from the indigenous people.

* There is, of course, great difference of opinion among honourable members on the Opposition side and they are definitely divided over their **immigration** policy.

* 1 **immigration** position on the Opposition side.

* In the main our **immigration** has run on sound lines.

* As employment in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is determined by the capacity of officers to meet the normal requirements for employment in the Commonwealth Public Service, a requirement that a person should or should not be a first generation migrant or should or should not be from a particular ethnic background would appear to be in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  has been good enough to outline to the Parliament proposals dealing with migrant education to which he will give legislative effect in the near future.

* The Government's proposal is a forward step in the fulfilment of our ideals and aspirations in the field of **immigration**.

* This is true not only in Australia but in other countries with **immigration** programmes.

* I am pleased also to note that evidently the Minister and the Department of **Immigration** are taking note of submissions made in this Parliament and at **immigration** conventions, and by interested organisations, about the need for something to be done in the field of education.

* He said that a survey by the Department of **Immigration** indicated that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English and that departmental English classes assist only a small proportion of them.

* With the assurance of the Minister for **Immigration** that he will not curtail the debate when it takes place, within reason, I will content myself with saying that we on this side of the House will welcome the legislation.

* In recent trips around Australia while serving on the Government **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs Committee I visited many places where job opportunities existed for our new settlers.

* In the explanation which the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has just given lies the cause of my fundamental concern.

* It would not be wrong, and it would not indicate any lack of support for our **immigration** problem, if a committee of the standing of the Vernon Committee were set up to inquire into the economic value and the economic cost of **immigration** to Australia and to make recommendations on any alterations that are necessary, for economic reasons, to our **immigration** policy.

* If, as has been claimed by the professor, we are spending about $4,000 on each migrant in social costs - not actual dollars - then it would not be a bad idea if we had statistical and economic data provided to show us the absolute value of **immigration**.

* We believe that Australia's national reputation has been damaged because many of its policies are interpreted as racist - I refer to those on **immigration**, Aboriginals and New Guinea, just to name a few - but primarily we believe that it is wrong to play sport against a team which deliberately excludes players of a different colour.

* The former **Immigration** Information Branch now transferred to my Department is producing booklets of information in a range of languages for the benefit of migrants.

* These are being produced on behalf of the department of Social Security and will presumably be distributed in the Parramatta region by means available to that Department 
-There are 2 matters to which I would like to refer specifically in speaking to the estimates of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* A letter from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** states:  .

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar)  has approved of its incorporation.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 March 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 25 October 1978: 
The second point is item (c) of the recommendations which is in chapter 3.

* We have a Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs responsible for the question.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1 978: 
People are sent to me from lawyers- halfsmart lawyers, probably in the Liberal Partywith letters of introduction so that they can ask me to make representations to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to have their visas extended.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is the Government's policy on **immigration** to be altered in any way as a result of the ambivalent attitude towards **immigration** revealed in recent conflicting statements attributed to 2 spokesmen on this subject belonging to the Opposition?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 April 1977: 
-My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

* Was there any lack of liaison between the Minister and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in regard to notification of the closure?

* What discussions, if any, were held between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in regard to the closure?

* I shall add to that by pointing out the quite unsatisfactory legislative framework within which  Mr Salemi  has had to work and also detail the actions of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the omissions and lack of action by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  consequent upon the report of the Ombudsman in this matter.

* In particular, he drew attention to the report of the Bland Committee on Administrative Discretions about the attitude of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the rights of migrants in Australia.

* The Attorney-General, as he then was, pointed out that when the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs was absent from Australia he acted as 
Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* It is on the record in the Ombudsman's report that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has changed its position on this matter.

* As I recall, the last part of his speech dealt with the Australian Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* The honourable member omitted to say that the first statement which the Minister made in January was in fact the result of a review which was initiated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he was the Minister for Labour and **Immigration** in the previous Government.

* Perhaps that partly explains why he was removed from his office as Minister for Labour and **Immigration** to another position in the previous Government.

* The recent statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has made that clear, at least over the next triennium.

* I direct my question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for **Immigration**.

* Has his attention been drawn to statements made by the newly arrived Japanese Consul criticising visa regulations applying to Japanese tourists, and to statements by Japanese business.ment about restrictions under our **immigration** laws on Japanese interests establishing industries in Australia and providing workers and executives?

* If so, in view of the obvious misunderstanding of the position, will he state the facts to the House and give assurance that the Japanese are treated no worse and no better than other nationals under our **immigration** policy?

* Will he also agree that Japanese industrialists have been encouraged and have never lacked the initiative and also the ability to expand and to protect their trade with Australia irrespective of tariff or **immigration** policies?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I thank honourable members.

* The relevance of this agreement and of similar agreements which European countries have made appears from another answer which the Minister for **Immigration** gave to the honourable member for Riverina on 19th August last, in the following terms: 
I will take the position of Italy.

* The Minister for **Immigration** told my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  on 19th August last: 
The Italian Under-Secretary of State for **Immigration** -  also covered Article 35 (Social Security) of the Migration and Settlement Agreement which requires the 2 governments to study, the possibility of entering into a reciprocal agreement on the payment of the benefits contemplated by the respective social security systems.

* The Minister for **Immigration** had an extensive tour in October and November last.

* He replied: 
The Minister for **Immigration**, however, did not visit Italy, nor in fact did he visit Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Yugoslavia, Malta or Turkey, whose reciprocal arrangements I have mentioned earlier in this speech.

* All the facts I have been quoting come from answers which either the Minister for **Immigration** or the Minister for Social Services has given to my colleagues the honourable member for Grayndler, the honourable member for 
Riverina, the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  and myself.

* But since the Minister for **Immigration** has challenged me on the last figure I have quoted I shall give the precise information from the answer which he sent me after the House rose last December.

* The burden of my interest is related to the previous case which I put to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I want to make a brief reference to **immigration** and how it affects the employment situation.

* As I see it, there are two important issues: Firstly, how our population is running by world standards and, secondly, what effect **immigration** has on our work force or, better still, our unemployment situation.

* Under previous LiberalCountry Party governments the broad policy was to increase our population by **immigration** by an average of 1 per cent of the population each year.

* Today, because of economic pressures, our **immigration** program has dropped off dramatically.

* Meetings of State Ministers associated with **immigration** and myself are held regularly under this Government and they now include the New Zealand Minister for **Immigration**.

* Recently, a senior officer of my Department was in New Zealand for discussions with New Zealand departmental officials and the current Minister for **Immigration** in New Zealand.

* I would like to see in existence an arrangement whereby the total **immigration** procedures of the two countries are brought as far as possible into harmony.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 
1 ) Who are the present members of the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council.

* I am sorry that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is not here tonight to hear what I have to say.

* I will not mention tonight the $500m at 3 per cent which was the alleged promise - I will be careful - of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  prior to the last election because I want to go one stage further.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: 
Did the Prime Minister tell me on  26  April  1977  (Hansard,  page  1263)  that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Social Security were examining the question of the survey in the context of a much wider survey of refugees in Australia.

* It is a pity that attention had to be called to the state of the House so late in the speech of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  as I am sure that members of his own Party who were not here could have benefited by listening to him.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, who is so concerned about the future of this country, has made allowance for an intake of migrants this year on a similar basis to that of last year, but of course we have one extra allowance.

* The Minister for **Immigration** commented that the rural industry was experiencing a boom time, lt certainly is, but that is an act of God, not an act of Gough.

* The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) said that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  had been acting and that he should be on television.

* However, I think it very unlikely that any member of the Opposition would advise him to go on television, particularly at a time when the Minister for **Immigration** or the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was on television, because I think that this would show us the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1977: 
Senior officers of my Department have been in consultation with the National Urban and Regional Development Authority regarding the assistance which can be given, through the **immigration** program, to the development of regional centres and other centres outside the metropolitan areas.

* It is to the credit of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  that he has introduced a system whereby a migrant in Melbourne can telephone and receive immediately the services of a linguist who can interpret and explain legislation such as this.

* I ask the Minister for Social Security to give heed to my suggestion - and to pass it on to his colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** - that special facilities should be created in these areas to inform the migrants about such matters as portability of pensions.

* On **immigration**, the Labor Party believes that Australia should be a patchwork quilt with all the various colours opposing each other, building up hatreds and bringing about a condition within this nation which would not be conducive to a free peace loving people.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 1978: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 1978: 
I wish to inform the House that the Minister for the Army  (Mr Peacock)  left Australia on Friday on the inaugural flight of Alitalia to Rome.

* The Minister is expected to return to Australia on 30th September, and during his absence the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  is Acting Minister for the Army.

* One needs only to look at the list of skills provided for prospective migrants by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to know that a training scheme should be related to those shortages.

* Let me make it clear that, although we found ways of improving the RED scheme- which was introduced by the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)after  the scheme had been operating for over 1 8 months, this is no criticism of the initial concept.

* These tax and exemption stamps will be obtainable from regional offices of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, from Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs booths at airports and major sea ports, from Customs offices at ports where the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs does not have offices and of course at Department of Foreign Affairs passport offices throughout Australia.

* This is an important point: If a carrier or an agent should wish to arrange the affixing of a tax stamp to a client's ticket in order to facilitate passenger travel arrangements, stamps will be available for bulk sale from offices of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The agent or carrier will be able to buy the stamps in bulk from Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs offices.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The building unions in Western Australia have written to overseas countries requesting that no further migrants come to Australia until the situation changes.

* It is up to this Government to take immediate steps to stop **immigration** to Western Australia until the employment situation eases.

* I do not believe that firms such as this should be able to add to the already high unemployment figures that exist in Western Australia or should have any say as to what happens to Australia's **immigration**.

* Has it stopped **immigration** and redirected the finance saved to unemployment relief?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We have just listened to a speech giving views quite the opposite of what has been enunciated by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* Was not that the basis of the **immigration** policies of  1945  and  1946?

* Only a few days ago in this House we witnessed the attitude of another Minister as expressed through the Minister for **Immigration** who is the Acting Minister for Health and former Minister for the Army and God knows what else.

* The Government hides the figures for **immigration** unemployment.

* The Government cannot regard **immigration** in  1973  as it did in  1953.

* Nobody can say that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is not a fast talker when he is desperate; but it was not quite good enough tonight.

* Since the introduction of NUMAS the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs have consistently claimed that this situation has not altered.

* For example, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in the Parliament on 11 October stated: 
Under NUMAS every potential migrant received a rating.

* I met with my equivalent in the **Immigration** Department .

* The fact is that NUMAS was adopted to boost the **immigration** program which had been cut back severely by an absolute lack of job vacancies in Australia for the Australian born and the overseas born.

* An examination of the approved list of occupations published by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and based on the predictions of 'Employment Prospects by Industry and Occupation ' shows that while there are some localised shortages of labour in some States, there are very few shortages of labour Australiawide.

* As an official from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has said, a lack of work opportunities in Australia prompted the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to introduce NUMAS.

* The Department of **Immigration** wants a larger migrant intake and it will go to any lengths to achieve it, no matter what the employment consequences.

* Evidence in our possession shows that NUMAS is biased in favour of rich, white English-speaking middle class immigrants from Rhodesia and the USA, while at the same time significantly weakening the family reunion aspect of the **immigration** program.

* I have had discussions with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and senior officers of my Department have also had discussions to keep the operation of NUMAS under close review in this field of supplying the labour market.

* **Immigration** is no longer a program where, except for the refugee and family reunion categories, labour market considerations are the prime considerations in determining entry.

* However, while that is not the situation, representations you receive alleging conflicts between the **immigration** policy and Australia's labour market situation are best answered by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* We have in any case tended more and more to seek to transfer those kinds of representations (previously answered by this Department) to **Immigration** as NUMAS has developed.

* A further report, commenting on the Government's proposed **immigration** intake of 210,000 in the triennium 1978-81, says: 
It is 'rather perplexed' at the formula- 'growing unemployment, therefore increased **immigration**'.

* It asks: 'What is the point of increasing **immigration** when in Australia and throughout the world recession is on the increase?'.

* This phasing out of skilled **immigration**, 8,000 to 10,000 a year, and the projected increase in the demand for skilled labour, 10,000 a year, would require an increase of 20,000 a year on current apprenticeship intakes.

* It is a scandalous situation we have reached in Australia and it is about time that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment were either merged or the Ministers were forced by the Executive to meet regularly to see what the demands of the labour market are in Australia and to see that people are not just brought here to boost the ranks of the unemployed.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 am not aware, and I have nor been aware, that members of this Parliament - the honourable member or other members - have reached the conclusion that the **immigration** programme is bad for Australia, as the honourable member appears to suggest.

* For our part, we have been conducting an **immigration** programme which, in terms of numbers, has been greatly successful.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** seen reports of the meeting of Australian and State Ministers for **Immigration** which was held in Brisbane last Friday?

* Are they correct in saying that the States favour a change in the present level of **immigration**?

* -That was the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* A little while ago there were reports that the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was about to introduce amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to protect the public interest, to give the Government power to appeal against decisions of single members of the Commission and to require commissioners to observe the indexation principles and guidelines of the Full Bench.

* The former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** 12 months ago said: 
House.

* The remark was made by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan),  representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in this House.

* It is extraordinary by any standards, but when it is made by a Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, and a Labor Party Minister at that, one has to look for a deeper significance.

* -I suggest that the order for the consideration of proposed expenditures agreed to by the Committee on 14 September be varied by next considering the proposed expenditure for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the proposed expenditures for the Department of the Northern Territory, the Department of the Capital Territory and the Department of Home Affairs.

* Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs 
-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I refer to the increased assistance for apprentices as advertised in a brochure issued by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I direct to the Minister for **Immigration** a question relating to citizenship ceremonies.

* Its leader in Germany is one Ante Vukic, whom our Commonwealth police considered such a dangerous man that they advised the **Immigration** Department against granting him a permit to visit Australia in May 1972.

* Among the voluminous documents on Suljak and the Australian branch of the terrorist organisation UHNj, which have been tabled today in the Senate and which will be tabled in this place tomorrow, is a letter dated 30th May 1972 from  Mr Davis,  Commissioner of Commonwealth Police, to the Department of **Immigration**.

* A brochure produced by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of **Immigration** in August 1972 on Croatian extremist activities makes special reference to the UHNj, its organisation in Australia, its activities and its members.

* On 18th October 1972 the AssistantDirector of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of **immigration** recommended Marincic's deportation.

* In weighing up all the considerations, including Marincic's probable fate if he returned to Yugoslavia, the AssistantDirector said: 
In a long and carefully argued submission to the Minister for **Immigration** dated 12th November 1972,  Senator Greenwood  reversed the priorities as between the interests of Australia and those of an obvious Croatian terrorist in favour of the latter.

* Let me quote just one passage from this extraordinary letter from the then Attorney-General,  Senator Greenwood,  to the Minister for **Immigration** of the day.

* The chief law officer of Australia, the then Attorney-General, must have been familiar with the decision of the High Court in the case of Znaty v. The Minister of State for **Immigration** and Another reported in 1972 Argus Law Reports at page 545.

* Judgment in this case was delivered on 25th February 1972, that is, some 9 months prior to the letter to the Minister for **Immigration** urging him not to deport Marincic.

* If we assume that  Senator Greenwood  was familiar with this decision - surely he would not undertake to advise the Minister for **Immigration** without familiarising himself with the up-to-date state of the law regarding **immigration** matters - we can only reach one conclusion about this conduct in this matter: In order to protect a terrorist from deportation, he misinformed the Minister responsible for the issuance of a deportation order about the legal consequences for the terrorist of such an order.

* Fortunately, the Minister for **Immigration** did not grant Marie's application.

* For example, on 3rd December 1969 the Honourable Phillip Lynch, then Minister for **Immigration**, wrote to the then Attorney-General Hughes expressing:   .

* In a letter addressed to the AttorneyGeneral and the Minister for **Immigration** dated 6th January 1964, he wrote, in part: 
Recommendations have been made that certain persons be deported, not necessarily to the country from which they came.

* The Minister for **Immigration** makes the necessary orders.

* The matters I raised in this House were referred by the Minister for **Immigration** to the Director of Migration in Sydney.

* A conference was held with the girls concerned and representatives of the Good Neighbour Council and the Catholic **Immigration** Office.

* If we claim the right to dictate how the South Africans should handle their internal problems, cannot other countries by the same premise place boycotts and sanctions on Australia because they might claim that they do not like the way we treat our Aboriginals or that they do not like our **immigration** policy?

* -Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs)- Pursuant to section 42 (d) of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948-1973 1 present the annual return of persons granted certificates of Australian citizenship during the year ended 30 June 1 975.

* I have already written lo the honourable Ministers for Civil Aviation and **Immigration** and as well to the General Manager of Qantas but as yet I have nol received any reply.

* I believe that the Department of **Immigration** or the Department of Civil Aviation, if need be, should be investigating these agents.

* It is time the Department of Civil Aviation and the Department of **Immigration** did something to protect and to assist people in this category.

* I think that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  would agree that we cannot allow the present system to continue.

* Certainly the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  in another place knows, because he has been very competently operating in Senate committees himself.

* I have spoken with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr McKellar)  in regard to this case and I am raising the matter so that I can place on public record the extent to which people who are in the unfortunate situation of being in Australia and classified as prohibited immigrants are being exploited by people who should know better.

* I do not know who advised this person from Fiji to go to this solicitor, but apparently within the Fijian and Tongan community here in Australia, this solicitor, whose name I will reveal in a few moments, has a name for being able to do something with the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* All the solicitor was to do was to get an application form from my constituent to forward to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for the purpose of trying to get him permanent residency in Australia.

* Up to the present time that form has not been sent to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* If he did try to answer, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  as is his wont, would run back and forth to the table raising points of order.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** tried quietly to warn him.

* The Minister for Unemployment- I beg his pardon; he is called the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, but one would never know that labour is bis responsibility.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  refused even to consider the continuation of rural unemployment relief.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The proposed expenditure for the Department of **Immigration** for the coming, year is estimated at $71,274,000.

* During July the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  announced a series of new studies and investigations which the Government is initiating in the migration programme.

* At the outset I should like to give a brief survey of the history of the Australian **immigration** programme.

* The Minister described the programme in his publication **Immigration** in the Seventies' in these words: 
Perhaps I could go further and say that our **immigration** programme ranks as one of the great achievements of our time and is acknowledged as such by people of all shades of politics and thought in Australia today.

* The first Minister for **Immigration** was the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  who was sworn in on 1 3 th July 1945 during the time of the Chifley Government.

* The new Department of **Immigration**, according to a document issued by the first Minister at a later date, commenced with about 24 officers, 6 stationed in Canberra, 6 more in Melbourne and about 12 located in London, engaged almost exclusively in making arrangements for the British wives and children of Australian servicemen to come to Australia.

* On 17 th September 1970, in answer to a question I had directed to him the Minister for **Immigration** advised me that arrivals under the United Kingdom assisted passage scheme increased from 1,960 for the January-June period in 1947 to 69,035 in 1969-70.

* Recently the Minister announced the terms of a far reaching inquiry into all the ramifications of the **immigration** programme not, as he said, to curtail migration but rather, as he put it, to study certain aspects and allied matters that he mentioned to me in a letter which was just an endorsement of what he had already put out publicly.

* He said: 
A comprehensive review of the benefits and cost to Australia of **immigration** conducted on traditional patterns.

* The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment as consultants on the **immigration** programme, 
Convinced that increased population is vitalto the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding **immigration** programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* In recent times criticism has been made by some sections of the community of the demands of **immigration** on our economic capacity.

* This is not an unusual pattern because similar criticism was offered by critics of sustained **immigration** as long as a century ago.

* The Minister has not stated any individual names except those appointed to certain **immigration** committees.

* The **immigration** programme owes its success amongst other things to the united support of most of the major political parties of Australia.

* With this background I suggest to the Minister that in the interests of **immigration** and its further this inquiry should have been conducted by an all-party parliamentary commitee from both Houses of the National Parliament.

* Recently the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr Nixon)  announced the establishment of a coastal surveillance service for the protection of our fisheries and to assist with matters of concern to the Departments of Customs and Excise, Health and **Immigration**.

* -Briefly I want to raise a matter which concerns the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  and to some extent the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* We have been seeking to lay the basis, through consideration of a Green Paper, for an on-going **immigration** policy.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: 
Then the honourable member mentioned Indonesia.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  visited it last May.

* He told the National Press Club: 
All Social Security programs, including payments under the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children) Act and special benefits for people under maintenance guarantees and for refugees, cover migrants insofar as migrants are members of the Australian community.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  started his speech with a falsehood.

* What has happened in Australia is as a result of the Government's tariff decisions, the wage policies followed earlier by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the unreasonable growth in Government expenditure and the Government's foolish and incompetent policies in trying to overcome the difficulties that were created by its own mismanagement.

* The Department of **Immigration** computer records indicate that perhaps 960 or 1,000 people - that is all - came into Australia under that system, not 30,000.

* I further call upon the Opposition in this Parliament and particularly the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  who at one time was the minister of State for **Immigration**, to tell us in this Parliament what their reaction is to the advice that has been given to this Government, to the national Parliament and to the nation by the Queensland Minister for Justice,  Mr Knox  - that we should return to the past, that we should discriminate, that we should repeal all the things that have been done to abolish discrimination and put it all back again.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 September 1979: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
It is more than inflation; it is more than matters of productivity.

* I believe that for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who has a smile creasing his face, to contemplate the situation in Australia today for which he is responsible without any apparent concern is for him to commit the gravest fault against the memory of his own Party, but more significantly against his obligations to the Australian people.

* -Nothing that has been said should be taken as an indication that I think the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** or the Government looks with pleasure upon the present employment situation.

* I think it is worth pointing out that the previous Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  espoused the principle of indexation but he also insisted on including a plateau principle which, if implemented, would have totally destroyed all wage relativities presently in use.

* Again the sad fact is that the last 3 years have shown quite conclusively that the key which opened the Pandora's Box of our present problems was the decision taken early in 1973 by the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, supported by Cabinet, to intervene in the national wage case.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-As we are now dealing collectively with a number of clauses I shall deal quickly with some of those that I think require an explanation by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** because they refer not only to serious legal questions but also to serious practical consequences for the unions who must participate within this jurisdiction.

* Neither in the second reading speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** nor in anything we have heard in this Committee debate has the Minister justified the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal organisation in these fields.

* **Immigration** and sought the reasons why this man had been refused naturalisation.

* To the credit of the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  this mistake has been corrected and the man will be naturalised.

* Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs 
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** moving amendments to clause 3 of the Stevedoring Industry Charge Bill during the consideration in committee of the whole of an amendment requested by the Senate to the Bill.

* The right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  has a deserved reputation in the field of **immigration**.

* In summary, the new arrangements recently negotiated by this Government, and for which I accept responsibility as the Minister responsible for this portfolio, will involve, firstly, a change of sea contractor; secondly, the increased use of air transport by Qantas but no actual commitment to total air movement in the future; thirdly, the preservation of a choice of sea transport for those who prefer it; fourthly, a considerable saving in transport costs; and finally, in my own view and in the view of the most senior officers of my Department in Canberra with whom I have been in close consultation and of officers overseas with whom I have been in telephonic communication, no adverse effect will result to the total **immigration** programme.

* - Mr Speaker, I have moved this motion arising out of the refusal by a certain honourable member in this House to allow me to make a statement on **immigration**.

* But I can hardly remain silent today when again I am publicly misrepresented in respect of our **immigration** policy.

* I have been represented in the eyes of the Australian people as having misinterpreted or not knowing our **immigration** policy.

* 1 ) The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled "Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic" delivered by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 17 September 1972.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-As the Opposition has now turned the debate on this Bill into an attack on specific Government programs, I am more than happy to fall into line and follow the theme that has been established by my colleague the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  said, of course the Government is going to pour millions of dollars into Medibank to ensure that every man, woman and child is covered by a health scheme and not by the patched up job that existed under the control of 113 private health insurance companies.

* I pay tribute to actions taken by previous governments and refer to the **immigration** reforms of Prime Minister Holt and the May 1967 referendum.

* We will see the end of these vicious, nasty, racist, **immigration** groups who took such a role in the last election campaign in the electorate of Riverina.

* There is a need for special orientation, lt has been suggested by speakers at **immigration** conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage women to participate; that women teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, **immigration** is one of the few subjects on which Government and Opposition members agree pretty much on all aspects.

* I hope that, in the cost/ benefit analysis which the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  has arranged - for which I congratulate him - these questions which I would like to have dealt with will be answered.

* Going back over the history of **immigration**.

* But I believe the motives for **immigration** have changed since those years.

* One of the problems is that we cannot control the flow of **immigration** by, as it were, turning the tap on and turning the tap off.

* I am also concerned about the problems which are arising within the' Yugoslav community in Australia because, as I recollect, when this legislation was foreshadowed and the **immigration** agreement with Yugoslavia was entered into a year or so ago the arrangement was that we were to receive a very large number of skilled tradesmen migrants.

* I think there are some things in the Bill and some attitudes about our **immigration** policy that can be altered.

* the problem of increasing the skilled work force 'will not be solved by- raising the **immigration** target in order to acquire more craftsmen from overseas, although anything that can be done to increase the proportion of skilled persons among immigrants will be useful'.

* I  have helped in settling some Asian migrants and generally the Department of **Immigration** has been helpful, effective and speei.lv.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who I understand will follow me in this debate, led farmers in Australia to believe that the Government would provide - I use those words deliberately - $500m at 3 per cent.

* Minister for **Immigration** before the election and deliberately so, in what has happened with revaluation compensation.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
-The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  did not make a proper speech last year.

* -On a number of occasions the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has brought similar legislation before this House.

* -The indulgence of the chair is granted to the Minister for Labour and **Immigration** to enable him to clarify a matter.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
in reply - 'The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay),  on behalf of the Opposition, has supported the measure.

* If they in fact engage in activities here which bring them to the notice of Australian courts I will invoke the full powers that are vested in me, as Minister for **Immigration**, to see them on their way.

* I want to make it quite clear that as Minister for **Immigration** I treated his case in no way different from anyone else's case.

* -I have been asked to accept questions on behalf of the Minister for **Immigration**, who I think is still ill.

* The **immigration** powers enable the Minister to deal appropriately with any such cases which come to notice.

* In the 2 1 years since the Migration Act was passed the character of the Australian community has markedly changed, with radical amendment to **immigration** policies and in the volume and nature of movements into and out of Australia.

* Most travellers respect Australia's **immigration** laws.

* Unfortunately, there are some who enter or remain illegally in Australia, regarding breaches of **immigration** laws and policies as offences of small significance.

* Clearly, people who try to evade **immigration** controls should gain no advantage over those many others who, being also ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules.

* It believes that **immigration** laws and procedures should be observed and followed just as any other Australian law should be observed.

* **Immigration** restrictions applied mainly to people of non-European origin.

* By 1 973 discrimination on grounds of race had disappeared from **immigration** selection policy.

* The present level of **immigration** for settlement is relatively low, with an emphasis on encouraging only those skills in short supply.

* In this regard, I draw the attention of honourable members to the Minister's statement, '**Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population', of 7 June 1978 which emphasised the Government's recognition of **immigration** as a necessary element in economic growth.

* We are pursuing a longterm approach to population building in which **immigration** is the only directable factor.

* The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend an effective **immigration** policy and program to all persons who genuinely have the future welfare of this nation in mind.

* The relatively low volume of admission for settlement in more recent years inevitably prompts attempts to circumvent **immigration** policies and procedures either by malpractice or by entering for allegedly temporary purposes but then staying on without authority.

* A visa is a document or notation specifically in the form of a stamped impression in a passport which informs the carrier company and **immigration** officer at the port of arrival in Australia that the holder, prima facie, may enter Australia.

* The search for persons who breach the **immigration** law is an expensive and an unwanted burden on the Australian taxpayer.

* Honourable members will recall that on 10 August 1978 the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs announced that from that date prohibited immigrants who had been deported from Australia for any reason would be barred from re-entering Australia for a period of five years, except in the most compelling circumstances.

* A number of these provisions arose out of the recommendations of a management review which reported on its investigation of **immigration** policies and procedures in July of last year.

* The Government believes that the Bill will provide for a considerable increase in control capacity while new **immigration** legislation is being developed.

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Some time ago the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** mentioned that a projection of unemployment for the January period suggested that the maximum level would be about 400 000.

* I expect that it is fair enough to make the comment here that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator 
I hope that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will come into the chamber during the course of my speech because I have had them both told that I intend to say something reflecting upon the administration of their Departments.

* I knew this on the basis of departmental published figures and from what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** had said in this House in regard to those published figures.

* That figure obviously shows something is wrong, but it is seen to be even more revealing when one considers the statement of the Minister for Labor and **immigration**, who I see is now at the table.

* -I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* To set against the many benefits of **immigration** there are costs in education, housing and transport which are real factors for State governments even though the cost of **immigration** itself is a minor element in total Commonwealth expenditure.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 
-Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** been drawn to a letter issued by an insurance company in which that company threatens employees with loss of employment if they fail to sign petitions opposing the Australian Government Insurance Corporation?

* In his second reading speech the Minister for **Immigration** and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  stated clearly that this Bill provides for grants to the States in respect of the interest and sinking fund charges on a parcel of State debts amounting to SI, 000m.

* I will read from the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and the Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch).

* There are now 3 honourable members - the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  - who have some concern for primary industries.

* Perhaps this is because the Prime Minister believes that in relation to rural matters, primary industry leaders and the Ministers for **Immigration** and Northern Development are always wrong.

* Strange to relate, as the honourable member for McMillan pointed out quite rightly - I have mentioned this matter before time after time in this Committee - the past **immigration** programme has depended and the future **immigration** programme still is depending on secondary industries to provide employment for new settlers coming to Australia.

* I asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  whom I informed that I would be speaking today, to take a personal interest in this matter because it is absolutely ridiculous that these people who have been given hope that they would be retrained after losing their jobs are continuing to sit at home awaiting word from the Government as to whether or not they have been accepted for retraining.

* I trust that the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  who is at the table and who I notice is greatly alarmed at the revelations that I have made in the House today, will tell both the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  that they had better read the grievance day debate today because Cameron said something of note again.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What reports, excluding annual reports, have been produced by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, by authorities for which the Minister is responsible, and by ad hoc commissions, committees, task forces, etc., within the Minister's portfolio, since 5 December 1972.

* We are not getting any help - so far, at any rate - from the promise of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  of a loan of $500m at an interest rate of 3 per cent to he!p primary producers out of their difficulty.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has been at the table in the chamber recently boasting of the increases in the work force, patting himself on the back for this and saying that so many of the additions to the work force are married women.

* When the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** gets up in this chamber and boasts that because of these economic stresses these women with young families have been forced to take employment which they would not take of their own choice, I find it, if I may say so, a little distasteful.

* -At the outset I would like to say on behalf of Opposition members that we welcome the statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on this very important matter.

* I trust that the ensuing debate at least will lead to consideration of vital questions of policy in the future and will lead, to some degree, to solutions to the problems which we will have to face in the short term and the long term in relation to population policy, **immigration** and community affairs.

* He also says that **immigration** also has declined dramatically in recent times.

* What we must ask is whether the fertility and **immigration** slow-down is temporary.

* Why is **immigration** more limited at the present time than it has been in the past?

* Let us look at **immigration**.

* If we did accept the assumption of the Minister- I suggest at this point that the assumption is still very questionable indeed- that fertility rates are declining and will continue inevitably to decline and that the major way in which the Government can affect the composition of Australia's population is through regulating the level and composition of **immigration**, a whole series of other factors needs to be taken into account.

* Firstly, the rationale that the Minister presents in terms of **immigration** is one largely of turning the tap on when we need them and turning the tap off when the economic circumstances do not permit their ready integration into the workforce.

* Since **immigration** levels are determined largely by government decision, predictions must be based on political forethought.

* Australia's capability of managing various levels of **immigration** in relation to overall population size to date has largely been determined by political economy factors, particularly the capacity of many industrialists to seek cheaper labour and bigger markets.

* Indeed, the Minister for **Immigration**, on page 9 of his statement stated: 
Yes, it may be true that there was a national consensus in 1945 upon **immigration** for those purposes.

* For instance, one of the major characteristics of Australia in terms of **immigration** is its highly industrialised nature and the roles that immigrants are expected to play within the work force.

* When traditional British and Western European sources of **immigration** have declined Australia has had to recruit migrants from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower.

* The result of this **immigration** policy, sustained and continued by the Liberal and National Country Parties for something like 20 years, of the distribution of ethnic groups is very much now mirrored in terms of their distribution within occupations and the class nature of Australia.

* In this regard I refer to a study made by  Mr Steven 
**Immigration** labour has provided a significant and growing proportion of the workforce and almost all Australian industries.

* There would have been a decline in numbers working in manufacturing by some 20 per cent in the absence of **immigration**.

* According to a study undertaken in September 1 975 by what was then called the Department of Labor and **Immigration** entitled 'Migrants in the Work Force', the major occupation group in which migrants are employed is the broad and statistically unsatisfactory group of 'tradesman, production process workers, labourers, etc' which together contain 45 per cent of migrant workers compared with 29 per cent of Australian born workers.

* In so far as community tensions are concerned, the Minister contends that it is universally agreed that the **immigration** program has been of enormous benefit to Australia.

* I turn now to the rationale for **immigration**.

* In his ministerial statement the Minister suggested that the Government should maintain its position as stated in a policy statement on **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* He talked about **immigration** being an instrument of Australia's population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those national policies are directed.

* I believe that this is a commitment to population growth with **immigration** as a prime factor in that growth.

* I believe that need should be one of the most important factors when embarking upon any further **immigration** programs.

* I would also like to make some comments very shortly about the structure of the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council which has been restructured in the terms outlined by the Minister in his statement.

* If we are to have **immigration** programs we should have **immigration** programs that strive for respect, equity and fairness for the individual and that reflect as far as possible respect for and the diversity of values and life styles.

* Let me pay a little attention to the structure of the newly formed Australian Population and **Immigration** Council, to which I have made reference.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs suggests that it is to be bipartisan.

* Nevertheless, many misleading statements have been made and our friend the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has certainly been well to the fore in this.

* I do not know what honourable members think about that but it appears to me that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and the Minister for **Immigration** seem to be having most of the say.

* Whenever something favourable is about to be announced, of course we read the country Press and see statements made by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* A few weeks ago when the postal rates were adjusted, affecting chiefly country newspapers, the Minister for **Immigration** was very quick on the draw.

* I submit that on this occasion the first the Minister for **Immigration** knew about the alteration in postal rates affecting country newspapers was when the honourable member for Gippsland  (Mr Nixon)  presented the case in this place.

* Yet the Minister for **Immigration** was very quick to rush around and suggest that he had been doing a wonderful thing for the country newspapers.

* We all realise that the one-eyed Minister for **Immigration** must be pretty quick on the draw to get the publicity that he requires.

* The Caucus 'rural rump', headed by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  overwhelmingly defeated Cabinet's recommendation agreed to earlier this week.

* This article, of course, did not mention the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Who is controlling primary industry - the Minister for **Immigration**, the Minister for Primary Industry, the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, the Caucus, the rural rump, or even you,  Mr Speaker?

* Talking about credit - I will conclude on this point - the Minister for **Immigration** has been very vocal on this subject.

* The Minister for **Immigration** informs me that he has no objection.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We are also farewelling 3 former Ministers -the right honourable member for Fisher,  Sir Charles  Adermann, and the honourable members for McPherson, the  Hon.

* I can assure him that as the first Minister for **Immigration** and the one who laid the foundations ofour **immigration** programme we have to thank him for initiating the programme and for ensuring that it has been successful up to the present time.

* I am sorry, the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  who is at the table is a member of the Country Party but the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  was previously at the table and I thought he was in the House.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, who is sitting at the table, may be making, a rough note that the small businesses make up the number.

* Honourable members opposite should turn their minds to that matter instead of making stupid comparisons, as the honourable member for 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
It is revealing to see who this Government is prepared to sacrifice first in this image-making exercise.

* It is now the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* That is the question that ought to be answered by the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Ellicott)  or the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* But before I outline the ways in which the cuts have had this effect, it is worth noting the views of the present Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs when the Racial Discrimination Act was debated on 8 April 1975 and he was speaking for the then Opposition.

* Are we to believe that significant modification to **immigration** policy could occur only some time in 1966?

* For the first time Australia indicated that it was ready to deal with the non-aligned and with Asia and Africa on their own terms, without racial discrimination in **immigration** policy and without overriding military preoccupation.

* I raised the question of interpreter services in State government administration and health and legal institutions with State ministers for **immigration** at a conference on 11 May 1973.

* The **Immigration** Advisory Council has established a subcommittee to study the problem of interpreter services in the community.

* I am wondering now what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  would have to say if an already married member of Parliament returned from Bali, Djakarta or somewhere else and asked for the admission into Australia of a wife whom he had acquired or wooed and won in some foreign place.

* Perhaps this is a delightful and new way to get around our **immigration** laws and to build up our population.

* In reply to the honourable member I might say that he has given distinguished service as a member of the **Immigration** Advisory Council and I am very pleased to have a question from him on a matter which obviously interests him and most other members of the Parliament.

* Let us look at the other basic omission from the statement- the **immigration** issue.

* Surely we would hope that this Minister would have the capacity to produce something a little stronger than the cold and pious answer the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave me last Wednesday when he said that he would 'react positively and humanely to situations which may occur'.

* Is it not the case that the Australian High Commissioner there is not able to process **immigration** cases without bringing staff" from Athens?

* The people who live in the new Mallee electorate will not have easy access to departmental offices, such as those concerned with health, **immigration**, housing and repatriation.

* The matter was drawn to my attention when I recently saw a handout from the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in which articles from the ethnic press are summarised.

* and (2) The information on which such records could be maintained is not available to the Department; as the Committee on Social Patterns of the **Immigration** Advisory Council noted in its report on the departure of settlers from Australia in October 1967, for various reasons some settlers do not declare themselves as such when leaving.

* The numbers who departed before the expiry of 2 years and who fulfilled the requirements outlined above for the period January 1965 to June 1970, as recorded by the Department of **Immigration**, are shown in the following table: 
There is no question that there is a tremendous amount of confusion in the Lebanese community about the Government's policies and particularly about the administration of those policies.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in an expression worthy of his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  'the full global situation' of persons of quasi refugee status- that is about as dehumanising a phrase as I can think of- talked about the selectivity of the Australian Labor Party when it was in power.

* Anybody who has had any dealings with the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and with the distressing situation of relatives in Australia knows that people who go to Cyprus stay there and month after month are told to report back again and again to the High Commissioner there.

* The letter which the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  tabled points up one of the demands of the Lebanese community in Melbourne, that there ought to be additional interpreter staff within the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs available to assist sponsors in this country who are concerned about their relatives in the Lebanon or who have escaped from the Lebanon.

* The administration of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra and its regional offices, at least to my knowledge in Sydney, has been much less than adequate.

* I know that my relatively less well-off constituents have no difficulty in telephoning Nicosia daily to hear reports of their relatives' applications but the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in Australia is forever losing files and unable to be brought up to date.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-The honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  has put up a few arguments as to why the Bill should be carried.

* He paid a very fine tribute to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, in his second reading speech, said that the number of trade unions in Australia has been slowly declining.

* Our population from **immigration** alone has increased by at least 3 million.

* I am sure that the major financial difficulties of State governments flow directly from the Commonwealth's **immigration** policy, whereby it spends more than S50m a year to bring migrants here only to dump them mercilessly, relentlessly and unceremoniously into the laps of State governments to nurture, house, educate and employ them, without any consideration for the ability or otherwise of the authorities which must of necessity be the final link in a migrant's rehabilitation in his new country - the local government authorities.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* What is the Government's **immigration** programme for 1970 and 1971?

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What were the production errors which caused the **immigration** booklet 'Employment'  to  be withdrawn from circulation in 1971.

* Deportation orders were subsequently confirmed by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* They were given back their jobs even though the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs forced them to take seven weeks ' leave.

* A few minutes ago the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  attempted to chastise - if I may use a kindly term - the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  for not talking about remedies.

* A while ago the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said that the honourable member for Wannon was all talk.

* In other parts of the world we find, for example, that after the formation of Israel in 1948 the **immigration** intake reached 239,000 per annum in 1949 on a base population of only 800,000.

* However, attention has already been drawn to the fact that **immigration** in Australia appears to be at the crossroads.

* If I may say so without undue congratulation, I think our Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  is characteristically attuned to the tempo of the times in that he has inaugurated or is inaugurating a fairly wide ranging series of investigations to which the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  amongst others, previously drew attention.

* This seems to be, from all reports, something which the Department of **Immigration** is pursuing consistently.

* Finally, because I have to allow other members to make a short speech in this debate, I suggest that the problem of the crossroads position of the **immigration** programme as it is seen by some is near enough to being real.

* I have already mentioned that the Department of **Immigration** has been responsible for the establishment of embassies in certain countries to suit its needs notwithstanding that there may be no other adequate reasons for having posts in those countries.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social Security, offices of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, welfare offices and community centres.

* Let me assure the honourable gentlemen that within a week consultations were held- quiet, constructive consultations, I might add, without the issuance of Press statements and the grabbing of headlineswith the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland).

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration** 
The Government acknowledges the favourable impact which **immigration** has had on Australia's economic and cultural development.

* Consistent with this view the Government has decided on a target of 70 000 persons for the **immigration** program for 1976-77, compared with the estimated intake of 50 000 in 1975-76.

* Salaries in the Special Reports Branch of the Department of **Immigration** amount to $67,195.

* All authorities were established by statute as independent advisory bodies to Government and, except for the Canada Employment and **Immigration** Commission, all functioned independently of Government Departments.

* Some authorities, in addition to their advisory role, had the responsibility to undertake executive action in the administration of programs- Canada Employment and **Immigration** Commission, the Federal Employment Institute (the Federal Republic of Germany) and Manpower Services Commission (the United Kingdom).

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** aware that the Prime Minister told this House on 20 November that the Government may advise overseas students that it is their  duty to go back to the country which gave them their basic education but that it does not deport those students and that if students choose to remain in Australia they will be permitted to stay?

* I support totally the refugee policy of the Government and believe that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has handled this sensitive issue in a proper, positive and compassionate manner.

* In the area of my portfolio, **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the cuts are particularly savage.

* I remember all the hypocrisy of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when the scheme was about to be continued.

* A Sydney journalist, Peter Durisch writing in the  Inside Column  in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of 3 July, quotes what he calls a senior Government source as saying: 
Does the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs still stand by his public statements that in allowing Vietnamese refugees to come into Australia, Australia's health and quarantine standards will be maintained?

* I followed the matter through to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* On 7 November 1977, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs replied to me: 
Further correspondence ensued.

* On 28 March 1978, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs told me in a letter - 
The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs told me on 28 March 1978 that special arrangements had existed since 1920.

* It is not enough for the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and his counterpart in New Zealand to set up departmental inquiries and then make the assessment that because approximately 400,000 people travel between the two countries we should ignore the problem.

* It never sees it as the result of taxation policy which destroys incentive or its **immigration** policy.

* The adjustments to the **immigration** program have taken account of changes in the level and structure of employment demand.

* They were industrial affairs - 1 am sure the Labor Party has not forgotten about that one; defence; **immigration** - the honourable member lor Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  would not have forgotten that one; cities and decentralisation; education; and health.

* -(Warringah-Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs)- Pursuant to section 42 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 I present the annual return to Parliament of persons granted Australian citizenship during the year ended 30 June 1977.

* We ought to commend the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for the way in which he has gone about his task.

* The present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will not have to confess to a future parliament, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  had to confess this afternoon, his inadequacy and neglect in this very important field, because the Minister and this Government have taken the initiative to try to cure some of these ills.

* I support the proposition put forward by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The honourable member for Wimmera will address the Minister as the Minister for **Immigration** and not as the honourable member for Riverina.

* Applications by Asians in Uganda will continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with our non-European **immigration** policies.

* My main reason in rising to participate in this Committee debate is to express my concern at the deliberate attempts by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is sitting at the table, to downgrade the responsibilities of this Parliament.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  several times tried to explain parts of the Budget Speech by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean).

* At the time apparently the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  was leading for the then Opposition.

* It is also interesting to note that the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** at one stage said: 1 point out that one thing the Government could do is allow the people who make bricks, cement, roofing tiles and the host of things that go towards the building of a home to write off in their income tax returns the cost of the machinery in one year.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
When the honourable member for Melbourne finishes his prattle I will complete my speech.

* The confusion in this respect is similar to the confused situation which reigns in the field of **immigration** at the present time in that the Minister for Labour appears to be adopting a different line from the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Let me deal with the record.

* The main reasons for the increase were the economic and **immigration** policies commenced by the Chifley Government and outlined in the White Paper on Full Employment in 1945 and subsequent studies.

* The activities of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction - and let me say that the hidden remnants of that postwar reconstruction have been hidden in the archives of the Minister for Trade and Industry's Department over these long years - and the Department of **Immigration** saw Australia's early post-war development off to a good start.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: 
1 ) How many persons have applied for **immigration** to Australia since 1 January 1979.

* How many persons have been accepted for **immigration** since 1 January 1979. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
1 ) Has his recent move to increase the **immigration** quota by 20 000 persons provoked the comment in some sectors, that it is a deliberate attempt to increase the pool of unemployed.

* Will the increased quota mean that compassionate **immigration** for people from countries such as Lebanon will be made more accessible.

* The few criticisms which he made were directed in the form of questions to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* the **Immigration** (Education) Bill 197i gave evidence of general agreement with 2 assumptions.

* When we consider the problems that face us in the area of migrant education we cannot escape the conclusion that Australia's post war **immigration** program has been irresponsibly administered in the area of migrant child education, in the area of migrant adult education, and in the area of migrant integration.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
I turn now to the provision which makes taxable profits on the sale of certain assets within 12 months.

* I am glad that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is present.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-The person primarily responsible for family reunion, as the honourable member knows, is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The family reunion matter, as I said, is for the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Did the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** state on 17 September 1 972, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, that in order to give citizens protection against possible unjust or inaccurate use of ASIO reports a Labor Government would establish an administrative court of appeals to review administrative decisions, decisions made on security grounds, to lay down regulations governing the conduct of members of ASIO and other security organisations and to hear, determine and report to Parliament on the breach of any such regulations.

* If such a decision has not been taken, what action has there been to carry out the reviews as proposed by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** or to lay down the regulations proposed by him.

* The former Minister for Health would be well advised to stay quiet in view of the ineffectual way in which he handled matters affecting health and is now handling **immigration** matters.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  now talks about a scheme to help with unemployment relief.

* What I said was that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has been talking about unemployment relief.

* It is a further irony that the 3 saboteurs of the parliamentary system, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  should be the very people who come before this House in this censure debate to now seek to defend that system.

* It was, after all, the Prime Minister who prevented the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** from apologising to the Chair.

* It was, after all, the Prime Minister who prevented the Leader of the House from moving the suspension of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
In this instance I am not speaking about the great number of older Australians who have already lost their jobs.

* I speak particularly about the school leavers who face this dim and unwelcome prospect, a prospect which has been clearly spelt out by all speakers- clearly spelt out by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  himself when he revealed that as an estimate there will be 400 000 people out of work by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

* Taking advantage of the very short time that is available to me, I remind the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who has just spoken that the Australian Council of Trade Unions is in a state of complete eruption over the Minister's policies.

* Not a great deal of time has been allotted for the debate on the estimates for the Department of Labour and the Department of **Immigration**.

* I wish to direct my remarks to the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and to express a point of view.

* While there I took the opportunity to talk with our **immigration** officers in every country there in which Australia is represented.

* The officers to whom I spoke conformed to the pattern that I have come to expect from officers of the Department of **Immigration**.

* One aspect of it is the training of trade union officials, for which the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has carried the torch, as it were.

* It is an important step, an important part of a total program for which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is entitled to receive absolute credit and the praise of the community.

* -I have not had the chance to reply to the mauling that was given to me by my namesake, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  when he referred to the fact that the bull system was abolished in 1944 and not 1928.

* I might say on this general question of the departure of migrants from Australia that the figures for 1970-71 recently published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that about 28,000 migrants left Australia or stated that they were leaving Australia permanently, have to be seen against the very high level of **immigration** that we have had in the last 3 years.

* However, the Government is not complacent about this question and I have asked the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council, which undertook a previous study of settlers departing from Australia to undertake a further study to ascertain whether there is anything that we can do to reduce the rate of outflow of permanent settlers from Australia.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**: Is he aware that in the State of Victoria and, in fact, throughout Australia there is a vast number of Aborigines registered with his Department awaiting employment?

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  in moving the second reading of this Bill indicated that he thought that it was a simple measure and a purely procedural matter.

* I would have thought that this situation is one which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would have relished as a challenge to put the situation in Australia's hands.

* For the information of honourable members I present a paper entitled 'Multiculturalism and its Implications for **Immigration** Policy' prepared jointly by the 
Australian Population and **Immigration** Council and the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council together with a text of a statement relating to the paper.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1978: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question.

* Is it correct that there has been a change in the Government's **immigration** policy, as reported in the Melbourne 'Age' this morning?

* Is it also correct to say that the Government has re-started the **immigration** program?

* However, because of the fact that various pastoral finance companies and houses are finding more money for loan funds in this industry, and of course others, I thought it only right, in view of the incredible remarks of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  a moment ago, to remind him again - it must be 3 months since I have - that it was his promise during the last election campaign to make $500m available at, from memory, 3 per cent per annum interest.

* There is the financial implication that the Minister for **Immigration** should wake up to, even if he cannot see it.

* Just a few minutes ago he made the statement by implication that the primary producers are better off because he is sitting there as Minister for **Immigration**.

* Officers of theDepartment of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Business and Consumer Affairs stepping up at departure points identification checks of children who are accompanied by only one parent; 
This apparently is a reference to a speech entitled Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic' delivered by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 1 7 September 1 972.

* United States of America: **Immigration** Inquiries at Australian Government Offices (Question No.

* 782) 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Before dealing with the subject matter of the debate I would like to reply to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who made another one of his wild statements during which he looks vaguely across the chamber and cannot remember the names of any of the honourable members sitting opposite him.

* I have served with the honourable member for Grayndler on the **immigration** committee of the Australian Labor Party and I can assure the House that there has never been any division between us on that committee on any issue.

* But it is not surprising, because  Mr Robert  S. Clark - who runs one of the most racist organisations in this country, the **Immigration** Control Association, and who mainly specialises in helping the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  to beat  Mr St  John for representation in this Parliament - is a prominent member of the Liberal Party in the electorate of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and one of his most prominent helpers.

* The Labor Party has stated quite clearly in its policy on **immigration** that one of the points to be taken into consideration is whether any frictions will arise.

* I do not consider that being described as being cosmopolitan, as the Minister for **Immigration** described certain members of the Opposition - if that means not being extremely nationalistic - is an insult as the Minister and the Russians do.

* It was in regard to a statement made by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on family reunions involving East Timorese.

* It states: 
In referring to this passage, I am not necessarily putting the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in the same category as that well known character, Shylock.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1979: 
Thus in both trade and passports Australia is known to be defying United Nations resolutions of May 1968 and earlier and reaffirmed and reinforced as recently as 18th March by the Security Council.

* In answer to the honourable member for Chisholm, the former Minister for **Immigration** in effect apologised for having to follow United Nations resolutions on Rhodesian passports and said that there was certainly regret on his part in having to do so.

* We may know how insignificant is his position as  chairman  of the Liberal Party's **immigration** committee.

* Have they ever had to go to a department of **immigration** in any country and ask for a special tax stamp, when they could not speak Japanese, Italian or French?

* We 'foreigners in Australia' are expecting all those people who do not speak English, or is it Austraiian, to find out where our Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs office is.

* Nowhere in any of our international airports do we find a sign telling people where the **immigration** office or the customs office is situated.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made a statement before the debate on the Bill commenced.

* After introducing the Bill and it being before the Parliament for a couple of weeks, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has had to add to his second reading speech.

* I do not want the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to explain the departure tax.

* Mr Treasurer  - 
Did he receive advice from the former Minister for **Immigration** that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of **Immigration** to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports 
If so, has he been advised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** no longer intends to open in Parramatta an office specialising in migrant affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1979: 
Has he recevied special representations from the United States or Thai Governments or any other source regarding **immigration** of those persons known as the hill people from Laos, recruited by the US CIA during the Indochina conflict.

* That easy-visa-system was set aside by the previous but one Minister for **Immigration**- he was then the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameronand when we came to office we decided that the only way to overcome the situation of a large number of people residing illegally in Australia was to declare an amnesty.

* That is my answer to the interjection of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I am glad that the Minister for **Immigration** has come into the chamber, because there are one or two things that I would like to say to him.

* The Department of **Immigration** occupies an old and almost dilapidated building opposite the Adelaide railway marshalling yards.

* Let us consider what the Minister for the Interior has said in this chamber about votes for 18-year-olds and compare that with the speech which was delivered on his behalf by the Minister for **Immigration** over 12 months ago.

* I turn to a question in relation to the latest unemployment figures that was asked in the Senate by  Senator Everett  on 9 September and answered by  Senator James  McClelland, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* But that is the problem which I faced when I was the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* One very senior member of the Department of Labour and **Immigration** decided to give his own wife a NEAT training allowance, and other senior officers of my Department gave relatives and friends NEAT allowances under the scheme.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
'Thousands of workers', the honourable member for Franklin interjects.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and I have had discussions on this matter.

* That is the way I see it and that is the way the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** also sees it.

* In speaking to the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** I wish to bring a few matters to the notice of the Committee.

* Their beneficial effect to our style of living since the commencement of the **immigration** program in 1949 is well known to all of us and is welcomed.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1978: 
1 ) What occupations listed in the Approved List of Occupations for **Immigration** dated 1 September 1978 are directly involved in mining.

* There was a word of sense in what was attributed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  recently, when he was reported to have said that more women should stay in the homes and produce children.

* It has been suggested in some quarters that the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** might be reduced, that the expenditure should be down as the intake is down and that somehow Parkinson's law should apply.

* Mr Parkinson  does not work in the Department of **Immigration**.

* The estimates under consideration are not merely those of the Department of **Immigration** because our Department covers not only **immigration** but also emigration, settlement and welfare, citizenship and population.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* In view of the unemployment problems in Western Australia, will the Minister investigate the possibility of immediately curtailing further Commonwealth **immigration** to Western Australia except of those persons who have guaranteed employment and housing or to reunite families and will not displace or add to the employment difficulties of people who are already citizens of Australia?

* Will he make the additional funds obtained by the curtailment of **immigration** available for relief in the unemployment area until unemployment is relieved?

* by leave -  Mr Speaker,  one of the major new **immigration** initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of migrants into the Australian community.

* The Australian Council will be chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** or another officer of the Department appointed by the Minister, and it will be constituted by the Director of the Australian Trade Union Training College, 3 representatives of the Australian Council for Trade Unions, one representative from each of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and one representative each from the 6 State Labor Councils.

* The Authority will be responsible to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Bill envisages, in clause 9, that councils for union training may need to be set up in the future in the 
Minister for **Immigration**; Extra-departmental Advisory Organisations  (Question No.

* I therefore welcome this ministerial statement by the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar),  the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, on home savings grants.

* One must comment, therefore, in this debate on the initiative which was undertaken by the FraserAnthony Government soon after December of last year to decrease interest rates by 1 per cent This decision, taken with the whole package announced by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, gives positive proof that we are concerned about the housing needs of the Australian people and that we totally oppose the philosophy of the Labor administration which said that the Australian people would have to get used to the idea of living in smaller homes.

* The sad thing about it is that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  .

* My Department and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs attempt to make dual nationals aware of the problems they might encounter on return to their country of birth or ethnic origin.

* The report of the Joint Committee was referred to an interdepartmental committee drawn from the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney-General and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* -In similar vein I want to ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to clarify several matters.

* Careful **immigration** programs and selection process of course are major factors in smooth racial inter-relations in Australia.

* Therefore, I believe it is very important to consider the basis of **immigration** into a country when faced with problems such as those covered by the Bill.

* Problems of discrimination can be engendered by **immigration** policy.

* An essential precondition for the solution of such problems within a community such as Australia's is adequate control of **immigration**.

* One can agree or disagree with our **immigration** policies of the past but, taken in the broad and in no sense complacently, we have every reason to be enormously thankful for the capacity of newcomers to integrate and assist in the development of a fuller, more tolerant, more vigorous and more sophisticated Australian society.

* In my view it is essential that future **immigration** policies recognise the inherent sovereignty of the host country in the control of the movement of people into that country.

* I have spent some little time on **immigration** aspects of the Bill and I have pointed out that the control of the **immigration** flow, whilst essential, does not solve the problems already existing.

* Recently I have had discussions with my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, about the future needs of his Department for Commonwealth hostel accommodation.

* In relation to the protected zone provisions permitting freedom of movement by the local people in the carrying on of traditional activities, the treaty will provide for co-operation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements.

* In relation to the Protected Zone provisions which will permit the continued performance of traditional activities by the local peoples and continued freedom of movement about the Zone for that purpose, there will be cooperation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements, although each country will retain the right to implement national controls to prevent abuses or other possible adverse effects of the Protected Zone provisions.

* It is quite incongruous that parliamentary committees examine all major aspects of government such as foreign affairs, defence, environment, **immigration**, public works and expenditure, yet there has been no inquiry into energy by any committee of this Parliament.

* Taking no decisive steps to curb inflation which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has warned could reach the incredible height of 35 per cent per annum; 
-The Minister refers to Queensland.

* Advertisements such as the one I have in my hand appeared in most of the Australian newspapers showing a photograph of the former Minister for **Immigration**.

* Before dealing with the amendment that is before the chamber, which asks the Government to set up a joint select committee to inquire into **immigration**, I would like to congratulate the chamber - by that I mean honourable members on both sides of the chamber - on being embarrassed by the speech of the Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns).

* Then over the last 1 or 2 years an attack developed on the **immigration** programme, combining often contradictory economic growth arguments and so-called quality of life arguments.

* We have others arguing that in fact **immigration** is increasing our gross national product at too great a rate and that all that matters is the so-called quality of life.

* This argument ignores the fact that most of the problems mentioned are problems in all industrial societies, even those with no **immigration**.

* As the attacks on **immigration** increase both sides of the House might decide that it would be politically dangerous to defend **immigration**, no matter what the facts proved.

* This tendency to bi-partisanship, or what I would call me-too-ism, has been attached to **immigration** for a long time, but it is not peculiar to **immigration** as far as political issues in this country are concerned.

* It has been helped by the fact that Government leaders until recently have been urging another dream, that of getting bigger and bigger, and secondly that the Government has no information on a cost-benefit basis on **immigration**.

* As recently as  1969  the then Treasurer, who is now Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  was asked a question on the costs of **immigration** by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin).

* I was sorry for the Minister when, as Minister for **Immigration**, he had to defend the Government's **immigration** programme at a summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science earlier this year.

* The people there were antagonistic towards him and the **immigration** programme and he was unable to produce appropriate figures to defend it.

* It was the fault of the Government which has been in office for  22  years and has not properly analysed its **immigration** programme.

* Before concluding I wish to refer to a matter which specifically affects migrants although it is not strictly within the administration of the Department of **Immigration**.

* -I realise that I am not dealing with a function of the Department of **Immigration**, but surely it is concerned about the way migrants look at Australia and their expectations, whether they feel that Australia is giving them a fair go.

* To summarise, let us not accept as factual the belief of those people who blame a whole host of modern problems on migrants, thereby providing a unique Australian analysis of problems that in fact characterise most advanced industrialised societies, most- of which do not have **immigration** programmes, anyway, as the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  pointed out.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration** Ministers at their last meeting for legislative or administrative action by (a) the 
I rise this evening in the adjournment debate to draw the attention of the House to some of the inadequacies of the way in which the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is handling the important issue of the debate on population policy.

* It is advocated rightly by the Minister and those who spoke in the debate on the Green Paper that it should be a matter of - 
The Minister made a speech- he did not advise me that he was going to deliver his speech, so I suppose it is par for the course- and he talked about the decline in the growth rate of the labour force without **immigration**.

* I think that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who is so close to the labour movement, should do most to ensure that those bans are removed.

* The policy states: 
The Minister refers to the advantages that will come through the Department of **Immigration** being combined with the Department of Labor.

* There are many problems of migrants which the Department of Labor and **Immigration** is illequipped to deal with.

* I do not believe that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** would have the sensitivity and the understanding to be aware of these problems.

* That is one of the reasons why we want the Department of **Immigration** to remain and maintain its separate identity.

* There are real problems which the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  will deal with for the Opposition parties, and they are not best dealt with by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
'Ha, ha' says the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who has recently returned from his jaunt abroad.

* I am delighted to see that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has such boisterous enthusiasm for such a curious proposal.

* No doubt the Minister's display in this matter will confirm the suspicion that a number of us on this side have, and that is that the Minister has a fancy to indulge in erraticism 
I also inform the House that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  will leave Australia today to lead the Australian delegation to the Habitat Conference that is being held in Vancouver.

* During his absence the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  will act as Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
Australia is, in my view, approaching a most significant and potentially difficult period in its short history.

* We have been through periods of rapid expansion in our industrial and manufacturing capacity, of rapid population and **immigration** growth, of stock market booms, of unprecedented minerals and resource discoveries and of significant recognition by the world community and, in particular, by many of our Asian neighbours.

* He said: 
I want to associate myself very sincerely with the remarks of the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  and I hope that even at this late stage the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  may be a little inclined to reconsider his position.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  said that renunciation had no legal effect.

* The proposed expenditure for the Department of **Immigration** is $66,286,000.

* On 14th July 1945 the Honourable Arthur Calwell was appointed Australia's first Minister for **Immigration**, heralding one of the most immense mass movements of population of our time.

* Successive governments and Ministers for **Immigration** supported by dedicated, understanding, tolerant department officials at home and abroad, with the co-operation of churches, trade unions, employers and voluntary organisations have contributed unselfishly to its success.

* It is also a tribute to the first Minister for **Immigration** that the basic principles of the programme have been little changed since its inception.

* The ALP supports an **immigration** policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance - 
Last year the then Minister for **Immigration** announced the appointment of 3 committees to inquire into the scheme.

* I  suggest to the Minister that in the interests of **immigration** and its future this inquiry should have been conducted by an all party parliamentary committee from both Houses of the National Parliament.

* If any programme deserves a committee of this type it is the **immigration** programme because the scheme itself owes its success to the sympathetic support of members from all parties in the Parliament.

* The real question to be investigated is why the Commonwealth in continuing the **immigration** programme has thrust its responsibilities in housing, education and health services on to the States and has not provided adequate financial resources resulting in shortages and deficit budgets.

* The ramifications of the **immigration** programme are enormous, and were exemplified in the Minister's speech recently when he said: 
This year 1969-70 our **immigration** programme calls for the arrival of 175,000 settlers.

* I will be brief in my remarks because, as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said, time does pass and I think it would be advisable to debate a number of provisions, even if only briefly, to expose the various points and to get the Minister's reaction.

* I would like the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to respond to two or three points in relation to clause 7.

* Once the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has this matter well in hand we will be able to get down to obtaining a literal interpretation of what is an evacuee and what is a refugee.

* The categories of people acceptable for **immigration** ought to be extended at the Minister's discretion.

* Listeners were asked to contact the Australian Electoral Office if they were in doubt about the requirements and to contact the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs if in doubt concerning their citizenship.

* Posters are also on display at **Immigration** and Australian Electoral Offices.

* The supply of doctors is currently running in excess of the Committee's projections because of three main factors: population has grown at a slower rate than expected; the **immigration** of doctors is much greater than expected; and medical schools are producing more graduates than expected as a result of lower student wastage rates and adjustments to courses.

* In respect of the Commonwealth, for example, arrangements are currently being made for a committee of officers of the Departments of Education, Health, and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Tertiary Education Commission to examine the issues further.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether his attention has been drawn to a recent article in a South Australian newspaper quoting  Mr Giordano,  publisher of a monthly bulletin, as saying that more should be done in the field of housing for migrants.

* If he would like to write to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr Mackellar)  and support the additional Galbally report grants which are to be given to the St George electorate, then he is very welcome to join in my representations.

* Was he consulted by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** when that Minister prepared the Government's submission to the National Wage Case before the Arbitration Commission.

* He spoke at length about **immigration**.

* He said that **immigration** should be a fundamental aspect of the proposals that are implemented.

* Of course it will be  under  this Government's **immigration** policy.

* In relation to **immigration** the Opposition has put forward a proposal that existing dwellers in this country will nominate newcomers on a relative basis.

* Does the honourable member for Reid want to perpetuate the overcrowded cities by bringing together the fundamentals of the existing Opposition **immigration** policy and then adding this proposition?

* These costs determined in Australia are heavily influenced by national policies pursued by governments - not only by this Government but also by previous governments - being such things as economic growth, full employment, the diversification of industry and the pursuance of a high scale of **immigration**.

* The Departments of **Immigration** and Aboriginal Affairs have also been represented from time to time.

* The Ministers from the Departments of the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory (formerly Interior), Aboriginal Affairs and a representative of the Minister for **Immigration** have also attended from time to time.

* It is the expenditure policies of the Government, coupled with the wage policies earlier enunciated by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  that have led to an inflation greater than that which Australia has known before.

* It is only the Australian Labor Party Government that can be blamed for the consequences of revaluation, for the consequences of tariff cuts, for the consequences of the wages policy of the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, for the consequences of expenditure decisions and for their attack on business confidence.

* We would establish close communications with employees and the trade union movement so that there can be a continuing dialogue and discussion, and reestablish in a statutory form the National Labour Advisory Council that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  abolished, thus cutting off proper tripartite communications between government, management and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* the Minister for **Immigration** nevertheless has power to make an order declaring that a particular Aboriginal does not require a permit to leave Australia even though he is subject to control; and 
The Bill we are discussing is another example of the Government's bringing to itself power to deal with certain people in the community- and that is what has happened- while we abrogate our responsibility to deal with foreign affairs, **immigration**, defence- all the matters for which we have specific responsibility, about which I feel very concerned and on which I rarely have an opportunity to speak.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who is at the table, is one who has had a great deal of experience in this industrial field.

* Now, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  purports to represent unionism in Australia.

* The Council will possess the necessary powers for local government activities in the village area, and will advise the Government on a broad range of matters affecting the community for example education, health and **immigration**.

* As I announced recently, in a joint statement with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Australian citizenship will shortly be available to persons who were ordinarily resident on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands immediately before the transfer of those Islands to Australia on 23 November 1955, who are now ordinarily resident in Australia or an external Territory.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
It represents a rejection by the Labor Government of the principle that refugees are a common international responsibility.

* No public announcement was made by either the Prime Minister or the Minister responsible - the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* If the Prime Minister and the Minister for **Immigration** can carelessly cast aside our membership of ICEM it is important to make clear that senior officials in the Department of **Immigration** have recognised its importance.

* Mr Andy  Watson, the First Assistant Secretary of the Department of **Immigration**, said this to Senate Estimates Committee B in November 1971: 
I recognise now the presence of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Mr Watson  continued: 
Another First Assistant Secretary of the Department of **Immigration**,  Mr Dempsey,  had this to say to the same Committee in October 1970: 
Australia's annual contribution to the administrative budget of ICEM is SUS28 1,211.

* This was stated by the Minister for **Immigration** in reply to a question that I placed on the notice paper.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**, who is now in the House, to indicate, firstly, the reasons why the House has not been informed of the decision to withdraw from ICEM, even though that decision was made by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and himself as far back as 7 March this year.

* I made the appropriate inquiries of the Department of **Immigration**.

* If there are any reasonable complaints on the part of consular officials, 1 am sure that the officers of the Department of **Immigration** will do what they can to eliminate the cause for these complaints.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I was astonished to find on the second day of sittings this year that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  told the honourable member for Riverina that the details of the agreement between Canada and West Germany had not been made public.

* What a great concern the honourable member and the Minister for **Immigration** have for their primary producers.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, in his second reading speech, said: 
Of course, it is not just there that the anomalies and the penal character of this insidious Bill are apparent.

* Perhaps the Minister for **Immigration** does not know it, but the practice in the Department of Primary Industry has been that only ordinary time for the inspectors and veterinarians employed by the Department are met by the Department.

* Although southern Australia produces a large and increasing share of Australia's total meat exports, the Minister for **Immigration**, who comes from the south, probably does not even know that in northern Australia by far the largest percentage of the meat slaughtered goes for export.

* very pleasing to see the Minister for **Immigration** sitting here on his behalf.

* In his speech, the Minister for **Immigration** - a man who once had pretentions to be Minister for Primary Industry until he became apprehensive of where his policies or the policies of his colleague might lead him - made the point that he did not think the levy would be passed on to producers, with profit margins of 0.7c and l.'25c per lb and a levy, according to the Bill, of 1.6c per lb.

* In his speech the Minister for **Immigration** made the point that he did not think that the levy would be passed on to producers.

* All these things are utterly inconsistent because under the present Government's policy and as far as can be foreseen, unless there is a major change in Australia's **immigration** policy, only about 2 million people will be added to the total population of Australia between now and the year 2000.

* **Immigration** has been turned off in the most inhuman way.

* They will not come from natural increase, and the Government's policy has effectively turned ofT the **immigration** tap.

* The purpose of the amendment which we have just discussed has been in part covered by the answer given by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* Without labouring the point that speech is almost an exact replica of the words which were used by the Minister for **Immigration** when introducing the Bill.

* The Minister said: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 November 1978: 
-Until the last 3 or 4 minutes of the speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I thought that he was approaching this topic in the way it should have been approached.

* I refer to a letter signed by the Acting Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on 1 July which came to my office informing me to advise the sponsors that if their relatives went to Damascus their applications could be processed.

* In 1 969 at most posts locally engaged staff were controlled by the Department of **Immigration** and it was a relatively simply task to provide an up-to-date report on numbers employed.

* Whilst the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to receive monthly returns of staff employed at its posts, these reflect total numbers employed without any split-up into staff employed on **immigration** or other specific activities.

* The latest definitive figures available from the Department of Foreign Affairs are from the detailed annual staff returns showing persons employed in various functions at each base as at 30 June 1976. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1978: 
When I was Minister for Labour and later Minister for Labor and **Immigration** I publicly expressed great concern about the activities of some people, a very small number of unemployed, who were voluntarily unemployed.

* It would have been much better for the Department of Labour and **Immigration**, as it then was, to be the only department administering unemployment benefits, with its decisions being binding on people in receipt of unemployment benefits or seeking them.

* I can certainly speak for myself and say that I would not have accepted them had I remained Minister for Labour and **Immigration**.

* When I was Minister for Labour and **Immigration** instances occurred in Melbourne and in Sydney in which in isolated cases one person was drawing unemployment benefits in as many as 7 different names.

* The only decision that can be made is made by the Minister for **Immigration** on the advice of many organs of government and we will be proceeding with justice and compassion.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
1 ) Copies of press releases issued by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** are distributed by hand to the Canberra Press Gallery and to media representatives in Melbourne, by bulk postage to other addresses and by publication in the Australian Government Digest.

* The number of copies circulated depends on the particular content matter but generally copies of press releases distributed on Labor matters approach 3,000, and on **Immigration** matters 1,900.

* There are difficulties in Lebanon at the present time, as we know, but the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar' recently issued special instructions for dealing with those difficulties.

* One of the greatest difficulties is that our Government will not accept them on normal **immigration** terms because they fail to produce a number of documents considered necessary by us.

* Since then the Working Party has visited all Councils and has established tri-partite regional committees, comprising representatives of the Public Service Board, the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, in each State and Territory, to follow up with detailed interviews- of ail council staff and to co-operate, in efforts, to find them alternative employment.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
(a) Expatriates - Under the Papua and New Guinea Migration Ordinance 1963-1969 all immigrants (the term includes all persons not born in the Territory, whether entering for short visits or for longer term stay) other than members of the Defence Forces of Australia, certain diplomatic and consular officials and members of the crew of certain vessels during the stay of their vessels in Territory ports, are required to be in possession of entry permits.

* In all cases normal **immigration** requirements of health and character must be met.

* Norfolk Island has a new **Immigration** Ordinance which permits entry for periods of up to 30 days without having firstly to apply for an entry permit  provided a return or  onward ticket is held.

* 1 ) The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has one library, located at the Barton Offices, Canberra.

* Broadly, the publications in the Department's library cover the subjects of **immigration**, emigration, the education, health and welfare of migrants, automatic data processing and demography.

* I am sure that what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has done and what I am trying to do will be conducive to that end.

* In regard to the question of resettlement, my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is not proposing at this stage to alter any migrant entry policy in respect of its application to Rhodesians.

* I have details of a case that was submitted to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I hope that I am not boring the Minister - 
Did the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs state on 17 March 1976 that the Government has honoured all its commitments to provide financial assistance for programs agreed to with the States for the 1975-76 financial year, and that this applies to Albury-Wodonga.

* My colleague the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  is overseas on government business.

* Where I use the personal pronoun it should bc taken to mean the Minister for **Immigration** and not me.

* At the outset I take the opportunity to express my personal congratulations to the Minister for **Immigration** for developing this programme.

* The short title - **Immigration** (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the **immigration** provision in the Constitution.

* The committee will include representatives from State Education Departments as well as the Department of **Immigration** and the Department of Education and Science.

* Clause 8 provides authority for the conduct of such research which will be undertaken by the Department of " **Immigration** and the Department of Education and Science in conjunction with the research units of the State Education Departments and of appropriate tertiary institutions.

* Clause II indicates that the funds required from time to time will be provided under the annual appropriations for the Department  of  **Immigration**.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
On arrival in Western Australia nominees will be met by a company representative and conveyed to their accommodation.

* Within 3 days of arrival it is incumbent on the company to convey its nominees to the State **Immigration** Office so that they may be given an advisory talk on such subjects as home purchase contracts, hire purchase, employment, vehicle purchase, over-commitment, etc.

* Any type of contract or agreement for the purchase of a home must not be entered into prior to the advisory talk given by an officer of the State **Immigration** Department.

* After the defeat of the Labor Government in Western Australia the  Chairman  of the Board of Directors of the Landall Construction and Development Co. Pty Ltd wrote to the new Minister for **Immigration** in Western Australia,  Mr Grayden,  in these terms, after having had first of all a telephone conversation with him and, no doubt, given him the private reasons why he wanted these conditions set aside: 
Of all people on the Government side of the chamber who should not be saying anything at the present time about creating uncertainty in rural industry it is the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  because he more than anybody else has caused the rural crisis because of the statements which he has made.

* The present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, is reported as follows in the Griffith Area News' of 1 6 October: 
In relation to 1 (ii), the Public Service Board and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** are currently identifying these authorities and examining the application to them of the Government 's policy on maternity leave.

* In relation to 1 (iii), the Public Service Board and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** are currently examining the application to these authorities of the Government's policy on maternity leave.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I would like to make another point which again shows the Minister's lack of consultation with trade union leaders, with the ACTU and with employers.

* It was said- I will not mention the person's name because it might be improper to name an officer of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**- that:   .

* I also have with me a document entitled 'Monthly Review of the Employment Situation, October 1974' from the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* Government decisions have created large pools of unemployment and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** is introducing retraining schemes that have very little chance of success.

* My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Will the Minister take up this urgent problem with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in another place to see that the promises made by the Government are honoured?

* (Mr Cross continuing to address his question to the Minister for **Immigration**)- 
 The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
and (2) The population study 'Australia's Population and the Future' initiated by the Department of **Immigration** is being carried out at the Australian National University.

* -Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs been drawn to reports of an elderly German couple whose daughter is visiting them at present and who is now reported to be facing a deportation order?

* A recent review of the service required and provided in Geelong indicated that current arrangements are adequate for the amount of **immigration** business in the area.

* Since 1964 Geelong has been serviced by an information office located in the city and staffed on Thursday of each week by an **Immigration** officer from Melbourne, lt is proposed to continue this service until it is shown to be inadequate.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The purpose of the survey, which was conducted at a sample of addresses selected from CES records, was to identify differences between the Bureau's unemployment statistics and the CES figures.

* At all stages it was intended that the results of the survey, except for figures subject to sampling variability too high for most practical uses, would be published by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* If the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  were present he probably would say: 'Ah, you are going back on your word and what you said before'.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Did he state publicly that he is in possession of complete documentation of the activities of international criminal bodies and their local affiliates?

* In view of the nature of your representations I am referring a copy of your representations to my colleagues the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Attorney-General '.

* Department of Labor and **Immigration** (**Immigration** Section): Training in Financial and Auditing Procedures (Question No.

* 367) 
Sources: (b) (c) and (d) Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs Quarterly Statistical Summaries, (a) Provisional count of incoming passenger cards.

* There has been no re-starting of the **immigration** program because the **immigration** program has continued.

* One was that it was decided that the **immigration** program of the Government in future .is to be finely tuned to the economy.

* The second was that a decision was made in the face of unemployment at that time not to import unemployment by maintaining the **immigration** intake at a level which was not commensurate with our national needs.

* There has been no suggestion of re-starting the **immigration** program; it was never stopped.

* In the first quarter of this year the **immigration** intake was something more than 11,000.

* The **Immigration** Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  today attacked the Opposition Leader,  Mr Hayden,  for 'party political point scoring' on refugees.

* The Federal Government has received its first clear indications that profiteers are taking advantage of Indo-Chinese refugees, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* **Immigration**, the case of William Martin of 21 Park Street, Orange, New South Wales, who found he lost his entitlement to pension from the West German Government when he became an Australian citizen.

* Will he confer again with his colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, with a view to having this reciprocity implemented in the interest of both Australia and Australian citizens.

* I wish to draw attention to the item of expenditure under the Department of **Immigration** involving SI.

* I hope that the Minister for **Immigration** will look into this matter.

* This decision was a ministerial one - I know this because I have checked it - and the previous Minister for **Immigration**, who is now the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  indicated that he made it.

* My colleague the honourable member for Wannon concluded by saying that the purpose of raising this matter today was to get some clear information flowing from the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* It is the view of my colleague on this side that the administration and the equivocation of the Government's **immigration** policy has caused confusion both here and elsewhere.

* But the man who was taking the keenest interest in what was being said by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  was the man who wrote the policy of the Australian Labor Party on **immigration** and was refused the right to administer it, the man who was stripped of his position as spokesman on **immigration** and refused permission on the Opposition side of the House to enunciate his views until the then Government gave him the right to do so.

* Let me quote from John Edwards' column 'Politics' in the 'Australian' of 5 March: 
It's not easy to reconcile the announcement that Australia has dropped its racially discriminatory **immigration** policy with what few facts are available about the results of Labor's **immigration** program.

* Mr Edwards goes on to quote the words of a very distinguished diplomat who seems to take a different view from the Minister for **Immigration** on the occasion of a fracturing or a likely fracturing of Australia's foreign relations caused by the manner in which this Government is pursuing its immigation program.

* The column quoted a cable dated 22 February 1974 from the Australian Ambassador in the Philippines,  Mr Henderson,  to the Department of Foreign Affairs and **Immigration** as follows: 
I believe it is a matter of some urgency and of real importance in terms of Australia's relations generally with the Philippines that Australian administrative procedures of **immigration** be brought into line with the principles enunciated by the Prime Minister.

* So much for the friendly relations enunciated by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* isn't it odd that the Australian Ambassador on the spot, presumably advised by his Second Secretary who handles **immigration**, should have misunderstood so seriously what happens inside his own embassy.

* Some allegations also have been made about the manner in which the previous Government conducted its **immigration** policy.

* This is a debate brought about by the failure of the Government to produce a coherent **immigration** policy.

* I enter the debate to plead with the Minister for **Immigration** to inform adequately this Parliament and the public.

* We on this side of the House, in the traditions under which migration has been debated in this Parliament for many years have no desire to spread denigration in this most sensitive arena and I will firmly resist any moves to foster debate on **immigration** along selfish, arrogant, intolerant or divisive lines.

* On the Prime Minister's recent Asian trip, he assured the Philippines Government that Australia no longer had an **immigration** policy which discriminated on the basis of colour.

* The Prime Minister was reported as telling  President  Marcos that no longer would double standards be applied to Australia's **immigration** policy.

* On 15 March 1974, following discussions between the Prime Minister and the Ministers for Labour and **Immigration** and members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive, who themselves could get no coherence and, certainly until then, no consultation, the Government announced the shelving of the Leyland plan to bring in 35 semi-skilled Filipino workers.

* Crushing debt burdens imposed on these authorities by years of Commonwealth engendered **immigration** pressures and Commonwealth financial neglect must be met from a narrow tax base.

* Minister for **immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  announced outside the Parliament his private, leisurely inquiry into some aspects, and no report is yet in sight.

* It should not be thought that those people making unauthorised arrivals in Australia, largely arriving at Darwin, have not been subject to Australian **immigration** laws; they have.

* They have not travelled in an authorised fashion but certainly they are subject to all the **immigration** laws and procedures as soon as they arrive.

* I would not want it thought for a moment that Australia's **immigration** laws are being circumvented in any way by these arrivals.

* If honourable members wish to use their time in the debate on the Estimates to speak about this important matter of **immigration** there is adequate time for discussion.

* Statement on **immigration** by the Honourable A. J. Grassby, 11 October 1973.

* Honourable members will remember that earlier this year the steamer  Australis  was the vessel from which some 54 people decamped and sought to evade normal **immigration** controls.

* I should make it clear that Indian nationals are not the only people involved in efforts to circumvent Australian **immigration** requirements.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
After listening to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  trying to answer some of the questions raised by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  I am convinced that I am now more confused than ever I have been since the commencement of this debate.

* The eradication of disease is far more important than some of the matters that have been put by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for **Immigration**) &lt;3.1) - I have given the facts; I have given the assurances; I have given all the information that the Committee needs to make up its mind and on that basis I move that we vote on the measure.

* The temporary Minister for **Immigration** will not be here for very long.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 20 September 1978: 
My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.

* The honourable member for Riverina, who is Minister for **Immigration**, has stated that $500m will be made available for these loans at an interest rate of 3 per cent per annum.

* Will the delay of an inquiry prevent the specific allocation of $500m at 3 per cent interest as indicated by the now Minister for **Immigration**?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: 
As I have indicated, it is pleasing to see that finally the Government is enunciating an ongoing refugee policy.

* Unfortunately, the statement of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  fails to implement the most significant of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.

* I think it is worth repeating a statement made in relation to Chileans by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on 18 November in response to a question which I placed on the Notice Paper some months before.

* In relation to people who will be resettled in Australia, we will go through a process of advising the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on the capacity for accepting refugees and will regularly review the intake of refugees against the capacity of resources in this country to ensure successful resettlement.

* Questions concerning these details have been placed on the Notice Paper by the Leader of the Opposition and myself to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser).

* The Minister for **Immigration** may proceed.

* 1 ) The question of opening a separate regional office of the former Department of **Immigration** in Griffith, New South Wales, became redundant with the amalgamation of that Department with the Department of Labor.

* The Department of Labor and **Immigration** will handle **immigration** matters in Griffith through its office there.

* Regional **immigration** offices are functioning in Wollongong, Newcastle and Townsville.

* They were established in response to regional needs for services provided by the former Department of **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 13 October 1977: 
Which of the recommendations of the New South Wales Migrant Task Force Committee, headed by the honourable member for Prospect, presented to the then Minister for **Immigration** in June 1973, have been implemented and on what dates were the recommendations acted upon.

* This re-training scheme was introduced by the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* This is done at great expense and personal cost to the officers of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** who are working very hard to administer the scheme.

* As I said, 
My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I repeat: My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* He will be aware of my concern about the employment situation in 
1 ) The **Immigration** target for 1973-74 was 1 10.000. 
.

* However, a manual count in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** of Passenger Cards lodged by persons at time of arrival indicates that some 1 12,960 migrants arrived during 1973-74.

* This was a fact which had apparently completely escaped the attention of the responsible Minister, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I refer in this context to a report in the Melbourne 'Age' which stated, in part: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is **immigration** from Japan expected to rise sharply in the future following the announcement of increased interest by Japan in the development of Australia's resources?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 March 1979: 
1 ) Is it a fact that Australian officials overseas destroy or cause destruction of a number of applications for (a) **immigration** to Australia or (b) temporary or permanent residency in Australia, before the applications are considered or processed.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  left Australia yesterday to represent the Treasurer at the Asian Development Bank meeting in the Philippines and to have discussions elsewhere on refugee matters.

* During his absence the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Groom)  is acting as Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for  **Immigration**  and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1979: 
What action should this Government take?

* They should be given assisted passages under our **immigration** scheme.

* I should like to make a final plea to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  because I really believe that this amendment strikes at everything the Minister believes is important for the rank and file members of the union movement.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
With reference to question No.

* 2598 of the Member for Macarthur, what has been the total cost to the Government of examination of issues and preparation of reports by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, by authorities for which the Minister is responsible, and by ad hoc commissions, committees, task forces, etc, within the Minister's portfolio, since 5 December 1972.

* -Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs seeking leave to make a statement?

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 May 1979: 
How many (a) temporary and (b) permanent staff are currently located at the office of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, 23 George Street, Parramatta, N.S.

* W. 
-My question is also directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Today's Melbourne  Age  states: 
The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Mackellar,  has predicted an influx of black, white and coloured South Africans into Australia.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has advised that 1684 people have arrived without prior permission in 46 boats, the last of these being on 13 November this year.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**: In his recent investigation of the role of housing corporations in migrant sponsorship in Western Australia was he aware that the complaints referred to were investigated by the then Labor State Government two or more years ago and that the State Labor Minister for **Immigration** concluded that the scheme provided a useful service?

* In the Minister's investigation of the same matter did he or his Department make any approach to the Western Australian **Immigration** Department which has complete records on this matter?

* It is an **immigration** matter.

* I apologise for not informing the Minister for **Immigration** and 

 His sister who lives in Scotland wishes to come to Australia to join him.

* Mr Goff  signed the necessary papers for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, pointing out that he would provide her with shelter and any means of sustenance should it be required.

* I suggest that whilst she is not eligible under the family reunion provisions of the Government's **immigration** scheme, she should be eligible under the retirement provisions.

* I have learnt since this case came to my notice that people from Canada who want to migrate here in similar circumstances, who have no independent means and are not wealthy, have obtained money temporarily from a sponsor- a relative or someone else- and then have been able to show the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs that they have independent means.

* Quite frequently, different points of view will be heard and it has been the subject of a large number of reports and submissions which I have received since I have been Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* -I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Does he appreciate the embarrassment suffered by honourable members on both sides of the House when they are approached by illegal immigrants who have overstayed their visas in Australia and been directed by his Department to leave?

* In view of the continuing flow of illegal immigrants from Vietnam, will the Minister consider allowing another brief amnesty to illegal immigrants now in Australia who meet normal **immigration** qualifications?

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The total cost in fares, fees and expenses paid to members, officers and staff of the **Immigration** Advisory Council in each year since 1 January 1964 has been: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The main reason I rise tonight is to draw the attention of the House to some very dangerous tendencies that are developing inside the Liberal Party.

* The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  was appointed as spokesman on **immigration** by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).

* I would like to read to the House from the **Immigration** Control Association's publication called 'Viewpoint'.

* The publication reads: 
On a trip to Canberra with my wife and another member of the **Immigration** Control Association we dropped in to the House of Representatives to talk to a few of the members.

* I think it is important to note that the honourable member for Warringah has been appointed to a position which is particularly sensitive to the propositions of the **Immigration** Control Association.

* No, I will not take advantage of it, but I think it is important, when a sitting member of this Parliament becomes identified with the **Immigration** Control Association or the National Director of the Australian League of Rights, that it is made clear that he does not speak for the whole of his Party.

* If he does speak for the whole of his Party, that Party dissociates itself from - 
The Minister for **Immigration** can explain this in the committee stage.

* The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  said that he was disappointed with an **immigration** agreement that we had wilh Yugoslavia because of the small number of skilled people who were coming to Australia from that country.

* and (2) Information concerning health benefits, including specific information on the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan, is included in a booklet printed in 20 languages which is provided by the Department of **Immigration** to migrants before embarkation for Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 March 1977: 
The Family Welfare Bureau in fact did receive grants from numbers of Government departments.

* It received from the Attorney-General's Department a grant of some $14,800 for its marriage guidance work and from the former Department of **Immigration** it received $9,452.

* Has his attention been drawn to the report in 'The Australian' on Thursday, 18th March 1971, stating that 2 Australians are among 237 foreign nationals who are being held in **immigration** detention camps for illegal entry into Indonesia?

* Departmentof **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs 
-I have not had reports of these headlines or articles in the newspapers in Singapore.

* This applies also to **immigration** policy, defence and other matters.

* That survey was established by the former Minister for **Immigration** and the former Minister for Education because of the real problems of which people were aware in migrant education.

* If one can criticise the past - I think it is perhaps legitimate for the Opposition to do this - there is probably an under-estimation of the problem that has been placed upon educational authorities by an **immigration** program that for a while introduced into Australia people who had had only 2 or 3 years schooling even in their own language.

* -The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
But before we discuss the qualification and the reasons for shortening the qualification period for portability we should know something about those people who leave this country in their retiring years and particularly those migrants who have returned to their former countries.

* It is informative to look at a progress report on an inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia compiled by the **Immigration** Advisory Council's Committee on Social Patterns.

* The report states: 
Examination of this shows that it reflects the lower proportion of refugees in current **immigration** - that is, refugees tend to stay more than other migrants - the greater ease of travel in recent years, the strong economic attraction of western Europe, and the growing number of skilled and highly qualified persons who, as part of an increasingly mobile international community, often move from Australia after a few years.

* It is true that last night I made serious allegations against him and against the shadow Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar).

* I was referring to  Mr Eric  Butler in the case of the honourable member for Parramatta, and to the **Immigration** Control Association in the case of the honourable member for Warringah.

* I am sorry that the shadow Minister for **Immigration** has not seen fit to dissociate himself from the **Immigration** Control Association and from its support.

* The task forces are composed of existing staff in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** who have been temporarily released from their normal duties to provide emergency assistance in the Department's Victorian Regional 
In 1973 the work test which determines eligibility for unemployment benefits was modified so that Aborigines on missions and reserves did not have to move to stations and towns in order to make themselves available for employment.

* In addition, the strength of the Aboriginal employment section of the then Department of Labor and **Immigration** was increased from 65 positions in December 1973 to 122 positions in September 1975.

* -From time to time the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has indicated that the migration program is administered to ensure that migrants do not add to the number of people unemployed or take jobs from qualified Australian residents.

* With reference to the administrative procedures purporting to prevent such a situation, can the Minister indicate how the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs ensures that a migrant recruited to help to fill a vacancy in, say, Perth will go to Perth rather than to Sydney or elsewhere; how the Department ensures that no Australian worker is available to fill the vacancy in question; and in what circumstances the Department would recommend retraining an unemployed Austraiian rather than go to the expensive and time consuming effort of recruiting a migrant overseas?

* Will the Government release the list of jobs classified as in short supply, which is supposed to guide the recruitment procedures of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs?

* The honourable member for Canning  (Mr Hallett)  joined the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes),  who represents the Minister for Health in this chamber, in quibbling about the concept of nationalisation.

* First of all he wants to whittle away almost completely our **immigration** programme.

* It would like to get its hands if it had the opportunity on that section of government expenditure that flows in the direction, of **immigration** and put it into other fields of expenditure.

* The approach of the Government, however, to reduce the **immigration** intake by about 10,000 people is a reasonable approach and is, I believe, the kind of action that any responsible government would want to take.

* In addition we are still engaged in Vietnam and the great issues of development, **immigration** and other national problems face the nation.

* Since March we have had 3 Ministers for Foreign Affairs, 3 Ministers for Defence, 3 Ministers for Health, 3 Ministers for Education and Science, 3 AttorneysGeneral, 2 Treasurers, 2 Ministers for Labour and National Service, 2 Ministers for **Immigration**, 2 Ministers for the Navy, 2 Ministers for Housing, 2 Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and 2 Ministers for Supply.

* **Immigration**: Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration  (Question No.

* 4532)  Mr Whitlam  asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) With reference to the answer to question No 2 1 1 (Hansard, 30 July 1974, page 832) concerning the establishment of a bureau within the Department of Labor and **Immigration** as discussed at the Industrial Peace Conference, what progress has been made in the considerations of the Government.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
How many applications for permanent residence from Lebanese people were outside normal **immigration** guidelines between 1 January 1976 and 30 June 1976.

* I wish to refer to the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* As a general observation, let me say that I believe that, our **immigration** program is administered very fairly by a Minister who looks at cases impartially and tries to do the best he can for all the people who seek to bring in friends and relatives from overseas.

* Last Thursday, I asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  what progress had been made in bringing those 600 people to Australia.

* I refer to an article in the Melbourne  Herald  of 1 1 November 1978 which states: 
A spokesman for the Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr MacKellar,  said there had been 'some delays in arranging the mechanics' of the visit.

* That is, a visit of an Australian **immigration** team to Indonesia.

* The article continues: 
Further, the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia was reported in an Indonesian newsletter late last year as saying that his Government did not object to anyone leaving Timor who wanted to, providing he went through the normal **immigration** procedure.

* They were not met, apparently, because of difficulties of the Australian **immigration** team getting into East Timor to carry out interviews, to do the normal processing which is required of anyone who wants to come to Australia, and because various difficulties were put in the way of people wishing to come out of East Timor.

* Correspondence that I received subsequently from the then Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, expressed expectations that the program of reuniting families would take place expeditiously.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in a letter dated 3 April 1 979 wrote: 
As I said earlier, there- may be a way round getting extra finance for insect control and research, in the absence of a special program such as the one which was proposed originally by the Minister for Primary Industry.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  in his second reading speech, said.

* According to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  not less than 24 000 people are now employed under the RED scheme.

* There is a discrepancy of more than 50 000 between the figures on unemployment from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and unemployment figures from the Bureau of Statistics.

* and (3) It has long been generally acknowledged that each country has a right to determine its own **immigration** policy; it is not appropriate that the Australian Government should comment on the policies of others.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I thank the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  for granting me an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.

* It is a great pity that in the operation of this policy the present Minister for **Immigration** has maintained a continued restraint on the level of migrants.

* I believe that the origins of  Mr Calwell's  administration and the administration of successive Liberal-Country Party Ministers, pursued in the **immigration** portfolio, was tremendously important in developing this country in the years after World War II.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
1 ) What arrangements have been made, or planned, to have his Department represented in rural areas which have been served in the past by offices of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and by way of explanation I refer to the entry to and departure from Australia of  Mr Wilfred  Burchett without an Australian passport.

* Two or 3 weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science which dealt with the subject of **immigration**.

* Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of **immigration** which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community.

* As the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  mentioned in his second reading speech there are 2 or 3 major aspects of this educational programme.

* This is one of the major arguments for **immigration** being continuous.

* There are some problems which seem to be of a minor kind perhaps to which the Minister for **Immigration** might direct his attention if he has not done so already.

* When I was Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the Inspectorate was taking proceedings against employers at a rate of knots.

* He has lost the **immigration** division.

* 1 think that that is probably a good thing, because **immigration** ought to be kept as a separate entity.

* In fact, I think it is wrong that the Department of **Immigration** does not have more of the old Department of **Immigration** than it now has.

* In fact, the Minister for Labour and **Immigration** of the day, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  is quoted as saying that anyone refusing a reasonable offer of a job would be disqualified from receiving the unemployment benefit.

* Why should they have to bear the strain and the sorrow of having members of their closely knit families separated by thousands of miles due to inhumane and narrow **immigration** guidelines for family re-unification?

* I welcome, therefore, that section of this Government's policy on **immigration** and ethnic affairs which states: 
I trust that this Government's **immigration** policy will be implemented in a manner which is befitting such a worthwhile principle.

* I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General's Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane **immigration** program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social welfare system presently contains regarding migrants.

* These are problems of housing, poverty, unemployment, **immigration**, the aged, the sick and the poorly educated.

* I can assure them that I will tackle their problems assiduously as their problems, whether they be problems of **immigration**, social security or education, are all national problems.

* Will the Minister for **Immigration** investigate whether international criminals have slipped into Australia as part of the past **immigration** program?

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Which sections of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** are concerned with aspects of safety.

* Most honourable members can remember the great speeches he used to make on a great variety of high policy matters when he was in Opposition, particularly in respect of **immigration**.

* At one time he was the shadow Minister for **Immigration**.

* At the outset I refer to the statement on population policy made by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in the House on 30 March.

* I had hoped to speak in that debate in order to call for an increase in **immigration**, but the debate was terminated rather abruptly and this was not possible.

* When  Mr Arthur  Calwell commenced the post-war **immigration** scheme Australia's population was approximately 7 million.

* **Immigration** reached a peak in 1970 when 185 325 permanent residents came to Australia.

* Over half the increase of 6.2 million in Australia's population since World War II has been due directly to **immigration**.

* This view has again achieved some prominence in recent times, and I believe it represents a grave misunderstanding of the effects of a high **immigration** intake.

* However, I cannot but question how the Minister can reconcile that view with the present restrictive **immigration** guidelines and an **immigration** target for the forthcoming year of only 70 000.

* Canadian experience has shown that **immigration** has had little or no effect on unemployment in that country.

* High levels of **immigration** to Canada during the past 3 years have not significantly affected the level of unemployment.

* As a result of Labor's **immigration** policies, migration to Australia has declined so drastically that the rate of increase in our population has come to a virtual standstill.

* The Minister further pointed out that the rate of growth of our traditional source countries for **immigration** is decreasing, and that, if current trends continue, it will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century.

* Not a day passes without people coming to my office, wishing to sponsor close friends and relations for **immigration** to this country.

* I must pay a tribute to the present Minister who, of all the Ministers for **Immigration** with whom I have dealt in the last 1 0 years, has given the most compassionate and sympathetic ear to family reunions and applications by people to come to this country.

* The day may well come when the United Nations, dominated by Third World powers and the communist bloc, may endeavour to dictate to us what our **immigration** policies will be.

* Apart from the obvious need for the Australian States to establish a Federal government responsible for defence, external affairs, **immigration** and other matters, in which Commonwealth influence is becoming progressively greater, I believe that few problems could have influenced the founders of federation more than the hotchpotch of railway systems of that time, with various gauges in various States.

* I would like the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to substantiate that statement.

* That the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** be suspended from the service of the House.

* To cease **immigration** will not solve the problem.

* [ have always found it a source of amusement when I have had to sign an **immigration** form for entry to the United States of America, for example.

* When I have explained to the poor **immigration** officer who had put the question that I was not really a citizen of the Soviet Union he has said, 'No, it does not mean that'.

* T have always explained to the **immigration** officers in great detail - I am happy to be patient with them - that if I am an Aboriginal I can be quite black and I am also a Caucasian anthropologically speaking.

* When this has happened the **immigration** officer has looked at me with some horror and has said that apparently Congress had not heard about it.

* To be more specific in relation to the measure before us, this Bill comes down against a background of widespread questioning of our **immigration** programme.

* This has been demonstrated by the findings and investigations of the Department of **Immigration**.

* I spoke to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  before I rose in this debate.

* This is why 1 addressed an appeal while I was overseas recently to the Minister for **Immigration** to reject completely and very bluntly the statements made by the Victorian **Immigration** Minister, Mr Vance Dickie.

* He caused resentment amongst the most conservative Australians who said that this man did not speak for our people, did not speak even for the Government and, I am sure, did not speak for the Minister for **Immigration** who sits at the table.

* T would never insult him by suggesting that he had adopted such an extreme attitude as to talk about 99 per cent of those with dark blood being rejected- 
am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
It is part of the process of getting off this drug, this momentum of government spending financed by the harvest of taxation and the deficit to boot, with its adverse long term effect on the non-government sector.

* The home building area is a case in point and the Government is carefully monitoring the situation, as witnessed by the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill which was brought in a little while ago by my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, on notice, on 8 May 1978: 
What are the specific statistical bases for the Government's planned **immigration** policy in the light of (a) the inadequacy of current Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force surveys in terms of identifying (i) the extent of unemployment at State levels by age, (ii) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, and (iii) the incidence of unemployment among specific ethnic groups and (b) the inadequacy of current Commonwealth Employment Service registration figures in terms of identifying (i) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, (ii) the nonregistration of married women with working husbands, and (iii) the arbitrary accreditation in Australia of qualifications gained overseas by job applicants.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 September 1978: 
Is his Department's publication  **Immigration** Categories and Procedures  printed only in English; if so.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Australia's **immigration** program is totally and completely nondiscriminatory and based, in fact, on the assessment of individuals and not on their racial background, the pigmentation of their skin or their religion.

* Mr 3  per cent at the table, the Minister for **Immigration**, says that it was not available.

* -Mr Speaker, I wish to add one or two points to what has been said by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The honourable gentleman attempted to challenge the acceptance by the Government and the  present Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  of the Commonwealth's responsibilities with regard to migrants.

* I feel sure that the honourable gentleman has read the Government's published **immigration** and ethnic affairs policy.

* Having regard to the fact that the honourable gentleman so deliberately sought to challenge the policies and views of the present Government, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  the published policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties on **immigration** and ethnic affairs dated August 1975.

* Have a look at the Budget speech by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland),  a member of your own Party, delivered in the Senate last week.

* Government members are alleged to be concerned about unemployment But we have the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in the Senate talking about a rise in unemployment peaking at around about 400 000 people by December or January of this year.

* -Has the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** been drawn to the report of massive dismissals in the United States car industry?

* I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table supplied by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** setting out productivity rates.

* The present members of the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council are: 
Hon.

* M. J. R. MacKellar, M.P., Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Chairman

* If not, then how was the Minister for **Immigration** aware of all the interdepartmental consultations in which his Department was involved through interdepartmental committees.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I will leave the Treasurer at that point; no doubt we will hear more of this matter later.

* Let me just come to the point and speak of the humiliation which the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  has suffered with the introduction of these Government measures.

* I think there should be a call from his electorate for him to resign as Minister for **Immigration** because what is being put forward in the Government's policy is so diametrically opposed to what he made an issue of and stood on as a point of principle in this House and during his election campaign.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What was the total cost in fares, fees and expenses paid to member, officer and staff of the **Immigration** Advisory Council in each year since its establishment?

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) Has the **Immigration** Planning Council recommended that the migrant intake be increased to 135,000. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 November 1978. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** upon notice: 
expenses and fees to each of the present members of the **Immigration** Advisory Council in each year since 1st January 1964?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has the Government's new **immigration** policy meant the end of a Nurses Training Program in Australia for Asian girls?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What amount was spent on **Immigration** programmes in each of the years 1967-68, 1968-69 and 1969-70?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 May 1 978: 
I thank the Minister for his courtesy.

* I wish to substantiate a case which I wish to make against the previous Minister for **Immigration** in this Government.

* The present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is, of course, responsible for Government policy but I believe that the previous Minister,  Mr Grassby,  must be condemned for allowing trained political activists to come into this country with no real intention to abide by this nation's principles or aspirations.

* My evidence for this comes from a Chilean from my own electorate who happened to be at the Department of **Immigration** in Adelaide where he had to help to interpret for a large group of immigrants who arrived from the Adelaide airport.

* The Chileans who in the past paid their own way to this country are properly offended that these people should be termed Chileans and they wish to be entirely dissociated from the kind of people whom the previous Minister for **Immigration** brought into this country.

* I do not blame the **immigration** officers who were sent to Chile to augment the meagre numbers of people examining those so-called Chileans seeking entry into this country.

* What happened is also an indictment against the Prime Minister and the Minister for **Immigration** of that time for taking measures that did not ensure proper safety for this nation in the importation of these people.

* I have certainly not been persuaded by the sort of threats contained in the speech by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he introduced this Bill.

* I am not as readily persuaded by the comments of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* He said: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What are the titles and dates of all agreements made with other countries on all matters affecting **immigration** since 1945. 
by leave- The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  on the progress report of the **Immigration** Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers.

* The House will recall that the **Immigration** Advisory Council submitted a similar report to the then Minister for **Immigration** in 1967.

* I would ask the Minister to consider making a ministerial statement which would set out the full details of the new Government's approach to **immigration**, the basic principles which it is following, the determining factors which influence the total number of migrants which the Government intends to seek to bring to Australia this year and their impact upon the whole migrant program.

* As the Minister for **Immigration**, I stated that migrants' contributions to Australia's economic growth are important by any standards.

* But we invite the Minister, through his Ministry - 1 am sure he will be anxious to do this - to provide the House with an opportunity to debate the whole question of the Government's **immigration** program.

* No responsible government should abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the **immigration** program to be determined simply by the uncoordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and abroad.

* The former Government combined 2 processes in its **immigration** program - sponsorship programs designed to encourage family reunion and actively seeking migrants under government sponsorsip to fulfil those needs not met by family sponsorship.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** to restrain himself.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on15 August 1978: 
Perhaps we should look in some other direction to see what open government means.

* The Prime Minister made a statement from Ottawa and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  made statements from diverse parts of the world.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the conditions he announced yesterday in relation to family reunion of Vietnamese are narrower than those that apply under the normal **immigration** program?

* Is the Prime Minister aware of concern expressed that the guidelines announced contradict advice from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** that would have enabled the sponsorship of parents, brothers, sisters, nances and friends?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
If so, how many migrants have settled in each State since the commencement of the **immigration** programme.

* Another point I make concerns the Government's record on **immigration**.

* The Fraser Government's **immigration** policies acknowledge none of these depressing realities.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-Order!

* I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Mr Cameron, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, has written publicly to the Treasurer demanding a change in the course of economic policy;  Mr Hayden  believes that the Government is presiding over the destruction of the Australian economy;  Dr Cairns,  the  Deputy  Prime Minister, thinks that the fault lies with the system; the Treasurer,  Mr Crean  has now identified some economic problems but hopes that they will simply go away; and the Prime Minister has not expressed any view at all.

* In July the Treasurer told this Parliament 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** boasted publicly in September, in a story headlined 'All Better in a Year- Cameron': 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
-The honourable member for Chisholm  (Mr Staley)  has just put up quite a good case for the people whom he represents, namely those who selected him for the safe seat of Chisholm and who earn about $20,000 a year or more.

* I certainly have had rejected by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  large numbers of prospective migrants who have much better employment records than that doctor.

* The main point made in the speech of the Minister for **Immigration** as Minister representing the Minister for Health was: What would the Australian Labor Party do?'

* Has the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** been drawn to an article in the 'Daily Telegraph' on 
Australia is being destroyed by its **immigration** policies - 
**Immigration**,  upon  notice: 
the investigation of offences against laws administered by the Department and of organised circumvention of **immigration** policies and procedures; 
the establishment and development of procedures for the prevention and detection of **immigration** malpractice; 
In respect of persons granted citizenship, advice is obtained from time to time from the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* With the co-operation of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, electoral claim cards are customarily distributed at naturalisation ceremonies.

* The justification for this appears, as far as I can see, in the speech delivered by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  last night.

* But I still believe that we can control inflation by proper integration of our policies' on tariffs, subsidies, **immigration**, investment, education and profit and price control.

* The problem is so serious that, quite apart from the Government's views on the Labor Party's scheme, our thoughts on general practitioners and the suggestion that general practice clinics might help to reestablish the standing of the general practitioner is in accord with the views expressed - and I trust that the Minister can find time to read them when he has finished speaking to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  at the table- by the Australian Medical Association study group on general practice in its pamphlet entitled General Practice and Its Future in Australia'.

* Department of **Immigration** 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
-There are 2 officers from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta presently visiting East Timor.

* The visit is also partly to start preliminary local preparations for a visit to East Timor by a team of Australian officials from the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* That visit was announced by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on 30 March, and it has been approved.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) What is the advertising budget of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** for 1975-76.

* Let not the Minister for **Immigration** laugh that off because she is a practising Christian and a good cleanliving decent girl whom people had no right to grab by the scruff of the neck like a common criminal and shanghai to New South Wales to be incarcerated in a prison.

* Again there is that supercilious look on the face of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* It is obvious that he is distressed, but the Minister for **Immigration** is not distressed.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 March1979: 
How many illegal immigrants, i.e.

* those who have entered the country legally and who have since contravened the Commonwealth 's **immigration** laws, as well as those who have entered the country illegally, have been deported during the period 1 January1978 to date.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The message I want to state is that pure budgetary and monetary policies are no longer sufficient for trying to achieve a full employment economy.

* The first is in relation to structural unemployment and retraining, and the second is in relation to **immigration**.

* The other matter to which I want to refer is **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 May 1977: 
1 ) Who are the present members of the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
It is a fairly brilliant idea.

* He has compounded the joke by asking the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to think up ways of spending the $50,000.

* Now either the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs or the Minister for Social Security wants to get rid of a lynch-pin in the organisation.

* Department of Labor and **Immigration**: Training in Financial and Auditing Procedures (Question No.

* It reported the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  as saying: 
I am at a loss to know why the Government has sought to ban this man from entering Australia.

* 1 cannot believe that this is the action of the Minister for **Immigration**, a man whom, in the short time I have been here, 1 have grown to respect, a man whom I believe to be a small '1' liberal and a man whom I have praised on other matters in the House.

* Will he discuss with his colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, how best to discourage and delay the entry into Australia of any more expatriate Pakistani and Indian doctors while hundreds of thousands of emaciated and disease ridden Pakistani and Indian people are dying from malnutrition and a lack of medical attention.

* When the Whitlam Government took office and unemployment began to rapidly escalate, that Government reduced **immigration** to 30,000 persons per annum.

* On coming to office the Fraser Government increased **immigration** to 70,000 persons a year under strict guidelines.

* Going backwards, in recent times there have been the new Minister for the Navy  (Dr Mackay);  before him, the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen);  before him, the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly);  before him, the present Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr Chipp);  before him, the present Administrator of the Northern Territory and, before him, the new Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* It ought to be noted that the Press statement released at that time by the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  had been written by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* In this situation we find the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the Prime Minister and others willing to condemn air hostesses but not the AMWU and John Halfpenny and not the Builders Labourers Federation for what they might want to do in terms of guerrilla tactics and industrial anarchy right around Australia.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has said that if the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were changed the situation would be improved.

* On taking office as Minister for **Immigration** I established a committee on citizenship of the **Immigration** Advisory Council and I took this step to check on the position as revealed in the previous Government's survey of 1971.

* The latest recommendation was endorsed by the entire **Immigration** Advisory Council, of which  Senator Gordon  Davidson was for so long a distinguished  chairman.

* These were his words: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following information: 
Following publicity given last year to claims that large numbers of Papua-New Guineans were entering and residing illegally in the Torres Strait area and northern Queensland an **immigration** task force visited the area on a number of occasions and found the claims to be greatly exaggerated.

* Nevertheless the information obtained by the task force has formed the basis for recommendations to interested Ministers on measures to overcome illegal **immigration** in the area, keeping in mind however the traditional rights and movements of Papua-New Guineans in the Torres Strait.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
Where and when have there been meetings of the Ministers for **Immigration** in the last year.

* The Child Migrant Education Program is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**, and funds for the program are appropriated to his Department.

* The Department of Education and Science is responsible for providing educational advice and assistance, for acting as the agent of the Department of **Immigration** and for the development of teaching methods, materials and teacher training courses.

* The information which the honourable member has sought is contained in the following two tables based respectively on Table VII and combined Tables IX and XI of the Report of the Minister for **Immigration** on the Migrant Education Program for 1971-72 tabled in this Parliament on 20th September 1972.

* But, tonight, I think the honourable member for Grayndler gave us a very reasoned and studied approach to the subject of **immigration**.

* 1 think that his suggestion of an all party committee to look into the subject of **immigration** is something that is well worth considering.

* lt is just over 25 years since Australia's post-war **immigration** programme came into operation and it is interesting to note that, at this time, we are hearing criticism of the scheme.

* As one journalist wrote recently: Australia's **immigration** programme has been taken out of the sacred cow category and subjected to increasing criticism'.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  has been aware of this type of criticism for some time, and recently, as the honourable member for Grayndler said, the Minister announced that the Government would undertake a full scale review of Australia's **immigration** programame.

* The present scheme was introduced by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  when he was Minister for **immigration** in the Chifley Government, and it has been continued by succeeding Liberal and Country Party Governments.I think it is a matter for some pride, that Australia has absorbed some 2.6 million migrants since 1945.

* Although the Department of **Immigration** has existed for only a quarter of a century, Australia has gained much over its two century history from migration.

* **Immigration** started in Australia when the first 850 people landed at Sydney Cove in  1788,  and it has been said that the history of Australia has been the history of **immigration**.

* All of us in this House, are either immigrants ourselves, or descendants of immigrants, so that we might say that Australia's growth and economic strength have been founded on its **immigration** policy.

* I was pleased to read a. recent statement by the Minister that **immigration** to Australia would continue at a high level and that some 2 million new residents could come to Australia in the 1970's.

* But those of us who have been bom in this country do not have to look far to see what **immigration** has contributed in so many ways to what we have now come to accept as the Australian way of life.

* But our restricted **immigration** policy is not based on any theory of racial superiority.

* Australia's **immigration** policy is directed to maintaining a predominantly homogeneous population, mainly because we would not like to see Australia become the breeding ground of racial prejudice and hatred such as we are witnessing in America and England today.

* Most countries have a restricted **immigration** policy for varying reasons.

* But for moral reasons as well as those of national security, let us not slacken in our efforts to expand this wonderful country by continuing our **immigration** programme.

* But what has the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  done less than  2i  weeks after that announcement?

* Minister for **Immigration**, because he jumps side to side, from the back to the front or any way at all over fences.

* He makes numerous statements and now nobody seems to know what is the present **immigration** policy of this country.

* The chap broadcasting the news said: 
The Australian Minister for **Immigration**, he now visit one of the islands- 
I was interested in a report which appeared in the 'Australian' of today's date.

* The article states that public servants in the Departments of Defence, Primary Industry, **Immigration**, Housing, the Taxation Office and Repatriation will be transferred to new jobs.

* Where does the Minister for **Immigration** stand now?

* Perhaps we should look very carefully at our **immigration** policy.

* Australia has a very sound **immigration** policy.

* The Australian **immigration** policy had one great architect.

* This has been his general attitude, and perhaps that is the reason why he dumped the peasant from Grayndler as Labor's spokesman on **immigration** matters.

* It certainly has been a restrictive **immigration** policy, but not nearly as restrictive as the policies of many Asian countries.

* With its vaunted high standard of living, culture and all the rest, the problems which it faces are a striking example of how difficult this **immigration** question is.

* We have Britain's example of what happened when she allowed unrestricted **immigration**.

* Eventually she had to restrict **immigration**.

* Today we have many policies on **immigration**.

* Here again, in an attempt to gain political popularity he has fallen down on his face again because the Australian people do not want his **immigration** policy or the policy of so many others who have expressed variations of Labor's policy.

* As a matter of fact, I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party has an **immigration** policy today, because it has left the policy of the right honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Grayndler.

* **Immigration** is an important problem.

* We Australians have established an **immigration** policy to give us a homogeneous society, and we are determined to maintain it.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I am very pleased that this question has been raised today because it gives me the opportunity to explain away some of the misconceptions which presently exist regarding the Government's **immigration** policy- misconceptions which seem to be shared by honourable members opposite.

* I would like to start by saying that last week when the Estimates Committee was looking into the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs it was made clear that it is too early to make the kind of judgment on the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System which the honourable members opposite are presently trying to do.

* The  Deputy  Secretary of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs said: 
I think it is operating under a misconception to see any effects of the new policy, which really dates from 1 January this year, in the intake figures for the financial year 1978-79 .

* At this stage we do not have any clear indication from the settler arrival statistics of what the precise impact of the various categories of the new **immigration** policy .

* I think honourable members opposite would do well to examine the NUMAS points system in detail, as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has outlined it.

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  should also examine the principles of **immigration** which are followed by this Government and which were presented to the House by the Minister last year.

* The second of these principles states: 
This clearly is the basis of NUMAS and the basis for the administration of our **immigration** program.

* If honourable members opposite are concerned about relationships between **immigration** and unemployment, they should have a close look at their own party's policy in this area.

* In other words, the bulk of the Opposition's **immigration** intake would not be related to labour market considerations at all.

* It is strange that the Opposition, when in office, brought **immigration** levels to the lowest point on record and did away with a separate Department of **Immigration**, incorporating that Department with the Department of Labour.

* Now it would promise an **immigration** intake comprised mainly of those people who would be competing for jobs at the most competitive end of the labour market, that is the unskilled area, or the area where there is no specific occupational demand.

* The Labor Party never seems to accept that there are positive employment aspects to a sensibly controlled **immigration** program.

* **Immigration** provides us with a labour force mobility which would not otherwise exist.

* **Immigration** also overcomes leads and lags in our domestic retraining schemes, which we do not underestimate.

* As the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has already pointed out, for skilled workers entering employment, additional jobs are created for semi-skilled and unskilled workers.

* Of course, **immigration** means a greater demand for housing, consumer durables and other goods and services produced in Australia.

* rightly points out that it is illogical to concentrate attention on the effects of migration on the supply of labour, especially during recession, without admitting the demand-creating features of our **immigration** program.

* The general evidence from Australia's own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that **immigration** does not increase unemployment.

* My own view is that increased **immigration** at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits.

* The Minister for Labour and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has quite rightly pointed out in his second reading speech that 53 per cent of the wage and salary earners in Australia belong to trade unions.

* Be that as it may, one of the major problems we must face with this question is the danger that the trade unions will become too centralised in the sense that if all courses are to be run through this Authority, there is a very real danger, of which no doubt the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is aware, that if certain ideological sections of the community set out to gain control of this Authority, and in particular control of its syllabus, the implications for the settlement of industrial disputes in Australia is very serious indeed.

* He refers to the Green Paper that followed the Borrie report, and is critical of the **immigration** program, of the ideological commitment of the Liberal Party to pursue population growth policies.

* He accused the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  of misleading the House on a matter where he subsequently admitted he was quite mistaken and that the Minister was quite correct.

* I understand that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has estimated that the actual unemployment figures- not the seasonally adjusted figures- in JanuaryFebruary of next year to be of the order of 400 000.

* I am amazed at the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  promoting the establishment of a monster which could become an embarrassment to the Government.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** should enforce the principles of rank and file control of oganisations through the provision of a secret ballot under Commonwealth Electoral Office supervision for the election of the officials of all organisations.

* I am going to say quite bluntly that 1 think the Ministerial Member of **Immigration**, or the Minister for **Immigration** if he is to become that, in Papua New Guinea should have the power of deportation.

* The power over **immigration** and emigration - who comes into their country and who goes out of it - would be a very important step in self-government and 1 believe that it would lead to certain changes in attitudes that might improve race relations.

* Because private students are the responsibility of the Department of **Immigration**, I have referred the second part of the honourable member's question to my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**.

* However, the comparability of the figures is limited by factors such as the retention of students in the same grade for more than 1 year, **immigration**, interstate migration and movement between types of school (particularly during the final years of secondary schooling), details of which are not available.

* 1 ) Australia's **immigration** policy is non-discriminatory.

* I am advised that the Departments of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security are examining the question of the longitudinal survey of Vietnamese refugees, originally proposed to be undertaken by  Dr Martin,  in the context of considering a much wider survey of refugees in Australia.

* Does the honourable gentleman recall saying on 'Monday Conference* this week that this postponement was an automatic outcome of an administrative decision which he himself took as the Minister for **Immigration**?

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
There are 2 matters that I want  to  place before the House for both  of  which honourable  members  should have both an individual and collective concern.

* But one  of  the situations that have developed as a result  of  some  of  our **immigration** policies is that a man can come here from  America,  take up a position in Australia with one  of  these companies and replace Australians.

* This is a matter in relation  to  which I hope the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  will give me an answer but I understand that such a person can receive tax free benefits for 4 years.

* I am concerned that our **immigration** policy allows a person to come here in this situation, to replace a highly skilled Australian and to obtain special benefits in taxation and other things.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  pointed out, we are living in a society in which there are labour markets.

* The initiatives that have been taken by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** are to be commended.

* We challenge honourable members opposite to put on the line what they would do - not merely voice criticism of the tremendous job being done by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I think it is fair to say that a number of different programs of migrant education have been developed by various bodies- by the Department of Education in the Commonwealth sphere, by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and by other various State bodies- which do need some coordination.

* I have drawn this to the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs because I think it is of concern to him in the ethnic affairs part of his portfolio.

* The structure of that education centre is as follows- I gather that it is not just limited to Eastbridge and that there is a similar situation existing in other centres: Firstly, the Language Training Supervisor in charge of that centre is employed by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** seen statements in the Victorian metropolitan and provincial newspapers indicating that the State Government is planning to recruit building workers, particularly for country areas?

* I rise on this occasion more in sorrow than in anger because I have an uneasy feeling that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  either wittingly or unwittingly has deceived the House.

* I repeat the quotation, referred to by the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street),  from the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* To my surprise and to the surprise of all of us we heard the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry  (Senator Wriedt),  come into the House and say that the Government wanted an increase from lc per lb to 1.6c per lb in the levy on beef.

* The Minister, in association with child welfare authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs because, in my view, the activities and initiatives of the Government in this area represent one of the major success stories of this Government over the past  2Vi  years.

* I thank the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  who is the Opposition spokesman in this area for the way in which he has really given strong basic support to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the Government.

* It was the present Government which saw the need to establish a separate Department of **Immigration** with which migrants would establish contact initially and which would continue to provide a special contact point for migrants during their subsequent settlement in Australia.

* Yet it was the Labor Party which did away with a separate Department of **Immigration**.

* On the other hand this Government reintroduced the Department of **Immigration** and expanded it to include ethnic affairs, a recognition of the fact that the Government does not see migrants as being just workers but rather as people with a unique and cultural heritage which we should encourage them to foster as they become Australian citizens.

* I congratulate the Goverment and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table, on this.

* I would like to say a few words about the Government's recently announced intention to increase Australia 's **immigration** intake.

* Firstly, I state that under the Labor Government in 1975-76 Australia's **immigration** reached the lowest level since 1947 when there was an intake of 52,000 people.

* This Government, on the other hand, has decided to increase the net annual **immigration** intake to 70,000 for the first year of the triennial rolling program which commenced in the year 1 978-79.

* On balance, in my opinion, this expanded **immigration** program should be welcomed by all Australians; but it must be done sensibly, with caution and with a certain degree of flexibility.

* It is difficult in times of high unemployment to gain widespread acceptance of the need for an expanded **immigration** poliCy.

* Also, **immigration** can provide a labour force mobility which might not otherwise exist.

* In addition, **immigration** can meet occupational shortages and help to overcome lags in domestic retraining schemes.

* Also, **immigration** can help to provide a balance to the work force component of the population which would grow only at diminishing rates with the present and projected combination of a declining natural population growth rate and an aging of that population.

* **Immigration** also can improve expectations of the business community regarding future markets, thereby influencing its output and investment decisions, and it can, of course, create economies of scale.

* I also make the point that those who state that higher **immigration** rates, coupled with capital intensification, will lead automatically to higher unemployment should realise that historically Australia has been able to maintain near full employment at times of high **immigration** and increasing capital to labour ratios.

* But there are also a number of unknowns which could influence the nature of the **immigration** program.

* On balance, I support an expanded **immigration** program on both economic and non-economic grounds; but it must be implemented with caution, flexibility and good sense.

* I also mention that **immigration** policy has to be framed within a long term perspective.

* Decisions taken now, and within the next few years, about **immigration** matters will have a permanent, long term effect on the size and composition of the Australian population.

* I congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, who is at the table.

* He is the best Minister for **Immigration** that we have seen for several decades.

* by leave- The statement of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  was a long and beautifully worded statement which I am sure sounded marvellous to those listening to the broadcast.

* Of course, the policy of this Government has been to centralise all these things back into the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, which is quite contrary to the spirit of the Galbally proposals.

* He points out that different languages seem to raise enormous problems in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I will not comment in detail at this stage because there is legislation before the House, other than to say that because of the way in which it is drafted, with all due respect to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, it is tokenism.

* Perhaps this investigation is what the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  had in mind earlier today when he made the curious claim that  Mr Urbanchich  should be regarded as innocent until proved guilty.

* Does the bland indifference of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs today represent the attitude of this Government?

* We are entitled to know how he came to escape the screening of Australian **immigration**.

* Not only do we have a trade agreement with Yugoslavia, but we have an **immigration** agreement with that country.

* In response to the statement on **immigration** policy by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 22 August I made the following comment: 
The point is that the students claim that they are advised by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to apply for permanent residence visas when they seek to stay here in order to gain work experience.

* The post-war era was a long period of dynamism fuelled by the baby boom of the 1940s and the 1950s and a wave of high level **immigration**.

* I arranged with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to see Vietnamese refugees who had recently arrived in camp in Hong Kong.

* While in Hong Kong I was taken by the Hong Kong authorities to the first staging camp which is basically a quarantine camp in 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 November 1978: 
The blow that was struck by the Commonwealth Government to the home building industry in April 1970 was one that has taken a good deal of time to overcome.

* Taking into consideration that there has been a net increase in **immigration** of 300,000 and that over 200,000 marriages have taken place during this period, one will realise the record of the home building industry since 1970.

* We have to ask ourselves- I know that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  would be asking himself this continually.

* I think the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** nods his head at that.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
The honourable member's main charge against the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is that the Minister could not foresee whether peace or truce would exist between the Christians on the one side and the Palestinians and the Syrians on the other.

* The matter I wish to raise tonight in the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House concerns the Department of **Immigration**.

* I am delighted to see that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is in the chamber.

* The folk concerned have written to the Department of **Immigration** but have received no reply.

* He stated also: 
I advised the person concerned that the telegram from the Minister for **Immigration** had been received and that I would notify her as soon as I had received further information from the Minister.

* Following this, I made further representations to the Minister for **Immigration** on 15 February pointing out that I had received a further representation and stating that I would appreciate the Minister looking into the matter as it was now a matter of some urgency.

* Having received no reply from the Minister to my communication of 15 February, on 19 February I sent a telegram to the Minister stating: 
On 22 February I received in a reply a telegram from the Minister for **Immigration**.

* From 22 October when my first letter was sent to the Minister for **Immigration** and I first made representations in this regard - I say nothing about the original letter written by this lady in September because, as I said earlier, it was written to my State colleague who forwarded it on to me in October - to this day, no final decision has been made on this matter and I believe that nobody would dispute my statement when I said that there was something wrong with the administration of the Department of **Immigration**.

* A great deal has been spoken about **immigration** and about all the various factors relating to **immigration**, yet here is a case which I think is - I use the word sincerely - a disgrace to the 'Department, that over a period of time the Department cannot give a reply to a member making representations.

* Yet on exactly the same day I received a telegram from the Minister for **Immigration** informing me that the person concerned had been interviewed in the country where the application originally had been made and that it was hoped that very soon that person would be given permission to enter Australia.

* So, frankly, I think that this case, plus the other cases to which I have referred show a need for the Minister for **Immigration** to pay a little more attention to what is happening in Sydney than travelling around overseas telling everybody what a marvellous Department of **Immigration** and Government we have and what can be done.

* I informed the Minister for **Immigration** that I intended to raise this matter this evening because I think that the length of time it has taken is beyond all bounds of reasonableness.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  is a university lecturer.

* We have had 9 Ministers for Civil Aviation, 7 Ministers for Shipping and Fuel, 12 Ministers for Air, 8 Ministers for External Affairs, 7 Ministers for **Immigration**, 9 
-The estimates set out in terms of costs Australia's **immigration** policy for the year 1978-79 and the extent of its assistance to ethnic groups.

* Since World War II our population has accelerated and has become more of a European blend because of the **immigration** policy directed towards getting our skilled workers from that general geographic area.

* Their financial cost to the nation for **immigration** was absolutely nothing, but their financial and cultural contribution to Australia today cannot be calculated.

* I want to contrast that with the attitude that has been adopted by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* It is never difficult to defend him against attacks, puerile as they may be, from the Opposition, because his record in the short time that he has been Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in this Parliament is, in my view, without parallel in the history of this Parliament.

* They have received an increase probably two or three times as much as the postal workers have claimed yet they stand here and criticise this Government and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the  Minister for  **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I wish to raise a matter which affects naturalised Australians who have dual nationality.

* It might interest you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  to know that the usual occupant of that chair was Minister for **Immigration** at that time.

* At this end in Australia his parents visited the Italian Consulate and our own Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs with no result.

* A member of my staff comments that he contacted an officer of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* Keeping that in mind, let me now quote in part from the **immigration** platform of the Australian Labour Party as defined at Terrigal in February this year.

* It reads: 
Labour supports an **immigration** policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* Senator Mulvihill, Vice Chairman of the Federal Labor Party's **Immigration** Committee, said in an address entitled  Refugees in the World Today  delivered on Thursday of last week, that is, 28 August:  ... the sympathy, understanding and tolerance with which the Government's policies are administered apply no less strongly to refugees than to migrants generally.

* Clause (f) of the policy which provides that there shall be no discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, politics, creed or sex lies at the heart of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Just as we have a global **immigration** policy, so too we have within its non-discriminatory provisions a global refugee policy.

* -The general supervision of the recommendations of the Galbally inquiry is under my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Additional grants to ethnic organisations have been announced by my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* A special task force headed on a full-time basis by a  deputy  secretary of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is working on the implementation of the various recommendations and, most importantly, it is keeping in contact with ethnic communities in different parts of Australia.

* I ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration** which is supplementary to the one asked today by the Leader of the Opposition concerning Air Vice-Marshal Hawkins, a distinguished Australian airman who fought for this country during the last war, and the withdrawal of his passport.

* -I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: In view of the rapid decline in Australia's population growth and in view of the fact that substantial gains on account of net migration made in the 1960s have during the 1970s been turned into net losses, will the Minister give urgent consideration to converting the present annual **immigration** target of 70 000 settler arrivals into a target of net population gain through **immigration** of 70 000?

* -The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has followed his usual line of appearing to be a reasonable individual.

* That is what he has been doing since he became responsible for **immigration**, in dismantling a lot of the worst excesses of his predecessor,  Mr Grassby.

* If there is anybody in this House who is an archetype of the cynical politician it is the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Working mothers have managed to maintain momentum behind economic development in this country since the early 1960s when it was discovered that, with the fall-off in **immigration** and the contraction in birth rates in earlier years, unless working mothers entered the workforce the economic momentum of this country would be set back.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  in a most effective confidence trick, talked during the last election campaign of making low interest finance available to farmers in massive amounts.

* He mentioned a sum of $500m at 3 per cent interest But the deception did not rest only in the words of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* It has become clear now that the Minister for **Immigration** and the Government as a whole pulled a deliberate and shabby confidence trick on Australian farmers.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in his Budget speech devoted 11 lines in Hansard to the **immigration** program and to all the problems which have been uncovered in recent times in connection with the settlement of people in this country in recent years.

* He capped this 11-line reference to **immigration** with a sad attempt to create further divisions in our society by talking about people disliking migrants - surely a strange phrase in a nation of migrants.

* As a former Minister for **Immigration** I would have thought that the Leader of the Opposition would have attempted to give some attention to the very real inadequacies which exist in Australian society at the present time in relation to the people who have come here recently.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is probably the greatest Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that this country has ever had.

* I must say that the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  set the tone of the debate in opening the discussion on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration**.

* I welcome what the honourable member said concerning the importance of Australia's **immigration** programme which in the post-war period has successfully brought some 2.6 million new settlers to this country.

* 1 can report progress to the House in relation to these studies and I mention that following a recommendation by the **Immigration** Planning Council,  Mr J.  R. Wilson, Senior Lecturer in Economics at Sydney 
University, has been appointed to undertake the cost-benefit analysis.

* The assignment will be conducted under the general supervision of the **Immigration** Planning Council which includes Professor B. R. Williams, Vice Chancellor, Sydney University, whose own authority in the area of cost-benefit analysis is well recognised both in Australia and abroad.

* At the same time, regular exchanges of technical information have taken place with the Canadian Department of **Immigration** which has started a similar survey.

* The honourable member for Scullin mentioned the matter of an **immigration** museum.

* Finally, the honourable member for Riverina raised the question of an **immigration** office in Asia.

* He tried to question what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and myself have been doing in regard to this matter.

* But the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and myself have had the courage to stand up to these people and to stop them standing over the airlines.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
We have had problems: We had the problems of the Whitlam era, when there was a takeover bid for some of the area in New South Wales; when there was a great degree of empire building, as there was in so many other Public Service areas, when the Australian Capital Territory wanted a bit more land, since it was talking about expanding very rapidly to accommodate a population of half a million.

* They did not realise that partly because of the Labor Party's **immigration** policy and partly because of the downturn in the birth rate, Australia was growing at a rate of about 114 per cent compared with the 9 per cent at which the Labor Party wanted the Australian Capital Territory to grow.

* Certainly there was not going to be **immigration**; the Labor Party demonstrated that it was not in favour of **immigration** in this country.

* This rapid growth cannot be sustained in a country which has cut down on its **immigration** intake because of Labor's policies, and in a country which has a rapidly decreasing birthrate.

* It is my personal opinion that the reduction in our **immigration** intake must be a factor in the increased rate of inflation.

* I have never believed **immigration** to be inflationary, but on the other hand I believe that the numbers of immigrants who have come to Australia together with their dependants have provided a steadily increasing local market for our primary and secondary industries.

* Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  at the weekend were only a beginning.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is to be congratulated for starting to remove the last relic of discriminatory legislation from Commonwealth laws.

* I congratulate my friend, the Minister for **Immigration**, for this action.

* He is a very good Minister for **Immigration**.

* I do not want to appear to be a repetitive bore on this topic but now that we have had a change of government once again I want the new Ministry, including my friend and colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table, to be very much aware not only of the aspiration but also of the urgent need of the people of Brisbane to have the airport relocated.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  introduced one measure yesterday with an expectation that it would be considered in detail today.

* In fact, there was no proper explanation of Government policy given to this House in the form of ministerial statements in many significant areas of Government policy - areas of selfproclaimed Government concern - such as the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and, of course, a field very dear to the heart of the Leader of the House, **immigration**.

* The Leader of the House knows full well that he sits in the Ministry with a colleague who has been throughout the length and breadth of Asia proclaiming the concept of a new **immigration** policy for Australia.

* 1 ) Did the Minister receive advice from the former Minister for **Immigration** that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Depanment of **Immigration** to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports.

* If so, has the Minister been advised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** no longer intends to open in Parramatta an office specialising in migrant affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 October 1978: 
Has his attention been drawn to the recent Australian Medical Association Federal Council resolution that **immigration** of doctors be controlled and to previous projections that Australia suffers from an over-supply of doctors?

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** aware of a public statement made in Perth yesterday by a visiting Japanese Government economic mission that future joint ventures between Australia and Japanese interests in Australia could be impeded unless our current migration policies insofar as they affect Japanese migrants, are altered?

* I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that certain skilled Japanese workers may enter Australia under our **immigration** laws as they are applied at present, and that the real restrictions to which the Japanese dignitaries refer are industrial limitations imposed by certain sectors of the trade union movement?

* a Melbourne report, referred to the fact that the Japanese were concerned about our restrictive **immigration** policies affecting joint ventures.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** seen reports that Australia's international airline Qantas is not getting a reasonable share of assisted migrants who travel to this country?

* -On 7 June 1978 the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made a statement on **immigration** which held out considerable promise in the field of family reunion for the ethnic communities.

* In addition to those provisions the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is, at the moment, applying a job guarantee.

* There are two possibilities: One is that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Riverina, misled the House when he introduced the legislation, because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said something which contradicts what the Minister said.

* The Minister for **Immigration** said: 
That is what the Prime Minister said.

* No explanation is given to this Parliament - an explanation which does not He with the statements of the Minister for **Immigration** who is at the table and who irresponsibly represents his colleague in another place.

* With great respect,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I think' that this is highly relevant to the Bill because we are told by this Government in the Budget Speech and by the Minister for **Immigration** that one thing is going to happen and then the Prime Minister in the same hour is saying something quite different to the Press and that is completely, categorically and irrefutably proved.

* He said, firstly, that there was no difference betweeen Pitt Street and Collins Street farmers and all other farmers and secondly- 
-It is scandalous that the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs now plays a secondary role to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in the make-up of Australia's labour force.

* We already have substantially high unemployment in this country and many of those people who are coming to Australia today under the present system of **immigration** will also be unemployed.

* A charge of misleading the Parliament and the Australian electorate is not one taken lightly by the Opposition, but departmental documents prove conclusively that the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  have deliberately attempted to mislead the Australian Parliament.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
**Immigration**: Special Passage Assistance Programme (Question No.

* 4057)  Mr Whitlam  asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
(a) In none of the Agreements mentioned above is any provision made regarding an annual intake of migrants from the country with which the Agreement is made.

* Annual **immigration** targets are determined year by year by the Australian Government and, where necessary, in consultation with the Government concerned.

* Here I draw attention to an answer I was given on 28 May last by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  giving the number of certificates of citizenship granted in excess of 100 in the various local government areas in Australia.

* In order to indicate that this concern is expressed on both sides of the House, I will quote from the House of Representatives  Hansard  of 1 1 September 1975 when the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  asked a question of the then Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The honourable member for Gellibrand asked: 
Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** inform the House why the unemployment figures compiled by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** from its Commonwealth Employment Service records are substantially in excess of those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics through its quarterly labour force survey?

* I know that this matter is in the mind of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  but unfortunately it appears that even he can do very little.

* In relation to the other matters raised by the honourable member, I have never said, and this Government has never said, that **immigration** should be seen as a substitute for training or retraining.

* **Immigration** should be seen as working in conjunction with training and retraining.

* In the light of that situation the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has taken the opportunity to try to extend the language of the exemption, but in a way which will limit the area of the exemption.

* That may well be what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** intends, but he must know the ramifications of it if it is what he intends.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Australia's post-war **immigration** programme, which has played such an important part in our national development, is to be continued in the 1972-73 financial year.

* I refer, of course, to the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  who, as Minister for **Immigration** during the early post-war years, laid the foundation of what is generally regarded as one of the most spectacular and successful mass migration programmes in history.

* To the right honourable member for Melbourne and to the first permanet head of the Department of **Immigration**,  Sir Tasman  Heyes, must go the main credit for launching this monumental scheme.

* I pay tribute also to the dedicated Ministers for **Immigration** and officials who have served Australia so well over the years since that time and who are serving Australia now.

* The Australian Labor Party at its Launceston conference last year made a radical departure from its traditional **immigration** policy by proposing to abolish all forms of discrimination.

* The longstanding bi-partisan policy on **immigration** has unfortunately been abandoned officially by the Australian Labor Party, and its chief spokesman for many years on **immigration** matters, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has been unceremoniously dropped because he does not agree with the proposed removal of all forms of discrimination.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1978: 
What differences exist between the **immigration** restrictions of Australia and those of Papua New Guinea on persons moving between Papua and the Torres Islands.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Although some few people outside this chamber have put the point of view that Australia's population should ideally be stabilised at around 13 to 15 million people, there seems little doubt that for this country to become economically balanced a population in excess of 20 million is necessary.

* For these and other reasons we have had a sustained **immigration** programme since the end of the Second World War.

* I believe that this aspect of **immigration** policy was a valid one, and still is, though perhaps to a lesser extent today when military technology has, to a certain degree at least, overcome the advantages previously enjoyed by sheer numbers of people.

* However, it is in the increase of our economic strength that the **immigration** policy has had its most easily measurable impact.

* In addition, cultural benefits have also been derived from our **immigration** policy.

* That there are problems and costs associated with the **immigration** scheme nobody denies, and I would like to look at some of the criticisms that have been raised, lt has been said that not enough use has been made of many skilled personnel who emigrate to Australia and I believe that in some cases this is and has been the case.

* I mention the convertibility of qualifications and I believe it is to the credit of the Department of Labour and National Service that it has undertaken the task of compiling a guide to European technical qualifications and their approximate equivalent here, lt is also a tribute to the Department of **Immigration** that in 1969 it established a committee on overseas professional qualifications.

* There are some other aspects of our **immigration** policy which have disturbed me in the past but I believe that steps which have recently been taken will do much to overcome criticism.

* I firmly believe our **immigration** policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable migrants and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate migrants into our society.

* I believe the Department of **Immigration** is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, welfare officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of migrants in this country.

* Research into desirable future population levels together with the structure and distribution of the population within Australia can only be of great assistance in assessing desirable levels of **immigration**.

* A cost-benefit analysis of **immigration** and time span surveys of migrants during their early years will provide much needed back-up data and disclose avenues for further initiative in the selection and integration of settlers.

* The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment to the Migration Planning Council can only add to the effectiveness of this Council and, together with the **Immigration** Advisory Council and the **Immigration** Publicity Council, it will act as a source of good advice to this Government.

* The approach adopted by the Minister and his Department, particularly the efforts quantitatively and qualitatively to assess the selection procedures, desirable intake levels, assimilation procedures, and contribution of new settlers will do much to answer the questions of those who view our **immigration** policy with some suspicion.

* That report has been sought by successive Ministers for **Immigration**.

* If the honourable member asks his own colleagues who held the position of Minister for **Immigration** or Minister for Labor and **Immigration** he will find that they sought to have the report finalised and brought forward for consideration.

* On attaining the office of Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs I too sought the finalisation of the report, and I am pleased to say that I have been partially successful.

* I welcome his agreement that in such matters as **immigration**, of which he was speaking, Australia should, to quote the words of my Party's platform, avoid discrimination on grounds of race*.

* Phillip Lynch, then Minister for **Immigration**, attended a meeting of the Central Committee of the United Croatian Associations  of  Australia on April 3, 1970 ... At the April 10 celebrations of last year,  Mr Ian  Fuller deputised in Sydney for  Dr Malcolm  Mackay, then Minister for  the Navy; while in  Hobart  Dr  Bob  Solomon   .

* I should have thought that this would have been known since a former Minister for **Immigration** attended a meeting, and on the wall behind the platform on which he stood were 2 portraits: One of Queen Elizabeth II and the other, he thought, of the  president  of the association whose meeting he was attending.

* Yet we find that subsequent Ministers for **Immigration** and some of their colleagues have attended similar celebrations.

* Meetings of Commonwealth and State Ministers for **Immigration**, during the past 12 months, have taken place in Melbourne on 9th October 1970 and in Hobart on 7th May 1971.

* The main purpose of these regular conferences is to enable Ministers for **Immigration** to keep each other fully informed on current activities and developments in relation to the **immigration** programme.

* There has been a change in the attitude of the Government in relation to an **immigration** program.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
Since January 1970 the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and its predecessors have been collecting data on persons registered with its Employment Service who are seeking part-time work and since January 1973 the Department has been collecting information on vacancies for parttime workers.

* The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has been active in seeking to secure a wider acceptance of part-time employment as a regular feature of the employment market structure.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I support the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  but I also share his belief that legislation on this subject is essential.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  described the situation illustrated by the Moore v. Doyle case as 'notorious'.

* It described the basic problem which was facing Australia in these terms: 
It is a matter of record that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** meets his State counterparts frequently.

* I would like to make it clear, because of inaccurate Press reports, that there has been no questioning by the Japanese Government to the Australian Government of our **immigration** policy.

* In the light of the question that was asked by the honourable gentleman I point out that the Australian Government has not thought it necessary to raise the question of Japanese **immigration** policies with the Japanese Government.

* In relation to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question, I think all I can say is that our **immigration** policy does not, of course, differentiate between the nationals of countries according to the amount of trade that those countries do with us.

* This inevitable consequence has been recognised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and also by the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* The Minister for Overseas 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, in a letter to the Treasurer dated 27 June, copies of which were sent to all of his ministerial colleagues, said this: 
You will also recall,  Mr Acting Speaker,  that I sought leave of the Prime Minister today to table that correspondence - which of course was denied - because this correspondence indicates again, as we have seen on so many earlier occasions, that at the present time in Australia there is no semblance of Cabinet government but rather a public meeting of Ministers who parade their particular views before the Press and before the general public without at the same time seeking to involve their colleagues in meetings of the Cabinet.

* The sorry mess which was referred to during question time today and which was gratuitously referred to by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was an economy in which the worst level of unemployment was 2.4 per cent or almost 137,000 in December.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will recall that in 1970 the then Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Phillip  Lynch, made an announcement regarding a number of steps that were to be taken by the then Government, amongst which was the commissioning of Professor J. R. Wilson of the University of Sydney to undertake - 
There was a drought; I can tell you.

* He was commissioned to undertake a costbenefit analysis of **immigration** into Australia.

* by leave- Ordinarily the statement of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have been followed by a statement from my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  who is the spokesman for the Australian Labor 
Party on **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* I know that there must be a very heavy load on the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister in processing the hundreds of applications that honourable members make on this matter.

* But I speak at this stage because I hope that before we come to the debate on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the week after next it may be possible to clear up some matters.

* I have already given instructions that an **immigration** officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia.

* We decided- it was a joint discussion and a joint decision by my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  and I- that we believed it was in the best interests of Australians and of the ethnic communities generally if we set up a separate unit within the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

* When parliamentary members of the Labor Party accept the prescriptions of Caucus and when they accept the restraints that the Prime Minister today demonstrably placed upon the then  Speaker  and upon the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  but refused to place on the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  we do not believe that any member of that Party can be seen as being prepared to comply with the Standing Orders and to maintain the dignity of this Parliament.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
-Has the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs seen a report alleging that the Government has failed to honour its obligations in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution in relation to Rhodesia; that it is in fact admitting Rhodesians contrary to that resolution; and that the Government is using its program for the entry of IndoChinese refugees as a means of legitimising entry of Rhodesians?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
However, it is doubtful whether  Mrs Le  Mesurier will ever receive an Australian pension unless the Act is amended, as she is over 80 years of age.

* I would therefore like the Minister to take this matter up with his colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  and give consideration to amending the Act with a view to paying the Australian pension to all migrants over 80 years of age, after serving a qualifying period of 6 months, as applies to residents from the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Will he provide a list of all Inquiries relating to **immigration** since 2 December 1972.

* Minister for **Immigration** aware that a percentage of Australian university graduates from Asian countries, after being refused residential status in Australia, migrate to developed countries such as Canada?

* -My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 August 1979: 
-I preface my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs by quoting from an article in the Johannesburg  Star  of 13 January 1979: 
Australian **immigration** officials confirmed this week that it has doubled to four its **immigration** staff in Pretoria to handle the growing number of applications by white Rhodesians to come to Australia.

* It has been alleged that for the next few months - until the vote for the Security Council is taken - the Soviet Union should not be antagonised and that the Department of Foreign Affairs has told the Department of **Immigration** that it should not be sympathetic to people whom the Soviet Union wants to exclude from membership of any outside nation - people whom it wants to get back into its own clutches.

* I do not have much confidence in the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* The previous Minister for **Immigration**, the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch),  who is sitting at the table at present, was a reasonable sort of bloke when he held the **Immigration** portfolio.

* All the betrayals of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  over rural finance, as bad as they are, pale into insignificance beside this action on superphosphate.

* At least not many people took the Minister for **Immigration** very seriously when he talked about $500m for farmers at 3 per cent apart from the people of the Riverina, who believed the Minister, much to their cost.

* Where is the Minister for **Immigration** who used to come in here caterwauling week after week last year and who went out at election time making promises a mile long and who has delivered nothing?

* As to the inclusion or the maintenance of the renunciation of all other allegiance, although the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has explained tonight that 18 other countries do not require renunciation of other allegiance, we in Australia are in a peculiar position at the moment.

* To my mind one of the deplorable consequences of the actions of the 'Minister for **Immigration** is that the future homogeneity of the Australian population could well be prejudiced if the trend towards reducing the inflow of a minimum of 50 per cent of the migrant intake from the United Kingdom be reduced.

* It is of course a new homogeneitey; it develops as our **immigration** develops.

* But the present Minister for **Immigration** is changing the emphasis and I am quite concerned that, in the trends towards the reduction of the meaningfulness of the difference between a British citizen and an Australian citizen which this Bill reflects, we are denigrating the maintenance of this homogeneity which is such an important part of the Australian nation today.

* That is the general criterion under which the scheme is operating on instructions sent out from the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* and (3) The provision for maintenance guarantees is contained in the Migration Regulations which are the responsibility of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs from whom the required information should be sought.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
He has not told us about the uncertainty that he has created in the rural sector of the community by not agreeing to any long term proposals for the wheat industry, rural reconstruction and a whole host of other matters.

* Is that what the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  meant when he talked about $500m at 3 per cent?

* Let me refer to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The **immigration** policy is up; it is down; it is stopped; it is started.

* We do not know what is the level of **immigration** in this country at the moment.

* I must say that I am unaware of the reasons which were advanced for it but I want to observe that over a quarter of a century in which Australia has had experience in the promotion of a high level **immigration** programme our record in relation to selection and assessment of the 2.6 million migrants who have come to this country post- 1945 has been very good.

* I think of the reports we have received of the incidence of mental illness and crime among migrants; of the reports that we have received on migrant youth; of the fact that the Australian system has been well commended by international authorities in the field of **immigration**; of the fact that our experience has been sought by other countries with high level **immigration** programmes, and finally of the fact that 2.6 million people who have come here in the post-war period have with some difficulties been effectively integrated into the Australian community.

* I want to say to the honourable member and to the House that this is not a question on which one can take any position of complacency because undoubtedly, in view of the fact that **immigration** is a difficult experience and because of the human factor, mistakes have been made in the past and will no doubt continue to be made in the future.

* The Minister, of course, is in charge of his Department, as I made certain to emphasise when the appointment of first assistant secretaries came up in the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Where and when have there been meetings of the **Immigration** Ministers since 4 December 1972.

* When will the next meeting of the **Immigration** Ministers take place.

* For the information of honourable members I present the final report by the **Immigration** Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia.

* The progress report was presented to the House on 14 March 1973. 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 
The programme designed to teach migrants to speak English has failed dismally.

* He went on to say that a recent survey conducted by the Department of **Immigration** indicates that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English, and the Department's classes cater for only a small proportion of these.

* I am sure that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  does not agree with me on this matter, for obviously if he did the Bill would be substantially different.

* For example, the Federal Department of Education and Science, which is administering Commonwealth grants for the Department of **Immigration**, is insisting that teaching follow the situational method which is taught to adult migrants in its classes for children.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* This makes a mockery of the repeated claims by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that his Government has provided strong and continuing support for child migrant education.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Recently there has been a good deal of criticism about the change in ministerial arrangementsabout the change of the positions of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and of myself.

* Under previous governments there have been 8 Ministers for Defence, 7 AttorneysGeneral, 8 Ministers for External Affairs, 9 Ministers for Civil Aviation, 7 Ministers for Shipping and Transport, 12 Ministers for Air, 7 VicePresidents of the Executive Council and 7 Ministers for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 November 1978: 

 Mr Neil expressed concern that the Liberal Party- may have alienated itself from the Greek community because of the mass prosecutions of Greek migrants involved in allegations of social welfare fraud.

* As a result of  Mr Neil  's concern the Prime Minister instructed the Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr MacKellar,  to investigate.

* Despite the constraints of staff ceilings and a tight Budget, the **Immigration** Department sent a number of officers to Sydney to confer with Greek leaders.

* Some Greeks thought it strange that **immigration** officers should be despatched on a mission which appeared to be on behalf of the Liberal party 
How true.

* He wants to know from the Minister for **Immigration** how many people of Chinese origin are in the electoral division of St George.

* Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  removed the honourable member for Grayndler from his position of shadow minister with responsibilities in conection with the handling of the Labor Party's side of **immigration**. ]

* He is looking for friends because we all know that when Labor does not win the next election fearless Freddie will be back in favour steering the destiny of this nation insofar as he can as Labor's spokesman on its **immigration** policy.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Initially, the Committee requested written submissions from seven departments which were selected as being representative of a wide range of Commonwealth publishing operations.

* These departments were External Territories, **Immigration**, Interior, Labour and National Service, National Development, Trade and Industry and the Treasury.

* The Department of **Immigration** has centralised its overseas printing in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom; the Department of Trade and Industry arranges its overseas printing in all continents; while the Australian News and Information Bureau has its printing for overseas distribution done mainly in Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 May 1979: 
I was amazed to listen to the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  this evening complaining that members of the Opposition originally were critical on the one hand of the Regional Employment Development scheme and yet on the other they supported the principals of our parties in the States in protesting against its cessation.

* What we have been criticising is not the system or the principles involved as originally laid down by the former Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  but the way in which the Government has carried out those principles.

* I wish to direct my comments this evening to the **immigration** aspect of the appropriations for the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* The former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 26 October last year issued a Press statement on the migration program for 1974-75.

* But, having regard to the smaller **immigration** program- 80 000- decided upon by the Government for 1974-75, there would need to be a significant reduction in the approval rate.

* I will not set out all the details because the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** knows all about that case.

* Then, on 1 5 September I wrote to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and received a reply, a portion of which I will now quote.

* I used to receive a number of letters of this type from the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, Al Grassby, who said that he was going to do a lot of things, but nothing ever happened.

* Yet, in Division 366, which is the appropriation to which I am speaking, we are being asked to approve a proposed expenditure of $4,884,600 for Overseas Services which are basically related to **immigration**.

* If we were to revert to the former situation and if we sought to increase the number of migrants entering Australia to up to 180 000, how would officers of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** be able to cope if they cannot handle the few migrants who are coming to Australia now?

* In conclusion what I am saying is that in my mind the Government is tackling the problem of **immigration** back to front.

* It is time the Government woke up and realised that **immigration** has played a very important role in the advancement of this nation.

* I am amazed that the Government and the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** (Sentor James McClelland) are not prepared to extend the program to a reasonable limit so that the original suggestion of the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, may be acceded to.

* What agreements with other countries have been made or amended since 4th December 1972 which affected **Immigration**.

* In plain terms the Cabinet has been snowed' by the support of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  for union wage claims beyond the wage fixation guidelines set down in the recent national wage decision.

* They have each abrogated their responsibilities in the face of threats by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has scorned his colleagues and the Australian public whose interest he has a direct obligation to protect.

* On 10 May the  Australian ' had this to say: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in the Commonwealth jurisdiction in this country is the saboteur of the policy of wage and salary restraint.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is well aware that excessive wage and salary costs can price labour out of the market and can force up prices.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has deliberately, to use his own words uttered but a few years ago, 'cooked the books' to deceive and mislead the Australian public.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  spoke for about 30 minutes but no doubt before this debate is concluded members of the Opposition will be gagged.

* The first matter I want to raise is in relation to the **immigration** part of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I am concerned that our policy has drifted away from the original one laid down by the first Minister for **Immigration**, the late A.

* Basically, his policy was to lift the population of Australia through **immigration** but at the same time keep a homogeneous population.

* The immediate past Minister for **Immigration** recently said that any Australian Minister, public servant or government worker would be sacked on the spot if he sought to promote discrimination on the grounds of race, colour or creed.

* In past years **immigration** has been a subject of non political consequence.

* We were told by the former Minister for **Immigration** that the future policy would be based on family reunions and that this would play a very important role in relation to incoming migrants.

* However, I am also conscious of what can happen if a country adopts a policy of pleasing all, as our immediate past Minister for **Immigration** was only too quick to try to do.

* To see how our **immigration** policy will affect Australia in the long term one need only look at the position in the United Kingdom at present.

* Time will not allow me to go into all the ramifications of this Department of Labor and **Immigration** but I should like to mention some other points.

* I remember that as Minister for **Immigration** he was an extremely kindly man to immigrant families whose cases were presented to him, as I presented some in my first years here.

* I remember that he showed the same great courtesy to members of the Opposition of that time in the personal manner in which he dealt with cases which they presented to him as Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
-Order!

* I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Yes, I agree to some extent with that point of view but surely a matter connected with a change in Australia's **immigration** policy is something for which the Minister is responsible.

* I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Admittedly both New Zealand and Canada do not worry to the same extent as we do about **immigration** matters.

* It is true that our Department of **Immigration** has 318 people looking after the migrants that we are trying to get not only from Great Britain but also from Europe, but even in that area only approximately 100 of these people are Australian based personnel.

* Because we are reducing our **immigration** programme I believe that the personnel associated with **immigration** should be reduced from the 318 that I have mentioned to a much lesser number.

* The Prime Minister should say to our Minister for Foreign Affairs: 'You, Foreign Minister, take over the affairs of Australia House; segregate the Department of **Immigration**, the Department of Trade and Industry and the other similar departments that are represented at Australia House, but for goodness sake, Foreign Minister, take over the responsibilities, cut the staff to a reasonable number and compare achievements with those of Canada and New Zealand'.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I wish to raise a grievance about a leaflet which is circulating in some areas and which is put out by the **Immigration** Control Association.

* I quote the following statement from the leaflet as my first example: 
There are arrows pointing to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)-  these men- these politicians- afraid of offending the United Nations are now breaking faith with those who died and suffered to keep Asian invaders out of Australia.

* They fought and died to keep Australia a free and democratic country, and part of that freedom and that democratic process is the right to decide what sort of **immigration** policy we should have and what sort of criteria should be administered.

* I do not know whether the honourable member for Cunningham is supporting the **Immigration** Control Association.

* Apart from the fact that I think the leaflet exaggerates the problems in Great Britain, I point out that Australia in the formulation of its **immigration** policies has always tried to learn from the experiences of other countries.

* One of the aims of our pattern of **immigration** is to try to ensure that we do not have developing in particular areas under-privileged enclaves of people who form a problem in an area.

* There is room for sensible debate about **immigration** policies in this country.

* But to try to base an attitude towards **immigration** on the sort of puerile propaganda contained in this type of leaflet does not do any good for the Australian community.

* **Immigration**  (Question No.

* 374)  "  Mr Scholes  asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has a decision been made on the proposal to establish a permanent **immigration** office in Geelong.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Finally, I should like to comment on the amending legislation regarding the Federal Government's subsidy increase from one-half to two-thirds of the salaries paid io welfare officers.

* I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or welfare officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of **immigration**, repatriation, social security and other social welfare needs.

* I discovered that at a conference of Ministers for **Immigration** in November 1973 it was agreed that a strict set of operating rules, such as those applying in South Australia, should be introduced throughout the States where the land and housing companies were engaged in these sponsorship schemes.

* Within 3 days it would be incumbent upon the company to convey its nominees to the State **immigration** office so that they could be given an advisory talk on such subjects as house purchase, contracts, hire purchase and many other matters that were of vital concern to a new migrant coming to this country.

* The present Minister for **Immigration** in Western Australia, the Honourable Bill Grayden, or William Grayden I suppose I should say, soon after his appointment received a letter from the  Chairman  for Landall Construction and Development Company Pty Ltd requesting a revision of these conditions governing the acceptance of personal nominations from private development companies.

* I am informed that immediately or very shortly after the Minister received the request from the Landall company, he decided to revoke the 2 rules which the Ministers for **Immigration** had previously agreed upon so that there would no longer be the necessity, which previously would have operated, of letting migrants know something about the law before they entered into these contracts.

* The disproportionate burden of complaint from Landall nominees was a matter of very great concern to my colleague, the former Minister for **Immigration**, and he took steps to see that an inquiry was made into them.

* I rise to speak to the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Due to the fact that time is limited, I should like to refer to three particular areas which come within the responsibility of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to illustrate the intolerable neglect, once again, of this Government which is endeavouring to dupe migrant communities in this country into believing that the Government is acting m their interests.

* It is exaggerated by the Government's dated policy of considering **immigration** in a compartmentalised capsule divorced from all those policy areas affecting it.

* When speaking in the debate on a matter of public importance I did not elect that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs should answer the debate.

* In a tug-of-war with the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the Department of Social Security won out.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  was appointed as spokesman on **immigration** by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).

* I would like to read to the House from the **Immigration** Control Association's publication called 'Viewpoint'.

* In other words the appointment by the Leader of the Opposition of me as spokesman on **immigration**.

* I would like to point out to the House that to my knowledge the publication from which the honourable member for Prospect was quoting was one from which he quoted some 2 years ago and it bore no relation to the appointment by the Leader of the Opposition of me as spokesman for **immigration**.

* I believe that the honourable member for Prospect said in the House today that it was a pity that I had not repudiated the association with the **Immigration** Control Association.

* I find myself in the position of speaking on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** rather earlier that I had expected.

* The former Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Lynch,  said that the Government 'decided to finance the salary costs of teachers employed to teach migrant children in special classes and the necessary supervisory staff, special training courses for teachers in methods of teaching English as a foreign language, the provision of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for special classes, and the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials'.

* I know that both the Commonwealth Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  have received a number of deputations on these matters, because the situation in capital cities in particular is so critical.

* Of course, this is not a Commonwealth responsibility but, since **immigration** is a Commonwealth responsibility, it is not too much to expect that the Commonwealth should make very firm representations to the States that the rigid educational facilities and staffing establishments in the schools affected should be made more flexible so that the job can be carried out properly.

* This probably sounds pretty self-evident but it certainly needs emphasising.It means that we must expect this Government, through the Department of **Immigration**, to provide within the English language programme that exists in Australia a recognition of the needs of the professional groups in this area where oral communication is so important.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
Office accommodation occupied by the Department of **Immigration** in the Australian Capital Territory is as follows: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: 
On three occasions recently Fred Daly, whom you have appointed as shadow Minister for **Immigration**, has given a racist interpretation of Federal ALP policy on **immigration**.

* He has got excellent drive in it I dont believe that he would want to have the portfolio of **Immigration**.

* You couldn't have one man doing both those jobs - **Immigration** and Interior.

* On the question of **Immigration**, while I might have differences here with him, I do have differences here with him - 
I interpolate to say that I was referring to the St Clair Allen case -  the fact is he is better informed than anybody in the Parliament at the moment on the actual present practice and statistics of **Immigration**.

* If you look at Hansard  you  will see that he is on top of the job of **Immigration** as it is done at the moment You can't fault him.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The cost of members' fares to and from meetings of the **Immigration** Advisory Council are paid directly to the carriers by the Department of **Immigration**.

* No later statistics are available than those supplied by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in answer to the honourable member's question No.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
This debate began last night, but the normal rules of the House interrupted it.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  began his speech by suggesting that the measure he was introducing was a simple one, a technical machinery measure.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** himself is on record as having said that he is not in favour of 35-hour arrangements if all they mean is an increase in the number of hours worked at the overtime rate.

* Mr Samuel  is notorious for the campaign of denigration that he has been waging against the Department of Labor and **Immigration** for the last several months, if not for the last couple of years.

* But  Mr Samuel  is not prepared to allow lies to stand in the way of publishing something which he feels will have a denigrating effect upon the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* It is being exacerbated by the deflationary economic policies of this Government and its failure to implement adequate retraining, manpower and **immigration** policies.

* Many fine local amenities were created under that scheme which was introduced by the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* As a result the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs attempts to fill the vacancies with imported labour while those migrants already in this country wait in vain for reunion with close relatives whose applications for migration have been knocked back by the Department.

* I warn the Minister for **Immigration** and some honourable members on my left will be going out too, if they do not keep a bit of order.

* The Opposition will be supporting one part of what the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  had to say, namely concerning the Bahamas.

* We understand that they have contributed much and will contribute much more to the future development of Australia if the **immigration** program is not continually diminished in size as it appears the Government would want to do.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Later he served as an **immigration** officer.

* I have taken the trouble to find out from the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is also concerned about this matter, what is to happen.

* I have had some discussions with the Minister for **Immigration** about the following statement in the Budget: 
The level of unemployment in Tasmania is higher than the Australian average.

* I listened to the answer given by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to the question asked by the honourable member for Denison.

* I think that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was not only exercising his responsiblity, but he was exercising it well.

* When the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  authorises a cost benefit analysis of **immigration** as it affects the economy the facts arising from that investigation are not available to me.

* It has shown the need, in the context of inflation, for fuller study of our tariff system, our **immigration** programme, our powers in respect of restrictive trade practices and of our taxation structure.

* Before discussing **immigration** policies, I would first like to address myself to the findings of the first report of the National Population Inquiry.

* The Population Inquiry highlights some quite startling facts which I believe must provide the basis for future government planning, not only in **immigration** but in almost all areas of government policy.

* If this is the case, one should think very carefully before accepting the necessity for high **immigration** rates.

* Of course, this has strong implications for future **immigration** programs.

* As a result and in the absence of any **immigration** program a continued decline in fertility rates in my opinion will lead us not only to zero population growth but even further to negative rates of population growth in the future.

* In these circumstances, Australia's governments in future will have to look increasingly to **immigration** programs to maintain reasonable rates of population growth.

* I agree wholeheartedly with the comment by the honourable member for Lilley that **immigration** should be seen as a very valuable addition to the Australian population but not as a substitute for it.

* Given that any initiatives to redress that imbalance would take a long while to implement, quite clearly there will be a case for a much higher **immigration** intake in the years to come.

* Therefore, in view of the predicted decline in the rate of natural growth to Australia's population, on balance I support the view that higher **immigration** rates are required for the future.

* First, we need to consider such an **immigration** program in terms of Australia's economic structure.

* If the **immigration** intake is undertaken together with some restructuring of domestic industries in order to allow the laws of comparative advantage to take effect, such a program is well justified and is in the best interests of both Australia and our trading partners in the region.

* The second qualification I have relates to the rate of increase in the **immigration** intake.

* **Immigration** levels should be sufficiently flexible to take account of Australia's short term domestic economic problems, our manpower needs and our changing capacity to absorb immigrants after giving full examination to the social consequences of large, constant intakes.

* But having made those qualifications, on balance and for the reasons I have already stated, I would support the need for a substantial **immigration** program for Australia for the foreseeable future.

* One of the main functions of Australia 's **immigration** program in the past has been to increase the labour force.

* Also, in the absence of **immigration**, coupled with declining fertility rates, Australia will become an ageing nation and it is suggested that within, say, one generation the total proportion of the population dependent on those of working age will increase.

* Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the need for Australia to increase its rate of **immigration** over the longer term primarily because we had a humanitarian obligation to the poorer nations to develop our richly endowed country for their benefit and also for our longer term benefit.

* Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our **immigration** program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families.

* In concluding my remarks I congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  for the way in which he has handled his portfolio in the past.

* It was not lost over unionism or demarcation issues, as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  are so fond of saying.

* I shall put this in terms which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** might understand.

* Neither the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, nor the Prime Minister, nor any other Minister is prepared to tackle the Builders Labourers Federation or John Halfpenny of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union.

* The last passenger completed **immigration** formalities at 1 1.45 a.m.

* The average time per passenger for completion of **Immigration**, Quarantine and some Customs formalities was 1.3 minutes but with such a peak of arrivals delay for some was inevitable.

* **Immigration** requirements are kept under surveillance with a view to improvements consistent with control responsibilities but it would be uneconomic to staff the control points on the basis of handling the heaviest loads without any delay.

* The department aims at an **Immigration** clearance time of 45 seconds per passenger at Tullamarine and Mascot.

* If they do not seek registration they can, after 5 years here, simply notify the Department of **Immigration** that they want to be citizens; and they thereupon become citizens.

* It is just 25 years since the first Australian Minister for **Immigration**, now the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, introduced into this House, with great and justifiable pride, a Bill which for the first time created in law the status of Australian citizen.

* That is what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in the course of his address this morning 
I rise also to support the **Immigration** (Education) Bill 1973.

* In 1971 the previous Liberal-Country Party Government introduced the **Immigration** (Education) Act.

* But I draw to the attention of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  the fact that in many of the schools where these demountable buildings will be provided there is already a large number of demountable or temporary buildings.

* The Department of **Immigration** maintains essential statistics of persons admitted with resident status, granted resident status after entry for temporary residence, and granted Australian citizenship by naturalisation or regisitration.

* The following answers are based on statistics maintained by the Department of **Immigration** and exclude persons born in Australia.

* The Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  has suggested today that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had sufficient guts to talk about Jewish **immigration** with the Russians.

* In his wonderful achievements in the external fields, why was it that in one country alone on his visit- I refer to Holland- he was prepared to accept in his discussions on **immigration** that there should be a preparedness by the Australian Government to consider an increase in migrants?

* Why did not the Prime Minister visit the Middle East, another area about which there is tremendous concern in Australia and a source of a good deal of **immigration** to this country?

* Following the statement of 23 September 1976 concerning the Government's review of **immigration** policy relating to persons normally resident in Lebanon, all members of the family are now eligible for migrant entry subject to their completion of normal health and character requirements.

* Did he indicate on 30 January 1973 that there can be staff savings in the Department of **Immigration** to ease the growth in the Public Service.

* His  wife is the daughter of a late Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales who was also the Vice-Chairman of the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will act as Minister for Foreign Affairs until the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  returns from overseas.

* At a time when the British Government is revising its **immigration** rules the British migrant to Australia expects a clear and definite revision of Australian citizenship.

* Surely this is an indication of the needs of modern **immigration**, as individuals desire to become a part of another country within the framework of its laws and constitutions.

* I would like to congratulate the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  on the Bill which he has introduced into the House.

* The unions have never in the past been able to take their proper place in society, but under this Government and as a result of actions taken by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** the unions will certainly get the recognition to which they are entitled in this society.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
This morning during question time we saw another example of the Opposition's refusal to have a bar of the voluntary benefits organisations.

* I would remind the House, as the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who is sitting at the table did this morning, of the comments of the Nimmo Committee in relation to this matter.

* The Committee rightly recognises the work that was done by the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, in establishing the trade union training college.

* But  Mr Clyde  Cameron was the first Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that this country has had who was prepared to take the practical step of setting up the trade union training college.

* But the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, took an important step when he set up the trade union training college.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
by leaveOnly a handful of issues has, in the last few months, attracted more persistent speculation than the prospect of a revised **immigration** policy.

* The question of **immigration** is rarely argued in detached terms.

* The issue of Indo-Chinese refugees has brought all Australians face to face with the reality that no longer are we insulated and isolated from **immigration** questions of immense significance.

* **Immigration** ought to be above partisan political polemics, and largely it has been.

* The issue between us has never been the fact of **immigration** but the quantum and nature of intake.

* Since 1974 **immigration** policies have been very tightly defined.

* While there has been a shortage of hard data on which to reach firm conclusions regarding the economic effects of population growth and **immigration**, many have seen a link between post-war economic development and large-scale **immigration**.

* It was against this background that, in 1976, the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council prepared a Green Paper on '**Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population'.

* The issues were discussed at conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs over the past year.

* There is a remarkable degree of unanimity among the States on the importance of a continued positive approach to population building through **immigration**, and on related policy measures.

* There has never been, in Australia, so comprehensive a review of **immigration**.

* Though the Government must give priority to resolving the prevailing economic difficulties facing Australia, it believes that population and **immigration** policies lay the foundations for tomorrow.

* These centres are subsidised out of the Migrant Hostel subsidy paid to Hostels Ltd by the Department of **Immigration**.

* Surely honourable gentlemen opposite have seen **immigration** forms from various countries around the world when they have travelled, as many of them have done and do extensively, where the first name is described as the given name.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs upon notice: 
Figures are not available for the cost of providing these services in each urban area of Australia.

* Population increases in the urban areas also result from natural increase, and from the movement of native-born persons to urban areas as well as from **immigration**.

* Most financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth is designed, inter alia, to help State Governments cope with the increasing demand for State services occasioned by the growth in population whether from **immigration** or natural increase.

* by leave- I should like to elaborate on three matters mentioned in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  concerning matters within the **immigration** and ethnic affairs portfolio.

* In my statement of 7 June 1978 to the House on **immigration** policy, I indicated that while other temporary residents would no longer be eligible for permanent resident status while in Australia, private overseas students would continue to be eligible for permanent residence pending the review of the private overseas student policy.

* Most courses are provided by State education services under arrangements with the Commonwealth Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The interesting thing is that as a result of the procedures which were then in force and which are now in force in the Department of **Immigration**, some 7,000 to 8,000 people were regularised by being encouraged to apply properly and return or by having their status regularised here.

* It is my intention to address my remarks to the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Yet we have a program under which we intend to increase **immigration** this year to 70 000 people.

* That is the policy of the present Government yet it talks about increasing **immigration**.

* The situation is that during the 23 years from 1949 the **immigration** intake continued at a rate around 2 per cent.

* The average growth rate for those 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party Government was something like 1.1 per cent in natural population and 0.8 per cent in **immigration** population.

* The fact is that under the conservative forces of this country, between 1949 and 1972, 70 per cent of the **immigration** increase in the population of this country settled in the cities and urban communities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* That proposition is still put forward by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is at the table.

* He not only supports a proposition for an increased **immigration** program but also he supports a program of increased natural birth.

* By making a rational decision in relation to our **immigration** program we would then be able to look at a population of something like 17.5 million by the year 2000.

* **Immigration** to this country should be allowed on the basis of family reunions and from such countries as Lebanon and Chile.

* Health, **Immigration** and Customs procedures covering passengers arriving at the new international terminal are not causing confusion.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
They had an important advocate for their cause right inside the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
-The Minister for **Immigration** will remember that at the first question time of this Parliament he encouraged all illegal immigrants who were covered by his amnesty offer to come forward.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
My question is also addressed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It is well known that the control of ethnic radio has been the subject of an empire building feud between the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications.

* It is widely known that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs met the  Chairman  of the ABC and other senior ABC executives in mid-October when the Minister's gentle overtures were deftly and subtly rebuffed by  Sir Henry,  particularly on the matter of the appointment of a national ethnic broadcasting council to advise the ABC.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is probably not the appropriate authority as it is presently constituted.

* The Department is almost exclusively a Department of **Immigration** and has little to do with ethnic affairs as such.

* While a number of Ministers have an interest in aspects of population policy, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has formal responsibility in this matter.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
1) Is it a fact that people with epilepsy, regardless of the degree of incapacity, are considered unable to meet health requirements for **immigration** to Australia.

* If so, when was the last time this condition was assessed for the purpose of **immigration** health requirements.

* If this condition has not been assessed within the last 2 years for the purpose of **immigration** health requirements, will he consider reviewing the matter in view of the availability of modern drugs to control the effects of this condition.

* It was not referred to in the second reading speech made on behalf of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  by the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  but it gives a power to the  President  of the Commission to assign a commissioner to act as the Tribunal.

* However, we would like to hear from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** just what the proposal means.

* But I do not intend to go over the old ground which was mentioned briefly in the second reading speech given on behalf of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and, I think, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** have on numerous occasions said that excessive wage claims are the main cause of inflation and unemployment in this country.

* But I must admit that my confidence in the Government's intentions was shaken at question time today when the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** indicated that if the wage indexation submission was not accepted by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, he saw little cause to intervene in the metal trades case which will be considered subsequent to that decision.

* There was the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  who shortly afterwards became the  Deputy  Prime Minister; the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**- I am not too sure where he is now- who at that stage also made certain remarks, and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren).

* Towards the end of1977, I was contacted by a  Mr Belford  of the Department of **Immigration** in Melbourne, with a view to determining whether or not I would be prepared to have my husband return to myself and our family upon his release.

* I was also told that there was a letter from the **Immigration** Department saying that a deportation order was pending.

* I affirm the statement that I made to my Federal Member of Parliament and which he repeated in Parliament, namely: I have never had an official letter or communication from the Department of **Immigration** concerning my husband's deportation.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Can he say whether the Rev.

* Father Nicholas Mcsweeney, Director of Catholic **Immigration**, has claimed that he has helped hundreds of Eurasians from Burma and India to come to Australia.

* If there Is to be any reduction in our **immigration** intake, will he see that British, Irish and European people will be given precedence over people whose presence endangers, and will continue to endanger, the social, wage and housing conditions of Australians, whether bom here or naturalised.

* Will he urge the Catholic **immigration** authorities in every State and the World Council of Churches to concentrate their efforts on helping Australian Aborigines and part-Aborigines on the principle that charity begins at home.

* I trust, too, that the Government will consider at an early date the reintroduction of an **immigration** program somewhat similar to that of a few years ago.

* I am glad to see the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs at the table.

* It has always been my belief that in the short term **immigration** may interfere with employment opportunities.

* But in the long term **immigration** creates employment.

* To achieve this end we must increase the level of **immigration** on a gradual basis.

* The passport issued to Lieutenant-Colonel William Knox an 6 December 1967 was issued by the Australian Embassy in Pretoria after seeking confirmation from the Department of **Immigration** on 21 November 1967 that the applicant had not ceased to be an Australian citizen.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
 Mr Speaker,  it is true that we suspended for some months what were known as employer nominations because we wanted to review the precise conditions under which people would be invited to come to Australia to work for specific firms.

* At the **Immigration** Planning Council I took the view that it would be desirable for these major corporations to put together their views, to indicate the sort of people that they wanted, where they thought these people would be available, where they thought these people should come from or should be available and the sorts of conditions that they were offering not only in terms of wages but also in terms of their accommodation.

* I am still awaiting from the **Immigration** Planning Council the details of the general picture from the spread of corporations.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Working Party established to examine the question of the distribution of certain functions previously carried out by the former Department of **Immigration** that a Standing Interdepartmental Committee should be established to ensure a continued, co-ordinated and integrated approach to all matters relating to **immigration** and the welfare of migrants.

* The Committee is to comprise senior representatives of the Departments of Labor and **Immigration**, Social Security, Foreign Affairs, Education, Customs and Excise, Media, Housing and Construction and Prime Minister and Cabinet and will be chaired by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* **Immigration** to Australia has also declined dramatically.

* According to the first report of the National Population Inquiry- page 302- if fertility stabilises at around 1975-76 at net reproduction rate = 1 the population to be expected by the end of the year 2001 would be 15.9 million in the absence of **immigration** and 17.6 million if net **immigration** averaged 50 000 a year.

* Secondly, net **immigration** is currently running at well below 50 000 a year.

* It was in the context of the need for long range perspectives on population and **immigration** that the Liberal-Country Party Government, on the strong recommendation of the then Minister for **Immigration**, the  Hon.

* In so far as Australia has had a population policy in the post-war period it has been in terms of **immigration** rather than policies designed specifically to increase births to achieve desirable population policy goals.

* There are people who suggest that Australians should be encouraged to have more children as a substitute for **immigration**.

* Therefore, external **immigration** will continue to be the only major instrument available to government to influence the level and composition of our population.

* The second is that the rate of population growth in most of our traditional source countries for **immigration** is decreasing and, if current trends continue, will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century.

* What population goals should **immigration** be directed towards in the medium and long term?

* A precedent is the 2 per cent population growth rate policy following the Second World War and the introduction of annual **immigration** programs.

* The agreed policy was that Australia's population should increase by an average of 2 per cent per annum, approximately 1 per cent resulting from natural increase and the balance from **immigration**.

* One only has to consider that since 194S some 3.3 million migrants have come to Australia and that one person in five in this country is a migrant to appreciate the impact of post-war **immigration**.

* It is almost universally agreed that the **immigration** program has been of enormous benefit to Australia.

* We are a larger and more diverse nation than the one which set out on the large-scale post-war **immigration** program.

* There are groups who see our standard of living rising by upgrading the skills of our work force and developing our natural resources without the assistance of further **immigration** or even population growth.

* If the community sees some cause for concern in an ageing population, it may even be desirable to direct **immigration** in such a way as deliberately to have a 'younging' effect on the populationfor example by lowering the general age eligibility limits or by giving preference to younger applicants.

* Our example, and even massive **immigration** from them, will not have any significant effect on the scale of their problems.

* For its part, the Government maintains its position as stated in its election policy statement on **immigration** and ethnic affairs: 
**Immigration** is an essential instrument of Australia's population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed.

* That is a commitment to population growth, with **immigration** as the prime factor in that growth.

* But- and I emphasise this- it is not a commitment to **immigration** simply to add to our population without any assessment of the effects of doing so and what is needed to meet those effects.

* The Government believes that Australia's population and **immigration** strategies must not be a numbers game but must have a sound basis which takes account of the medium and longer term implications of various growth options.

* In my capacity as Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs with responsibility for matters of population policy, I now announce initiatives which will assist the development of future population policy.

* In addition, I have reconstituted the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council which was originally established in February 1975.

* The reconstituted Council will advise me on such matters as regular monitoring of, and research into, population change; major developments and research in Australia and overseas concerning population and **immigration**; the longer term implications of changing patterns of **immigration** intakes; ways in which future **immigration** intakes can be planned to complement other policies; and implications of population change for various aspects of resource allocation.

* The functions of the new Council indicate the importance which the Government attaches to population policies and show its determination to base **immigration** policies and programs on a range of considerations, inclusing the population objectives to be developed with the assistance of the Council.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Despite the current horrific rates of unemployment for all Australians, particularly migrants, the Government goes on blindly insisting that the rate of **immigration** should be substantially increased.

* The major rationale is that Australia's work force lacks skilled personnel in particular areas and that these bottlenecks prevent employment of more skilled workers, but the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  produces no facts to prove his case.

* Any increase in **immigration** does nothing to change the current situation and may indeed exacerbate it.

* While the Government insists on a large scale **immigration** program to meet the needs of industry, it does little to alleviate the continuing problems of migrants after their arrival in Australia.

* Yet it is at such a crucial time that the Government decides to transfer migrant services to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* In other words, despite the increasing clamour from various migrant welfare organisations for more funds, for reasons best known to itself the Government has inhibited the Department of Social Security- now it is the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs- from distributing the funds theoretically available for grantsinaid.

* The Government has shown little concern for the high rate of return home to their countries of origin among migrants, particularly the professional and skilled- those groups which supposedly justify further increases in the rate of **immigration**.

* Is it not time we stopped using people as factory fodder, as tools of economic management, and developed a policy for migrants, not just an **immigration** policy.

* One Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers for **Immigration** has taken place since 7th May 1971.

* Vance Dickie, M.L.C., Minister for **Immigration**, 
Western Australia- The  Hon.

* H. D. Evans, M.L.A., Minister for Lands, Agriculture and **Immigration**, 
Tasmania- The  Hon.

* D. F. Clark, M.H.A., Minister for Housing (representing the Minister for **Immigration**, The  Hon.

* To ask the Committee of the **Immigration** Advisory Council now undertaking an Inquiry into the Departure Movement of Migrants to differentiate between assisted and unassisted migrantsin determining the size of this movement 
To continue to tailor the size and content of the **immigration** programme to Australia's needs and the nation's ability to absorb migrants.

* The honourable member has asked whether we can do something about recording the history of **immigration** properly in an authoritative volume.

* I am pleased to say that within the Department of **Immigration**, thoughts that have been nurtured for some time have come to fruition in the History Section, which is at present engaged in gathering material together.

* I am at present considering a submission that would enable the commissioning of a history of **immigration**.

* A list of 47 academics, authors and writers has been compiled and I hope that from that list a selection can be made to commission a history of **immigration** and the Australian people.

* Firstly, I would like to refer to the statement by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is referring only to unemployment figures which exclude school leavers.

* Mr CLYDE CAMERON (HindmarshMinister for Labor and **Immigration**)-  Mr Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation.

* Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar)- With your indulgence,  Mr Speaker,  I wish to say that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said rather slightingly that there had been, I think, 1 1 widow trainees.

* I assume that the honourable gentleman is referring to part of the Opposition's **immigration** platform as adopted at the Launceston conference.

* It will be clear to this House, as in fact I believe it is clear to the Australian people, that there is no consistent, coherent voice on the Opposition benches in relation to its approach to Australia's **immigration** policy.

* In discussing the estimates for the Department of **Immigration**, owing to the lateness of the hour I will not mention many of the figures which I intended to mention.

* I will refer to the approach to **immigration** of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party.

* Speaking in Perth last weekend, he attacked the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  who was not in Australia.

* He complained that there had not been a full scale debate on **immigration** policy for the last  5i  years.

* (Mr Daly)  it could be said that we did have a bipartisan **immigration** policy.

* While stating that its **immigration** policy shall be administered with the avoidance of discrimination on any ground of race, or colour or nationality, the same Labor Party Conference adopted a policy to advise Australian mothers to limit their families.

* Surely it is better to retain control of **immigration** as this Government has done, to be able to draw back the numbers of migrants rather than to be confronted with a flood of people over which there can be no control concerning race, colour of skin or nationality.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration**  (Senator Cotton)  has said that there have been applications for 50,000 Indians to enter Australia.

* Many thousands of migrants already are living happily in Australia and the **immigration** policy of the .

* Australia clearly enunciated its goal to achieve through **immigration** an annual population growth of 1 per cent to supplement natural increase which was also expected to be about 1 per cent.

* Having established the goal, it set out to achieve it through a vigorously promoted, but selective, **immigration** program.

* This is not to say that Australia's **immigration** programs during the past 3 decades have not been accompanied by problems.

* Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an **immigration** gain, Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of **immigration**.

* Over recent years, we have also seen a rapid rundown in the rate of population growth through **immigration**.

* This represents a growth rate for the financial year of less than 0.15 per cent through **immigration**.

* In considering the **immigration** options open to Australia, we must bear in mind that Australians themselves are a mobile people.

* If we are to avoid regular losses of such needed skills, it is imperative that Australia should maintain some level of **immigration** which is selective in regard to occupational skills.

* This component of our **immigration** program would also appear indispensable unless its underlying humanitarian objectives are to be jettisoned.

* This element also, I believe, should be a necessary part of any **immigration** policy and I hope to announce soon the policy guidelines within which Australia's future responses to such situations will be made.

* As the Green Paper indicates, issues underlying **immigration** cover a diverse range of topics.

* In terms of an annual **immigration** program, the Green Paper suggests that feasible limits might be net gain in the range of zero to 100 000 persons per year.

* High tribute is due to the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council which has prepared this Green Paper.

* I should like to pay particular tribute to the part played by the late J. F. Rich who died 2 days after the Green Paper was adopted by the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council.

* It is now 30 years since the great post-war **immigration** program was begun.

* That **immigration** program was introduced by a consensus of people of vision, people confident about the future of Australia, a growing Australia.

* It dealt in general terms with trade, commercial and **immigration** matters.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Prime Minister has made one too many speeches outside the Parliament and has allowed the Minister for **Immigration** to mislead the House or unwittingly show that he does not know what the situation is all about.

* We should demand that the Minister for **Immigration** give a categorical guarantee that there will not be amending legislation within a week to increase this tax, as some Government supporters want, to a punitive level of 12c per lb which is basically, as I understand it, the kind of tax recommended by Government members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices - a tax that would bring in something like $160m to $170m a year additional revenue to the Government and which, at the same time, they would hope would force down the price of meat and keep it off the export market.

* I call the Minister for **Immigration** representing the Minister for Primary Industry.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** whether South Africa has imposed new entry requirements affecting Australians.

* I would like to make it very clear that the Opposition has supported the Bill before the House but 1 think for the record and in fairness to all concerned I have to reply to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who was very critical of the former Liberal-Country Party Government for, as he wants to convey it, having allowed the wool market to fall to such an extent that wool sold at 30c or 37c per lb.

* I am sure that the Minister for **Immigration**, who is sitting at the table, would not want to take the blame for the current fall in wool prices.

* Mr GRASSBY (Riverina- Minister for **Immigration**) - I wish to make a personal explanation.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
-As a result of my raising the facts in Parliament on 2 June 1 977 the facts relating to other cases have come forward.

* I am informed by reliable sources in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs that this solicitor has extracted similar amounts of money from more than 600 unfortunate people who are seeking to become residents of Australia and has done absolutely nothing for any of them.

* He gave  Mr Khoury  $250 cash on 18 March 1977 - 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Where and when have there been meetings of the **Immigration** Ministers since 4th December 1972.

* When will the next meeting of the **Immigration** Ministers take place.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  at the second reading stage, in response to a query I put to him, indicated that the assistance which will be extended under this Bill will also be extended to independent schools.

* To this end: It has ratified the Convention on the Status of Refugees; it is a member of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and contributes to the resettlement funds of the UNHCR; it recognises the need through its **immigration** policy to fulfil the legal obligations required by the Convention and to develop special humanitarian programs for the resettlement of the displaced and/or the persecuted.

* The Government will consider proposals from the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for designating refugee situations and appropriate responses to them.

* A standing inter-departmental committee on refugees comprising a senior officer of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs as chairman, and senior officers of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Employment and Industrial Relations, Social Security, Finance, Health and Education with other departments and the Public Service Board to be co-opted as necessary, will be established.

* This Committee will advise the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on the capacity for accepting refugees; consult annually, and otherwise as necessary, with voluntary agencies regarding the numbers they would accept for resettlement; recommend co-ordination for arrival and immediate resettlement; and regularly review the intake of refugees against the capacity of resources in this country to ensure successful resettlement.

* Provided satisfactory sponsorship is available, a small number of such refugees could be accepted on a case by case basis by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The Refugee Unit of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will be strengthened.

* I teel heartwarmed by the concluding remarks of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch).

* Will the Minister for **Immigration** investigate the delays of up to 12 months which occur in the issuing of tourist visas?

* Yes, by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly).

* Earlier today the Leader of the House and the Minister for **Immigration** claimed that the Government had been refused leave to make a statement on **immigration**.

* Pages 1979 and onwards of Hansard of October last year indicate that the Minister for **Immigration** sought leave to make a short statement, but to have incorporated in Hansard - a quite unusual procedure - the body of his statement.

* This present 
I think I have made the point that I wanted to, and that is that the Leader of the House and the Minister for **Immigration** had indicated that there was an opportunity for a debate in the last session of Parliament.

* There was not, and the words of the Leader of the House as reported in Hansard confirm that no opportunity was provided for a debate on **immigration** and on **immigration** alone.

* I repeat the challenge to the Government: Any time it wants to debate **immigration** it will be debated.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
Perhaps I should explain the reasons for the amendment.

* Earlier I did not go into an exposition as to why we have moved it but, as the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has raised the matter, I had better explain the reasons for the amendment in more detail.

* In line with normal practice the Department of **Immigration** issued instructions to withhold the booklet until it was replaced with a new edition.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 

 - Mr Deputy Chairman, I return to the clause before the Committee.

* This clause highlights the position which I put to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  previously in relation to my doubts about the legislation.

* Honourable members will know that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  in a Press release on 1 1 September, announced the details of the scheme.

* On 17 October we first had the allegation of political patronage in a question from the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  who said, inter alia: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** replied, inter alia: 
I mention in passing that when I went to the office of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  I was treated extremely courteously not only by the Minister but also by officers of his Department who were available to talk to aU honourable members.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
I shall be brief as I understand that the debate is to conclude at 25 minutes to 5.

* In that year Arthur Calwell, who was then the Minister for **Immigration**, announced the establishment of a concerted **immigration** policy on the basis that increased population was essential to the growth and full development of the Australian economy in the post-war period.

* One of the fundamental principles underlying the continuance of the **immigration** program was the great economic and social benefit that flowed as a result of it.

* The first point is the failure of the Government to inform the House adequately of changes in **immigration** policy.

* In my political career, no Minister has used more words, made more Press statements, had more publicity - I do not blame the Press for this because we know he is a very colourful character - confused more people, indeed divided more people and changed the policy more frequently than the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* I would suggest to the Minister for **Immigration** that maybe he would not be in this position today if he had a Press secretary.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  said last night: 'If she's still as nice as she was when we deported her when she was five, I'll be delighted to welcome her back.'

* Perhaps the Minister for **Immigration** and some of his colleagues can answer some of the questions which these headlines raise.

* The 'Australian Financial Review' of 20 February 1974 had this headline '"Social" **immigration** for a balanced Australian society'.

* A headline in the National Times' of 20 August 1973 reads: If White Australia is dead **Immigration** isn't saying'.

* But the Minister for **Immigration** has plenty to say.

* The article beneath the headline states: 
American Negroes would be allowed to migrate to Australia under new plans drawn up by - the Federal **Immigration** Department.

* But it is ALP policy to have a non-discriminatory **immigration** scheme.

* I think earlier this afternoon the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  in his remarks referred to the Minister for Services and Property because he had a very definite policy on **immigration**.

* I pay a tribute to the first Minister for **Immigration**, the late Arthur Calwell.

* As I said in this House 2 weeks ago, he would be classified as one of the most successful Ministers for **Immigration**, whereas the opposite applies to the present Minister for **Immigration**.

* In conclusion, I say to the Minister for **Immigration**: On these issues the best way to fight fire is to prevent it.

* I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take the appropriate steps that would enable him and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to be aware of the potential need for a refugee policy and ask them to meet delegations of members of the relevant associations in Australia and delegations of members of the relevant Lebanese Press and assure them of the Australian Government's policy so that it may be disseminated to residents in Australia.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 9 March 1 977: 
I have allocated a high priority to the role of **immigration** in regional development 
At the Conference of Federal and State Ministers for **Immigration** on 9 November, general agreement was reached on the need to meet the special labour requirements of development areas.

* The Department of **Immigration** has set up the necessary administrative machinery to obtain detailed information from Federal and State planning authorities and to develop proposals for future migrant programs in the regions.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in his second reading speech stated: 
I am immensely relieved to find that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is not to be consigned to Colombia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
A couple of days ago the honourable members for Calare  (Mr England)  referred to the initiatives of the Government but he had to preface this by referring to the approaching Parramatta by-election.

* He accused the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson),  the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  and me of having abandoned our electors.

* 51 **immigration** officers visited premises occupied by the Children of God on 29 November 1 976.

* The visits were carried out as a routine **immigration** activity by officers in the normal course of their duties and no separate costing is therefore available.

* 141 persons were spoken to, of whom approximately 70 were interviewed to a greater or lesser extent concerning their **immigration** status.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked  the  Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has his attention been drawn to the declaration, signed by Professor E. G. Saint who was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Queensland, which appeared in the West Australian' on 20th November 1963, in support of a claim that Australia's **immigration** policy needed reappraisal so that our restrictiveness should balance a regard for our national interests with some concern for the susceptibilities of our coloured neighbours; if so, why was Professor Saint appointed a member of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications in March 1969. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice: 
I am pleased that the Government has concentrated its endeavours on sultanas.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, to make sure that before another Bill of this nature is produced for Parliament to scrutinise copies of the legislation, or at least information on its general thrust, will be available to the industry more readily than as happened with this piece of legislation.

* There are many aspects of **immigration** now which are of very great concern to people who have migrated here and who want to bring friends and relatives here; there are many aspects which are of vary great concern to those areas of Australia where municipal and other institutions have exceptional burdens because of the **immigration** programme.

* That the following words be added to the motion: and also to permit the Minister for **Immigration** to make a statement on the Government's policy on **immigration**.

* The only reaction I got on that day on which I spoke when I pointed out the position of these people- I spoke of how misunderstood they are, the extent of their handicap, how people showed them no patience, no understanding, because of their deafness- was for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to sit on the front bench aping deafness and actually performing a comic opera which disgusted me.

* Will the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and .**Immigration** give a categorical commitment that all applications approved under the Regional Employment Development scheme will be funded by the Government?

* I ask this question in the knowledge that many municipalities and organisations have outlaid resources and finance after receiving official acceptance of their applications from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and.

* I was disappointed that there was no reference in the Governor-General's Speech to an increase in **immigration**.

* The Whitlam Government cut **immigration** to 30,000 people per year when it became apparent that unemployment in Australia was approaching 5 per cent of the work force.

* When departures from Australia were taken into account, this reduced **immigration** figure resulted in a net loss to Australia of between 5,000 and 8,000 people per annum.

* The report read: 'Unemployment could be cut by stepping up **immigration** rather than cutting it back',  Mr Ian  Spicer said yesterday.

* In Canberra yesterday, the **Immigration** Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  said that any cuts in migrant intake would retard economic recovery.

* When it came into office in 1975 the Government increased **immigration** from the 30,000 of the Whitlam Government to 70,000.

* I believe that **immigration** must be stepped up in the not too distant future.

* I am sure that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  will be able to deal with such a racist speech when he rises during the course of this debate.

* From the previous Minister for **Immigration** we heard this evening adequate reason for us to say with every certainty that the Australian **immigration** program was in a shambles because of the attitude of the previous Government.

* It is easy to appreciate the massive task that the present Minister had to face on assuming his portfolio in setting out to lift the standard of our **immigration** policy in the eyes of the rest of the world.

* As a last resort the Government, through the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  is buying its way out of trouble by paying the employees retrenchment money- full pay for 6 months, and I understand that the employees are having difficulty in getting that too.

* I wish to raise a matter in the House tonight and I have to inform the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  of the matter so he can listen in his room and take appropriate action.

* The **Immigration** Department asked us to find Kadya a position to come to, but unfortunately we have been unsuccessful in obtaining a job for her and the situation has become quite impossible for my family in Lebanon.

* In a letter dated 6 September, 197S to the Regional Director, Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Sydney,  Mr Malla  sought a review of both decisions.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Processing or work on behalf of Departments of the Capital Territory and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and some limited work for severalother departments.

* Register of arrivals and departures for Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The Departments of the Capital Territory and **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs have access to their own records and once again this is restricted to authorised personnel.

* I note also that an advertisement has been placed by the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** in a newspaper called the  Middle East News,  in which he makes some assertions about the number of Lebanese in Australia.

* In 2 countries, Belgium and the Netherlands, the **immigration** authorities conduct a limited programme with technical assistance from ICEM.

* In countries where ICEM is not operating the Department of **Immigration** is responsible for preembarkation language instruction.

* The special provisions in this Bill - I again emphasise the payment of salaries of these special teachers in addition to teaching aids and so on, is a very progressive step forward by the Department of **Immigration** and will be a big factor in enabling migrant children to settle more quickly into their new environment.

* 1 carried out a survey of a number of government and independent schools in my electorate and all welcomed these new proposals in the **Immigration** (Education) Bill 1970.

* It is quite obvious that there will be a shortage of skilled personnel in the coal mining industry in the next 18 months or so, and perhaps the Department of **Immigration** could have a look at this and get some skilled miners out from Great Britain.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1979: 
-I rise to speak in support of the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs which this year provide for an expenditure of $32,975,000 compared with an actual expenditure of $27,130,458 in the last financial year.

* Recently the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that following consultation with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations a revised list of occupations for persons eligible for migrant entry into Australia had been approved.

* If I could be critical of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, it is in the area in which relatives want to migrate to this country from England.

* I ask the Minister to see what can be done to speed up **immigration** to Australia in these cases.

* The other factors are the high levels of consumption generated by the high wages and salaries that are paid; the present rate of **immigration** which imposes further pressures and demands; the degree of protection accorded the secondary industries, protecting their costs of production from overseas competition and protecting the high levels of employment; and, another factor not often mentioned, the fixed exchange rate which is creating an unrealistic, insulated, high internal cost structure and inflation.

* The listening public of Australia would not believe that what we just heard was a Minister attempting to defend the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden);  rather would they think it was a speech written by someone else and read b&gt; the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* The bringing about of a permanent scheme of employment for waterside workers is not a matter in relation to which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  or his advisers, or anybody else, say to those who work on the waterfront: 'These are the conditions under which you will work'.

* I know that my colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, is very anxious that many of the difficulties that have arisen in the past between various unions, because of the multiplicity of them, should be resolved.

* When the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** brings forward further proposals later this year many of the difficulties that have arisen in the past and could arise in the future will be resolved, simply because we will no longer have the ludicrous situation of one union arguing against another union in relation to work to be done, which is commonly known as a demarcation dispute.

* The Minister for **Immigration** has the call.

* -I suggest that the Minister for **Immigration** might withdraw the last remark that he made about the honourable member for Lalor.

* A recognition of these fundamental truths has until recently bound the major parties in this Parliament together in a bipartisan approach to **immigration**.

* If is not we but our accusers in this motion - the Australian Labor Party 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Did the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** state on 1 7 September 1 972, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, that reports by the Defence Standards Laboratories relating to tests made on a wide range of consumer products should be published and made available to the Australian Consumers' Association.

* Then there was that incredible contretemps between the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Labor.

* The Minister for **Immigration** said: 'I will ask the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council if I can bring in 20,000 more migrants'.

* The Minister for **Immigration** has been a double failure.

* But the Minister for **Immigration** has gone over to Ireland and Italy.

* **Immigration**: Settlers from South Africa (Question No.

* 3696) 
ns asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
When the Department of **Immigration** was abolished by the then Government in June 1974 its various functions and records were transferred to a number of different departments.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 24 September 1979: 
Further to his amended answer to Question No.

* 4472  (Hansard,  25 September 1979, page 1530) concerning the necessity for the use of the English language in incoming passenger cards and outgoing passenger cards, is it a fact that the words 'The card must be completed in the English language' appear on the back of each card and that the instructions are printed in the English language alone which might give rise to an inference that no other language will be understood by **immigration** officials.

* While English is the official language in Australia and presumably is the official language in Great Britain, is he able to say whether the British **immigration** authorities do not regard it as necessary to say that it is compulsory for British **immigration** forms to be filled in in English.

* 4472, have **immigration** officials ever complained that passengers have in practice made their tasks difficult by the use of native scripts; if so, what were the native scripts in question and in what way would the answers to questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 12 on the exit form and questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 13 on the entry form differ if they were written in a language other than English.

* I direct my question to the immensely likeable and competent Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is the Minister aware that I learned first hand during my self paid for visit to the United States of America that his Department in that country had received 9,050 **immigration** inquiries during the month of January this year?

* - Mr Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to make a statement on a matter that has become of great personal interest to me in particular and one that is of great importance to the Australian public - that is the **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* But arising out of the meeting of that Committee I was designated to write a policy in support of the established **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party as we knew it at that time.

* On 10th May 1965 I received a letter from  Mr Wyndham,  the then Secretary, in which he said: 
To: All Members of the **Immigration** Committee 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren).

* That was the time of the initiation of our **immigration** programme.

* There was an earlier time when the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  said that the Government had proposed certain accommodations in relation to these clauses - that it had retreated a certain amount but that it would retreat no further.

* He knows very well that we have supported and had supported for a long while a bipartisan **immigration** policy.

* He also knows very well that he is one of the architects of a destruction of a bipartisan **immigration** policy which is certainly not supported by all members on the Government side of this House.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
A complete review of **Immigration** policies and practices, including the granting of assisted passages, is being undertaken.

* The review is being undertaken by the Department of **Immigration**.

* The purpose of the review is to give effect to the Labor Party's approach to **Immigration**, as set out in the Party's platform agreed to in 1971, and the announced objectives of the Government.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
Nevertheless, quite a number of undertakings have participated in a voluntary reporting scheme for many years, and have forwarded annual returns to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** for consolidation.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs whether he is aware of reports in the ethnic Press that the Government is to radically change its **immigration** policy to admit only those people who speak English.

* Instead it has returned to the past, particularly the last 2 Ministers for **Immigration** in the previous Government.

* How could any Minister responsible for **immigration** and citizenship go out to the million here now and the tens of thousands still coming and draft them off like so many sheep and cattle, saying: 'You go to the one year pen; you to the 3-year pen; you to the 5- year pen.

* The present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  when Minister for **Immigration**, introduced a citizenship Bill in 1969 which showed a progressive outlook for that time by recognising the growing importance of the status of an Australian citizen.

* A few days ago the 'Australian Financial Review' reported that Australia's main Public Service union had called for the Federal Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to be sacked.

* Unemployment is rising dramatically, and there is a greater muddle and mess in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** than there has ever been before.

* I am told that I cannot table documents in Committee but I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to allow the incorporation in Hansard of a circular of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** dated 26 August.

* Four different people at different levels in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** told me that the allowance was tax free and that instructions had been sent to every Commonwealth Employment Service officer saying that it was tax free.

* The man whom he repudiated as the Opposition's shadow Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has come into this Committee with the support of quite a number of his colleagues, led for the Opposition in this debate and moved the Opposition's amendment.

* There can be little doubt that Australia's post-war **immigration** policy, and its implementation, has been remarkably successful.

* At the same time, our whole way of life, our culture, and our economy have been enriched by the application of a selective **immigration** policy which has allowed and supported this massive inflow of people from all over the world.

* This is something which needs to be emphasised and repeated again and again, until people from all oyer the world will realise that Australia's **immigration** policy is not a racist one bat, like those of most other countries, is a selective one.

* There are 2 aspects of our **immigration** policy upon which I would like to comment.

* I know and appreciate the work being done by the research groups set up by the Government, which will appreciably assist the assessment of desirable levels of migrant intake, and a host of other factors concerned with **immigration**.

* But it is on the second aspect of our **immigration** policy which I mentioned that I would like to spend some time.

* **Immigration**, with its massive effects on the structure of our society, is a subject of the utmost concern to every person in Australia.

* As we all know, the Labor Party at its recent conference at Launceston came up with a different form of words for its Party platform in relation to **immigration**.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  who, as we all know was described by his own leader as knowing more about **immigration** than anyone else in the Labor Party - and hence is of insufficient capacity to be retained as shadow minister for **immigration** - said on 22nd July this year: 
From what I have read in the Press, the changed  vording  of the **immigration** policy does not  represent  any significant change from my interpretation  of  the policy before the conference.

* Firstly, family reunion has always been given the highest priority in Australia's **immigration** programme.

* very interested to know that the Party traditionally seen as representing their interests in fact had an **immigration** policy which could be interpreted as advocating, introduction of cheap labour.

* The Premier of South Australia has been most outspoken on the issue of non-European migration and has been quoted as saying that he advocated a system of Asian **immigration** to Australia similar to that operating in Canada, and also of putting the proposition that a homogenous Australia was nonsense and that he would like to see the country as a radical melting pot.

* Has this attitude to assisted **immigration** ever been repudiated by any member of the Opposition?

* On **immigration** as on so many other policy issues, the Labor Party speaks with many tongues.

* -Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister, in the course of his answer, mentioned that a question had been asked of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  last week.

* My question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** specifically did not mention the name.

* My question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** specifically did not mention the name or the country.

* I have written a letter to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** seeking further information.

* I mentioned in that letter that I would honour any restrictions the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would put on my reading the file.

* elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; 
As conceptualised by the Galbally report, the proposed Institute of Multicultural Affairs was welcomed by the Opposition in 1978 as a multipurpose resource centre serving the needs of a polyethnic society.

* As we saw it, the Institute would document the phenomenon of **immigration** to our country, trace and comment on the growth of ethnic communities, sponsor crosscultural awareness, help preserve the heritage of our ethno-cultural society, promote mutual tolerance and esteem between all groups and investigate cross-cultural experiences, lifestyles and needs.

* The Vernon Committee, way back in the past, had views about **immigration** but felt contrained to support the policy of the then Government.

* It was not allowed to make comments on **immigration** policy in relation to economic affairs, although I understand that in the substance of its report it stated that it was not able to conclude that **immigration** in fact gave rise to the economic benefits that were so loudly touted at the time.

* The Secretary to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs - 
Elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; 
-I bow to your ruling,  Sir.

* The Oposition is using this kind of procedural issue - we are getting familiar with it from day to day - to avoid the main and paramount issues of the day such as industrial relations, the **immigration** policy - (Quorum formed).

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
In the second reading debate a great deal of nonsense was spoken about some of the provisions of the Bill.

* The interjections of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  during the second reading debate were quite false and wrongly based.

* If the honourable member regards that as reprehensible he should say so to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* Borthwick,  Mr Badger,  University students, journalists, an interpreter from the **Immigration** Department, Members of Parliament, Amnesty International Office-bearers and representatives of many other groups and citizens alarmed at events.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  mentioned this afternoon that we were about third in the world in the giving of external aid.

* We look down the list at the Post Office, defence and **immigration**.

* On the other hand we have the question of the people of Papua and New Guinea and the question of our own **immigration** policy.

* A question arising from our **immigration** policy is how to confront the simple issues that arise in electorates.

* -Can the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** inform the House why he has so hurriedly deported recently to the United States a man named Utter?

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971-1973 I present the Annual Report on Migrant Education for the year ended 30 June 1 974.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** seen recent suggestions in the Press that some form of home visit insurance should be provided for migrants to cover them against the heavy cost of a return visit to their homelands in cases of emergency?

* The Australian Population and **Immigration** Council survey showed that 66 per cent of Greek migrants cited the English language as the biggest problem they faced; 55 per cent of Yugoslavs said that it was their biggest problem, whilst a recent survey of Italian migrants claimed that it worried them also.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: 
The fact is that the Seamen's Union gave $5,000 to the Labor Party's slush fund.

* We want to know whether the terms of reference of the Royal Commission will bring to light the reason that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has been so tardy in his action in handling this matter.

* Why the ACTU was elbowed to one side, the interplay of union rivalries and the dislike for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** are all matters which could be brought to the fore and we would be able to obtain a certain amount of information.

* The Minister for Transport is as culpable as the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* When he replies let us not have from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** one of those glib speeches in which he says nothing.

* asked the  Minister for  **Immigration**, upon  notice: 
Can he provide details of Commonwealth assistance to State, semi-government and local government authorities to compensate them for the burden imposed by the Commonwealth Government's **immigration** programme.

* The Australian Government closed our Embassy in Beirut on 28 March and on 1 April the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  issued a statement in which he made the point that Australian missions existed in Cairo, Athens, Nicosia, Ankara and Tel Aviv and that special arrangements were being made to post an **immigration** officer in Damascus.

* I can assure this House that beneath the comforting veneer of Press reports emanating from the Minister's office is a reality of serious and continuing bungling on the part of the Fraser Government, particularly the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Are we to continue to have the Treasury dictating the foreign- policy and **immigration** policy of this country?

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question arising from the clause in the migration agreement with Yugoslavia which provides that Yugoslav migrants will not be called up for military service in Australia if they are 20 years and 1 month or more at the time when they arrive in Australia.

* Whilst the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  gave us interesting but sometimes misleading information about **immigration**, he did not get very close to the Bill.

* But let me say to him at the outset that migrants in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an **immigration** programme had it not been initiated by this Party.

* I do not know about the association which the Minister for **Immigration** might have with the various migrant groups, but I receive very considerable correspondence from many of these organisations indicating their concern about many aspects of Australian life and their desire that those aspects might be improved.

* When I inquired by way of question placed on the parliamentary notice paper as to the reason, the Prime Minister said that neither he nor the department of **Immigration** had the address of the Federation of Netherlands Societies Ltd. Every honourable member on this side of the House, by virtue of the intensive contact he has had with that Federation and other migrant groups, would know not only the secretary's address but also the address of some members of the Federation.

* Report by the **Immigration** Advisory Council Committee on Social Patterns - 'The Departure of Settlers from Australia': Commenced May 1966; completed October 1967.

* Australia's **Immigration** Programme 1968-1973 (**Immigration** Planning Council): Commenced November 1966; completed June 1968.

* Report by the **Immigration** Advisory Council Committee on Migrant Youth - 'Migrant Youth in the Australian Community': Commenced March 1970; completed February 1971.

* Second Report by the **Immigration** Advisory Council Committee on Social Patterns - 'The Departure of Settlers from Australia': Commenced October 1971; to be completed July 1973.

* Cost Benefit Analysis- directed by Associate Professor J. R. Wilson of Sydney University and aimed at analysing the effect which **immigration** has on the Australian economy: Com- menced July 1970; to be completed by mid- 1974.

* This is a deal between **Immigration** and Foreign Affairs, probably worked out between  Senator Willesee,  who is desperate to get elected to the presidency of the United Nations, and  Mr Cameron  who is Minister for **Immigration**.

* May I deal very quickly with some of the pretentious nonsense often regurgitated by all sides in the **immigration** debate.

* Of course, the Broken Hill Company, General MotorsHolden's, the Ford Motor Company and others supported **immigration** on the basis of obtaining unskilled labour as well as consumers.

* I would also like to criticise more specifically some of the opponents of **immigration**.

* They are basically the same people who opposed **immigration** ever since it became fashionable to do so.

* I suppose that ever since large scale **immigration** started its opponents have argued that in periods of full employment the cost of basic services required for migrants- the so-called build-up of a social infrastructure- was so great as to use up our very limited resources.

* Such people in most cases are still opponents of the **immigration** and now argue the opposite, namely, that **immigration** will cause unemployment.

* I rise with pleasure to speak to the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Immediately it came to office it established a separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* In that respect the Government's record is first class and the record of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is excellent.

* We are not 2-faced about our policies, and I believe that the migrant community of Australia and all Australian citizens recognise the real concern that this Government and the Minister and my colleagues on this side of the Chamber have for the **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs portfolio.

* I compliment the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  for exposing the rather cavalier remarks of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  in his references to Australian citizens.

* I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon for bringing to the notice of the Australian people the shoddy tactics of the Minister in declaring in this chamber that he was basing his **immigration** policy on the result of a gallup poll.

* I suggest that the honourable member should debate the question which is before the Chair, that is, the amendment moved by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Be that as it may, one can only express amazement and astonishment that the Minister for **Immigration** has deleted words which are of great traditional significance.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 March 1979: 
Suddenly the New South Wales Supreme Court has insisted on his presenting a certificate of naturalisation or other certificate to show that he is a British subject.

* 1 checked with the Department of **Immigration** and found that his name was included on the application for naturalisation, but due to a clerical error he was not naturalised and is not a British subject.

* The Minister for **Immigration** will address the Chair and he will do so only after I have called him.

* He had been the personal assistant to the head of the Department of **Immigration**,  Sir Peter  Heydon, before that.

* He gave me this information: 
On Wednesday 19 February I was approached by the Opposition spokesman on **Immigration**,  Mr MacKellar,  who said he was thinking of asking your permission to examine the Stonehouse file.

* He became Minister for **Immigration**, but he was a dismal failure again.

* My grievance concerns the Government's failure to implement its promises with regard to migrant education and the admission by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  at question time yesterday that he had no interest or involvement in assisting migrants to gain a proficiency in the English language.

* What did we get from the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs?

* I challenge the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to tell the ethnic groups what he proposes to do.

* It will be realised of course that the Australian Government, and certainly the Department of **Immigration**, are not in a position, I suppose, to open barriers which are closed in a firm way.

* I am not decrying their importance but I am yet to hear any member of the National Country Party rise to his feet and take an interest in technical education, **immigration** or social welfare.

* Ministers responsible for **immigration** within the States are well aware of this.

* The New South Wales Minister for Education has had clear assurances from the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and also from the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  that there will be a commitment to maintain levels at least sufficient for last year and to enable the courses to continue.

* I commend the Government on its allocations for **immigration** and ethnic affairs in this Budget.

* The selections by the Department of **Immigration** have been completed and the appointment action by the Public Service Board is taking place now in all States.

* In looking at  Hansard,  it seemed to me that there could be some misunderstanding so I sought further advice on this subject from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland).

* A Press statement was released by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 10 September following a meeting of the ministerial committee which administers the Regional Employment Development scheme.

* At a meeting of Ministers administering the Regional Employment Development Scheme on Wednesday, 10 September 1975, consideration was given to the results of a review, undertaken by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, of projects approved after 30 June 1973 and of those approved before that date on which work had not begun.

* Officers of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** contacted sponsors of all those projects and sought information as to whether work had started or not, and what financial commitments had been incurred.

* This Government has not even taken into account the problems which have been caused by our **immigration** programme, particularly as it affects these schools.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1979: 
I do not know whether I favour the publication of awards and other information in various languages because it could have the tendency to create a multi-lingual community which, of course, is not what the Minister for **Immigration** and I wish to see.

* At the same time I am impressed by the reply given yesterday by the Minister for **Immigration** to a question asked of him by my colleague the honourable member for Phillip in which he asked the Minister to consider issuing this information in various languages.

* I commend to the Minister for **Immigration**, to whom I have already spoken about this matter, the practice adopted in those countries which requires that each employer who enlists or recruits migrant labour shall be obligated to provide 300 hours in working time to study the Swedish, Norwegian or Finnish language or whatever the language happens to be in the particular country.

* Indeed, I would go so far as to say that had the suggestion of the Minister for **Immigration** been adhered to before the strike reached the crisis stage that dispute may never in fact have occurred at all.

* All the Government has to say on this matter was said' in the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who at the time was Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development.

* Is the spokesman still the Treasurer or is it even the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)?

* As well, we had the extraordinary situation of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** writing to the Treasurer and arguing that the Government had to change course.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has also been busy telling the Press and the Australian public that unemployment is going to rise and that he has felt that way for a long time now.

* Of course, he forgot to tell the Prime Minister that, because at a Press conference on 2 July the Prime Minister, although he had spoken extensively to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on the previous day, said he knew nothing of the Minister's predictions.

* On that very same day the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was engaged in the favourite pastime of Labor Ministers of leaking - not just any information but the June rise in unemployment and a record fall in job vacancies.

* That has not yet been told to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the  Deputy  Prime Minister.

* Then there was the latter day Henry Georgist, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I am pleased to have an opportunity to take part in this debate on the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The debate and much of the discussion is looking ahead not to next year, not even to the next decade, but to the next century because the policies that we implement with regard to Australia's **immigration** program and, putting it in a wider context, with regard to Australia's population, will determine the manner of the future development of this country.

* At.the outset, I want to stress that I think Australia needs increasingly to see its **immigration** policy as a part of its population policy.

* As a result, the major influence on Australia's population will be our **immigration** policies.

* So when we read in the Green Paper that a series of **immigration** options have been put forward, I think that we should rephrase the term '**immigration** options' and refer to 'population options '.

* A point I want to make at this stage is that over the past few years we have looked at **immigration** programs upon the basis of the number of new settler arrivals and we have said that there will be 100 000 new settlers coming to Australia in a particular year.

* The fact is that the settler arrival figures give a totally false impression of our current **immigration** program.

* Net migration, rather than gross settler arrivals, is used in measuring population growth due to **immigration**, as it takes account of departures from Australia.

* If **immigration** was stopped, population growth in Australia would be determined by natural increase (i.e.

* I urge the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  when he looks at this question to recognise that family reunion is based upon humanitarian grounds.

* Yet there is a certain illogical position for those vehement critics of **immigration** who see the stimulatory effects of **immigration** during inflation but fail to admit the potential for recovery from recession in the same source.

* In recent times it was changed from **Immigration** to **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I believe that consideration should be given to changing the title to Minister for Population, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to draw attention to the significance of migration in terms of Australia's total population program.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
What is the Australian Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians.

* What would be the Australian Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians in the event of a negotiated settlement between the Smith regime and the British Government.

* I indicate to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  that if the irrelevancy of the Prime Minister in this debate was exceeded at all it was exceeded by the contribution which the honourable gentleman made.

* I say without any sense of real offence to the Minister for **Immigration** that he seemed more at pains to defend his own actions which have led to such hysteria in the migrant community than to defend the Attorney-General in another place.

* I turn finally to comments made by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  because he has been at great pains to clear his own name and the actions in which he has been concerned.

* That concept does not lie very easily with the concept of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  of the family of the nation.

* On the latest population projectionsallowing for an **immigration** target of 70,000 persons annually and assuming that we return to the participation rates of February 1 978 which were much lower than those for 1977 or 1976- the work force can be expected to rise from 6,384,200 in 1978 to 7,000,000 in 1981.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 September 1977: 
1 ) The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs advises that 793,086 Australian citizens departed during 1975-76, 814.060 during 1976-77, and 836,586 during 1977-78.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said today: 'I am right.

* More often than not the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has been right in a number of things he has said about the economy and growing unemployment.

* I think if the Prime Minister wanted a responsible Treasurer he ought to consider the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** as a Treasurer.

* Let me assure the honourable member that his own Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  recognises the problem.

* My first comment relates to a statement made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I suggest that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has taken no action whatsoever.

* Let us look at another statement- a Press release by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It stated: 
Obviously, they are more empty words from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Social Security.

* I continue my remarks to refer to an interview given by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on the 'A.M.'

* I suggest to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that there is a multi-million dollar racket in Australia at the moment in this regard.

* The headline reads: 
I refer to a statement by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who said: 'We believe in a full employment society', while at the same time he was deliberately driving Australians into an unemployed society.

* Within our community we are beginning to get more detailed consideration of **immigration**- it has been exemplified by statements tonight- not just in terms of **immigration** but in terms of the broader context of a population policy for Australia and that is what we are seeking.

* I was very pleased that a number of honourable members referred in this debate this evening to **immigration** not just in terms of **immigration** for itself but in terms of a broader policy.

* This is a gross over-simplificatoin of the **immigration** program for this current financial year.

* Therefore he can only be arguing with that section of the **immigration** intake which is related to occupationally selected migrants.

* In fact, the people who will be competing with Australians for jobs in terms of the **immigration** intake fall largely within the family reunion category and humanitarian category both those sectors of the intake which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said we must continue.

* He spoke in the longer term about an increase in **immigration**.

* I believe bis contribution was part of the series of contributions which related **immigration** to population policies.

* As he and other honourable members will know we are seeking through the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council to have a green paper prepared and ready for public consumption early next year.

* I am hopeful that honourable members and interested people within the public who have a commitment in this area and who have some strong feelings in relation to these matters will make their contributions to the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council.

* However, successive governments in Australia in relation to **immigration** policy have set aside the policies pursued by other governments- that is the guest worker concept.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  in his contribution said that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs was a misnomer because it did not have any ethnic affairs function.

* The only other comment I would make in relation to the speech made by the honourable member for Grayndler is in respect of his suggestion in a Press statement he put out earlier this year that there was something racist about the Government's attitude towards **immigration**.

* I would like to state publicly that I have nothing but praise for the commitment, hard work and dedication of all members of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs both in Australia and overseas for the way they are handling the very greatly increased work load.

* In general, I am very pleased that at least some of the contributors to the debate in relation to the estimates for my Department took the opportunity to draw **immigration** in the wider context of population policies.

* The **immigration** policy for Papua and New Guinea was a long standing one based on the need to avoid the sort of problem which has arisen in other developing countries over the admission of alien racial groups.

* Two men are involved and we cannot see the application of an **immigration** policy to their appointment.

* Then to issue a statement that a **immigration** policy applied to the man.

* The other explanation related to **immigration**.

* For some reason the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to embark upon ethnic Press conferences, presumably because he has taken note of the comments of some members of the ethnic media who have described his shadow minister for **immigration** as a likeable but incompetent shadow minister.

* He also failed to differentiate between the **immigration** program and the refugee program.

* One must remember that the Labor Party is the party which slashed and for all practical purposes cut out **immigration** in 1 973 or 1 974.

* It also abolished the separate Department of **Immigration** and created the Department of Labour and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch),  in the course of his speech, said: 
-I ask the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Has a decision been taken regarding the continuation of interpreter-translator training courses initiated in 1975 at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the Institute of Languages of the University of New South Wales, and die Canberra College of Advanced Education?

* Firstly I wish to deal with the subject of **immigration**.

* I appreciate that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  has a difficult time making decisions on matters of **immigration**, but I must protest at the constant frustration which is being experienced by one of my constituents, a  Mr David  Crane of Rivervale.

* But, despite many requests to the Department of **Immigration** and the Minister for **Immigration** for them to be allowed to migrate to Australia on a full fare paying basis, they have been refused admission to this wonderful country.

* I ask the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  to reconsider the situation and to see what can be done to admit the family.

* I want to say something this evening in regard to the question that I asked this afternoon of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Cameron).

* The reason why I asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, in conjunction with the 
I appreciate that many problems are faced in times of flood or bush fire when a farmer-owner is not entitled to receive relief but a share farmer is entitled to receive relief immediately.

* I was rather disappointed that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** went off on a sidetrack and talked about his own experiences and his appreciation of certain problems and difficulties.

* I think it is quite wrong for the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  to suggest that there was anything about the Labor Party when it was in office or in Opposition which could possibly suggest that the Labor Party was against **immigration** or that it was against migrants.

* I put it to honourable members that whilst the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations may have faced the facts about unemployment, we see reflected in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs an inability on the part of that Department to face that kind of reality.

* There is evidence that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is suggesting that in those circumstances, where we now have 6.2 per cent of the work force unemployed- by the new year, the percentage will be considerably higher- we ought to increase the rate of **immigration** which, I believe, will therefore increase the rate of unemployment.

* The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations suggested in its submission to its Minister: 
The direct effect of **immigration** for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of migrants) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year.

* It is within that context that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in April of this year, was arguing for increasing the levels of migration from their current net levels of around 50,000 odd to 1 10,000.

* If one takes that figure of 27,000 contained in the statement of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in June of this year, well after the parameters of the Budget had been set, and compares it with what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations said in his statement of Thursday of last week, one finds a great difference.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs who, in April was advocating 1 10,000 immigrants a year and whose Department has an interest in the highest possible figures, is clearly in conflict with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who has an interest in the lowest possible figures.

* I refer the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to a paper recently released by  Dr Birrell  of Monash University, who has drawn attention to the way in which the Minister and his Department have manipulated figures to their own advantage.

* Mr Deputy Chairman,  I have shown this table to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and I now seek leave to have it incorporated in  Hansard.

* Every country has a right to its own **immigration** policy and a duty and responsibility to ensure that that policy is administered in the best interests of its own people.

* The overriding objective of Australia's **immigration** policy is to ensure the continuing development of a cohesive and homogeneous community, well integrated and harmonious, without persisting divisions or disunity.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April 1978: 
The course in assimilation starts with pre-embarkation instruction.

* During the recess last year the Government members **immigration** committee flew to Perth and joined the migrant vessel 'Australis' on its trip to Melbourne.

* I was sorry to hear the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  announce at question time today that our migrant intake this year will be cut back to about 170,000.

* I understand that the Department of **Immigration** aims to save S2.6m in salaries, administration expenses, capital works and services, and migrant embarkation costs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
An attack was made by members of the Opposition on the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* Again, I reiterate the figures given by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Again I want to follow the line put forward by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who has done more for the working people of Australia than any previous Minister for Labor.

* This is the only government which has attempted to retrain the working people in this country under the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** whom honourable members opposite say has done nothing to contribute to the lifestyle of the Australian working people.

* This was clearly an unsatisfactory situation and the Minister for **Immigration** of the day, the Honourable B. M. Snedden, with the full approval of all State Ministers for **Immigration**, established in 1969 the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications under the chairmanship of  Dr David  Myers, Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University.

* It thus complements the work of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* 26 of 1974 from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  entitled 'Provisional Commonwealth Employment Service Statistics October 1974' and the attached tables.

* The official figures released by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for September show that 36 per cent of those out of work were under the age of 21 years.

* Compare this with the statement made on 21 April, before the last election, by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Cameron.

* I am grateful to the honourable member for referring to my initiative before the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees but, of course, there have been other proposals, and I refer to both the interest of the Opposition and particularly the endeavours made by my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in association on this matter.

* We were instrumental in bringing about an informal international meeting under UNHCR auspices at Kuala Lumpur in 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
There has been a remarkable unanimity among the tributes which have been paid to him by his colleagues, his friends, his opponents and the Press.

* All have very properly singled out his pioneering of the post-war **immigration** program as his most important and enduring achievement.

* It is a pleasure in this debate to be able to offer some informed views on the performance of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in relation to his Department.

* When Labor was in office it linked up **immigration** and all the matters related to our ethnic people with matters concerning labour- we had a Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* **Immigration** did not have a ministerial hand who was able to devote himself fully to attending to the needs of the migrant community.

* Immediately upon our coming to office a separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs was established.

* One of the first acts of the Minister- for this he deserves congratulation- was to reconstitute the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council.

* Honourable members opposite know, as I do, that that Council has been asked to consider the implications of population change, developments in research in Australia and overseas in the areas of population and **immigration**, the probable long term effects of changing patterns of **immigration** intakes and, additionally, the way in which **immigration** intakes can be planned to complement other national policies.

* As a result of that, Australia's first Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australian population was produced and published.

* During this debate on these important funds which are being allocated to bring immigrants to Australia, I ask the honourable member whether he is prepared to state clearly in what areas he would run down our **immigration** program.

* After reading through the speech he made in this House on 22 March 1977, I should like to know whether perhaps he wants to tail down the family reunion aspects of our **immigration** policy.

* Or is he perhaps saying that if we tail down our active **immigration** policy, which is evidenced in the document we are debating, it is the refugees whom he does not want?

* This is the gentleman who wants to tail down our **immigration** policy because he happens to believe m minimum population growth.

* As the spokesman on these matters for  Her  Majesty's Opposition he might be prepared at some point of time to clarify which area of our **immigration** program he wants to see tailed down, because these estimates allocate the funds necessary to maintain an active **immigration** program.

* Recovery will be generated indirectly through an active **immigration** program bringing skilled workers to Australia.

* During his term of office the Minister has expanded the family reunion categories for **immigration** and allowed people who are bringing business skills, money and so on to Australia that will enable them to commence businesses in Australia, to be eligible under the criteria for entry to this country.

* Since, as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  conceded in that debate, very few of those services indeed are the responsibility of his Department, I propose to confine my remarks to a couple of matters that are within the province of his Department.

* In the couple of minutes remaining to me I want to talk about one other item in the appropriation for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I address a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The honourable gentleman will be aware of the text of a letter sent by his colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, to the Treasurer, a copy of which was sent to the honourable gentleman's office, wherein the Minister for Labor said: 
I ask the Prime Minister: Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** right?

* Does the honourable gentleman share his colleague's view that the Government should change course along lines which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has publicly indicated?

* Thirdly, is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, by inference, publicly criticising his colleague the Federal Treasurer?

* asked the .Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
**Immigration**, upon notice: 
When did he ask the **Immigration** Advisory Council to make a further study to ascertain how to reduce the outflow of permanent settlers (Hansard, 29 September 1971, page 1616.)

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The 2 weeks has become 100 days and more, and still the Leeton growers have not been paid.

* I should like to quote from an article which appeared in the Griffith 'Times' on 22nd December and in which the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for **Immigration**, quoted what the Prime Minister  ('Mr Whitlam)  said to him.

* The article reads: 
After criticising the previous Government, the Minister for **Immigration** was further reported as saying: 
It is related to the Bill.

* One hundred and twenty-four were addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, 55 to the Minister for Trade and Industry, 44 to the Prime Minister - 20 of which were rural questions, none on the environment - 39 to tha Minister for National Development, 32 to the Minister for Shipping and Transport, 27 to the Minister for the Interior, 23 to the PostmasterGeneral, 20 to the Treasurer - 12 of which were rural questions relating to tax concessions and rural relief - 14 to the Minister for Education and Science - 7 of which concerned the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation on cattle - 13 to the Minister for Labour and National Service, 9 to the Minister for the Army, 8 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and, 7 to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I am one of the people who hope that our population projections which have been reduced in the past few years for two reasons- lower fertility rates and much lower **immigration**- will move ahead somewhat more quickly than at present projected.

* The progress could be made by an increase in **immigration** rates to try to counteract the very rapid decrease that honourable members opposite caused when they somehow ceased to believe in **immigration** to this country.

* I feel that he is not operating in the same Party as the honourable member for Hindmarsh, who is now the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* The whole principle of the proposition of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** concerning indexation is to utilise the process of indexation as a substitute for the cost pressures of wages due and the subsequent effects on price rises.

* That would fit in quite well with the current program of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, concerning his process of indexation.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 August 1978: 
I raise this matter now, this being the first time I have had the opportunity to do so today since there has been a  Speaker  in the Parliament.

* I have a proof copy of today's Hansard proceedings which shows that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  stated: 
I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to apologise to the Chair.

* The circumstances,  Mr Speaker,  of the intervention by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would seem to fit in its entirety with the interpretation of the statement that I quoted from May's Parliamentary Practice.

* May gives illustrations of circumstances within which there shall be said to have been any type of reflection on the Chair and there is no doubt that the statement made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was intended to be directed personally against the  Speaker.

* Against the economic circumstances recently outlined in this House by the Prime Minister, the **immigration** programme for 1970-71 has been modified to include the arrival of 120,500 assisted migrants and 49,500 unassisted migrants - a total this year of about 170,000 migrants.

* We do not know how many of these people live in our country, but let us accept the figure that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave in the House last week of 32 000.

* Gullible folk are persuaded to part with their savings under the mistaken belief that, no matter what the Australian **immigration** officials say, they will gain permanent residency when they get to Australia.

* He was attempting to extort money on the promise that his friend in the **Immigration** Department could help the individual to stay in Australia.

* First of all I would like to make some brief reference to honourable members on the Government side who have spoken this evening on this matter of **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: 
1 ) Does the Government agree with the statement in the Green Paper on **Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population that approximately 9 per cent of all immigrants between 1 945 and 1 976 were refugees or people from refugeetype situations.

* It was made clear that increased costs would not be part of the scheme, but even there the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  is looking at particular projects to ensure that substantial justice is done in every case and that there is no undue hardship wherever that can be avoided.

* He called on the new Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to clarify the election promise of amnesty for illegal immigrants.

* I consulted with officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in the States and gave them explicit instructions that people applying for amnesty should be treated with the utmost consideration and humanity.

* The  Neos Kosmos  accepts the guarantee and asks all illegal immigrants to report to the Department of **Immigration** without delay.

* Obviously it would make a nonsense of any **immigration** program.

* In the course of this inquiry, the SubCommittee heard evidence from a number of departments, in particular, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Primary Industry and Health.

* These are exotic animal and plant diseases and illegal **immigration** from Papua New Guinea.

* Illegal **immigration** from Papua New Guinea to the Torres Strait Islands and eventually to mainland Australia is a well-known practice, and one which poses a major risk of disease entering Australia through animals brought into Australian territory by Papua New Guineans.

* Since the Committee heard evidence from the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on this question last August, the Department has taken measures to identify Papua New Guineans living illegally in Australia.

* Whilst the Committee was pleased to hear recently that the Department is now confident that the situation is under control, it believes that this control must be continued and strengthened through expanding the number of **immigration** officers permanently stationed in the area.

* This of course was understandable as the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population was due to be tabled and debated in this House, as it was yesterday.

* I had intended to participate in that debate as I am particularly concerned about **immigration** policy, but this was not possible as the debate in this House was curtailed.

* I hope that the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population will stimulate throughout the community dialogue and debate regarding the quantity and quality of Australia's migrant intake.

* It was an excellent paper and no doubt the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  will be submitting to Cabinet in the not too distant future a report based on its findings.

* It said that if **immigration** were stopped completely the country would be unable to replace the skills of the 30 000 to 40 000 Australians who leave the country each year.

* This figure dwindled to only 50 000 in 1975 under the Labor Government's restrictive **immigration** guide lines- the lowest figure since post-war migration commenced.

* In actual fact there was a net loss in 1975 of more than 6000, perhaps almost 8000, in the number of people entering and leaving the country- the first net loss since our present **immigration** program commenced in 1946.

* Former Liberal and Country Party governments had set a goal of at least a 2 per cent annual population growth rate- 1 per cent through natural birth and 1 per cent through **immigration**.

* I believe that it would in Australia's best interests if the Government were immediately to increase the **immigration** target from 70 000 to 100 000.

* I believe that we are being horribly short sighted- not only the Labor Government before us but even the present Government, even though it has expanded migration- in restricting our **immigration** to such an extent.

* I hope that, following the publishing of the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population, the Government will review our whole migration program.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  had one or two interesting things to say, especially when he revealed the depth of his argument over the last 12 months with the Cabinet, a continuing argument that has gone on since December 12 months ago when he made it plain that he was warning his Cabinet colleagues that there would be impending and rising unemployment in Australia throughout 1974.

* The Prime Minister, and latterly the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, in part say that it is wages that cause inflation and unemployment, although the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has said today that it is much more caused by overseas events- a complete repudiation of his Prime Minister.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** knows quite well that there will be no restraint as a result of the form of indexation that he seeks to introduce.

* It makes speeches from on high, and the trade union movement thumbs its nose at the Government, as it does at the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs 
Has the Minister for **Immigration** seen reports of the failure of the settlement of Ugandan Asians in Britain?

* Government and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** at the time stated that the amount would be flexible and dependent on the unemployment situation.

* They were: The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Cameron;  the Treasurer,  Dr Cairns;  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren;  the Minister for Social Security,  Mr Hayden;  the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Senator James  McClelland; the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart;  and the Minister for Environment,  Dr Cass.

* They are: The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Senator James  McClelland; the Treasurer,  Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development,  Mr Uren;  the Minister for Social Security and Minister for Repatriation and Compensation,  Senator Wheeldon;  the Minister for Manufacturing Industry,  Mr Bowen;  the Minister for Tourism and Recreation,  Mr Stewart;  and the Minister for Environment,  Mr Berinson.

* Senator James  McClelland, both notable Labor and **Immigration** Ministers.

* It was signed:  Senator J.  R. McClelland, Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The meetings of the **Immigration** Advisory Council since 1st January 1964 have been at the following venues: 
Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: Expenditure on Travel (Question No.

* T. F. Gill, New Zealand Minister of **Immigration** and Minister for Health- 17-20 February 1976.

* Apart from that, of course, it is represented by my dear friend and colleague, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  a very sober, quietly dressed young man.

* A great deal of this increase has been the result of **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is it a fact that the Italian Under-Secretary for **Immigration**,  Mr Bemporad,  during a recent visit to Australia said that many provisions of the **Immigration** Agreement between Australia and Italy were inadequate and provided little security for Italian migrants and requested that it should be brought up to date?

* Did  Mr Bemporad  state that the Italian Government was dissatisfied with the methods of the Australian Department of **Immigration** and had sought assurances that information on living and working conditions be accurate and reflect more closely the local situation?

* **Immigration**,  upon notice: 
I happen to be the eldest child.

* The second double standard, if I may use that expression, under which the Labor Party is operating may be seen from a comparison of the so-called health policy of the Labor Party with its **immigration** policy.

* At the same time the Labor Party has a new policy on **immigration**.

* I would like to quote from one of the many statements made by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  and so far as I can see the only clear statement he has ever made.

* On 27th December he was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' as having said: 
The emphasisin future **immigration** programs will be on sponsorship, and family reunion will be given a high priority.

* So, on the one hand, the Australian Labor Party wishes to control the natural increase of Australian born children while on the other hand allowing the uncontrolled **immigration** of people into Australia, irrespective of their country of origin and including nonEuropeans, merely on a family basis.

* Some have put it- I think this overstates the case- that we have come to the end of an era, the post-war era of strong growth fuelled by high level **immigration**, import replacing manufacturing and the growth of the tertiary sector.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Did he receive advice from the former Minister for **Immigration** that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of **Immigration** to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports.

* If so, has he been advised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that the Department of Labor and 
**Immigration** no longer intends to open in Parramatta an office specialising in migrant affairs.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I remind the Minister of representations that have been made to him on behalf of East 
-I seek some clarification from the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  who is the Minister assisting the Treasurer.

* 1 ) Following a survey of the Geelong area it has been decided to open an office of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in that city.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who will follow me in the debate must dissociate himself from the remarks of the Minister for Primary Industry.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs shakes his head.

* For instance, I nope that the deportation sections of the **Immigration** Act are not implemented in accordance with the wishes of the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party.

* I hope that the Minister will not exercise his discretion in the way he did when dealing with the representations of an Italian worker,  Mr Salemi  who is still under threat of deportation, notwithstanding that three High Court judges indicated that there had been a denial of natural justice and that the other three High Court judges were of the opinion that  Mr Salemi  had been treated unfairly and that the concept of natural justice did not apply in the administration of the Minister's decision under the **Immigration** Act.

* I believe it has not been proclaimed because Ministers like the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs want to write into the legislation sections which would not preclude the operation of section 14, of the migration section.

* The matter concerns 2 private students from Malaysia who entered Methodist Ladies' College at Kew in Melbourne with student visas from the Department of **Immigration** at the commencement of 1973 with the aim of obtaining their Higher School Certificates in 1 974 and subsequently pursuing a medical course.

* The 1974 handbook and guide for students for entrance into the medical faculty at Monash on page 42 stated: 
That no more than 10 per cent of the quota of 160 students shall come from overseas to study in Australia under the student visa student of the Department of **Immigration**.

* I am glad to see that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is at the table because the university year is about to commence and I think immediate action is required.

* Also I have received a letter from the principal of the Methodist Ladies College, Kew, advising me that 5 more Asian girls, one from Indonesia and four from Malaysia- I have their names here if either the Minister for Education or the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would like to have them- were interviewed by the Australian 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The honourable member for Wannon also accused the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  of having an ulterior motive.

* I believe the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is to be commended.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) What was the **immigration** target for 1973-74.

* By the year 2001 this figure will increase to 8.5 per cent of the population if account is taken of existing **immigration** trends or 9.1 per cent if **immigration** is not considered.

* The Ministers referred specifically to the Department of **Immigration**, the Repatriation Department and Department of Social Security.

* Action to overcome the shortages is being taken through the **immigration** program, a number of training programs, including CRAFT, and initiatives taken by the Government to increase resources for technical education.

* It is quite clear that the numbers involved are no threat to Australia's **immigration** policies.

* The Minister for **Immigration** says that the Government now pays their air fares; that is splendid.

* Yet the presence in Saigon of a young couple by the name of Robertson, who carried the forms from official to official in our Embassy  -  I might say to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  that these officers have been very helpful - and through the bureaucracies in South Vietnam enabled them to cut off the last 2 months and, indeed, if this process were begun very much earlier I think there would be greater joy all round.

* I look forward to hearing something on this matter from the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** must seek leave to make a statement.

* **Immigration** policy, particularly when it relates to migrants who want to enter the work force, must play an important part in the formulation of manpower policy.

* For this reason, the amalgamation of the old departments of Labour and 
**Immigration** will ensure that there is a much closer relationship between **immigration** and manpower policies than there has been in the past.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  accused me of being involved in a conspiracy with one of the biggest shipping firms.

* I sincerely ask the Minister for Northern Development and the Minister for the Northern Territory to speak to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** about this legislation because, if accepted, it will drive shipping off the north coast.

* Future policies will need to account for this development unless the birth rate increases- I suppose that is unlikely- or we adopt a deliberate **immigration** policy aimed at bringing young people into the country.

* Even such an **immigration** policy would have difficulty in effecting a 'younging' of the 
Australian population, if I may put it that way.

* To some extent at least that would counteract any attempt to introduce younger people into the community through a deliberate **immigration** policy.

* I desire to ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* our **Immigration** authorities for entry of such children.

* My department, the Services and the Department of .**Immigration** have no record of any formal requests concerning such adoptions.

* It is in support of the estimates relating to the important subject of **immigration** to which I want to speak.

* In the total reach of the new policies and programs already undertaken, and others in process of preparation and introduction which have occupied the Government of which I am a supporter, none has more incisively and imaginatively gripped the mood and temper of the nation than has the subject of **immigration**.

* In his statement to the House, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  revealed his remarkable capabilities and the informed concern with which he deals with the many facets of the subject under review.

* It would seem to me that there are 3 possible reasons to support a program of **immigration**.

* If I could return for a moment to the third of the reasons I advanced for support of an **immigration** program, it would seem to me that it is the only moral and valid reason.

* Department of Labor and **Immigration** 
The removal of the exemption will have 2 very serious effects.

* If the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  likes to deny that, I will be pleased to hear him say that this is adequate compensation for the fruit growers.

* That is a pretty proud record for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  and his Prime Minister whom he was praising so greatly yesterday as having performed so much for the trade union movement.

* I instance the 25 per cent tariff cuts without examination; the successive revaluations; the unreasonable government spending leading to inflation; an initial wage policy which added very greatly to inflation, which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has at last come to recognise and which the Prime Minister has more recently come to recognise; the policies of the Prices Justification Tribunal which were designed to squeeze companies and  profits so  that there would be nothing left for reinvestmentthis has been recognised far too late by the Prime Minister in his letter to the Prices Justification Tribunal- and the credit squeeze itself which is causing many firms to become bankrupt and many others to put off employees in an effort to survive.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** started by saying March but when the recent survey of manufacturing prospects was put out by the Department of Manufacturing Industry and when a forward look is taken at what is happening in the economy, one finds that it is most unlikely that there will be any change in present trends in March, April, May or June.

* It has set up a Regional Employment Development scheme for the country; a Regional Employment Development scheme for the city; National Employment and Training proposals which are still far from the objectives which I think the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would want; and the income maintenance scheme which is utterly unfair because why should those who are out of work as a result of a tariff decision receive preferred treatment to those who are out of work as a result of a credit squeeze?

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-This afternoon we have listened in this House to some extremely interesting speeches on the Appropriation Bills.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  made great play of the fact that the people who sit on the Opposition side are very rich people- wool barons, oil barons, wealthy pastoralists and the privileged.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, for whom I have high regard, mentioned employment and what the Government was doing for the unemployed.

* When we were in Government, I heard the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** enlarging upon the unemployment figures.

* It is all right now in the short term, but in the long term somebody is going to pay for it; somebody is going to be jollywell hurt, and it could be the little people of this country, the poor people, the people whom the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  purports to represent.

* I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I disagree entirely with the censorious remarks directed by the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* I believe that the present Minister for **Immigration** is one.

* I must pay some credit to the efficiency of **immigration** officers in Australia in the manner in which they issue passports.

* Knowing human nature as I do, I know that the most foolproof scheme that can be implemented in any **immigration** office or bank is not foolproof unless the honesty of those enforcing the scheme or carrying out their duties is beyond reproach.

* I believe that this should be applied not only to people in the **immigration** office, about whom I am not making serious allegations.

* I say to the Minister for **Immigration** that I should like to see the principle sold to the Australian community and to this Parliament that people obtaining a passport or responsible migration documents should be invited to submit voluntarily their right index finger print or their left or right thumb print.

* The first question may relate to Aborigines, the next to the state of the economy and the third one to **immigration**.

* I think the honourable gentleman who is now at the table, the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  had things to say about the admission of British migrants to Australia.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** aware of allegations that there are now 30,000 people illegally in Australia?

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  knows.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, who said that he would resign if the unemployment rate exceeded 250 000 people is here.

* They are the pacesetter principles advocated by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It has been picked up by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who is saying that unemployment is imported.

* I thank my colleagues for their support of the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic 
Earlier today we saw the Parliament trying to politicise this whole subject.

* I have an emphathy with the honourable members for St George and Grayndler, feeling deeply as they do about the personal problems they face among the large ethnic groups within their electorates, but I hope we will soon see the whole subject of **immigration** lifted to its former position of warranting bipartisanship on the part of all members of this House, rather than slanging matches across the Chamber.

* This is no easy subject to discuss and I believe it a great shame that the **immigration** debate has become so very political in the last two or three years.

* At this stage I should like to pay a tribute to the professionalism that exists in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* It was a source of personal pleasure when this Government decided to make the **Immigration** Department a separate department again.

* I congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who has sat through the whole of this debate, for his personal concern and involvement in the problems of migrants in Australia.

* I pay tribute in this debate to people in the Sydney office of the **Immigration** Department, people such as George Austin, Brian O'Neill, Bruce Donald and John Vanderness, among others.

* The point is that we have within the **Immigration** Department some very dedicated professional people.

* From my own experience I believe that is a good relationship between the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* These standards are developed by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs after consultation with the Department of Health.

* As the honourable member is the shadow Minister for labour and industrial relations I should have thought that he would have taken advantage of the mass of information that is available to him from the Department of our very fine Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I feel sure that the honourable member has read a document put out by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I do not say that there is any connection between the figures; I use them merely as an illustration of the fact- this has been said by both the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**- that unemployment is not a phenomenon peculiar to Australia.

* I think the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** answered very well the charges in relation to the working of the National Employment and Training scheme.

* I should have hoped that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is at the table, would have fought for more reasonable proposals, even though this matter is not directly under his administration.

* Therefore in theory when a government wants to start a new program or wants to spend more money on defence, **immigration** or whatever it may be, it has to go out and defend that proposition before the public.

* What is the Labor policy in respect of **immigration**?

* Amongst the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  the right honoruable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  the new shadow Minister for **Immigration** who deposed the honourable member for Grayndler, and  Mr Don  Dunstan and  Mr Bill  Hartley on the Federal Executive of the Labor Party, there seems to be some confusion.

* -As the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has said, we cannot go on - 
Does the Minister for **Immigration** recall my question of 30 May last and my suggestion that Commonwealth instrumentalities such as the PostmasterGeneral's Department and the Defence Department should set an example in teaching English to migrant employees.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-I want briefly to ask a question of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* The Minister for **Immigration** has been going around saying one thing today and another thing tomorrow.

* I believe that the statement which has been made today by the Minister for **Immigration** certainly will not help our relations with those countries, particularly with Fiji.

* I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that there is an urgent need for re-examination of the total **immigration** policy of the present Government.

* I feel that it highlights the confusion and doubt about the **immigration** policy of the present Government under the administration of the present Minister.

* The **immigration** programme with its many social problems, the international scene, the need for members and senators to be freely available throughout their electorates, the increased cost of travel, population increases, larger electorates, the needs for members of Parliament to be informed electorally and on the Territories of the Commonwealth all present heavy demands on time and money.

* I turn next to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who perhaps should be called the Minister for unemployment.

* I understand that, some time in his rash career, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** made the statement that he would resign if unemployment ever exceeded 200 000.

* Only some 6 months before that time, he and the shadow Minister for labor, the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, were screaming that any government which faced an unemployment level of 100 000 or 1 10 000 persons should resign as it was not fit to govern a country.

* The then shadow Minister for labor said: 
The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is misleading the people also inasmuch as, through the activities of his RED scheme, monetary assistance is being provided to place many people in jobs which have a temporary base.

* Is the Ministerial Member who is in charge of **immigration** and emigration in Papua New Guinea empowered, on his own authority, to deport persons in the Territory and to refuse entry permits to persons wishing to come into the Territory?

* Tabled by  Mr Grassby:  **Immigration** Advisory Council - Progress Report of Inquiry into the Departure of Settlers from Australia  -  14 March 1973. 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs Minister for Home Affairs.

* has twice visited Australia since the agreement was signed, the present Minister for **Immigration** did not see fit to visit Italy during his extensive overseas tour in October and November, aor in fact did he visit Yugoslavia, Malta or Turkey, with which negotiations have been proceeding for some years, as I have quoted, nor Denmark, Ireland and Spain with which negotiations have since been initiated.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, who interjects, has not visited those countries and his colleague the Minister for Social Services has not mentioned them as being countries to which approaches have been made.

* Despite these rhetorical speeches which are prepared for the Minister for **Immigration** about Australia's migrant intake, the fact is that the migrant intake is going down.

* This is a feature which we ali accept - the decline in the volume of **immigration**.

* In March this year the number of former migrants who departed permanently was 2,736 and in March last year it was 2,330. 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 31 May 1978: 
-The facts of this case are quite simple.

* The nomination was sent to the chief **immigration** officer in Rome in the usual way.

* The previous Minister for Labor and **Immigration** reviewed the case in May of this year and confirmed the decision taken by officers of his Department.

* The action taken was to advise the Australian **immigration** officials at the Australian Embassy in Rome to review the case further.

* After examination by the appropriate authorities in Australia the **immigration** officials in Rome were advised to undertake a further examination, to seek a further review and to make a report.

* He has been most unreasonable and the accusation that he has made against the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**, whom 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Finally, in the Minister's second reading speech is a fairly optimistic statement on how the Government's program is moving towards the reconstruction of Australia's horticultural industries.

* There are members in the Australian Labor Party - the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  for example - who have in the horticultural industries in their electorates very real problems that just have to be faced up to.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) How many officers in the Department of **Immigration** had been given some form of formal training in financial or auditing procedures used in Commonwealth departments in the last 12 months.

* Clyde Cameron advised that the last item of official advise he received as the previous Minister for Labour and **Immigration** was notification to him from the then Treasurer, the  Hon.

* The proportion of unsponsored migrants in the total **immigration** program will in future vary according to Australia's needs.

* Under the **immigration** policies of the present Government, there will be 3 main elements in the **immigration** program: 
My understanding was that some of the non State schools in Victoria received their dividends from this legislation faster than schools in the State school system.

* If this in fact is what happens I think the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  ought to take steps to see that there is no disadvantage placed upon the State system because some of that State's bureaucracies are slow moving.

* I wish to direct the attention of the House, as I have directed, by way of a letter, the attention of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  to one of the problems for migrants in the Geelong area which has resulted from the amalgamation of the former Department of Labor and the former Department of **Immigration** and the separation of those departments since the change of Government last year.

* Prior to the amalgamation of the departments following the 1974 election, officers of the Department of **Immigration** serviced the Geelong area on a regular basis- I think for 5 half days a week.

* I point out that some 22 per cent of the population of the area is of migrant origin and a very heavy work load for the migrant communities has been undertaken by the Department of **Immigration**.

* At the time of the amalgamation of the 2 departments, the officer who had been carrying out the duties of the Department of **Immigration** in the area was absorbed into the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and, as part of that Department's Commonwealth Employment Service in Geelong, still carried out the same duties.

* Since the Department has become a separate entity the officer concerned has remained with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and on an agency basis has carried out those functions previously carried out for the Department of **Immigration** in its single and combined functions with the Department of Labor.

* Certainly the officers concerned find it unsatisfactory, and I believe that the reestablishment of an office or regular visits by an officer of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is highly desirable.

* In this particular instance there was a request by the honourable member for Shortland calling upon the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to table the document.

* I put the question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 'Did you read from the document?'

* -My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, and it is a supplementary question to that just asked by the honourable member for Melbourne.

* by leave- A study of the economic costs and benefits of **immigration** was one of three projects commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in 1970.

* Two of these, the National Population Inquiry, headed by Professor W. D. Borne, O.B.E., and the 1973 **Immigration** Survey were completed in good time and produced valuable results.

* The report of the 1973 **Immigration** Survey, entitled 'A Decade of Migrant Settlement', was tabled in Parliament in September 1976.

* These two reports provide a valuable data base for the formulation of Australia's future population and **immigration** policies.

* I now refer to the report on the third project, the cost benefit study of **immigration**.

* Associate Professor J. R. Wilson, of the University of Sydney, in 1970 undertook to carry out a cost/ benefit study of **immigration**.

* His appointment was recommended by the then **Immigration** Planning Council and the project was subsequently placed under its general supervision.

* Successive Ministers for **Immigration** pressed to have the study completed as did I.

* 1 believe that I will, in expressing some regret about the apparent quality of the report, speak not only for myself and the Government but also for previous Ministers for **Immigration** who, like me, had hoped for a greater contribution to an understanding of the economic impact of the post-war **immigration** program than this report offers.

* 1 ask the Minister for **Immigration**: Is it a fact, as has been reported, that the Prime Minister of Fiji who, I understand, has complained that his luggage was inspected by Australian Customs officials during transit through Australia is required to obtain a visa to enter Australia whilst his European official is not?

* His  reputation is well known to most honourable members, particularly to former Ministers for **Immigration**.

* I have been given examples of his behaviour by a former Minister for **Immigration** of some years back.

* If the description of him as given to me by that former Minister for **Immigration** is true, he is beneath my contempt and I will have nothing to do with him.

* He is intemperate and I believe his vindictive outbursts not only against myself in the present administration but also against Ministers for **Immigration** in former administrations achieve absolutely nothing for those on whose behalf they are purported to be made.

* In this regard I speak not only for myself but also for former Ministers for **Immigration** in previous Liberal and Country Party governments.

* The easy visa system was introduced to permit genuine visitors to come to Australia with a minimum of inconvenience in respect of **immigration** formalities.

* I am glad that on this point, as is usual with **immigration** matters, my opposite number in the Opposition agrees with my comments in this regard.

* But by and large, the visitors themselves cannot be exonerated from complicity in a calculated evasion of Australian **immigration** policy.

* I should like to know how many thousands of men and perhaps women, because we have found Filipino women who have been exploited in this way, are working in Australia at near slave rates of pay under threat of deportation by their employers who have only to say: 'Listen, if you are going to kick up a row about it or join the union I will ring the Department of **Immigration** and tell them where to locate you'.

* -Iwill take a minute or two to raise an **immigration** matter which I think has very distressing and exceptional factors.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has refused to allow a three-year-old Filipino infant to be reunited with his mother in Australia.

* The Minister has taken the view that  Mrs Aussieker  sought deliberately to mislead the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs when she was asked to indicate whether she had any dependants.

* Believing erroneously that the Australian **immigration** officials were inquiring whether she was economically dependent and, having a job, she answered no.

* He said: 
Travel by Members of the **Immigration** Advisory, Planning and Publicity Councils.

* A senior female officer of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** in Melbourne, chosen to sit on the committee solely because of her own standing and background -  was convened.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Any Australian **immigration** action in East Timor requires the co-operation of Indonesian authorities to locate and assemble nominees for migration procedures.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is compiling a list of sponsored nominees acceptable under family reunion policy.

* Nominations received by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs up to close of business on 22 April 1977 will be considered in this operation.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is seeking from sponsors details of the disposition of their families so that all relevant factors may be considered in assessing the eligibility of their nominees for entry to Australia.

* In accordance with normal **immigration** procedures, this information is for internal departmental use only and is being obtained on a form used, where required, in cases involving family reunion.

* I appreciate what has been done by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* He issued this statement following the Australian Labor Party's Federal Conference at Launceston: 
My view on Labor's **immigration** policy and particularly on non-European migration, should be very well known as I have expressed them publicly on many occasions.

* Following the Launceston Conference of the ALP, when a slight change was made in the wording of the policy, I expressed my opinion on its interpretation and was  promply  relieved of my responsibilities as 'shadow' Minister for **Immigration**, or in more colloquial terms, 'sacked'.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  speaking on behalf of the Liberal-Country Party Government has left no doubt as to their policy on non-European migration.

* To achieve that end Australia should continue the position of preferment which has characterised that relationship, particularly having regard to the overall basis of our **immigration** policy.

* I can well imagine the feelings of the present Prime Minister with his Napoleonic arrogance and his sense of divine destiny, but I can tell the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  that those expectations might well be 'hope springs eternal' so far as the Prime Minister is concerned.

* It indicates a failure by the Minister for **immigration** and the Government to put before this House and the people of Australia a cohesive and meaningful **immigration** policy.

* The Minister knows full well that some weeks ago he was deliberately challenged - I confess the use of the word 'deliberate',  Mr Speaker  - to bring down in this House a comprehensive statement of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* It is a matter of record that since he assumed the **Immigration** portfolio, the Minister has been one of the Government's most prolific purveyors of what is loosely called news.

* I fee' a little embarrassed for the officers of the Department of **Immigration** who are here.

* The officers of the Department of **Immigration** in this country are unparalleled in their dedication to duty.

* I feel embarrassed that I should be making these comments because, as my colleague the former Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes),  points out what a terrible time it must be for them.

* Yet the **immigration** policies of the Australian Labor Party advocate and require that the Commonwealth Government should withdraw from the search for migrants.

* In addition, the **immigration** policies of the Australian Labor Party would mean significantly fewer migrants coming to Australia from such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Malta.

* I pointed out also that the experience of the Department of **Immigration** gauged over 25 years of **immigration** was that migrants generally waited more than 8 years before deciding to apply for citizenship.

* The role of the Commonwealth in this sphere has been limited, in the words of my colleague the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden),  a previous Minister for **Immigration**, to vigorous advocacy.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 25 May 1977: 
1 ) Did  Mr Justice  Gibbs in the case of  Salemi v Minister for **Immigration**  hold that the **Immigration** Act did not require the Minister to act in accordance with the rules of natural justice.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 April 1977: 
After serving four years in Townsville gaol, having been married to an Australian citizen and having had three Australian children,  Mr Grunau  was sent by this Government and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  a deportation order signed by the Minister on 19 September and delivered on 29 September.

* Last year the Minister for **Immigration** announced that the Commonwealth Government would move towards more air travel for migrants instead of sea travel.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  explained in his second reading speech, the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Bill 1974 is designed to provide for an extension of the Stevedoring Industry (Temporary Provisions) Act for a period of 2 years pending the introduction of permanent legislation.

* Why does the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  not tell us where he is running into all this trouble?

* I trust that the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** are working in close co-operation - perhaps that is too much to hope for from this Government - on the associated aspects of future port upgrading and labour relations.

* It is no good the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** saying, as he did in a speech in June, that industrial conflict is a natural consequence of our economic system.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
Taking as an example those persons who were sponsered by the Fairbridge Society and qualified for entry in 1976-77, how are these applicants classified under the Government 's **immigration** policy?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has he or the Government given undertakings to any governments, or the representatives of any governments, for the issue of visas to citizens of those countries for travel to Australia without all normal **immigration** clearances, providing such visitor nominees are recommended or referred by their respective governments.

* This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social welfare administrators which recommended that **immigration** policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a child-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the child would not promote his or her welfare and best interests.

* As Minister for **Immigration** and Ethic Affairs, my role is primarily to determine applications for entry to Australia of children for adoption on the basis of the principles and recommendations I have mentioned.

* I believe that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  both of whom are at the table, ought to be ashamed of themselves for advancing such weak arguments.

* After all, as the Minister for **Immigration** said, the argument for a new national anthem has been discussed for many years.

* I was a little disappointed at some of the comments made by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Yet the Minister for **Immigration** says that there is not a great deal of interest shown.

* The Minister for **Immigration** says that it is too late.

* I again say that it is not too late to do as the honourable member for Warringah suggests, and I am surprised at the Minister for **Immigration** for talking such rubbish as to say that we should have woken up earlier.

* As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since federation, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a crisis in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an **immigration** policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community.

* I did not really think that the honourable member for Riverina, the Minister for **Immigration**, was so sensitive.

* I want to refer to a few matters that really go to the point of the failure of the Government to keep its promises, firstly, in the area of **immigration** and ethnic affairs which is the area of my responsibility.

* Although the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in stating a policy on **immigration** and population, is laying the groundwork for bringing more migrants into this country, the Government cannot take adequate care of the people in the country at the present time.

* Even though times have changed drastically, with hundreds of thousands of people out of work, there has been no change of which I am aware in the Government's commitment to large scale **immigration**.

* Whatever may be its strange attitudes to future **immigration**, or even to the future of Australia, the Government is demonstrably at fault in its attitudes to existing communities of people born overseas and the children of parents born overseas.

* It is the responsibility of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and of the Government to ensure that proper and adequate facilities are provided for the purpose of protecting those people who are brought out here in the first instance as factory fodder and then forced into a situation where they are at the mercy of the scavengers in this society.

* I preface my question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** by saying that recently in Sydney the employees of a small textile manufacturer were stood down.

* Does the Minister recall an agreement of October last year between the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in the previous Government and the Federated Clerks Union that no such dismissals would take place, and that staff would not be retrenched or posted to other States?

* I can assure the honourable gentleman that so far as it lies within my powers as Minister for **Immigration** to consider whether any person should remain in Australia - this of course, does not apply to an Australian citizen, as I think the honourable gentleman mentioned - the matter will be duly considered in exactly the same way as the case of  Mr Cocker  was considered, and the Government will apply the same firm attitude based on the very serious view it takes of offences of this sort.

* -Is the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware that wage indexation has been described as a wage freeze?

* Preliminary discussions leading up to the Agreement were held in Canberra and Belgrade between representatives of the two Governments, including a thorough discussion on main principles by my colleague the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden),  when, as Minister for **Immigration**, he visited Belgrade in December 1968.

* The Australian delegation comprised representatives of the Department of **Immigration**, the Department of External Affairs, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Social Services.

* In accordance with the usual practice on agreements affecting **immigration** the text of the Agreement was referred to all six State governments and each signified that it had no objection to the signature of the Agreement as proposed.

* It has always been basic to Australia's post-war **immigration** policy that the right to determine who may be admitted to Australia for permanent settlement rests with Australia.

* As with all other countries from which migrants are taken, Yugoslavia has a legitimate and reasonable interest in the number and occupational categories of those moving to **immigration** countries.

* **Immigration** Agreement Between Australia and Yugoslavia - Ministerial Statement, 5th March 1970.  and move: 
I refer the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the statement made by him earlier this year when he so properly revoked the insidious system of the Whitlam Government requiring - 
The Migration Act 1958 confers in Sections 12, 13 and 1 4 power to the Minister of State for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to order the deportation of 'aliens' and 'immigrants' provided certain defined pre-conditions exist.

* Those sections may be invoked in the following circumstances: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 April 1 978: 
I should Uke to address myself to some of the more basic questions on **immigration** in this country from a long-term point of view.

* I would also like to criticise some of the opponents of **immigration**.

* They are basically the same people who opposed **immigration** ever since it became fashionable to do so.

* I suppose that is ever since the time **immigration** started.

* The same people, who are still opponents in most cases, now argue the opposite- namely that **immigration** will cause unemployment.

* I do not know whether this is still done by the present Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, but the old Department of **Immigration** did this.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 June 1 978: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
1 ) Will the Minister provide a list of all inquiries relating to **immigration** since 2 December 1 972.

* I have great pleasure in supporting the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  because I represent an electorate which contains some 6000 Greek people, 2000 people of Russian extraction, 1000 Italians and 2000 other people of non-British origin.

* Let me say this to the people of Victoria: When you compare the results of the man who is now the Commissioner for race relations,  Mr Grassby-  a former Minister for **Immigration**- when 367 people stepped forward, with the results of the new Liberal Minister you will see that the new Minister has increased the previous number eleven-fold.

* The honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Opposition's spokesman on **immigration**, suggests that the period should be one year.

* The post-war **immigration** boom was begun under a Labor government but unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of migrants, services fell very quickly under a government that did nothing for them for 23 years.

* In 1974 we transferred the section from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to the Department of Social Security.

* For some reason the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  carries far more weight in her party than does the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  whose performance is causing some concern even in his own ranks.

* Whenever the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic affairs are challenged they quote figures for the whole branch rather than for the migrant welfare section.

* Professor Encel was to carry out a similar inquiry early in 1976 at a very low cost to the community, but the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs sacked him.

* -Last Thursday in this House I asked a question of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in relation to the regional employment development scheme.

* I ask you,  Mr Speaker,  why there would need to be 4 RED Ministers- the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the Minister for Tourism and Recreation  (Mr Stewart),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass).

* Yet the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** took it on himself to handle it all from Canberra.

* There are approximately 900 local authorities in Australia, all making submissions to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The States opened the door wide, and what did the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** do?

* R. J. Hamer who was then Minister for **Immigration**.

* At page 3804 of the Victorian Hansard,  Mr Hamer  said: 
What is the estimated revenue received by the Commonwealth from the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia as (a) taxes on mining and processing Australian bauxite, limestone and coal, (b)net profits and interest paid to the Commonwealth as a result of the increased requirement for electricity in the industry, (c) taxes paid by migrants employed in the industry less their **immigration** fares and assimilation costs.

* It may be an administrative one which would gather under its umbrella all the housing areas which are at present administered by the Commonwealth Government, such as housing for Aborigines, certain **immigration** procedures and defence service homes.

* In the second reading speech the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  stated that the charge is being made to cover the cost of meat inspection, which has grown with the huge increase in meat exported from Australia.

* I will bet that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is the honourable member for Riverina has received his share.

* I must say that I am surprised at the tenor of the question asked by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition because the records of my Department indicate that he when Minister for **Immigration** was deeply concerned at the activities of criminal elements in our community, a small group of people in the total migrant intake but nevertheless too many because one person in our community who is addicted to violence is too many in terms of the acceptance of these activities by the Australian people.

* When he was Minister for **Immigration**, the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition used strong terms and took strong action to deal with what he had evidently felt was a lack of government action and a lack of action by the appropriate government agencies to curb violence in our country.

* What I said was that the information which had been gathered by the Special Reports Branch of the Department of **Immigration** had been made available to me immediately on taking office.

* The Department of **Immigration** has received specific continuing instructions that there shall not be considered for migration anyone who has an addiction to or a record of violence.

* The cases appearing before superior courts- 
Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs data.

* Alternatively, perhaps he could have the Australian subsidised dredges operate in cooperation with the South Korean dredge, provided that the Commonwealth Department of **Immigration** allows the work to proceed.

* This matter relates to problems of interpreting the law concerning **immigration** and, even worse, to the misinterpretation of what might be deemed to be Press releases of a Minister announced as being government policy.

* Let me say at the outset that during the last election the Government announced its policy on **immigration** with the famous line: 
Subsequent to that we had the benefit of the Ombudsman's decision which clearly indicated that he felt Salemi was entitled to remain here.

* We would say that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKeller)  should certainly act in accordance with the Ombudsman's impartial investigation of the position.

* How is it that the Government is just wiping its hands of the situation and allowing the confrontation to be between only the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and  Mr Salemi?

* What could have been a sensible attempt to balance, economic growth against other objectives has become a narrow prejudice against **immigration** which threatens to slow our rate of development, limit our room for economic manoeuvre and dry up opportunities for all Australians.

* Restriction of **immigration**, in spite of the rationalisations of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  is occurring.

* Ever since the postwar **immigration** scheme was launched by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  to whom I pay tribute, it has been accepted as axiomatic by both sides in this Parliament that the national interest requires the effective control of the size and structure of the migrant inflow.

* I say has been accepted' because the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on the Budget with his penchant for trimming his policies to the prevailing fashions of the patio intellectuals, has become an advocate not of control but of laissez-faire in **immigration**, because this is what natural migration, open migration or sponsored migration is.

* The Leader of the Opposition who would introduce controls and planning into virtually every aspect of our economic and social life, has become an advocate of laissez-faire in **immigration**.

* No responsible Australian Government could abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the **immigration** programme to be determined by the unco-ordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and overseas.

* Indeed, the intemperate nature of some recent attacks on **immigration**, and even particular migrant groups, can be described adequately only in terms of the legal definition of fraudulent misrepresentation.

* To advocate, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, a totally passive role for the Commonwealth Government in the field of **immigration** is completely unrealis tic.

* Parenthetically, I make the point that to confine our **immigration** programme to sponsored cases would effectively preclude Australia from accepting refugees who, with few exceptions, are wholly Government sponsored.

* Critics of the Government's policies also forget that **immigration** is not an end in itself.

* But, as in the past, the **immigration** programme - and particularly assisted migration - will continue to be directed towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population.

* **Immigration** is only one part of an overall population situation, only one of several components of population change.

* But the social, economic and demographic effects of the components of population change - births, deaths, **immigration** and emigration - vary quite substantially.

* Changes in the **immigration** programme cannot entirely offset the consequences of changes in other population, and work force, factors.

* Neither is natural increase and **immigration** the mutually conflicting possibilities which they are sometimes represented to be.

* Indeed, an increased birth rate as an alternative to **immigration**, as sometimes advocated, is neither feasible nor relevant to Australia's needs.

* But natural increase and **immigration** are not mutually conflicting alternatives.

* Yet we are traditionally a country of **immigration** and.

* The most that we can reasonably ask of **immigration** is that it improve the situation which otherwise would exist.

* It is foolish, and indeed dangerous, to regard **immigration** as some kind of economic and social 'wonder drug' which will overcome all our problems.

* But it is, of course, just as foolish - and just as dangerous - to regard **immigration** as the sole or principal cause of these problems.

* In fact, the essential purpose of the **immigration** programme is, as I said before, to contribute towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population and work force.

* It is against this background that Australia's **immigration** programmes are being developed.

* This information will be used by the Government, together with other considerations, in determining the size and structure of future **immigration** programmes.

* Another major study is being carried out at the university of Sydney under the aegis of the Commonweath **Immigration** Planning Council.

* This study is concerned with establishing the costs and benefits of **immigration** under existing Australian conditions.

* Like the cost benefit analysis, this survey is being carried out in association with the **Immigration** Planning Council.

* In conclusion I would remind the House, that as previously announced and for reasons then given, the Government has decided on an **immigration** programme of 140,000 for 1971-72.

* Even in the short term however, a smaller **immigration** programme is not going to be some kind of universal panacea.

* Most certainly, also, the decision to set a smaller **immigration** programme this year was not, and is not, intended by the Government as a convenient substitute for action by others in their particular fields of responsibility.

* In determining the **immigration** programme for 1971-72, the Government has acted with the courage of responsibility.

* Firstly, he gave the wrong figures for **immigration** for last year.

* Secondly, he confused the figures for net and gross **immigration**.

* Thirdly, he included the refugee intake figures among the **immigration** intake figures.

* I said that he had got the **immigration** figures wrong.

* He tried to say that the net political gain figures were the **immigration** figures.

* Mr HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)- In relation to the matter which the honourable member for St George raised and to which I responded, may we take it as a sort of ditto' comment in my explanation of a Press statement released by the Minister of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 1 1 September, taking the very same line that the honourable member for St George took.

* One of the alternatives to the present oath was not considered satisfactory in its present form by the citizenship sub-committee of the **Immigration** Advisory Council which I asked to look particularly at this matter.

* This impression, I am glad to say, is fast disappearing since you became Minister for **Immigration**, and for this we thank and congratulate you.

* The administration of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has been totally ill equipped to deal with the great addition in the number of people who have been applying for services and help from the Department of Labor and **Immigration** because it is a Department which had been geared to a full employment situation and which has suddenly found itself having to deal with the situation of quite massive unemployment.

* In addition to that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has put additional administrative responsibilities on the Department in the administration of the income maintenance scheme and in the administration of vague and far reaching retaining proposals and of other matters which have greatly increased the workload on the Department, leading to a general breakdown in administration at the grass roots level of the Department and to a great deal of hardship and inconvenience to many thousands of individuals throughout Australia.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said: 
But more recently- in December 1974- the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said: 
That shows the changes in attitude and the lack of understanding of the present Government in relation to these matters.

* That is a situation that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has in fact brought about.

* We have seen further examples of difficulties arising between the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden).

* It pointed out that many unemployed people have been passed by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to charity agencies.

* Only recently was that freeze lifted in relation to the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* He should have stood the Prime Minister up over that matter because of the workload that it placed on the people in the field from the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1977: 
I believe that those objectives are laudable and should be supported by the Australian community.

* The spokesman on **immigration** for the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass),  made a number of criticisms.

* Whilst I generally take the view that he does try to conduct debates on the matter of **immigration** and ethnic affairs in a relatively bipartisan manner, I felt that some of his criticisms were nit picking- if I can describe them as suchand really did not get to the substance of the Bill.

* The amendment put forward by the Opposition then states that the Bill ought to be redrafted in order to elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has made a number of statements both in this Parliament and outside it.

* We have seen quite plainly that actions of the Minister for **Immigration** and actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  have aroused in a number of countries expectations which it is most unlikely will be fulfilled.

* Honourable members are aware that hundreds of applications a day have been made in the Philippines as a result of the visits made there by the Prime Minister and the Minister for **Immigration**.

* In his speech the Minister for **Immigration** read out from a table figures indicating increased numbers of people who have come to Australia from other countries.

* If the Minister has forgotten when there was a debate in the Parliament on those matters concerned with **immigration** his memory is even more defective than I would have believed it to be.

* It would have been far better if the Minister had been content to be a more silent Minister of **Immigration** and not arouse expectations which he, or the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  at any rate, certainly would not want to see fulfilled and would not be able to fulfil without introducing changes which I doubt that the Leader of the House would be willing to see introduced.

* by leave - I table a progress report by the **Immigration** Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers from Australia.

* The **Immigration** Advisory Council will be making its final report after these researches into the causes of settler departures have been completed.

* My Department, the Department of **Immigration** - which I like to think of as the Department of **Immigration**, Citizenship and Settlement - is already taking action on the progress report.

* I call the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The honourable member for Maribymong has over recent times changed the approach of the Opposition in relation to its **immigration** policy.

* He suggests that we should- I think I am using his words- cut **immigration** to the bone but in doing so we should continue the family reunion and refugee categories.

* He talked about a suggestion that the Government is in favour of a highly increased rate of **immigration**.

* He will know that under the Labor Party Government, in 1975-76, **immigration** declined to an all time low of 52,000 people- the lowest since 1947.

* It demonstrated this at the earliest opportunity by the re-establishment of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The present Government reintroduced the Department of **Immigration** and expanded it to include ethnic affairs,, and subsequently has added other services to that Department- settlement services, telephone interpreter services, adult education services, et cetera.

* Through the ethnic affairs branch of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, which as I have already mentioned this Government set up, we have brought together departments concerned with services to migrants.

* Since I became Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs I have had regular consultations with the appropriate State Ministers not only in respect of intakes but also in terms of services provided to migrants.

* While I am on that point, I point out to the honourable member for Maribymong, the spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs for the Opposition, that in all instances all State Premierswhether they be on my side of politics or on the honourable member's side- have supported a continued active **immigration** program.

* I conclude by stating one fact which should never be forgotten: Under the Labor Administration we saw a halving of the **immigration** rate and a doubling of the migrant unemployment rate.

* We were pleased to be told by the Department of **Immigration** that, subject to three provisos, it was not opposed to the concept of external review of administrative discretions under its legislation.

* The present Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  sometimes waxes indignant about an illegal immigrant; but his words are always in terms of disobedience to the Act, without any regard to any mitigating circumstances that may be involved.

* The level of acting duty prevailing in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs results from the need to retain vacant positions in Canberra and State Branches into which officers returning from service overseas can be absorbed at their substantive classifications.

* Reducing establishments overseas and in Australia and the structural rearrangements which have taken place affecting **Immigration** functions and staffing over recent years, have also been contributing factors.

* There was no mention of the public division between himself and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  on this question.

* None other than the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I wonder what the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** thought about this exposure of the results of his own deliberate policy.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** argued that, if only wage indexation were introduced, inflation would be well on the way to being controlled.

* Suddenly the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** lost all his evangelical fervour for indexation.

* And there, like the Duke of Plaza Toro, leading his troops from behind, was the brave Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* This result can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It could be said of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, like  Sir Christopher  Wren, 'si monumentum requiris, circumspice'.

* But after the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and other Ministers hurl abuse across the Pacific at the United States, what interest has the United States Administration in keeping the access to that market for beef that we once had?

* If that story is confirmed, as I believe it most certainly will be, it is a disgraceful use of the Government's **immigration** power and its visa power to give the Prime Minister an apparent trade victory as a result of that particular venture.

* Those are the figures of the Department pf Labor and **Immigration**.

* It was only the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** who, in January of this year, said that the clothing, textile and footwear industries had no place in Australia.

* I repeat that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** said they have no place in Australia.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Child and Adult Migrant Education Programs- From 1970-71 until 1973-74 both the Child and Adult Migrant Education Programs were administered by the former Department of **Immigration** with the Department of Education (Education and Science until the end of 1972) providing consultative advisory and servicing functions.

* All funds were appropriated by the Department of **Immigration**.

* Full responsibility both for the Child and Adult Migrant Education Programs was transferred to the Department of Education from the Department of **Immigration** on 12 June 1974.

* As from 20 December 1977 the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs assumed responsibility for the Adult Migrant Education Program.

* Mr MacKELLAR (Warringah-Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs)- I wish to make a personal explanation.

* The main reasons for the increases in population were the economic and **immigration** policies started by the Chifley Government.

* The activities of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction and the Department of **Immigration** saw Australia's early post-war development off to a good start.

* We are looking to increasing our population by sustained large-scale **immigration**.

* I join in opposing the views put by members of the Opposition regarding our **immigration** policy.

* I cannot accept the view that, because we have high unemployment in Australia, we should curtail our **immigration** program.

* I submit that what we want in Australia is a medium **immigration** policy, a policy which will allow the re-uniting of families with a greater spread than is applicable at present.

* I hope that, in the ensuing three years, our Government will have a good, hard look at **immigration** on the basis of a wider family re-union.

* I make no comment other than to say this: An analysis of **immigration** statistics shows that there is presently an increasing number of non-white people coming to Australia as compared with the situation 10 or 12 years ago.

* Surely white Rhodesians who have exactly the same type of living oppressions in their homeland as other refugees do, are entitled to be considered for **immigration** to Australia.

* I make that point because at present there is very great concern amongst the Australian people about our **immigration** policies.

* I say this: Turn on the taps of **immigration** at a moderate rate so that we can have family re-union and so that we can have skilled workers and some unskilled workers.

* The Wilson report on **immigration** has been under way for almost eight years, yet no Government has seen fit seriously to consider that report.

* What a curious ambiguity there is in our **immigration** policy when we can allow people in- admittedly they are refugees- without great attention to the procedures they have undergone to get here, yet we refuse to allow into our country a blind girl from England.

* I shall leave the matter of **immigration** at that point.

* I want to reply to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who, I am sad to say, is not with us at the moment; I doubt whether he was with us before.

* I know the feeling of country people as a result of the provisions of this Income Tax 
The Minister for **Immigration** affords himself an enormous task in trying to go out and defend the Government's policies and attitudes towards the rural areas of Australia.

* Of course no government can claim - nor can the Minister for **Immigration**, the honourable member for Riverina claim - that this has been a result of Labor policy.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  ignored the requirements of this legislation when he decided to proceed with an enlarged **immigration** program for this financial year.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his weekly broadcast on Sunday 7 November said: 
My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is not a member of the economic committee of Cabinet, has pleaded that money is involved and that therefore the Government, 6 months after it was installed in office, cannot make a commitment to growth centres.

* and (2) The 'total cost' to Australia for each migrant involves expenditure extending beyond the annual budget ofthe Department of **Immigration**, and because of its complexity, no authoritative estimate of the account has been made.

* However, the direct costs of the **immigration** programme over the past 25 years,' during which time some 2.6 million settlers have come to Australia, average out at about $285 a head.

* in fact, an important purpose of the cost-benefit analysis of **immigration** for which I have arranged, on the recommendation of the **Immigration** Planning Council 
Melbourne.

* Our normal population growth is 1.9 per cent- 1.1 per cent being natural growth and 0.8 per cent representing **immigration** growth.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 19 September 1978: 
As  Chairman  of the Council I am gratified that I shall be able to draw on the wide range of experience embodied in its membership.

* I shall be asking APIC to proceed with preparation of a Green Paper on population and **immigration** policies.

* Taking account of the problems of comparing statistical series and the different time periods, it is apparent that the high levels of **immigration** into Canada during the past 3 years have not had a significant effect on the level of unemployment On the other hand, Australia has sharply reduced **immigration** during a period of rapidly increasing unemployment.

* Canada has sought to achieve a consistent approach to population growth and to **immigration**.

* The question of consistency in **immigration** programs is a most important matter for us all to consider.

* There is also the great question of creating new job opportunities in the emerging post- industrial society, though there is evidence that **immigration** itself helps to create jobs and to generate economic development.

* He was Minister for **Immigration** and Minister for Information in the years 1943 to 1949 and later  Deputy  Leader and then Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party over a period spanning some 16 years.

* As a former Minister for **Immigration** I have a particular memory of Arthur Calwell.

* His advice to me as Minister for **Immigration** was at all times helpful and in Australia's best interests I want to record my unqualified respect for this man who in both a personal and professional capacity was one of the great parliamentarians of this country.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
When this debate began I had considerable sympathy for the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  because he would not be the first Minister who, acting for another Minister, has picked up a Bill with whose contents he was not fully au fait.

* But as I say, everybody makes mistakes, and I think that If the Minister for **Immigration** had admitted on this occasion that he had made a mistake we all would have thought more of him.

* Even the Minister for **Immigration** would not pretend that he has any influence in this matter.

* In offering friendly, fatherly advice to the Minister for **Immigration** I say that, if he would recognise, firstly that he made a mistake when he introduced the Bill and, secondly, that the formation of a trust fund is the common way of ensuring that moneys are used for the purpose for which they are intended, we all would think more of him.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that the New South Wales State Government is experiencing great difficulty in maintaining adult migrant education services?

* As **immigration** is a Federal responsibility, is it not also a Federal responsibility to provide adequate finance so that migrants may be encouraged to learn English quickly?

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  had announced that he felt that unemployment was going to grow to massive proportions.

* In fact, on seasonally adjusted figures, the number of unemployed is now 134,000- the highest it ever reached in the period when I was Treasurer of the McMahon Government, in 1972, and the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was saying: 'Beware!

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, as he now is, and the present Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, were saying: 'We will get an unemployment figure of a quarter of a million.'

* On the admission of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Overseas Trade know- in fact, any member of the Labor Party or the Labor Government who knows B from a bull's foot knows- that unemployment in Australia will increase.

* The silence of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments.

* As announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on 21 August in the Budget Speech, the Government has decided to introduce charges to recover certain administrative costs currently incurred by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The proposed charges are: 
In Europe and North America it is usual to charge for a wide array of **immigration** and consular services.

* At present the Minister is empowered to appoint only officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, Customs officers and members of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Police Forces as authorised officers.

* These appointments will be made only in those situations where Australia is not represented in the particular overseas country or where officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs are not employed at overseas posts.

* Amounts expended on fares and travelling allowance at overseas posts where **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is represented, and the cost of travel of officers and their families both from and to Australia and inter post are: 
-The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has misled the Australian public and his own Cabinet colleagues over the Government's declared policy of a net target of 70,000 settlers this year.

* On 7 June the Minister stated that for 1977-78 'a gross intake of around 77,000 is expected to yield a net **immigration** of about 70,000'.

* The Minister has manipulated the figures for the last year to create the illusion that net **immigration** was 70,000 persons when in fact it fell well below this level.

* By doing this the Minister has been able to manipulate the figures to create the illusion that he was not increasing the **immigration** intake.

* In fact the Government has increased its net **immigration** target by over 25 per cent at a time of still increasing unemployment.

* By including in the net **immigration** figures people already in Australia who were granted a change of status, the Minister seems to be saying that last year some 10,000 to 15,000 visitors were permitted to become permanent residents.

* Such action would make a mockery of the Government's selected **immigration** program.

* On 7 June the Minister condemned the use of visitor entry to circumvent the **immigration** program and claimed to be tightening up on such activity.

* If this new policy is as successful as the one that the Government followed last year we can expect our net **immigration** intake to be around 85,000 persons, which is a significant increase on the stated target of 70,000 new settlers as permanent Australian residents.

* By the year 2000 we may even have only 17 million or 18 million people, depending on where and when our falling birth rate stabilises and on the net gain from **immigration** in the coming two decades.

* In his second reading speech, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said: 
I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to say what he will do if he is successful in this operation which is aimed at barge operators out of Darwin.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the right honourable member's question: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: 
Resettlement will be a gradual and voluntary process.

* A resettlement committee comprising officers of the Departments of **Immigration**, External Territories and Labour, will oversight the arrangements.

* This would bring Christmas Island into line with 
and (2) The screening of migrants from Britain has been the subject of representations to the British Government from time to time since the commencement of post-war **immigration**.

* I am not one of those who believes that **immigration** is the cause of unemployment in Australia.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs: 
I wish to inform the House that the Minister for **Immigration**,  Dr Forbes,  is leaving Australia tonight for official discussions on **immigration** in Europe and North America.

* During his absence the 
Minister for Civil Aviation,  Senator Cotton,  is acting as Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Acting Minister for **Immigration** will be represented in this House by the Minister for Labour and National Service,  Mr Lynch.

* I challenge the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to defend the cuts to translation and interpreter services- not to me but to the ethnic communities in our country.

* It is now concentrating on **immigration** and consular work relating to Lebanese who have applied to come to Australia.

* With the easing of civil unrest in Lebanon, normal **immigration** procedures have now replaced the special concessional arrangements under which some 10,700 Lebanese came to Australia in 1976-77.

* As I said, normal **immigration** procedures have now replaced those special concessional arrangements.

* Section 62 of the Migration Act, which comes within the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, requires that a parent should not remove a child from Australia where there is an order of an Australian court entitling the other parent to access to or custody of that child; in other words, irresepctive of the fact that the passport may not be an Australian passport.

* I believe that this House would have the view that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has acted with every propriety and with good sense in respect of this matter.

* He said he supported that concept but then he, and particularly his colleague the honourable member for Barker, launched a personal attack on the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for not having done something to remove  Mr Stonehouse  from Australia.

* But then he criticises the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for not having taken action to remove  Mr 
Stonehouse from Australia when such action can be based only on the premise that  Mr Stonehouse  has committed some offence.

* As we have seen over the years, there are 2 ways of administering the **immigration** laws.

* I am sure that had the honourable member for Warringah or the honourable member for Barker sought information concerning this matter in a sincere and genuine manner or for a sincere and genuine purpose that information would have been forthcoming privately from the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* They sought to come into this Parliament to try to score some fairly cheap political points, in my view, about the conduct of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** in respect of what is a sensational matter.

* Unfortunately this morning the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** was forced to make a public disclosure that  Mr Stonehouse  will be required to remove himself within 3 days or suffer the consequences of his having been expelled or having resigned from the House of Commons.

* He launched a vicious, personal attack on the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I think that the Minister's actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the **immigration** laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the rights of members of Parliament of the British Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity.

* and (2) Table 12, page 52 in the Budget document Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure for year ending 30th June 1971, provides the expenditure recorded against appropriations under the control of the Department of **Immigration** for 1969-70 and the estimated requirements for 1970-71.

* The amounts shown in Table 12 represent the expenditure by the Department of **Immigration** under Division 332 for maintaining its various overseas offices.

* Additional costs for **immigration** purposes are incurred under appropriations controlled by other departments.

* The functional summary on page 104 of the abovementioned Budget document provides the information sought as to the staff on the establishment of the Department of **Immigration** in its overseas offices.

* I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle in relation to this and as such I have instructed the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council to include a chapter on refugees in its Green Paper.

* Has the Minister for **Immigration** read a report in today's Press of the refusal by his Department to grant citizenship to Greek born Nick Karajas of Victoria?

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971, I present the annual report on migrant education for the year ended 30 June 1973.

* They will take no notice of the requests of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  or the Prime Minister to show caution and restraint and not to put in exaggerated wage claims in excess of the capacity of the community to pay.

* I wish to raise a matter which I would have raised yesterday in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** had time permitted.

* The ex: planation of this item of expenditure in the Department's explanation of these estimates records unequivocally the Department's high regard for the National Safety Council and acknowledges: 
In 1973-74 the grant by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to the National Safety Council was $100,000.

* It would seem appropriate to say to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** now, in case we are confronted with a fait accompli and find job advertisements in the newspapers setting out details of the bureaucracy, that he may not be consulted in any substantive way about the Bill when it eventually comes into the form of a national safety and rehabilitation scheme.

* It seems to me that the Government would do well to examine its own estimates for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to find ways of transferring funds to the National Safety Council in the short term.

* I suggest that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** give serious thought to transferring part of the $3m allocated for trade union training to industrial safety, because often it is the unionists who need to be made aware of the need for industrial safety.

* I am very pleased that the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  the spokesman for the Opposition on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, has once again brought the plight of Lebanese people to the attention of the House.

* Keep in mind that any **immigration** program, and particularly any program in relation to refugee or quasi-refugee resettlement, must take into account the full global situation.

* **Immigration** officials as well as some of the Foreign Affairs personnel.

* It deals with the question of inequalities, particularly as they relate to **immigration**.

* If one is to speak about inequalities in the Australian society, the Australian **immigration** policy is one area where one should look to find that we are not as egalitarian as we would like to think we are.

* Under the fourth category of the new **immigration** policy announced on May 7 by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, citizens of New Zealand, and Commonwealth and Irish citizens resident in New Zealand, are generally exempt from the requirement to seek prior authority to enter Australia while citizens from other countries have to go through lengthy procedures.

* They all reflect that race and a sense of class is demonstrable within Australia, especially in relation to our **immigration** policies.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 

 - Mr Speaker, you come to the Chair in unique circumstances.

* He not only intimidated the former  Speaker,  he also took unto himself the role of answering for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron).

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to apologise to the Chair.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to apologise to the Chair.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to apologise to the Chair.

* He answered for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It is addressed to me and it reads: 
Not only did the Prime Minister abuse, intimidate, destroy and answer for the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, but he also interfered in the duties of the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly).

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  shakes his head.

* Before the suspension of the sitting I was making the point to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs that the question of skilled labour needs far greater research in Australia than has already been undertaken.

* He said that it seemed that the Green Paper was taken up with **immigration** and perhaps submerged the total question of population.

* If the figure given in the Green Paper relating to the fertility rate is correct and there is no gain at all in **immigration** we will have a very low population by the year 2000 compared with what we may have anticipated 10 years ago.

* On the question of any stepping up of the **immigration** program on the basis of family reunions this will necessarily mean that because most migrant families live in Melbourne or Sydney there will be an increase in the population in those 2 cities.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 October 1979: 
I address my question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Mrs Chan advised that she applied to the Australian **immigration** authorities in Sydney for a further six months extension visa on 25 July 1978.

* She has informed me that she sent her Hong Kong identity card to the Sydney **Immigration** Office on 3 August 1978, addressed to a Miss Sacharczuk.

* However, I honestly believe that they have the sympathy of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who is carefully considering their case at present.

* There are two people in the **Immigration** office who have got to be paid and someone in Canberra'.

* I have implicit faith and I believe every other member of the Opposition has implicit faith in the integrity and honesty of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I do not have the same faith in the staff of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in Sydney.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
To give effect to the first Committee function, namely program by program examination, the Committee commenced examining about a dozen areas for further inquiry on 6 and 7 July 1976.

* The other involves that Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Health, **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and Overseas Trade.

* 1 ) Did the Minister receive advice from the former Minister for **Immigration** that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of **Immigration** to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant welfare, information, education and the issue of passports.

* If so, has the Minister been advised by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** no longer intends to open in Parramatta an office specialising in migrant affairs.

* It has a surprisingly large ambit of authority under the Broadcasting and Television Act going well beyond that directly related to ethnic radio and television and, most surprisingly of all, is administered not by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications but rather by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Under the Act the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs controls the Special Broadcasting Service in a way which is in flagrant conflict with any notion of independence for that Service.

* To have this Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  exercising such authority is as reassuring as having Bluebeard for a babysitter or holding a promissory note from Alfred Zion.

* That is the very thing about which ethnic people complain and which the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  denies- the two SEBAC and NEBAC are regarded as being virtually and completely out of touch with ethnic communities; 
That is the nub of the problem.

* Unlike the Australian Broadcasting Commission it is directly under the control and has to respond to the behest and to deflect to the whims of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* As I said, it is not a very reassuring accommodation to be in the hands of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I know that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** has taken the suggestion aboard but I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will turn his attention to this possibility and that his Department will take the opportunity to use this wool store, which is lying empty, to try to provide worthwhile employment opportunity and training for many of the young people who, because they have no trade, will have to drift into Redfern or elsewhere in Sydney away from their own environment.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 13 September 1979: 
-The estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs represent a very significant expenditure on a very large proportion of our population.

* I raise this matter because I want to refer to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  the reported remarks of  Mr Justice  Gibbs in the High Court to the effect that amnesty should have been granted to this gentleman, an Italian journalist whose deportation the Minister has ordered.

* Prior to the amalgamation of the former Department of **Immigration** with the former Department of Labour the services of an **immigration** officer were regularly available in Geelong on, I think, five half-days a week.

* There is a lot of work in the Geelong area for an officer of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and I hope the Minister will consider restoring that service to the migrant community of that area.

* There is another matter I ought to raise while we are dealing with the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Because of the present **immigration** restrictions there are large numbers of migrants who have raised **immigration** queries relating directly to members of their families who may or may not, in the final analysis, qualify for entry to Australia.

* It would appear that an extension of our **immigration** program is to take place.

* I believe that any relaxation in our **immigration** policy should be along these lines.

* As a result of the timely action taken by the Minister for **Immigration** a service is now rendered to migrants who are experiencing difficulties of communication in matters of urgency.

* In the light of this action by the Minister for **Immigration**, will the PostmasterGeneral give consideration to having the telephone number of the service placed in the telephone directory with a similar status to emergency calls which are made by dialling 000 free of charge?

* The honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  referred to the **immigration** portfolio and the **Immigration** Act.

* Having been the Acting Minister for **Immigration** for 5 weeks, I can assure the honourable member that the Minister does not always follow the advice of officials.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 November 1978.

* The disarray was in due course brought under control when we saw the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  - the former shadow Minister for **Immigration** - leading for the Opposition.

* He proposes as the greatest diversion in Australia since the Snowy River project a joint select committee to look into the operation of the **immigration** programme.

* If in fact this Liberal-Country Party Government has any problems with inflation they are only meagre compared with the problems which obviously are faced by the Labor Party - and the personalities in that Party which clash - on **immigration** policy.

* For example, in commenting on the gratuitous intervention of the British Race Relations Board and the gratuitous advice we go from them on the matter of **immigration** the right honourable member for Melbourne said this: 
The British political parties, both Conservative and Labour, have made a hell of a mess of **immigration** and now they appear to want to pass it on to us.

* In commenting in this House on **immigration** policy, in conjunction, in fact, with his Leader, the honourable member for Grayndler went further.

* He went on to say: 
But I maintain that Australia's **immigration** policy should bc based on the principle laid down by successive governments since Federation, that we need to maintain a homogeneous population.

* On  Mr Fraser's  weekly radio and television programme he said that  Mr Daly  had every right to decide that the misinterpretation of his attitude to Labor's **immigration** programme had gone too far.

* Mr Fraser  said that he was baffled by  Mr Whitlam's  moving an amendment to  Mr Daly's  motion seeking the right to speak, the amendment being that the Minister for **Immigration** should also have the right to speak.

* His  gratuitous advice on **immigration** to the Prime Minister of Singapore is fairly well known.

* I am referring to  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, who sent to the Prime Minister of Singapore a telegram which referred to close and most effective ties between Singapore, South Australia and the Australian nation as a whole in trade, culture and lastly **immigration**.

* He rejected claims that his statement would breach ALP **immigration** policy.

* Mr Dunstan  said: 
1 will now quote, as I have been doing - this time from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition made last Sunday in which he reiterated Labor's policy on **immigration**.

* The last 2 points are as follows: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 February 1978: 
I congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the magnificent job he has done since assuming office.

* He and the Government have done four main things: Firstly, they have restored the **immigration** program which was cut off at the roots by the Australian Labor Party Government.

* I have had many cases in which people have come to me in circumstances where approval was given a few years ago and then it was arbitrarily cut out overnight because the former Government got into economic trouble and decided that the way to overcome that trouble was to cut out the previous **immigration** program.

* The second thing the Minister did was to institute a thorough and sensible population and **immigration** inquiry.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and the Federal Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  provided additional teachers.

* It is time that the people realised that the Australian Labor Party stands for the abolition of censorship, the recognition of Scientology, the breakdown of the standard of our **immigration** programme, the importation of unemployment, because of the stated views of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to tariffs and the revaluation of the Australian dollar and because the Labor Party is pushing for shorter working hours without any regard for increased productivity.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The Government's policy, that is, the policy of the Liberal and Country Parties, on **immigration** has not been changed in substance since March 1966 when the then Minister for **Immigration** announced what our policy was - not static, because we are constantly looking at the problem of migration to see whether there should be any liberalisation.

* Since the postwar **immigration** scheme started nearly 4 million migrants have come to live in Australia.

* 1 believe that every country which has embarked upon an **immigration** program has had this experience.

* Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Armitage)I call the Minister for **Immigration**.

* In this debate on the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, I direct attention, as I did last 
Thursday week, 23 September, to the inadequacy of the Government's efforts to process applications by or for Lebanese refugees to come to Australia.

* It reveals a failure by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  to come clean with the many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Lebanese residents in Australia who are trying to assist their relatives overseas, most of whom have suffered enormous emotional and material hardship and loss.

* In a statement to the House on 1 April, following the closing of our Embassy in Beirut, the Minister pointed out that there were Australian missions in Athens, Nicosia, Tel Aviv, Ankara and Cairo and that special arrangements were being made to post an **immigration** officer in Damascus.

* In support of his claim that Australia had done more than any other country to assist Lebanese wishing to migrate, the Minister cited, among other things, the presence in Damascus of the **immigration** officer he had referred to in his ministerial statement on 1 April.

* On 2 1 May the Minister issued a statement announcing that Australian residents can now sponsor the **immigration** of their parents even if the parents are not dependent on them and are outside the acceptable occupational categories.

* In the discussion earlier today of a matter of public importance, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  gave some figures in respect of the various facets of services relating to and for migrants.

* Before I argue the case, or appear to be knocking **immigration**, let me assert the areas in which I am in favour of accepting migrants.

* **Immigration**: Expenditure on Advertising (Question No.

* 1412) 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
There are no tribunals operating within the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs nor under legislation administered by it.

* May I take this opportunity to commend the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  for the action which he took on behalf of  Mrs Gable  and her 2 sons.

* I will not go into detail but, as a result of representations made by the Minister,  Mrs Gable  and her 2 sons have now been naturalised and an unfortunate incident in the Department of **Immigration** has been cleared up.

* I informed the Minister for **Immigration** about this letter and he said that it was really the concern of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen),  to whom I gave a copy of the letter because I hoped that the responsible department would take some action in the matter.

* It reads: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The Federal Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has the responsibility for determining the eligibility of people for residence in Australia, including a child whose admission is sought by Australian residents for the purpose of adoption in Australia, or an immigrant child being adopted overseas.

* On arrival in Australia, children admitted for the purpose of adoption become 'immigrant' children in Australia within the meaning of the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children Act) 1946-73.

* Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social Security under the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory child welfare authorities excepting the power of delegation.

* The Federal Minister for Social Security will, of course, retain overall responsibility for the **Immigration** (Guardianship of Children) Act and the actions taken by the delegates under that Act.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The position in regard to the migration target, or the level of migration, for each year is exactly the same as it was when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for **Immigration**.

* The whole of the associated problems of determining the target are examined by the Commonwealth **Immigration** Planning Council.

* As I was saying, the level of migration is a matter for recommendation by the **Immigration** Planning Council.

* At present the **Immigration** Planning Council is considering all of the factors to be taken into account in determining the level of the intake for next year.

* This matter will also be dealt with by the **Immigration** Planning Council.

* I hope that the Prime Minister will approve of that Department at its most senior level joining the **Immigration** Planning Council so that the needs of decentralisation will be considered particularly by the Government in the migration program.

* This means that in future the **Immigration** Planning Council will have a representative at the most senior level, I repeat, from the Department of Urban and Regional Development.

* In other words, those in a position to know the consequences of this legislation in a good deal of detail object to its being put through at this point in the way in which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has intended.

* In this sense I think it is worth noting that the Sweeney report is misleading because at one point  His  Honour says: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I am glad that the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  advised us that he supports the Bill because I listened to him patiently for 20 minutes and frankly I found him talking about things other than matters that are contained in the Bill.

* The honourable member's views on **immigration** and matters of this nature are very well known.

* He said that the Australian Government's **immigration** policy is well known.

* It seems to me that when the question of **immigration** is mentioned not only the honourable member for Boothby but also a number of other honourable members on the other side of the House seem to be very condescending in their attitude towards the whole question.

* Those honourable members seem to forget that Australian history is one of **immigration** and that the honourable member for Boothby is a descendant of immigrants, as 1 am and as is every other member who sits in this House.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  is well aware of the matter about which I speak because I wrote to him about it in the middle of last year.

* However, when the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the honourable Clyde Cameron, introduced this measure it was meant to provide jobs for unemployed people.

* I want to take this opportunity to thank the previous Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, on the marvellous way in which he operated this RED scheme.

* As I stated at the beginning of my speech - 
This year's Budget is further testimony to the Commonwealth Government's support for **immigration**, for migrants and for the development of a socially cohesive and culturally diverse Australian community.

* At no time in Australia's history has there been such a wide range of achievements in **immigration** and ethnic affairs as there has since the beginning of 1976.

* Following an extensive review of **immigration** policies in the context of Australia's population, new **immigration** policies and population objectives were announced on 7 June last year.

* We have an active **immigration** policy with denned objectives over rolling three-year periods; we have relaxed family reunion entry categories in a responsible way; we have introduced new opportunities for independent applicants to be considered for migration under a systematic selection system known as NUMAS, which is based on the collective experience of settlement in this country over many years.

* We in the Government believe that a continuing **immigration** program is a crucial element in policies and programs for the advancement of Australia.

* We believe also that we must link the **immigration** intake with effective post-arrival settlement programs so that the process of **immigration** is one that is satisfying and productive to migrants themselves and to the Australian community.

* This is essential expenditure to ensure that adequate information is available to decision-makers in the Australian community for resource allocation, for **immigration** planning and for use by those who have to plan and carry through services to the community as a whole and to elements within the community.

* More than 20 years ago when Australia was going through a difficult period of unemployment and economic problems, there was a clamour from some people that **immigration** should be cut or that it should stop completely.

* Fortunately, good sense prevailed and a majority of Australians, not only supporters of the Government of the day but also leaders of the trade union movement, recognised the importance of **immigration** to Australia's development and economic well-being.

* Planned **immigration**, based on the need to maintain a balanced program, both ethnically and industrially, continued to lead us into the prosperous 1960s.

* Attitudes, especially of some sections within the Opposition in more recent times, are reminiscent of those calls for reduced **immigration** in 1956 and 1957.

* Our **immigration** and ethnic affairs policies have been stated in this Parliament.

* The ALP's **immigration** policy is a very imprecise one but it does say that family reunion must have a high priority.

* In a statement on a new approach to **immigration** and community relations, the Opposition spokesman said that family reunion is a concept that includes: 
There is no clarification in recent Press releases from the Opposition spokesman on **Immigration**.

* It is a pity that in a debate on **immigration** the Opposition should have descended to the sort of level where the Opposition hovers around waiting for innocuous pieces of paper, in some instances early Departmental drafts, to become available as the basis for unintelligible Press releases.

* Mr Deputy Speaker, I have a feeling of pride in referring to the achievements in the **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs portfolio since the beginning of 1976.

* This year's Budget gives additional funds and resources to enable a continuation of a positive approach to **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Our **immigration** and ethnic affairs policies and programs are based on Australia's interests, compassion for our fellow men and women and playing a responsible role in the international arena.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-In debating the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs I want to raise one or two specific matters.

* Applications were made to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for a grant-in-aid but these were rejected.

* Some 12 months to two years ago a decision was made to relocate offices of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to the Geelong area.

* In Geelong an officer is working in the **immigration** area with the Department of Social Security.

* They were provided up until the time **immigration** became part of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* The Commonwealth Employment Service is not able to carry the additional work load of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I put it to him that these services were provided in the past and I think the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has a responsibility to provide those services in the future.

* **Immigration** Procedures at Tullamarine Airport  (Question No.

* 2408) 
-I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs concerning illegal **immigration** to Northern Australia.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** pointed out yesterday, the survey in September of last year revealed that 64 per cent of those who responded were unemployed, compared with 54 per cent in 1 963.

* As the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** pointed out yesterday, those who dishonestly obtain these benefits deserve to be penalised severely for doing so.

* 1 per cent natural growth and 0.8 per cent **immigration**.

* Let me examine the Green Paper on **immigration** and population which is before us.

* I point out to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and to the House that if a comparison were made between that report and the reports and the studies that have been made in Canada, United States, the United Kingdom and other parts of the world it would be found to be in fact an extremely poor report.

* Using the Borrie yardstick we can expect a population of approximately 16 million people by the end of the century if we rely only on natural growth and exclude **immigration**.

* The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate **immigration** policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new migrants.

* Heavy **immigration** programs impose immediate burdens on resource allocation and can cause gross distortions in our economy.

* That 1.1 per cent would include both natural growth and **immigration**.

* The natural growth would need to be supplemented by a modest **immigration** program.

* We know also that there has been strong population growth in Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, in South Australia, even without a major **immigration** program these trends will continue.

* Firstly, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  insulted and defied the  Speaker.

* We have seen, when it came to a choice of disciplining the wild and insubordinate Minister for Labor and **Immigration** or deserting the  Speaker  that he chose the latter.

* We have already started an in depth survey of population, including **immigration** and emigration, rates of births and deaths and similar matters.

* I refer to prices, government policy and **immigration**.

* It is interesting to note that between 1961 and 1966 the population of Australia increased by 1 million - 487,000 coming from **immigration** - while the rural population of Australia declined by 65,000.

* The cost of **immigration** for the year 1968-69 was $61,835,007; in 1969-70 it was $67,925,000.

* That includes the cost of the administration of the Department of **Immigration** and the bringing of migrants to Australia, lt has been suggested that the cost of each migrant is about $10,000.

* I am not one who opposes **immigration**; I support **immigration**.

* This view was supported eventually by my colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and former Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development.

* The Minister wrote a letter to me in which in part he said: 
Private students are the responsibility of the Department of **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
There is no field within which there is a greater necessity for an explanation of where this country is heading more than **immigration**.

* There is confusion as to just what is meant by Australia's current **immigration** policy and whether there is still an opportunity for persons in Asia to come to Australia and on what terms and conditions.

* For example, the application of the easy visa system, as referred to in the statement of the  Minister  for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  suggests that a visitor will not be able to alter his status while in Australia.

* The first thing I want to say about present **immigration** policy is that it is regrettable that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  suffers from verbal diarrhoea.

* In confusing the understanding of the Australian electorate and people abroad on the Australian **immigration** policy he performs equally admirably.

* I believe that neither the Minister for **Immigration** nor the AttorneyGeneral should continue such pursuits in their vendetta against those who they say are breaching Australian laws.

* Finally, I believe that at this stage there is a real necessity for Australia to embark on a concerted **immigration** program.

* I am delighted that the Minister for **Immigration** has seen fit to make this statement.

* I believe that its practical approach to **immigration**, by curbing the number of immigrants to Australia to 110,000, was long overdue and should have been adopted by the previous Government.

* I agree with the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that it is inadequate.

* There could be no more fundamental matter for debate at this point of time than the question of Australia's **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in bringing the Green Paper before this Parliament pointed to the fact that this was the first green paper dealing with Australia's **immigration** policies and Australia's population ever to be tabled in this 
Parliament.

* I take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs on the initiative and drive that he has shown, aided and supported by the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council, in preparing this Green Paper and bringing it before this Parliament and the people of Australia for discussion and debate.

* I have said before and I shall say again, that this Government is fortunate to have a Minister of the calibre of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* As one who has ventured to express some views on Australia's **immigration** policies may I be heard to say on this occasion that this Minister is one who does give one a hearing and is responsive and sympathetic to the submissions one puts before him.

* It is incredible when one considers that with a population of 13.9 million in one of the richest countries in the world, that this is the very first time that there has been a Green Paper on this matter placed before this Parliament for the Parliament as a whole to debate, giving it an opportunity to consider Australia's future population growth and in particular **immigration** policies.

* As the Minister said when he introduced the Green Paper into the Parliament, the previous **immigration** policy which has operated in this country for nearly 30 years was responsible for bringing to Australia over 3.3 million new settlers who, together with their children born in Australia subsequent to their arrival, have been responsible for about half of Australia's postwar growth from 7.4 million to 13.9 million people.

* If we were to take note of some of the comments which have emanated from the other side of the House we would have no **immigration** policy at all.

* There are some who are frankly so petrified at the question of **immigration**, thinking in some way it is an electoral issue which could put them out of Parliament, that they are not prepared to face up to the realities and the challenge that is before Australia at present.

* I commend the Minister and the members of APIC for coming out and telling the Australian people quite bluntly that we can expect a considerable increase in **immigration** to Australiamuch larger than many other people would have believed.

* The honourable speakers who have preceded me have pointed to the fact that increased **immigration** leading to increased population will lead to increased demand and increased productivity.

* Far from endangering the jobs of Australians I believe it will make available to Australians more jobs than they would have if there were in fact a negative **immigration** growth in this country.

* Unless there is an increase in the birth rate we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and in the absence of an **immigration** gain Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of **immigration**.

* Like the Minister I draw to the attention of the House that unless we have a proper **immigration** policy not only will we have reached the situation of zero population growth but we will find that this country in the 1980s- that is barely 3 to 4 years off- will have a very severe manpower shortage.

* Might I just say in passing that I welcome the indication that we might now be talking in terms of **immigration** in net terms rather than raw figures.

* The editorial, in its concluding sentence, made this comment: 
The point that the Minister makes, the point that the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council makes- and on APIC were the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,  Mr Hawke,  and the Secretary of the ACTU,  Mr Souter-  is that if we do not get these people into Australia we will not be going anywhere.

* The establishment of a small, permanent team of **immigration** officers in Bangkok is one proposal I put forward.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**,  Mr Clyde  Cameron, my namesake here, would quickly talk to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  or any other relevant Minister and say: 'You are not going to do this because obviously there is a great degree of reluctance to accept it on the part of the people involved in this industry'.

* -My question, which is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, arises from the continuing losses of life and property from earthquakes in the Friuli region of Italy.

* It is true that the reduced **immigration** programme for this year will provide an opportunity, as I said in my statement on the size of the programme, to extend and develop our welfare and education activities amongst migrants.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
1 ) What were the nationalities of applicants approved for **immigration** under the entrepreneur policy up to 30 June 1978.

* Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that upwards of 15 000, perhaps even 20 000, applications for citizenship are in hand and are being processed very slowly in Melbourne, holding up the right to citizenship, and therefore the right of the people involved to get on the electoral roll?

* Mr Fraser,  labour and **immigration** spokesman, said he generally supported the plan by the Labour Minisster,  Mr Cameron.

* If anything it would have more old age pensioners who had originated overseas because America's main period of **immigration** was in the early part of the 20th century and many of the people who migrated to the United States then have now become eligible for the old age pension.

* I refer to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  his verbose and boring Press releases and his striving to make something newsworthy every day.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: 
-The matter I raise today is one of growing concern to many Australians.

* The answer I received reflected an appreciation by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that there is a problem and that procedures were changing to cope with that problem.

* Once a foot is placed on Australian soil it is difficult to have it removed even when there are others who seek to enter this country through the authorised door of normal **immigration** procedure and should have a higher priority.

* In all areas of defence, security, health, **immigration**, foreign affairs and drug trafficking we should be alert to the dangers and change accordingly.

* In many cases people who came into Papua New Guinea were treated as illegal immigrants and consequently were held under the relevant sections of the **Immigration** Act until their residential status could be determined.

* Many people who are prevented from bringing to Australia close friends or relatives because of the job aspects of our **immigration** policy complain bitterly about our open-handed policy towards these Vietnamese refugees.

* The refugees on the base could be processed by officers of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for acceptance or repatriation, depending on the circumstances of each individual.

* It is nice to be able to chalk up a plus when we are beating our heads against all the reams of red tape whether it involve **immigration**, passports or whatever.

* I should like to address my remarks to the Department of Labor and **Immigration** but specifically to one relatively small aspect of **immigration** into Australia.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is aware of the question I am going to raise and basically it is this.

* This concerns **immigration**.

* Suddenly, about one year ago, it was decided by the Australian Government in its wisdom- or lack of wisdom- that these people could not be considered for **immigration** into Australia unless they had a passport which was stamped showing Australia as one of the countries for which it was valid.

* I approached the previous Minister for **Immigration** and the present Minister for the purpose of obtaining a concession and discussing the cases on their merits.

* Do we accept the proposition of the police forces of those totalitarian regimes that these people are suitable for **immigration** into Australia or do we use other methods?

* I congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on a published Press report in connection with the antiquated thoughts of an old judge at the Old Bailey in England last Friday.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  is the Minister who not so many months ago was saying that wages do not increase prices.

* -In Australia **immigration** must surely form a very important part of any Government's policy.

* Our **immigration** intake over the past few years has diminished considerably.

* I have no doubt whatever that when this situation is arrested the present Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  who is doing an excellent job, and the Government will ensure that increased migration takes place.

* During this discussion much has been said about the Green Paper entitled  **Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population  which was tabled in the House recently by the Minister.

* Secondly, the estimated net **immigration** rate in the current financial year is little more than 30 000 people, compared with only 21 000 people in 1975-76.

* It all adds up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from **immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in previous statements in this House has made it clear that there is a numerical decline in what has historically been the mainstay of the labour force, the male worker; and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a stagnant society.

* Australia's real population building took place in the post-war period when we embarked on a major **immigration** program.

* My question is directed to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I am not aware of any specific undertaking given by the Government or by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** to State governments or to anybody else in respect of this matter.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I think it is useful to say at this stage that the Australian Government welcomes any liberalisation in Soviet policies in relation to these people.

* We have been in constant discussion with the Australian- Jewish welfare societies and the Federal Catholic **Immigration** Committee.

* The proposed expenditure this year is an average yearly expenditure by the Department of **Immigration**.

* I would like to confirm the remarks made by the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  about the officers of the **Immigration** Department overseas.

* As a member of a parliamentary delegation last year I was able to see at first hand the methods of our **immigration** officers in Turkey, Yugoslavia, Great Britain, Ireland, Greece and some other countries.

* If I could be critical of our past **immigration** policy it would be in this sector.

* In the past 3 years **immigration** programmes reached considerably higher levels than previously.

* Public debate on a matter as important as **immigration** is essential.

* The Government has clearly stated its policy so that the community can formulate informed views on future **immigration**.

* Australia has critics of our **immigration** policy.

* In the main the criticism is that **immigration** inhibits economic growth, that our programmes are based merely on getting numbers and ignoring quality.

* Some critics regard **immigration** as the cause of pollution, the urban sprawl, inflation and so on.

* At times critics give the impression that they believe that **immigration** is the root cause of everything wrong in Australia and that Australia alone suffers from these problems.

* Our **immigration** programme takes into account changes in the employment situation, availability of housing and accommodation, balance of the sexes, worker dependent patterns, and factors bearing on the successful integration of migrant groups.

* I support the estimates of the Department of **Immigration**.

* Hundreds of the hopeless can be seen milling around the **immigration** office where our **immigration** officers do their best to cope with the mess that this Government has created.

* It is necessary to refer to one thing that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  did last year which was not necessarily wrong in principle but which was disastrous in the effect that it has had in our handling of the Lebanese refugee situation.

* In the second place there were hundreds of people already in Nicosia and other 
The result of what the Minister did was a flood of Lebanese into Cyprus and other places which aggravated in particular the situation in Cyprus and made the task of overworked **immigration** officers even more difficult.

* There are now arrangements for people to go back to the **immigration** office in Nicosia as late as 3 April this year.

* It is absolutely necessary that even now the Government reinforce the staff of the **immigration** post at Nicosia.

* When I was at Nicosia just a fortnight or so ago, literally hundreds of people were nulling around the **immigration** office, standing there like cattle, and being processed at a rate that was deplorable.

* The Government set up **immigration** committees to deal with category A applicants alone.

* In the course of his speech a few moments ago the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said that I would not allow a debate on the subject of **immigration**.

* If the honourable member for Wannon wishes to discuss **immigration**, I invite him to get up and put up or shut up.

* The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has said that there will be full opportunity for any member of this Parliament, especially myself and the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock),  to speak about **immigration** in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  Her  Majesty the Queen.

* It is not the same as a specific debate on **immigration** policy.

* Mr GRASSBY (Riverina - Minister for **Immigration**) -  Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a personal explanation.

* The honourable member for Wannon - a former Minister - suggested and stated during the course of his remarks that I had made no statement on **immigration** to this Parliament.

* What the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has stated is correct.

* When he sought to make a statement in this House on **immigration** on a previous occasion leave was denied to him to do so and he had no alternative but to present a paper without comment.

* The arrangement was made by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  with the Secretary of the organisation.

* The Secretary of that organisation in a letter sent to his office bearers in other places said: 
**IMMIGRATION** AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS POLICY 
**Immigration** is an essential instrument of Australia's population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed.

* The Liberal and National Country Parties are therefore committed to the active encouragement of **immigration** at a level and of a pattern which best suits Australia's national interests.

* To fully overcome these needs and at the same time offer the maximum opportunity for ethnic groups to continue to contribute to Australian society in general, the Liberal and National Country Parties will establish a separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* A Liberal and National Country Party government will constantly re-appraise its **immigration** policies to ensure that they continue to contribute to the steady improvement of the standard of living for all people in Australia.

* **Immigration** Programme 
The Liberal and National Country Parties believe that an active **immigration** programme is essential to the growth of Australia's population.

* **Immigration** is vital if Australia is to enhance the living standards of all its citizens and if it is to successfully take up .

* The humanitarian and compassionate aspects of **immigration** will not be subjugated to short-term changes in economic conditions.

* The Liberal/National Country Parties will establish a separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to ensure the efficient administration of **immigration** policy through a single department instead of the present fragmented approach.

* A separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will also ensure the coordination of **immigration** policy with other major national objectives and provide a single focal point through which matters of interest to migrants can be given prompt and effective attention.

* A Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will give explicit effect to Liberal/National Country Party objectives of taking **immigration** out of the narrow ' manpower policies ' which at present dominate it.

* Special arrangements within the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will be made by a Liberal/ National Country Party government to provide both a reference point for individual migrants problems and assist the many migrant welfare organisations.

* These committees will help to ensure a more coordinated **immigration** policy between the Federal government instrumentalities, the States and the ethnic communities.

* Within the new Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, a Liberal/National Country Party government will establish a refugee mechanism to cater for emergency situations instead of making ad hoc responses as at present.

* To ensure that immigrant movements are geared towards overall demographic and population considerations, a Liberal/National Country Party government will establish demographic studies administered by the Depart.ment of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to provide continuous information on long term population trends.

* In furtherance of its **immigration** policy, a Liberal/ National Country Party government will also- 
One matter of concern, of course, is the adequacy of teachers who can teach in migrant languages.

* This has been a matter of discussion recently between the Minister for Education and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The question of **immigration** is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* We are, of course, receiving an increasing number of **immigration** applications from people in Rhodesia.

* Were passengers arriving at Tullamarine Airport in BOAC 747, Flight 812, on 5 September 1973, delayed nearly two hours in clearing customs and **immigration**.

* Are there separate **immigration** desks for returning Australian citizens so that they are not unnecessarily delayed by the more extended procedure necessary for migrants; if not, why not.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister  for  **Immigration**, upon notice;    (I.)

* I rang the Commonwealth Police and Customs officials, who act for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** when someone is leaving the country.

* Lance Johnston; and that they were meeting the **immigration** authorities early the next morning.

* At about 3 o'clock on the Monday afternoon I heard that Georgi Ermolenko had gone from the **immigration** office at 11 a.m. to the Parmelia Hotel, to which all the Russians had returned.

* Lance Johnston and  Mr Badger  had been prevented by police, **immigration** officials and other departmental officials from actually seeing Ermolenko or indeed any of the other Russians.

* I rang a representative of the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Perth,  Mr Henne,  to ask that they assure me that they personally had talked privately with Ermolenko and had received an assurance that he had changed his mind and wished to return to Russia.

* Let us not forget that when Ermolenko emerged from the **immigration** office in St George's Terrace, Perth, he gave an interview to the Press.

* First was the **immigration** program.

* Let us assume a continuation of current **immigration** policies resulting in a net contribution to the labour force of approximately 20,000 a year; a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates by about 1981, remembering that our female participation rates are still significantly below those in a number of industrialised countries; and that young people participate in education and the labour force at present rates.

* Australian people and that an ageing population growing at zero growth is not in the best interests of this country's contribution to the prosperity of its own people and the South East Asian region and that, therefore, policies be adopted concerning **immigration** and the Australian family, which remedy the present trend of events having regard to the development, employment and social justice obligations of Government.

* It relates to **immigration** and to the social justice circumstances of **immigration** programs developed in Australia.

* We are concerned now with **immigration** because we are concerned with the economic defence of Australia.

* So, for a whole host of social and hard economic reasons, I ask the Government to be bold in relation to **immigration**, and to be bold with a sense of justice.

* Because of **immigration** there was a slight boost in the second half of last year.

* I ask the Government to consider what it might do in respect of the deposit gap for young marrieds who have the care of children, at the same time as it looks at a new and bold **immigration** policy that might be implemented with a sense of justice.

* **Immigration** was his last portfolio in government.

* I am very pleased, on behalf of all who served in the Department of **Immigration** over the years and who serve now, to add to the tributes which have been paid to him today in the House of Representatives.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
There can be no doubt that one of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the framing and administration of **immigration** policy.

* **Immigration** and its effects on a nation is not a short term phenomenon.

* The results of **immigration** policies are irreversible.

* Because the effects of changing migration policies and administration are so far reaching, the Opposition believes that the Government owes to the people of Australia, both recent arrivals and those who could claim to be native sons, a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons behind the recent changes wrought in the **immigration** field.

* The possible effects of this inquiry's recommendations in relation to future **immigration** policies and administration are obviously enormous.

* The Committee was due to report to the Government this June, according to the previous Minister for **Immigration**, when he spoke about it last year.

* The Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass),  the Minister for Urban and Regional Development  (Mr Uren)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  are still battling for control of the population planning section of the Department.

* The interesting aspect of this struggle is that both the Minister for the Environment and Conservation and the Minister for Urban and Regional Development are avowed supporters of zero population growth, whilst the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is responsible for manpower planning.

* Let us look at another field of uncertainty and unease - the relationship between foreign affairs policy and **immigration** policy.

* It is a fact of life that **immigration** policies do have some bearing on these relationships.

* However, the split up of the former Department of **Immigration** still leaves unclear the question of the issue of migrant visas.

* Again, the results of the Government's emphasis on sponsored **immigration** and family reunion are unclear.

* No one would claim that the former Department of **Immigration** and its officers were perfect, but also no one would deny that the officers of the Department exhibited experience, expertise and dedication of an extremely high order.

* To support this view I have no less an authority than the former shadow Minister for **Immigration**, now the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is sitting at the table.

* I should like to quote what he said about the Department of **Immigration** on 7 May 1968, in his former position as shadow Minister for **Immigration**.

* This Commonwealth is extremely lucky to have a department like the Department of **Immigration**.

* No other department in the Commonwealth acts so efficiently or with such great credit to its country as the Department of **Immigration** does.

* They were the words of the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Why was the **Immigration** Advisory Council or the Good Neighbour Council not consulted about the decision?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
My own personal view is that Australia should drastically cut her **immigration** programme.

* We should question whether it is in the interest of Australia to continue our assisted **immigration** programme in view of the pressure of **immigration** on the States, on education, on health and our hospitals, on local government, on spiralling land and housing costs; in fact on all aspects of government.

* We have to ponder not only our population increase but also our increased **immigration** intake.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What payments have been made by the Department of **Immigration** to (a) Qantas; (b) other airlines and (c) shipping companies for the transport of migrants to Australia in each of the last five years.

* The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Rehabilitation (SIDCOR) comprises representative from the Departments of the Special Minister of State (chair), Education, Health, Labor and **Immigration**, Repatriation and Compensation, Social Security and the Treasury, and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and the Social Welfare Commission.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 3 1 May 1978: 
I do.

* During the speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  he said that I yawned while the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  was speaking, with the inference that I was bored at what the honourable member was saying.

* For somebody who promised the Australian primary producers money at an interest rate of 3 per cent, I object to the fact that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  once again has accused me of voting against my own proposal.

* Department of Labor and **Immigration** Department of Social Security Department of Foreign Affairs Department of Education Department of Police and Customs Department of the Media Department of Housing and Construction Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet 
The principal functions of the Interdepartmental Committee are to exchange information and to promote coordination and co-operation between Departments involved in aspects of **immigration** or migrant settlement, rather than to examine and recommend on substantive matters of policy.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Let me recapitulate.

* 1 - an **immigration** cutback of 3,000 to be effective at Christmas time; No.

* 9,050 were distributed, free of charge, through the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to Good Neighbour Councils and ethnic groups throughout Australia.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* It is obvious that there are great divisions within the Opposition over its **immigration** policy.

* Only recently the honourable member for Grayndler was sacked by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  from the position- of shadow Minister for **Immigration** but tonight he carried the torch for his leader.

* During the very short time at my disposal I want to speak in support of **immigration**.

* As I said during the debate on the Budget it has become fashionable, for some reason, to knock **immigration**.

* I am yet to be convinced that **immigration** contributes either to unemployment or to inflation.

* I sought 3 tables of statistics relating to 6 selected countries and to the subjects of the annual rate of increase of the consumer price index, the percentage of the work force unemployed and the net long term **immigration** as a percentage of mid-year population for each *&gt;f those countries.

* I could have selected any other 5 countries to make a comparison with Australia but I chose Canada and New Zealand as countries of **immigration**, Japan and the United Kingdom as countries of intense manufacturing industry and as countries which have not increased their population through migration, and I chose the United States of America both as  a  highly intensive manufacturing country and as a country which still attracts migrants in reasonable numbers.

* Surely those statistics indicate that we should be looking elsewhere than to **immigration** to find the reasons for the present rate of inflation and increasing unemployment.

* I believe that our **immigration** programme has been made the scapegoat for changing economic conditions which have affected countries other than Australia.

* In fact, statistics show that Australia, which has the highest percentage of migration intake, has managed to combat the problems of inflation and unemployment far better than countries which have either no **immigration** intake or a lesser one than Australia.

* But in my opinion **immigration** is not to blame.

* Opposition when he addressed the Perth Press Club only last Sunday on the subject of Labor's approach to **immigration**.

* Referring to the impact which migrants who have come to Australia under the Government's **immigration** policy have, he said: 
One of the biggest problems we have in Australia is our low productivity.

* I suggest that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  should investigate ways and means of providing benefits for our communities in return for the moneys paid out in unemployment benefit.

* Last night the Minister for Housing  (Mr Riordan),  in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Labour and **Immigration** in this House, attempted to respond to certain instances that I had mentioned.

* It is clear that the Minister does not take it seriously and is attempting to brush it aside and assert that the Department of Labour and **Immigration** has done all that is possible in the matter.

* I add that I appreciate that the Minister has not been in this position for very long, nor has the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland).

* I have an acknowledgement letter from  Mr Robert  Lawrence, the private secretary of the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, dated 7 May in answer to my representation of 28 April.

* I turn now to the infamous case of the application for **immigration** by some Italian people.

* There has been aU this talk about receiving 65 000 representations in relation to **immigration** pOliCy, but who changed the **immigration** policy?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 12 September 1978: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
The honourable member has posed to me a particularly big challenge.

* The honourable member has raised a serious question, because in the early days of the **immigration** program there was no doubt that there was a considerable imbalance in the sexes, which led to a great deal of sterile competition.

* For those discussions I was accompanied by the Permanent Head of the Department of **Immigration**,  Mr R.  E. Armstrong, who was indeed one of the founders of that Department.

* There is allegation our citizens have offended against **immigration** laws.

* The **Immigration** Planning Council, the **Immigration** Advisory Council and the other organs of advice which were established, incidentally, by the previous Government and which we have continued have continued to provide that advice.

* I understand that the **Immigration** Planning Council met today.

* What used to happen - this has happened and is on file - is that one brother would apply for **immigration**.

* I have personally vetted 62 applications for citizenship, have had them re-investigated and have granted citizenship since I became the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Suggestions have also been made that Australia has built up bad relations in our neighbourhood because of its **immigration** policy.

* A few years ago a leader of Singapore said: 
Australia's **immigration** policy has done irreparable harm not only to Australia, but to all European nations with interests in Asia.

* The Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who will speak later in this debate, has the responsibility of advising me, as the Minister for **Immigration**, on Australia's absorptive capacity in relation to the work force.

* The honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  spoke of the proud record of the United Kingdom-Australia relationship, but the present **immigration** policy of the United Kingdom towards Australia certainly is not a proud one.

* I would like to read to the House an extract from the **immigration** policy of the United Kingdom presented in the House of Commons on 25th January by the Secretary of State for the Home Department,  Mr Robert  Carr, which is reported at page 654 of the House of Commons Hansard.

* After talking about the interdependence of Commonwealth countries, the United Kingdom, the colonies and **immigration** policy he said: 
With this in mind, it is all the more important to reduce the **immigration** of citizens of other countries - both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth - to the inescapable minimum.

* We have heard of this preferment or alleged entitlement given by the United Kingdom to Australian citizens, but in fact under the present **immigration** laws of the United Kingdom Australian citizens do not have any automatic entitlement to United Kingdom citizenship.

* On the economics side, the decision of a lot more people to remain in Australia after having arrived here means a great saving to this country in terms  Of  the cost of **immigration**, housing and assimilation.

* I mentioned earlier a statement on **immigration** policy by the Secretary of State for the Home Department in the United Kingdom speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government.

* In New Zealand, which would be a sister country to Australia in terms of **immigration** policy, renunciation is not required.

* The other matter I would like to mention is the citizenship ceremony, the emphasis on it in the Bill and the importance that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has been giving to it.

* The provisions of this legislation were outlined fully in a preliminary statement by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  to the House on 23rd April 1970 and have been further detailed in his second reading speech.

* Successive **Immigration** Conventions and the **Immigration** Advisory Council have confirmed that the great barrier to assimilation and integration is the failure of the migrant to speak English and expressed the view that there is a real need for the teaching of the English language at every level for assimilation, social and economic reasons.

* It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for migrants in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and **immigration** authorities.

* Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war **immigration** schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme.

* Since that time, great changes have taken place in the **immigration** programme, such as increased numbers, differing types of migrants and methods of transport.

* Surely, with this problem being stressed by **immigration** authorities everywhere, including citizenship conventions, advisory councils and other interested parties, a scheme might well have been expected at a much earlier date.

* After all, industry has benefited a lot from the **immigration** programme.

* Comparatively recently two excellent surveys were conducted, one by the Department of **Immigration** in Canberra and the other by the New South Wales Department of Education, on the question of migrant education and the education of migrant children.

* For instance, the report of the survey conducted by the New South Wales Department of Education in 1968-69 stated: 
The report of the survey conducted by the Department of **Immigration** in Canberra stated: 
Then there is the problem of the adults.

* Members of an Opposition parliamentary committee on **immigration** recently visited a centre where the intensive scheme was in progress.

* It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of **immigration**.

* **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Has his attention been drawn to public statements in the press which asserted that he rejected the advice of the Department of **Immigration** in applying these barriers; if so, is the position as stated?

* Was the Cabinet decision also a rejection of the advice of the Department of **Immigration**?

* In the publication setting out Labor's policy **immigration** takes up little space, something less than 2 inches, and like most of the Labor Party policies is capable of being interpreted in a number of ways.

* On one line it says that the basis of Labor's policy on **immigration** will include: 
These 2 statements are self-contradictory.

* This is the reason why we get statements from the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  claiming that the present **immigration** policy would continue under a Labor government and such contradictory statements from the South Australian Labor Premier,  Mr Dunstan,  that a Labor government would virtually open the floodgates.

* Our **immigration** policy is not based on any strange idea that, because our colour is white, we are superior to someone whose colour is black or something else.

* There are 2 basic reasons why Australia's **immigration** policy should continue in its present form.

* Dr KLUGMAN (Prospect)- by leaveEarlier tonight the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  made the point that if the Australian Labor Party's proposals were implemented we would not get any good Nordic or Aryan immigrants which he prefers.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: 
The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  gave an historical account of the matter which revealed the consistent policies of the previous Government to downgrade the Australian national identity, to downgrade Australian nationalism.

* Reflect on the changes that the Minister for **Immigration** has brought about.

* There is a thread, a pattern running through all those actions, all those steps or lack of steps by the previous Government, compared with what the present Government has been doing and all the initiatives coming from the Prime Minister and all the initiatives coming from the Minister for **Immigration**, about which 1 have spoken.

* Also the shadow Minister for **immigration** and community relations, the honourable member for Melbourne, committed Labor to a dramatic increase in education spending.

* The first agreement with Malta was made 22 years ago by the first Minister lor **Immigration**, who was a Minister in a Labor Government, the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell).

* The Minister knows that the **immigration** ministers asked that urgent attention be given to the question of rights^' of Australian workers or their dependants if they lived in another State or went to" live in another country.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  clearly does not care.

* It is a simple matter of fact that people from the United Kingdom and Eire have formed the backbone of the **immigration** program for many years.

* One of the first actions I took as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was the first visit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words- have an antipathy towards the British migrants but that in fact we welcomed them.

* It was the Labor Government which disbanded the Department of **Immigration** and incorporated it in die Department of Labour and **Immigration**.

* It was the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government which set up the new Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* We have had special Indo-Chinese refugees projects, special arrangements for the migration of Lebanese, amnesty for illegal migrants, the abolition of re-entry visas, the establishment of an ethnic affairs branch, the establishment of the national accreditation authority for interpreters and translators, migrant resource centres, the establishment of the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council, the Australian Ethnic Affairs Council and the establishment of a permanent broadcasting authority which provides a special broadcasting service to cater for the rights of ethnic radio.

* I could mention the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the war service homes people and quite a few others.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
What has been the venue and date of each meeting of the **Immigration** Advisory Council since 1st January 1964.

* Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** inform the House why the unemployment figures compiled by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** from its Commonwealth Employment Service records are substantially in excess of those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics through its quarterly labour force survey?

* -I address a question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I refer to the necessary investigations which must be carried out by the Department of **Immigration** before people can be granted approval to migrate to Australia.

* Will the Minister give consideration to increasing the staff of the Department of **Immigration** in Fiji to enable the more expeditious processing of these applications for permanent entry to Australia?

* They provide a far more difficult **immigration** problem than normal migrants.

* In particular, **immigration** on a large scale seems to bring about a more unsettled state of affairs.

* How they got through the screening of our **immigration** officials in other lands is beyond me.

* Our **immigration** officials must be incompetent.

* The introductory remarks which were made this afternoon by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and his colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  made it clear to me and I am sure to most thinking Australians that if both of these gentlemen were entrusted with  thz  responsibility of writing an **immigration** policy for the Liberal Party, each of them would produce a vastly different policy.

* Without seeking to embarrass the honourable member for Kooyong, I must say 1 am sure that his genuine ideas on non-discrimination would be much closer to the Australian Labor Party's policy than would the attitude and policies of the present Liberal Party spokesman on **immigration**, the honourable member for Wannon.

* He is 200 years out of date, because the Minister for **Immigration** has reminded me that there were more than 12 different nationalities in the First Fleet that came to Australia.

* I say quite clearly to the Opposition that it is entirely dishonest to claim that this Government has failed to inform the House adequately of changes in **immigration** policy.

* The Labor Party's policy on **immigration** has received the attention of honourable members opposite ever since we came into office.

* I will say quite clearly today that the recent announcements by the Prime Minister in the Philippines and the recent decisions by the Minister for Labour and the Minister for **Immigration** to initiate conferences with the Australian Council of Trade Unions in order to discuss the qualifications of overseas tradesmen are progressive steps on which those Ministers should be congratulated, and it should not be suggested that suddenly, overnight, new Labor Party policies have been devised.

* Over a period of some years before our success in 1972, **immigration** in Australia had fallen into a state where successive Ministers for **Immigration** applied their own policies.

* For a period of 23 years the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government had control of Australia's **immigration** program.

* The triumphant visit abroad by the Minister for **Immigration** shortly after Labor came into office, followed more recently by the Prime Minister's trip abroad, did much to elevate Australia in the eyes of the Asiatic countries close to our borders.

* This Government and the Minister for **Immigration**, in particular, are to be congratulated not only by this nation but also by every decent, fair-minded human being because at last a credible and honest image has been established for Australia, particularly in the eyes of the Asiatic section of the world in which we live.

* The effects of the **immigration** policy of the previous Government showed clearly that it did have such a policy.

* This matter was raised at Question Time this morning when the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  said that  Mr Urbanchich  was now an Australian citizen.

* The Minister for **Immigration**, who incidentally is out of his seat, may be more familiar with dictatorships than I am because he is a member of a Government which is seeking to run this House like a dictatorship.

* I suggest that the Minister is a temporary bird of passage in the **immigration** ministry.

* The Minister for Housing has a reputation for seeking headlines only surpassed by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* In addition, I propose that the matters should be examined by the Migrant Education Committee of the **Immigration** Advisory Council.

* The right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)-  formerly a senior Minister and formerly a Minister for **Immigration**, if I recall correctly, in a previous government- had no compunction at all about applying the same sorts of tests for other people.

* The **immigration** policy of the Liberal-Country Party Government was discriminatory.

* Should this situation arise any decision concerning Hishamuddin 's status would be a matter for the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Other speakers have pointed out that for 25 years **immigration** has been a major item of Commonwealth Government expenditure and that 2.6 million new settlers have been the result.

* Indeed, the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman)  and the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  pointed out that our **immigration** history is a much longer one.

* The honourable member for Deakin pointed out that the number of migrants we have received in modern times have given us a lead over the **immigration** rate that even (he United States of America achieved.

* 1 was very much impressed in the United States to see the museum of **immigration** that has been set up at the base of the Statue of Liberty.

* The Opposition believes that a proper **immigration** programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia's national and economic security, the welfare and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation.

* I compliment the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  and his Department because I believe they possess the same sort of principles and believe in a questioning of the proper role of **immigration**.

* The Minister has initiated major examinations of aspects of **immigration**.

* The staff of the Department of **Immigration** has been most helpful and understanding in any cases I have put before it.

* Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused naturalisation for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among migrants under our **immigration** plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group.

* I should like to refer to a speech made by the Minister for **Immigration** to the Metal Trades Industry Assocation in Melbourne on 30th July of this year.

* He said, amongst other things: 
It is important that Australians understand what can and what cannot reasonably be asked of the **immigration** programme.

* **Immigration**'s essential role in these areas is to supplement and reinforce other lines of action.

* I do however believe that the Department of **Immigration** is being let down in other areas of Commonwealth Government administration, or perhaps the Minister fails to convince his colleagues.

* If **immigration** is not intended as an alternative to adequate industrial and occupational training facilities, if it does not absolve us from our responsibility to train professional, skilled and other key workers, then the complete lack of forward long term Australian objectives in education and quality of education, which was highlighted in the recent debate on the estimates for the Department of Education and Science, should not exist.

* Our **immigration** officers overseas, particularly in countries sending large numbers to Australia, can and do start this process from the time the first approaches are made, wherever practicable.

* Perhaps after 25 years the Department of **Immigration** should not only be concerned with just mere money.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I refer, as the Prime Minister did, to the Structural Adjustment Board - that kind of legislation should have been before this Parliament 20 years ago - and the retraining scheme which is under the supervision of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* But the question of a release became a matter with which the Department of **Immigration** concerned itself.

* He was unable to get that release from the Department of **Immigration**, firstly, ostensibly on the basis that he could not be enrolled anywhere else.

* I wrote on 10th February to the Department of **Immigration** in Sydney, suggesting a release.

* I got that letter in June after the boy himself had received a letter not from the Department of **Immigration** but from the coaching college which he had left.

* With its whole weight the Department of **Immigration** says: 'We will not release you.

* I then sought an interview with the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  but he was overseas - we can understand that - and would not be back until July.

* It  is not the function of the **Immigration** Department to say: 'Because they will not release you we will not release you.

* It would be useless my trying to make representations to the **Immigration** Department in Sydney in the future.

* I think it is appropriate to draw to the attention of the House that the **immigration** authorities should be concerned with one thing only - that entry in proper circumstances is allowed and that at the appropriate stage the person concerned is able to leave the country.

* -Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that whilst additional funds have been made available to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology to allow the continuation of the translator and interpreter courses for 1976, following a question asked in the House by me, it is believed that funding as of next year will be on a triennial basis and that funds will be distributed through the Commission on Advanced Education, which finances the Institute on a per capita basis without earmarking funds?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The amendment ignores the substantial measures taken since the early days of post war **immigration** by this Government and by the government before it to develop a comprehensive programme of migrant education.

* It was in 1947 when at the initiative of the then Minister for **Immigration**, the now Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, agreement was reached between the Commonwealth Government and the Preparatory Commission of the International Refugee Organisation on a scheme for the admission of refugees and displaced persons from Europe that the first action was taken to formulate a migration education programme which involved at that time both the teaching of English and an appreciation of Australian life.

* In February 1960 a special committee of the Commonwealth **Immigration** Advisory Council submitted a report on the progress and assimilation of migrant children in Australia.

* The Department of **Immigration** again took the initiative in 1962 in conducting a survey of 'Abandonment from Migrant Education Classes in Victoria'.

* Firstly, let me emphasise the point that **immigration** is not totally a Commonwealth responsibility.

* Of course, in the particular context of the economic circumstances with which this nation is now dealing, these conditions provide further restraints on Government spending and support the view that **immigration** funds should not be used to finance capital works in the States.

* This major study, along with the cost benefit analysis, will provide in the future that information which we, as a Commonwealth Government, need to structure better future **immigration** programmes to our objectives in the 1970s.

* The cost benefit study of **immigration** is a long overdue attempt to provide an evaluation of the costs and benefits to Australia of **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
The city Press may not understand the situation because it has not really gone into what the wool industry is all about but the Leader of the National Country  (Mr Anthony)  does understand the position.

* This would be something like the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  racing out to address a mob of trade unionists and telling them, for instance, that the opposition of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the insertion of penal clauses in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act had collapsed because of the demonstration by those trade unionists.

* So when one reads and hears some of the comments of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  I wonder just how little he knows about such problems.

* Sometimes I wonder whether the Minister for **Immigration** has even heard of the word weevil', quite apart from having seen one or knowing what it does.

* The estimates for the Department of **Immigration** have been brought down this year in the atmosphere of a continuing national debate on migration.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* Is this new law of relativity wherein a mathematical decrease can be represented as a significant increase- the MacKellar law - 
asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is the Prime Minister the only person left in Australia who does not know that the unemployment figure is now 159,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis and including school leavers?

* Has the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** informed the Prime Minister that the Department of Labor and **Immigration** forecasts that there will be 280,000 unemployed?

* The honourable member for Bowman  Mr Keogh)  asked us to be reassured that the Australian Labor Party will maintain an **immigration** policy which will be in the best interests of Australia.

* One has only to look at other countries which have brought in trouble through **immigration**.

* I make no reflection on the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes);  he has to carry out Government policy.

* We have to look at the **immigration** policies of some of the colonial powers.

* We can be friends with these people and can give them support but we can be taken over not by war but because of our **immigration** policies.

* Our **immigration** programme has to be closed down to a great extent.

* I noticed one or two things that I thought might have been mentioned perhaps in the first place by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  when speaking on legislation concerning **immigration** in the last 2 days.

* Now, for many years, dating back to the start of **immigration** with Arthur Calwell, the Labor Party al least has had a very consistent, easily understood and quite plain **immigration** policy.

* Now we have a new Labor doctrine on **immigration**.

* I do not know whether it goes beyond the Leader's sort of private remarks made in the atmosphere of the moment, but the new Whitlam policy in regard to **immigration** is to bring to Australia the relatives of those who are here, but not to bring new members of the work force.

* Wherever this controversy may settle - and a lot of people have different views - it is quite plain that the advantage that we get immediately out of the **immigration** programme is the acquisition to the work force of skilled workers who are immediately productive.

* I do not know whether this new scheme will emerge as the new **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* It would be interesting to know because the Opposition spokesmen on **immigration**, as well as other people, over the years have pointed out that the one thing that cannot be done with an **immigration** policy is to turn it on and off suddenly for temporary reasons.

* I think that a quick reference might be made to the gulf between the former Minister for **Immigration** and the present Minister.

* In the Salemi case the Ombudsman went to great lengths to go behind a supposed ministerial discretion to pursue the administrative decisions which had been made and the advice which had been proffered to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* The intention to make such appointments was first discussed however at a meeting with State education authorities on 12 January 1970, and there is reference to my Department's intention to assess the need to extend its normal integration services, through the provision of interpreters and welfare officers to meet the requirements of the child migrant education program, in the Ministerial Statement made to Parliament on 23 April 1970 by the then Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
and (2 (a)) It is true that some appointment notices do include the words referred to in the Question.

* (2 (b)) From a survey conducted on behalf of the Department of **Immigration** in August 1971 it was found that the use of professional interpreters was extremely rare.

* (2 (d)) Interpreters from the Department of **Immigration**, the Migrant Information service of the Commonwealth Bank and the Department of Social Services are in fact, used at interviews with claimants for pension, where this service is requested.

* If the case for **immigration** is for Australia's benefit alone then as an advanced, rich country we surely stand condemned for taking only those who are well qualified to fit easily into this country.

* If the case for **immigration** is to help relieve population pressures in the countries of origin then again with our technique of selection we are taking the ones who are a minimal burden to their homeland.

* If the case for **immigration** is to provide a refuge for those who wish to leave their countries of origin because of persecution, such as is the case with those being expelled from Uganda, then again, to be consistent in our humanitarianism.

* During the years of our massive **immigration** programme we were not very selective in terms of quality as long as the immigrants were white.

* 1 deplore the dreadful racism involved, but 1 wish to discuss the effect of this non-selective white **immigration**.

* The Government would lose effective control of **immigration** if assisted migration was stopped, according to the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes).

* My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* What was the outcome of the meeting on 19th October 1972 between the Australian High Commissioner and the British Home Secretary about the administration of the British **Immigration** Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by **immigration** officers at.

* Accordingly, the Government will move to strengthen the Information Branch of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to provide a focus for co-ordination of advice.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 November 1978: 
It is a shame.

* I refer first of all to a question that was answered on 19 May by the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the  Hon.

* Today in this House a question was asked by the honourable member for Gellibrand of the Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Riordan),  representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, which was almost word for word the question asked by the honourable member for Gellibrand on 19 May of the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I want first of all to quote from Hansard of 9 September a question that was asked by  Senator Everett  of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland).

* The question read as follows 
I direct my question to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* It was the same trickery that was indulged in by the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, the  Hon.

* But what I want to do now is to quote from the document which is put out monthly by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, titled 'Monthly Review of the Employment Situation '.

* What I am extremely upset about on this occasion, as I was on 19 May when the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** gave almost the same answer to a question asked by the same honourable member, is that Parliament was not told of the unpublished lists that the Commonwealth Employment Service held.

* The document that is prepared by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** month after month makes quite clear those who claimed when registering that they were unemployed.

* Consultations between my Department, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of **Immigration** and other Commonwealth Departments involved in the training of overseas students are conducted each year through the Conference of Training Authorities.

* Consultations on the sponsored overseas student programmes are followed by a second annual conference' convened by the Department of **Immigration** on private overseas student programmes.

* Along with the miniBudget we have had mini policy statements from various Ministers including the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* Like the contribution by the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch),  the statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is another exercise in faulty logic and woolly thinking.

* Addressing the recent Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference, the Minister made the following statement: 
Yet the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs says that he will allow employers to recruit a limited number of unskilled workers.

* If there is anything that can be guaranteed to bring out into the open this racism, it would be an **immigration** program that increased the competition for already scarce jobs.

* I ask the Minister: Does he intend actively to recruit suitable persons to fill these gaps, or will the Government continue its **immigration** administration simply by taking skilled workers if, and only if, these persons offer themselves?

* It is vital that we base our **immigration** policy on the long term projections rather than the temporary day to day fluctuations.

* What is happening under this Government is that while the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is increasing the level of **immigration**, so creating a greater need for these support services, the Treasurer is hell-bent on dismantling the same services.

* But what sort of logic is it that increases the **immigration** intake and at the same time reduces the quality and quantity of the services available once these people have arrived in our country?

* We have never in the past exceeded the quota of migrants eligible under the occupational skills criteria of the **immigration** program.

* I wish to make only one last point about the Government's **immigration** program and that is to draw attention to the impression that the new Minister has given that he is intent on returning to the traditional sources of migrants for this country, in other words the United Kingdom.

* I felt personally offended by the reference of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  during his speech to 1 1 widows trained under the widows training scheme.

* I direct a question to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I wish to refer tonight to a matter relating to the Department of **Immigration**.

* I informed the office of the Minister of **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  that I would be raising this matter and I had hoped that he would have been here.

* The child was not subject to any court order in Australia but, had it been, our court order would have been nullified in deference to the **immigration** laws of another country.

* I have spoken to officers of the Department of **Immigration** and they have informed me, rightly or wrongly, that the Department has no responsibility in this matter.

* I do not know the provisions of the **immigration** law relative to this matter, but I should not think they would be so loose as to allow that situation to occur.

* If the Australian **immigration** laws have no provision which will prevent a Maltese national registering a child on his passport without the permission of his wife or the child's mother, that loophole should be closed.

* If this is how our **immigration** laws stand at the moment they contain a serious loophole which should be closed.

* In entering a debate on Australia's **immigration** policies and population it strikes me as rather odd that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  who preceded me in this debate, spent all his time talking about Aborigines.

* But I do think that the Commissioner for Community Relations,  Mr Grassby,  during his time both as Minister for **Immigration** in the first Whitlam Government and now as Commissioner for Community Relations, has devoted a good deal of time and attention to a lot of the problems which are canvassed in this Green Paper that we are discussing tonight.

* I want to talk about the human face of our **immigration** policies.

* Whilst people have commented from time to time on the way in which certain programs have administered by the Government and on certain directions that the Government is now seeking to take, basically we have been talking in largely theoretical terms about directions of **immigration** policies.

* I believe that we can get a good picture of Australian society now if we look at something that the Commissioner for Community Relations said in his first annual report last year: 
I do not like to see a word like 'etcetera' in reports like this; it is fairly sloppy-  is so poor that consideration should seriously be given to stopping or at least reducing non-English-speaking **immigration**.

* I join the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in commending the Council for its production.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 May 1978: 
Having given that background to the general exemption in paragraph (n) I should like to come to the speech of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** because in 2 points he made an error in his second reading speech.

* I can only assume from discussion between many people and officers of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** that that is not the Minister's intention because there are a large number of ports around the Australian coastBell Bay would continue to be one as are Whyalla, Gove, Weipa, Groote Eylandt, Ardrossan, and Port Lincoln, to name a few- where the company concerned generally uses its own facilities and its own labour to load or unload ships when there is not a register of waterside worker labour.

* On that basis the Opposition would oppose that extension of the amendment which has been moved by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* On advice available to me that will enable the situation to remain as it has been in ports outside Darwin, largely company ports, where it is important in a high cost situation to have an efficient use of labour as I am sure the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** would readily recognise.

* The words proposed by the Opposition would certainly achieve that 
I wish to speak on the Estimates of the Department of **Immigration** which provide this year for an expenditure of $63,079,000.

* It is interesting also to look at the dissection of the figures in regard to this Department, with particular attention to amounts of money being spent in the various fields and facets of **immigration**.

* These are 2 important aspects of the **immigration** sector and it is pleasing to see increases there.

* The figures are alarming as I think the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  would agree.

* These figures must give rise to alarm about Australia's **immigration** program.

* Our **immigration** policy must also, of course, take into account our capacity to pro vide employment.

* This is another important aspect of a successful **immigration** policy.

* This Government's policy is for an **immigration** intake in 1973-74 of 110,000 migrants.

* Of course, this program was started by the Liberal-Country Party Government and the present Minister for **Immigration** is carrying it through to its finalisiation.

* It should give us some valuable information and assistance with regard to **immigration**.

* I think that our **immigration** policy at this point of time should be stepped up.

* I hope the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  is listening because, after all, he tried to make some capital out of this also.

* The Minister for **Immigration** referred to sales to China.

* The Minister for **Immigration** is smiling.

* This raises a question so often raised by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* If it is not State quotas then why is the Minister for **Immigration** so vocal about this?

* The Minister for **Immigration** knows very little about this question.

* It is true that the Minister for **Immigration** did not say: 'The Government will give it to you', but his statements were so worded that every grower looked at them and said: 'Yes, that is what the Minister means' or 'That is what the honourable member for Riverina means.'

* This is the low rate of interest that the Minister for **Immigration** promised us.

* Mr Cameron,  the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, said to the then  Speaker, Mr Speaker  Cope: 'I don't' give a damn what you say'.

* The  Speaker  then named the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, and the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly),  knowing his duty, knowing the convention, started to move towards the despatch box to move the necessary motion for the suspension of the Minister from the service of the House.

* That special action had to be taken by this Government, of which the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** presumably is a supporter, to support 3 large multinational companies, but the Government did nothing for those Australian companies which were in equally difficult circumstances and which were placed in those circumstances as a result of the actions of this Government and this Minister.

* **Immigration**: Applications from Pacific Islanders (Question No.

* 369) 
-The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has the most peculiar habit of avoiding the topic under discussion, that is, the Australian Government's involvement in what can only amount to a contempt of court.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 14 September 1978: 
-I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Green Paper entitled  **Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population.

* I trust that when there has been adequate public debate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  might ensure that there is another debate in this place on the subject.

* It has been prepared by the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council whose membership is far ranging.

* In addition, because of the present difficult economic and employment situation in Australia, **immigration** programs have been decreased significantly to a point where the 52 748 migrants arriving in 1975-76 represented the lowest intake since 1947 .

* Australia is a country whose population is based on **immigration**.

* I think that in looking at **immigration** and population policies one must involve oneself in an examination of the unemployment question in Australia todaywhether the unemployment is long-term or whether it is short-term.

* He also makes the point in relation to **immigration** in Britain and refers to an anti-**immigration** backlash in that country.

* But looking at **immigration** policies in the future one would have to be very careful about how such policies were handled in that regard.

* The **immigration** program has brought to Australia a number of things that we would not otherwise have.

* In passing, let me add that I believe this indexation should apply to all award wages and salaries without the kind of fiddle which the Minister for Labour and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has suggested, because I believe that it will be more difficult to preserve industrial peace if we do not preserve full wage relativity.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** upon notice: 
Did the Department of Labor and **Immigration** ask the Bureau of Statistics to conduct a survey in October 1974 of persons registered as unemployed.

* If so, was this survey conducted on the basis that it was confidential to the Bureau and/or the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* I intend reading into  Hansard  tonight a letter which I directed on 30 May to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* The letter reads: 
Is the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs aware that the Honourable Franco Foschi, on behalf of the Italian Government, requested the Australian Charge d 'Affaires in Rome, or another senior officer, to call on him in order to discuss the deportation of Ignazio Salemi?

* Will he discuss this matter with his colleague the Minister for **Immigration** and point out that the most favourable place for a migrant girl to become proficient in the 
I turn now to the Australian scene to look at the nature of and growth in the population and the work force.

* It affects our population, our family policies and our **immigration** programs.

* All the figures I have quoted have been taken to the nearest thousand and are derived from the consolidated statistics of the Department of **Immigration** for  1971.

* -I rise to support the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and to congratulate the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the job he has done since taking over this portfolio since December 1975.

* **Immigration** must surely be one of the important facets of government in this country.

* These trends add up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from **immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has in statements to this House made it clear that there is a numerical decline in what has historically been the mainstay of the labour force- the male worker- and the risk that we shall become increasingly inward looking and a stagnant society.

* The appropriations for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs provide for a situation in which the intake of migrants will be rather static.

* We can see from the Budget Speech that the Government has decided not to set a specific **immigration** program for 1977-78 but to determine intake on the basis of numbers eligible through overseas selection processes.

* Provision is made for assisted passages for 16,000 people, which is approximately the same number as that provided for under the **immigration** policy last year.

* This is similar to the number which arrived in Australia under our **immigration** policy last year.

* Expenditure on the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will rise by $2.2m this year.

* It is interesting to note the employment figures in the various **immigration** offices that Australia has established throughout the world.

* Australia must keep up an active **immigration** policy immediately the economic 
Lilley, in criticising the honourable member for Melbourne, talked about the dynamics of population in other countries which are not comparable to Australia in the light of our economic and industrial set up.

* He expressed surprise that a Green Paper entitled '**Immigration** Policies and Australia's Population' should spend so much time dealing with the subject of **immigration**.

* in the Australian context, **immigration** remains the major instrument by which government can directly and significantly influence population growth.

* That, of course, makes one wonder about their validity in considering them  vis a vis  **immigration** policy.

* Australia's post Second World War **immigration** policy under Caldwell was based partly on humanitarian grounds and partly on the growth of Australian population that was needed at the time.

* There was very little in the way of social planning programs to accompany that **immigration** intake.

* It is part of some of those measures which must be considered in looking at an **immigration** policy and a population policy.

* I am sorry; I am now informed that he is the private assistant to the Victorian Minister for **Immigration**.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1978: 
There is a move to increase the number of  refugees entering Australia and details of this are due to be announced shortly in Canberra by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* At that stage the fighting was escalating in Lebanon and the **immigration** staff in Beirut was reduced.

* The honourable member has mentioned already the temporary establishment of an **immigration** office in Damascus.

* In late June advice was received from the Syrian authorities that it would not be possible to extend our **immigration** activities in Syria beyond the end of June.

* Clearly, the question of Australian diplomatic representation in Syria must be resolved on the basis of a wider range of issues rather than the need just to maintain a shortterm **immigration** operation, and that an operation to process applications from people outside Syria.

* That was the stage at which an announcement was made that a senior officer had been sent to Nicosia the previous weekend to investigate and report on the most effective way in which the Lebanese **immigration** operation could be organised.

* The Minister of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the Lebanese diplomatic representatives in Australia and the Australian-Lebanese Association have been in close contact throughout the crisis in Lebanon and many measures have been taken to assist the plight of the Lebanese who have been unable to flee Lebanon.

* The criteria for entry into Australia has been extended on compassionate grounds and additional staff added to existing **immigration** offices surrounding Lebanon and a special **immigration** office has been established in Damascus with the sole purpose of assisting the Lebanese who have fled to Syria.

* The **Immigration** Department and its officers are working under most difficult and extreme conditions and are dealing with people who have been subjected to considerable shock and stress and there is no doubt that there are some cases of hardship that are still being encountered.

* A brief reference is made to this scheme in 2 pamphlets put out by the Department of **Immigration**.

* It was a significant feature of the **immigration** policy under the previous Government, to such and extent that by the time we of the Australian Labor Party came to office in December 1972 some 25 per cent of our annual migrant intake was being lost by wastage of migrants returning to their home countries.

* Realising the need to reverse this trend and to develop a policy of post-arrival and settlement concern, several actions were taken very quickly by the labor Minister for **Immigration**,  Mr Al  Grassby.

* Among those valuable initiatives was the decision to appoint a committee of the **Immigration** Advisory Council to inquire into and report upon the extent of discrimination and exploitation of migrants, with particular emphasis on their use of community resources.

* The Committee has presented its interim report to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland).

* The decision of the Public Service Board to allow officers in Government Departments to undertake full time interpreter courses at full salary and for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** to pay allowances made under the National Employment and Training scheme to certain categories of students enrolled in these courses is a positive step forward.

* Like this gentleman in Geelong, the brother in the Lebanon is also an Australian citizen and therefore there are no problems in respect of entry or **immigration** but, unfortunately, he is crippled and unable to travel alone.

* Quite obviously she would prefer permanent residence for herself, as would her 2 brothers, both of whom would be resident in Australia, but she has been refused temporary or permanent residence by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on the ground that if she comes to Australia as a temporary resident she may seek to stay and that would constitute a future embarrassment.

* I believe that in this instance the strict interpretation of the **immigration** guidelines should not necessarily be applied.

* It is time that consistency was observed in this type of operation where the strictest interpretations of the **immigration** criteria are being applied to people who are in tragic circumstances.

* I mention first those dealing with **immigration**.

* I sent a follow-up telegram to the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 5 March 1975 after no response of any kind was forthcoming except for an acknowledgment of my letter, and that is useless.

* Under the Regional Employment Development scheme, a primary school in the suburb of Hollywood in my electorate according to my advice actually received approval from the then Minister for Labor and **Immigration** for a project.

* On 20 August I authorised the sending of a telex to the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, enclosing a copy of the telex from the line.

* On 2 1 August I went to the Prime Minister in the middle of the Budget discussions - 
We suggest a meeting with officers of your department the Department of Labor and **Immigration** and the Attorney General's Department in Sydney when convenient so that after studying the sequence of 
In view of the nature of your representations I am referring a copy of your representations to my colleagues the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Attorney-General '.

* Firstly I shall make some general points on the subject and, secondly, 1 shall deal with some of the questions that I would ask the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  arising out of the Bill and the comments he made during his second reading speech.

* I think that **immigration** too often is viewed on a statistical basis rather than on a human and sociological basis.

* The short title - **Immigration** (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the **immigration** provision in the Constitution.

* I am pleased that the Minister raised this question because 1 think it shows quite clearly that this Government should also introduce similar types of legislation dealing with **immigration** (hospitals), **immigration** (mental hospitals), **immigration** (councils) and **immigration** (all kinds of issues).

* Apparently he believes - and 1 hope he is right - that under the **immigration** provisions of the Constitution money could be fed to areas such as the States and local government where extra money is needed.

* The fact that we have increased our population bv **immigration** by a huge number of people has put terrific pressure on other areas of government and not just on education.

* The Minister for **Immigration** recently attended a summer school organised by the Institute of Political Science al which a number of people were critical of Australia's **immigration** programme.

* The point I would like to make is that **immigration** after 21 3'ears of extensive operation is coming into disrepute.

* Surely if the Minister really believes that the **immigration** programme ought to be continued, from the point of view of public relations, if from no other aspect, it should be possible to show that a certain amount of money is being given to the States and local government on the basis that it is money to reimburse them for extra costs due to the **immigration** programme.

* I hope that the Department of **Immigration** will strive to discourage State education departments from screening children with a migrant background too soon after their arrival in Australia.

* I think that he is sympathetic to the general **immigration** proposition and the problems surrounding it.I think that a danger exists these days because many people who support the views expressed by the Government and Opposition Parties in this House are starting to talk about the quality of migrants.

* I was disappointed that at the conference to which I referred earlier there were people who talked about racial equality, who opposed our so-called white Australia policy and who encouraged **immigration** on a non racial basis.

* These people are making value judgments in the same way as those who oppose the **immigration** of Chinese are making value judgments.

* In considering the subject of **immigration**, I believe that to some extent we must look at it from the point of view of the migrant.

* 1 hope that the Minister, when he is dealing with people who criticise our **immigration** policy by using statistics as many people do.

* I am pleased to say that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has agreed to the establishment of a Commonwealth Employment Service office in Echuca but so far the Department of Social Security has not agreed to establish an office there.

* **Immigration** did not even get a mention.

* I believe that **immigration** is a vital issue.

* Maybe it is the case that the Prime Minister could not keep pace with the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and his policy which changes almost daily, if not at least weekly.

* The records over a number of years show that one of the best Ministers for **Immigration** that Australia has known was the late Arthur Calwell.

* This Government should not be proud of some of the policies laid down by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I, like many of my colleagues, cannot understand why men like the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the Minister for **Immigration** can see what is going on and yet not have any influence.

* Where do the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, the honourable member for Macarthur, the Minister for **Immigration** and the Minister for Northern Development stand on this matter?

* That man has evidently been listening to the Minister for **Immigration** because I can recall him as the honourable member for Riverina saying in this House when he was in Opposition that the primary producer never got anything from the subsidy.

* I am surprised that a candidate for an electoral seat could turn around and follow the line taken by the Minister for **Immigration**.

* No doubt he will hang himself if he follows the Minister for **Immigration** on matters of this kind.

* I do not know what the honourable member may or may not have said to his growers prior to the last election but certainly many people, including the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  I believe would have made some rather strange remarks prior to the last election.

* Tonight we are talking on the question of **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* This is a very serious matter to contemplate because we can now be laying a basis for **immigration** policy that can last Australia for the next 30 years or so.

* The Labor Party is proud of the fact that the **immigration** program was one of its creations.

* I suppose that on this occasion, as has been the case on many other occasions, a tribute can be paid to the architect of Australia's **immigration** program- the late Arthur Calwell.

* I have heard this acknowledged even by Government supporters and the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is indicating that mention was made of this tonight.

* After Labor initiated this program- and a former colleague of mine, the previous member for Parkes,  Mr Leslie  Haylen went round the world in a difficult situation gathering up the ships to bring these people to Australia- we found that a unity ticket evolved on the question of **immigration**.

* The intake from **immigration** has slowed down as well.

* It was proper that the intake from **immigration** should slow down in that situation.

* For many years we had a **immigration** target of one per cent of the population.

* In 1975 our net loss in **immigration** was 8000.

* We are told in the Green Paper from the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council that in 10 years we lost 330 000 people who took up residence overseas.

* It is apparent that there is a very real relationship between the net **immigration** figure and the state of buoyancy of the Australian economy, the availability of jobs, the availability of houses and the like.

* It is interesting to look at the **immigration** intake and to see from where our migrants came.

* I believe that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, in cooperation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  should be giving much deeper thought to the need to lift from 14 per cent the intake of Asian migrants and should have regard to the need to bring people from Oceania.

* 1 would take the lower of those 2 figures if I were having a stab at the kind of **immigration** intake that we should have at present.

* I believe that the net effect of **immigration** would be beneficial to Australia in that it would have the capacity to increase consumer demand in Australia.

* Let me mention that the population trend in Australia is very serious in that we have had a decline from the stand point of both natural and **immigration** population growth.

* Our **immigration** has the effect of offsetting this declining fertility.

* I think sufficient figures are available already to indicate that if Australia is to sustain its population and if it is to provide the population expansion which is necessary from many points of view, including the point of view of defence and point of view of getting effective utilisation of our generously endowed resources, it ought to be at this stage laying the basis for an **immigration** program which will contribute to the well being of this nation, to the growth of our economy and to the prosperity of the Australian Community.

* Did the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** say, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, on 17 September 1972, that a Labor Government would adopt the 1970 submission of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations to provide within the departments an identifiable authority to officially rule, in cases of doubt, whether an officer could release a particular piece of information.

* I preface my question to the Minister for **Immigration** by asking whether there has been a reduction in bilingual broadcasting in Australia especially designed to service migrants.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is just leaving the chamber, spoke for 6 or 7 minutes and tried to justify his existence as the honourable member for Riverina.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
-Following the May election of this year the Government decided to abolish the Department of **Immigration**.

* For example, a good friend of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam), Mr Evasio  Costanzo wrote in 'La Fiamma' that Labor had killed **immigration**.

* He tried to justify the decision and to prove that the dismemberment of the Department of **Immigration** was not a process of killing Australia's **immigration** program.

* If we look at events that have occurred since we find that the **immigration** tap as it is sometimes described has been turned off.

* In October the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in a Press statement that he could not responsibly approve the entry of migrants who were likely to experience difficulty in finding and holding employment and who would be competing with Australians and migrants already here in the tight sections of the labour market.

* In abolishing the Department of **Immigration** it is clear that the Australian Labor Party, despite its earlier protests, believes that migrants should be treated as cannon fodder for industry.

* If one looks at the statement to which I referred previously, issued by the Minister for Labour and **Immigration** on 2 October, one will see that he said that it would be damaging and he would be acting contrary to the Australian Labor Party's platform if he were to bring migrants here at this time when we cannot ensure that they will find long term employment.

* The decision to turn off the tap is really a decision either to close down the **immigration** scheme altogether or it is a guise to introduce quotas.

* What will the quotas be when the **immigration** tap is turned on, if it is to be turned on by this Government, when conditions change?

* It appears that from the time the Labor Government decided to dismantle the Department of **Immigration** it could not decide which department would be responsible for citizenship.

* After a period of uncertainty, a period of ministerial wrangling, the responsibility for citizenship was left with that section of the old Department of **Immigration** which had been transferred to the Department of Labor.

* The question of the introduction of passport controls or similar controls between Australia and New Zealand has been under scrutiny for a long time, as the honourable member would know from when he was Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* There is close cooperation and consultation between New Zealand authorities and Australian authorities in both the **immigration** area and the police area.

* It was raised again at the most recent meeting of Australian Ministers concerned with **immigration**, which was also attended by the New Zealand Minister.

* I refer to **immigration**.

* put the axe into the **immigration** programme.

* Today it is fashionable to knock **immigration**, and the critics of our **immigration** policy point to the demands which the **immigration** programme makes on the economy and the additional amount of money which has to be spent on roads, schools, hospitals and sewerage systems because of the number of migrants which we as a government have brought to Australia.

* The critics of Australia's **immigration** policy base most of their criticism on the demand for capital which they claim is aggravated by our intake of migrants.

* My question is also addressed to the Minister for **Immigration** and refers to a statement in the Budget Speech last week which said: 
The Government has decided not to set a specific **immigration** program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of eligible applicants.

* In fact, the same type of provision could be included in future agreements made with countries concerning **immigration**.

* This important fact is in no small way a tribute to my colleague, the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  who was Australia's first Minister for **Immigration**.

* Throughout the years since its commencement our **immigration** programme has had the support of both sides of this Parliament.

* I am sure that all honourable members look forward to a continuation of this general agreement in future **immigration** policies.

* May I point out that probably the first occasion on which this Government implemented our policy was in the field of **immigration**?

* Our policy has been quoted this evening during this debate by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  the shadow Minister for **Immigration**.

* Our **immigration** policy has been administered in the past in a way that has met with the approval of all political parties.

* My colleague, the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen),  questioned the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on the effectiveness of the present **immigration** policy.

* Unfortunately, even though it was very early in the day, during question time, the Prime Minister missed the point of the question and answered that he did not realise that any members of Parliament thought that the **immigration** policy was bad.

* It is to the credit of the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  that he has recently ordered a searching inquiry of Australia's future migration needs.

* I would like to support the proposition put so capably this evening by the honourable member for Grayndler on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that the most suitable type of inquiry to investigate the future **immigration** needs of our nation is, without a doubt, a joint committee of both Houses of this Parliament.

* At this Convention I heard a number of very interesting matters associated with **immigration** discussed.

* We have listened for some time to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  hoping that he might show some real concern and show some indication of wanting to prepare policies that would relieve the acute unemployment that is present in Australia.

* Was the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** unaware that there was a tight monetary policy?

* Does the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** suggest that he was not responsible for these particular policies?

* The only difference is that now under a Labor Government with the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** the predictions that he made will come true.

* But is anyone, the Prime Minister or the Deputy Prime Minister, going to take any notice of this Minister for Labor and **Immigration**?

* The Minister wants to leave behind him a proud record as Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and I give him credit for having that wish.

* In these work categories, a minimum of 3 years' practical experience together with appropriate academic qualifications is required for **immigration** purposes.

* I am sure the honourable gentleman will appreciate that provision for repatriation has been a feature of Australia's post-war **immigration** programme and that provision for repatriation is included in a number of bi-lateral agreements which have been signed since the early 1950s.

* Although undoubtedly this item is a financial debit to Australia's **immigration** programme, I say quite deliberately that it is a debit generated from a sense of compassion and a realisation that, of the hundreds of thousands of people who come to Australia year in and year out, there will be some who for very good reasons will be quite able to conform to conditions here.

* This is a very small expense indeed when measured against the tremendous advantages to Australia of the **immigration** programme since its inception.

* and (2) At the date of the honourable member's question, copies of the Progress Report on Departures, by the **Immigration** Advisory Council's Committee on Social Patterns, were being produced to allow me to table it in the House.

* Department of **Immigration**: Creation off Positions (Question No.

* 113) 
Can the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** inform the House why the unemployment figures compiled by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** from its Commonwealth Employment Service records are substantially in excess of those produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics through its quarterly labour force survey?

* -Before discussing in detail those aspects of the Budget which relate to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, I wish to refer to the Galbally report for the purpose of reminding honourable members of some of the points in it relating to the expenditure in which the Government is indulging in this area.

* But at the same time under the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, there is a reduction of $600,000 for this purpose.

* In sum total then, the outlays for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs amounted to $65m last year and $73.4m this year- an increase of $8.4m, which is not much above the inflation rate.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affair, upon notice: 
That the behaviour of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** during today 's proceedings- 
That the behaviour of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** during the course of today's proceedings be referred to the Privileges Committee.

* The right honourable member is obviously referring to a speech entitled 'Official Secrecy, Open Government and Making Democracy Democratic' delivered by the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration** on 1 7 September 1 972.

* The regulation of this type of equipment, except when operating on the roads, is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* I understand that Question 1 784 put to the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** is identical and he will no doubt reply in full to the honourable member.

* It is certainly true that it would not have been possible for Australia to develop, in terms of economic growth, per capita income and employment, without the large scale post-war **immigration** programme which has been directed specifically and expertly to satisfying shortages of labour and Australia's other needs.

* I believe that should a Labor government in Western Australia or a possible future Labor Federal government announce its intention to withdraw from the specific approach to **immigration** that has proved so successful over the years and to confine it purely to the whims of people already in Australia - that policy has been enunciated and was made even clearer recently by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland - it will be disastrous for Australia.

* No longer would we have the process by which an expert **immigration** service selects the people with the skills and of the categories we require and the economic growth, advancement and development which Australia has had in the past would not be fired.

* I hope that the Minister can advise us of the details of whether these stamps will be available at the various **immigration** offices, in the capital cities, in the regional areas all over Australia and the Department of Foreign Affairs offices.

* In 1971 the present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  then shadow Minister for **Immigration**, was very anxious on behalf of the Opposition, to see that this initiative was taken.

* The honourable member referred also to the report of the Queensland Task Force and specifically mentioned the application to the Department of **Immigration** for pre-school or child care centre assistance.

* Within the Department of **Immigration** there is not this kind of money.

* The Department of **Immigration**, my own Department, is already providing special instruction to migrant children at pre-school age in the child care centres in migrant hostels.

* The Department of **Immigration** is also in touch with the Australian Pre-School Commission as part of our interest in ensuring that the needs of migrant children at pre-school age will be taken into account by that Commission.

* We are just getting the kits prepared in the Department of **Immigration** now.

* As a matter of fact my distinguished colleague who was the shadow Minister for **Immigration** used to say this with great passion and sincerity.

* As an instance, on television last night, in respect of **immigration** policy, another great issue of the Australian Labor Party- 
No, but the point was made by the Leader of the Opposition that members on this side should support this great matter of importance.

* Therefore I am against the suspension of Standing Orders because I consider that it is nothing but an endeavour to float this particular policy but not other policies, such as the policy on **immigration**, which could perhaps be more embarrassing to the Labor Party.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has outlined the growing acceptance of this concept in Australia.

* If the courses run reflect the rather constricted view put forward in the second reading speech by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, Australia would have lost a golden opportunity to provide a wider vision for union training.

* I draw that point to the attention of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, perhaps for his comment.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration**, upon notice: 
Is a record kept of the numbers of persons with professional qualifications who have migrated to Australia since the commencement of the **immigration** scheme.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 19 April 1977: 
For 12 months the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has ducked and weaved his way through questions from the Country Party on rural unemployment relief.

* I desire to bring to the attention of the House a matter concerned with **immigration**.

* 1 have kept closely in touch with the **immigration** programme over the years, not only because of my own interest as the Minister who first planned the post-war intake of migrants but more particularly because of its vital importance to Australia.

* Doubtless these points have been fully weighed by the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  in reaching his decision, but I. sincerely hope that he has not been unduly swayed by a desire to save money because in the long term this could not eventuate, particularly if the returnee rate increases.

* It is not universally accepted practice that the departments of **immigration** of various countries charge clients- or applicants for visas to visit those countries- for the processing of the various forms and applications.

* Insofar as there is now a significant component in the **immigration** welfare program which is really directed at and for refugees, one could claim that immigrants generally will be paying for their own postarrival welfare and for that of refugees.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  has pointed out that the charges will apply, for the most part, to persons who are Australian residents but not Australian citizens.

* Experience has shown doubtful qualifications of many selection officers in the Department of **Immigration** posted overseas in terms of their limited education and their limited crosscultural experience.

* In fact, one is tempted to ask whether this is an echo- and if so, one hopes it is a very faint echo- of the restricted **Immigration** Act by which tests in any language were used to exclude applicants for visas to Australia.

* He has drawn the attention of the chamber and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to a situation which does require close investigation.

* It is rather sad that the Committee, in looking at the estimates for the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, is observing in relation to the **immigration** side of things the demolition of a department which once was held in very great esteem and which played a tremendous part in the development of this nation.

* I know that in the past the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has paid a series of tributes to the personnel of the former Department of **Immigration** for the work that they did on behalf of this country.

* I think that he, like I, will be saddened by some of the figures set out in the estimates for the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* 1) 1974-75 that the amount for the item concerning **immigration** studies and research is down from the appropriation of $92,000 last year to the appropriation of $9,400 this year.

* I think those two amounts which I have drawn out as examples show very clearly the way in which the Labor Government has moved very quickly since the election on 1 8 May to dismember and despatch the former Department of **Immigration**.

* Most members of this chamber and, I am sure, most people in Australia have a very clear idea of the benefits which have accrued to this country from the major **immigration** program which has been going on since the end of the Second World War.

* We see the break-up of the former Department of **Immigration** proceeding apace which will have 2 very real effects.

* There will be a very great effect also on the public servants who previously made up the Department of **Immigration**.

* I have travelled around' Australia talking to the various members of the former Department of **Immigration** in the various States and I have sensed a very real feeling not only of sadness but also of great disillusionment.

* I believe that the figures when they are revealed will show a great number of resignations by previous members of the Department of **Immigration** as this disillusionment, frustration and concern about career prospects takes its toll.

* There are foreign policy implications about any nation's **immigration** policies.

* Rather than building up international goodwill by the application of the new policies of the Labor Government in **immigration**, in fact we are running the very real risk that international goodwill will be broken down.

* The previous Minister for **Immigration** in this Government gave a guarantee that it would be brought in earlier this year.

* Will he also give us an opportunity to have a full scale debate on this important area of **immigration** policy?

* It is in this context, recognising the importance of citizenship, that we debate the Government's latest legislative initiative in the area of **immigration**.

* The legislation seeks to remove the position of preferment which British migrants have enjoyed since the inception of Australia's **immigration** program.

* On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove discrimination in various pieces of legislation, particularly the **immigration** program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the **immigration** area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment "which is currently enjoyed by British citizens.

* If he seeks to bring down some universal application across the board in the field of **immigration**, perhaps I could put into his mind, if only in passing, the question of the visa system.

* As I recall the Minister's second reading speech - my colleague the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes),  a former Minister for **Immigration**, may also recall it - he sought to put the criticism very much on the shoulders of other members of the Ministry.

* Since the days of first settlement **immigration** has been a feature of Australia's development.

* In the years since, even as the base of our **immigration** program has broadened as never before, British migrants have continued to be the cornerstone, the very real base, of **immigration** to this country.

* I am certain the Minister would be the first to recognise that the pattern of **immigration** ought to be at the rate of integration in this country.

* I was rather amused to listen earlier this evening to some honourable members on the Government side of the House condemn out of hand previous Ministers now on this side of the House and heap tons of praise upon the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  who is wandering around the chamber at the moment.

* The fact is, as this House would be well aware, that the studies by Professor Borrie, and other investigations to provide the facts necessary to determine future patterns of migration, were announced on 26th June 1970 by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  the then Minister for **Immigration**.

* The new Minister for **Immigration** was elected to this House in 1969 and set about convincing the Italian Embassy, the Maltese High Commission and anyone in the migrant community whose ear he could blow into that he was a great worker.

* The Minister for **Immigration** should admit that the British migrant is different from the Italian, the Greek and the Yugoslav.

* The Minister for **Immigration** with his purple suit and dark hair is jumping around like a day-old cockerel, drawing everyone's attention to the time.

* Instead of sitting there smirking and smiling the Minister should set about considering some of these issues, because I am sure that if he had been given a British Government award he would not have half the pride in it as he has- 
My main purpose in speaking to the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** is to pay a tribute to the officers of this Department who are stationed overseas.

* While I was away I took the opportunity of calling on the **Immigration** post in every country I visited.

* I want to acknowledge the help and the courtesy which was extended to me by the officers of the Department of **Immigration**.

* Our overseas **immigration** posts did not just happen; they did not appear like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

* I believe the future of some of these posts has been placed in jeopardy by some of the critics of our **immigration** policy.

* Some people blame **immigration** for the increased level of unemployment in Australia.

* For this reason they want either greatly to reduce our **immigration** intake or cut it out completely.

* The records of our **immigration** intake over the years show that in those years in which we had the greatest number of migrants coming to Australia we had our lowest level of unemployment and we also enjoyed some of our greatest levels of prosperity.

* The matters  1  have mentioned are very positive gains which we have made from our **immigration** programme.

* But I think it is wrong to attribute unemployment, congestion and pollution to **immigration**, as quite a number of people have done.

* Let us have a look at some of the benefits which we have derived from our **immigration** programme.

* A vigorous **immigration** programme is essential to the development of Australia.

* I believe that it is in Australia's best interests to retain the very efficient **immigration** posts which have been already established overseas.

* I have referred to some of the tangible benefits of **immigration**.

* **Immigration** has contributed to the non-material activities which add to the quality of life in Australia.

* The effects of **immigration** have in fact permeated the whole life of the nation.

* As the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  announced earlier this year, quite a number of new measures are proposed both for assessing migrants overseas and counselling them prior to their arrival in Australia.

* In its inquiry, the Committee took evidence from the Departments of Services and Property, Social Security, Labor, now the Department of Labor and **Immigration**, Overseas Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Department of Transport, and the Public Service Board.

* How did it get through when two of the people who will be vitally affected if what is suggested comes about are the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the honourable member for Darling  (Mr Fitzpatrick),  who are Labor members and whose electorates are further down the Murray and Mumimbidgee Rivers.

* The Minister for **Immigration** will come to order.

* The Minister for **Immigration**.

* Is the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** aware of the vulnerable employment situation for apprentices in times of reduced business activity?

* I have in my hand a paper titled 'Wage Indexation for Australia- a Discussion Paper' by the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* There is a foreword to that paper signed by  Dr Ian  Sharp, the Secretary of the Australian Department of Labor and **Immigration**, and I must quote his words: 
There is a second paper dealing with indexation which was by  Mr Geluck  of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

* It is that paper which is the basis of much that is said in the Department of Labor and **Immigration** paper, and the Department treats  Mr Geluck  as the man who knows more about indexation than any other person.

* I do not argue here, and I do not state here, that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** lied, but I do claim that he suffered from immediate shock.

* Over the last 200 years, except for brief periods of war and economic recession, Australia has been a country of large-scale **immigration**.

* Australia has succeeded in maintaining social harmony and national cohesion throughout this period of **immigration**.

* Honourable members will recall that I tabled in the House on 7 June 1979 a paper entitled Multiculturalism and its Implications for **Immigration** Policy'.

* It will consist of a  chairman,  the director of the Institute, the Secretary to the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and not fewer than three, or more than six, other members appointed by the Governor-General.

* Pursuant to section 12 of the **Immigration** (Education) Act 1971, I present the annual report on migrant education for the year ended 30th June 1971.

* I refer the honourable member to the answer given by the Minister for **Immigration** to question number 860 (Hansard 1st October 1970 at page 1991).

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 March 1978: 
The difficulty is that this Government has aligned Australia with those communist countries.

* Is it any wonder that  Mr Byrne,  the Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation, Minister for Tourism and Minister for **Immigration**, said: 'If I can get 500 Chinese under contract to come to Australia I will get them.'

* -At the outset, in supporting the appropriations for the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, I would like to compliment the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on administering a very difficult portfolio in a most - 
Honourable members opposite delight in interjecting at a time when there is something of so-called importance before us.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  who has just resumed his seat said how important **immigration** is to his electorate and to the Opposition.

* Perhaps he does this because he has no concern, as is the case with the majority of Opposition members, for **immigration** and its impact on the Australian community.

* As I was saying before the honourable member for Chifley so rudely interrupted, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is to be complimented, as is his Department, for handling at a most difficult time some very difficult matters.

* He has conceded that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department have, to a large degree, given sympathetic consideration to the handling of applications from those Lebanese nationals desirous of coming to Australia.

* The Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, under the capable administration of the Minister, has sought to process as quickly as possible and in a most compassionate way, every application that has come forward.

* Under his Government's Administration illegal residents in this country were too frightened to come forward and submit themselves to the examination of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs which would consider whether they would be fit and proper residents.

* We did split **immigration** into its real area of concern- **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* The Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population should remind us all that we should be taking more notice of population trends.

* The preface of this Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population indicates that the size, composition and distribution of our population will have a major influence on the nature of our future society.

* If we close our minds and eyes to the problems of the pressing necessity of a large part of the undeveloped world- much of it a starving world- we will no doubt shelve our **immigration** problem with probably the excuse that because we have a high percentage of unemployed we cannot allow more migrants to enter the country.

* That is at the present rate of **immigration** intake.

* I do not say that that is the only consideration that should be taken into account when we are looking at altering our **immigration** intake.

* It seems to me that speakers from both sides of the House do not appear to be advocating an all-out **immigration** policy.

* We should make it known that we reject the proposition that **immigration** can be used to solve economic difficulties or that it should provide an underpinning of unskilled labour to be hired or fired at the whim of an industry, whether in a time of full employment or in a time of high unemployment.

* In accordance with these principles, a moderate level of **immigration** should be proposed with special consideration given to parents and dependants of former settlers.

* Our **immigration** policy should always be balanced with these considerations.

* **Immigration** is the second major component of population growth and it is here that the rate of growth should be regulated to allow the maximum welfare of the present community and those who make their homes here.

* Other speakers have claimed that **immigration** cannot be turned on and off but it seems to me that the facts of life would indicate that we cannot leave the gates wide open irrespective of how much we would like to admit people from the developing countries.

* We should support an **immigration** policy administered with - 
In discussing the estimates for the Department of **Immigration** I do not want to raise the propositions to which I referred in my speech on the Budget.

* I do not usually take time in this House to congratulate officers of any department, but tonight I wish to refer to one officer of the Department of **Immigration**.

* I said to the parliamentary liaison officer for the Department of **Immigration** in Sydney that I hoped the election would come soon so that the people who would be put in charge of the Department of **Immigration** and other departments would realise that they were dealing with human beings and not with files - that it is terribly important for the migrant in Australia and especially for the relative he is trying to bring out here that there is no delay through loss of files.

* It is terribly important that officers of the Department of **Immigration** always remember that they are dealing with human beings - with individuals.

* The people in Iraq must go to Lebanon or Syria to be examined by officers of the Department of **Immigration** for the purpose of deciding whether they are fit and proper persons to come to this country.

* I make a special plea to the Minister and to the Department of **Immigration** to realise that the Department is dealing with people who are for practical purposes refugees, political or religious refugees.

* I recently wrote to the Minister for **Immigration** concerning a case in which the relatives of a person who has been rejected for **immigration** are living in Australia.

* I appeal to the Minister for **Immigration** to go out of his way to examine this case and to bring that person to Australia.

* In the two or three minutes remaining to me I would like to repeat a point which arises from the general question of **immigration**.

* In addition to the points that have been raised tonight on whether migrants should be allowed into this country, 1 think to some extent we must realise that some of the opposition to **immigration** has developed because of the popularisation of what is commonly known as zero population growth.

* But do not let us get carried away with slogans to the effect that the only way we can teach India not to increase its population is by not increasing our population in Australia and then to go on to the next step and say that the only way we can stop Australia's population increasing is by stopping **immigration**.

* I am further informed that late last year, following the High Court decision, the Attorney-General approved the drafting of regulations under section 1 1 1 subject to consultations with my Department and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* The consultations with my Department have concluded, and those with the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs will, I understand, be completed very shortly.

* **Immigration** and ethnic affairs have to be a very big policy area in a country such as ours where something like one-quarter of its population was born overseas.

* **Immigration** is an emotional problem to many people.

* There is a theory that **immigration** adds to unemployment.

* I am very pleased to know that in the past year or so, for a change, the **immigration** question has been removed somewhat from the emotional area and the debate has become much more informed.

* This is a publication which was recommended to members by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* A particular paper presented by Ainsley Jolley was headed The Macro Economics of **Immigration**'.

* I believe that this is one of the signposts of the **immigration** debate and that people are beginning to realise just where and when in the trade cycle **immigration** causes stresses or benefits on employment and other matters such as the balance of payments.

* Too often in this place debates on **immigration** become emotional.

* Sometimes people get up and say: 'If we have an increased level of **immigration** we are bound to have to that same extent an increase in the level of unemployment'.

* If **immigration** were to be used as a means of economic stabilisation there would be a need to cut **immigration** at the peak of the trade cycle and increase **immigration** at the beginning of economic recovery.

* One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity **immigration** in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment.

* Even though I admit that perhaps at the bottom of the trade cycle **immigration** will add less to demand than it would at the peak, there is a case to be made, perhaps more strongly than even Ainsley Jolley has put it, that **immigration** at all stages of the trade cycle will add to demand especially of course at the top of the trade cycle, and that is a time when **immigration** perhaps needs to be cut.

* But when we are feeling the first very fragile commencement of a very solid movement forward in the Australian economy, now- right now- is, in my view, the time to increase **immigration** heavily in the way that it is apparently being done.

* Often there is a feeling in the Australian community- certainly this applies in my electorate too- that a low level of **immigration** is a means of cutting back on unemployment.

* Many people forget, however, that a low level of **immigration** is in many ways a contributor to our present condition.

* It does need to be said that it was the previous Labor Government that apparently did not believe in **immigration**.

* It was the Government that cut back the levels of **immigration** which made it so difficult for qualified brothers and sisters of migrants already in Australia to enter this country.

* It was the Government that created a situation in which in one year the net **immigration** to Australia was only about 20,000.

* There has been a steady increase in the net **immigration** intake.

* I want to see good and steady increases in **immigration** to this country as one of the prime methods of getting this country back on its feet.

* I am very confident that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs sees it that way.

* am asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 19 April 1977: 
My question is addressed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I attended a fund raising function of this organisation on behalf of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr MacKellar,  where the need for this type of facility for elderly members of the Greek community in Victoria was pointed out to me.

* The Ministers have been assisted by senior colleagues such as the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitiam)  the Treasurer  (Mr Crean),  the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  and the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  in creating a serious situation.

* Neither has the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** been able to supply this information in reply to the many questions, letters and telegrams I have addressed to him asking for specific details.

* The additional areas  of  assistance to industry and expenditure  on  the Territories, education, the Austraiian Broadcasting Commission, Aboriginals, research and **immigration** - all of which I believe are essential items of expenditure which the Government must undertake - represent 10% of the proposed total Budget expenditure.

* Yesterday afternoon the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs suggested that I had stated, during my speech on the matter of public importance, that the Acting  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission was not 'quite up to his job'.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and Labor's Minister for electoral survival - the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  - have joined in the conspiracy.

* The allegation made by the Minister for **Immigration** was disgraceful.

* My colleague, the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, has also indicated the Government's view concerning the future.

* The Departments of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs (Chairman), Foreign Affairs, Attorney-General's, Prime Minister and Cabinet, Health, Employment and Industrial Relations, Business and Consumer Affairs, Primary Industry, Aboriginal Affairs, Social Security, Transport.

* The interdepartmental committee had no specific terms of reference but was established to consider investigations by an **Immigration** Task Force into the movement of Papua New Guineans into the Torres Strait area and mainland Australia and to make recommendations to Ministers on appropriate courses of action to be taken following the investigations.

* In defence of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  I agree that he has conformed with the convention in the sense that when a statement is to be made it is provided a couple of hours beforehand.

* Nevertheless, the Opposition commends the Government on finally producing an agreed **immigration** policy; that is, I take it, agreed amongst themselves, because even in the last couple of weeks there has been some discord between various Ministers over this question.

* For what purports to be a major statement on the Government's **immigration** policies it says remarkably little and virtually none of it is new.

* Nevertheless, the Government is proposing a substantial increase in the **immigration** intake to 90,000 people a year.

* Is the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs practising a policy of increasing the numbers by stealth?

* According to the Minister 'this program underlines the Government's faith in **immigration** as an element in economic growth'.

* This is a far cry from his previous statements arguing that **immigration** provides an economic stimulus and increased employment opportunities.

* To increase our **immigration** intake when Australia faces a high and, in seasonally adjusted terms, rising rate of unemployment and a growing indigenous work force is totally irresponsible, in our view.

* The Government claims that there is a shortage of skilled workers which can be met only by increased **immigration**.

* More significantly, selective **immigration** has tended to have a negative effect on our training programs.

* Despite the Government's rhetoric to the contraryand I am not blaming the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs for this because it is not his responsibility- **immigration** has acted as an alternative to training or retraining our own work force.

* The exploration of long-term solutions to unemployment has been put off partly because the Government and the employers can avoid the difficult decisions by claiming to overcome shortterm skill shortages through **immigration**.

* Today's unemployment problem is not merely a reflection of the low level of economic activity but, even if it were, an increase in the **immigration** intake would not have any significant effect on the level of economic activity.

* It is claimed that by enlarging the domestic market **immigration** will increase the efficiency of industry through economies of scale.'

* **Immigration** is also supposed to increase business confidence and hence investment by providing a guarantee of continuous growth in the domestic market.

* Economic recovery by new investment stimulus is more likely to result from recovery in demand for our exports rather than from the dubious stimulus to domestic investment attributable to marginal increases in the size of the market from **immigration**.

* After all, the proposed level of **immigration** would represent a growth rate in the market of less than half of one per cent over the present rate of increase; hardly of much relevance to manufacturers unable to sell their goods today.

* In other programs such as the initial settlement program, cost estimates by the Galbally committee were based on the current **immigration** intakes, and even then it would take three years to cover the estimated bare minimum of those needing such a service.

* Will the Government now undertake to increase funds for those programs in line with its increase in **immigration** as proposed by the Minister?

* How can an increased selective **immigration** program be justified to those people who have already migrated to Australia?

* He is the Minister for **Immigration**.

* He could be the wine coloured suit man or the Minister for **Immigration**, but I will always know him as the bubbling, popping member for Riverina.

* The Government introduced this measure to placate the honourable member for Riverina - the Minister for **Immigration**.

* I am not one to step in and trample on local investment, but what I say is that I do not believe that the welfare of every beer drinker in Australia who wants to buy a bottle should be put below that of the sectional interests of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* by leave - I take this opportunity to make comment not only about the particular matter that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has mentioned but also about other aspects of his **immigration** administration for the simple reason that the Minister has resolutely, over a long period, not encouraged, not enabled and not taken any measures in this House to permit a proper debate of the alleged **immigration** changes he has made.

* But there is another area in which the Minister for **Immigration** and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in particular are culpable in relation to Australia's **immigration** program in a way in which no similar charge can be laid against any other Minister for **Immigration** or any other Prime Minister since the days of Arthur Calwell, the first and possibly the greatest Minister for **Immigration** whom Australia has had.

* It is a pity that his tradition in helping to establish a bi-partisan approach to this matter could not have been continued because it was Arthur Calwell - it was probably only a member of the Labor Party who could do it - who gained trade union support for a large and continuing **immigration** program.

* Now, partly from grandstanding and partly from belief and a search for publicity that general trade union support for a continuing **immigration** program looks like being threatened.

* It is being threatened because the Prime Minister and the Minister for **Immigration** are more concerned with publicity and are more concerned with immediate happenings than with the long term and solid development of Australia on a basis that does not arouse concern and passion.

* The Minister for **Immigration** will presumably be dashing those expectations in the same way as he has in relation to the Fijians.

* The important point in this proposal is that it runs the risk, as has become most evident in the last few days, of jeopardising continuing trade union support for a substantial **immigration** program that Australia needs.

* It is a situation that would seriously jeopardise the continuing support of the trade unions for an **immigration** program.

* Again, the Minister for **Immigration** and particularly the Prime Minister are culpable for having established the circumstances in which aspirations which will not be fulfilled have been aroused in the Philippines and in which fears have been aroused in the trade union movement for the first time since Arthur Calwell, to his continuing and lasting credit, sold an **immigration** program to the trade union movement of Australia.

* In relation to Fiji, the Minister for **Immigration** has ignored the experience and the advice of officers of his Department.

* By making that statement he aroused expectations that cannot and will not be fulfilled even by the present Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** is concerned with headlines and not with the substance of policy in relation to these matters.

* He is interested in the froth and not the responsibility of administering **immigration** matters.

* An example perhaps of the understandable but overdeveloped wish for publicity of the Minister for **Immigration** can be seen from a news release issued by the Minister - I understand it was written by him - when he described the welcome given to him in Calabria.

* He would do much better to look to his responsibilities to the Australian Parliament and people and to the administration of his Department rather than perpetually to seek flamboyance and headlines which will damage the **immigration** program in Australia.

* What this Parliament needs - I ask the Minister for **Immigration** to produce it - is a clear statement of the Government's policy and of the changes of emphasis that have been introduced and of the new policy initiatives which he alleges he has introduced.

* I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for **Immigration** claims to have introduced in relation to the welfare of migrants in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch).

* I hope that the contempt with which he treats the Parliament in relation to major statements of **immigration** policy, of which there is none that I can recall in this Parliament, and the contempt which he has so far shown for the Notice Paper by failing to answer questions, will not be continued.

* I ask him to make a statement on **immigration** and to allow it to be properly debated - not by one or two speakers a side but properly debated - in this Parliament.

* I am sure that the powers of the Minister for **Immigration** are great enough for him to persuade the Leader of the House that this matter is worthy of debate.

* Other aspects concern the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the Minister for Administrative Services and the Attorney-General.

* - Mr Chairman, 1 think the importance of the statement made by the Minister for **Immigration** and Minister assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  has been completely overlooked.

* The honourable member for Angas  (Mr 
The honourable member for Curtin complained about a number of things involving the administration of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* The rapidity with which new applications for assistance under NEAT are being determined is in fact a tribute to the dedication, the efficiency and the very hard work of officers of the Department of Labor and **Immigration**.

* Another case which he raised has been fully reviewed by the Department of Labor and **Immigration** but also has been rejected on the ground that the person involved had voluntarily left employment to undertake training for an occupation for which there is a low labour market demand.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Senator James McClelland)  has advised that the Department has virtually completed the review and it is hoped to provide project sponsors with firm details regarding the future of their projects by the end of this week.

* The honourable member also raised an **immigration** complaint.

* He should realise that the Minister receives approximately 65 000 representations per annum in respect of **immigration** matters.

* Before there is any further dicussion on the reports just tabled by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  I would like to make an announcement.

* Before doing so, I clarify a misunderstanding that has arisen following comments made by me in the last few days concerning my attitude to migrants and **immigration**.

* If this is so, why has the Government changed the whole administrative arrangements for migrants by once again concentrating all power in all areas of migrant welfare in the most centralised department of all, the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs?

* Why should people be forced to seek help from the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic 
Affairs and not from the Department of Social Security or the Department of Education, as other Australians may, simply because they are termed new Australians?

* With this new efficient rearrangementwe were told that one of the main justifications for electing a Liberal Government was that it knows how to run things better and how to be far more efficient than the Labor Government was- will we see a duplication of staff in the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to perform all these sundry services that were being provided very adequately and when not provided adequately were being expanded rapidly in all these other departments?

* Now let me turn to some of the doubts about our assumptions on **immigration** that have got me into hot water in recent days.

* Let me commence by turning to the Press statement by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  and the article he wrote in the  Age  in response to an article by  Dr Birrell  entitled '**Immigration** and Unemployment'.

* It was one of a series of articles which make up a book entitled  The **Immigration** Issue in Australia,  which has just been released.

* The Minister and I were both asked for our comments on one particular chapter which dealt with **immigration** and unemployment.

* In his Press release the Minister said: 

 Dr Cass has called for **immigration** to be cut to the bone as happened under the Whitlam Labor Government.

* If migration does do the thing it is claimed to do- be an economic stimulus and create jobs- the Government should rapidly and immediately increase the migration rate now and not wait until economic circumstances improve, for that implies that **immigration** inhibits or depresses economic recovery.

* Surely the cautionin other words, the fact that the Government does not rapidly and immediately increase **immigration** rates- reflects the true effect of **immigration**, and the stated policy, or what the Government goes on about publicly, about increasing **immigration** is simply humbug, an ideological hangup, a nefarious plot to weaken the trade union movement by increasing the pool of unemployment or, worst of all, a simplistic acceptance of up to now generaly held myths whose consequences have never been assessed.

* Just what are the effects of high **immigration** rates?

* The Government should stop talking in this humbug fashion about **immigration** helping to stimulate all these things.

* The subject I have raised this afternoon needs a good deal more light and a good deal more information than the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  so far has been prepared to make available inside this Parliament or outside it.

* But if anyone searches through those statements for matters of real substance and matters that have come to cause concern to a large number of people in the Australian trade union movement and in the general Australian community, he will not find much enlightenment or much help from this Minister for **Immigration**.

* He is probably the most publicised Minister for **Immigration** that we have had and I would think almost certainly the most publicised of the present Ministers of the present Government.

* In short, **immigration** needs a dose of open government because for the last IS months it has had a good solid dose of closed, secretive government and of refusal to supply answers and facts.

* Migrant counselling was greatly expanded under decisions announced by the honourable member for Barker when he was Minister for **Immigration**.

* This question concerns details of **immigration** - it is question number 999  -  such as the number of people coming to Australia and the number of assisted migrants.

* But the Hansard record would show that the total debate for the estimates of the Department of **Immigration** lasted about 2 minutes less than one hour, and that does not comprise a proper debate on **immigration**.

* On 14 March this year the Leader of the House made it quite plain that debate was not to be allowed on this issue and the Minister for **Immigration** was asked if he would make a statement on details giving the direction, the purposes and the consequences of Labor policy in these matters.

* A short while ago I wrote a letter to the Minister in which I said: 
Would you please give me a set of the principal policy statements that you have made as Minister for **Immigration**.

* As an Australian Minister for **Immigration** I suppose he felt that was appropriate.

* But it does not come to the substance, the purpose and the direction of Australian **immigration** policy.

* The fifth was 'Australian **Immigration** Statistics - March 1973'  -  he said that these were the latest available.

* The direction, purpose and consequence of an **immigration** program depend upon the numbers of people who are coming to Australia and the countries from which those people come.

* If that is the kind of thing that is to result from the Minister's handling of the **immigration** portfolio it certainly is not going to result in great advantage to Australia.

* We have seen the Minister jeopardising union support for a continuing **immigration** program, which only the Minister for **Immigration** would be capable of doing.

* What has been the trend in South East Asian countries in inquiries and applications since the Government announced its new **immigration** policies?

* Finally, what weight does the Minister place on advice from the **Immigration** Advisory Council and the **Immigration** Planning Council?

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1979: 
Is it a fact that **immigration** entry cards state that answers to questions must be given in the English language.

* This Government, with this Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  were not having any of that.

* One of these people approached me when the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  was Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and asked me to see what I could do about getting  Mr Salemi  out of the country because he was a communist, not because of the work he was doing.

* On 25 January 1976, flushed with success at being admitted to the Ministry- perhaps he will be the next to go- the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs announced an amnesty.

* It is certainly a most undesirable situation and one into which I believe that the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has a great responsibility to look very deeply.

* I shall pluck out two or three lines which I think the Minister at the table, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  would agree in some way epitomise the feeling of this proposal.

* The most major dispute was increased to double the length of time that it should have lasted because of the interference by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones).

* I believe, if I do not misquote the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, that he called the finding of the tribunal chaired by  Mr Justice  Coldham a decision that was 'idiotic'.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 5 June 1979: 
What the Opposition argues is not the root cause of it at all.

* If we want to- know the exact position with regard to fuel and- oil supplies in Australia as the question has been raised about the adequency of supplies, I have mentioned it and my colleague, the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will be dealing with the industrial aspects.

* If the honourable member says that some have been rejected, I will certainly raise the matter with the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** and provide him with a suitable answer at the earliest possible opportunity.

* To put it bluntly, this whole tactic of scaremongering on irrigation supplies was used by the Minister, and supported in a most unscrupulous way by the Minister for **Immigration**, in an attempt to hide his real motive which was to support the blackmail tactics of the New South Wales trade unions.

* Theoretically, a council will have to work in liaison with the Australian Department of Social Security or the State offices of it and up to 13 other Australian Government departments, such as Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-Generals', Capital Territory, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, **Immigration**, Labour, Northern Territory, Repatriation, Tourism and Recreation and Urban and Regional Development; the State Government in its various departments concerned with welfare services; local governments - there are 900 of them; the Australian Council of Social Services and the State Council of Social Services; various planning boards in existence and to be set up; and local bodies and charities concerned with welfare services.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs.

* I have always taken the view that when an application is made to the Department of **Immigration** confidentiality should prevail between the applicant and the Department.

* We have heard in this House on a previous occasion the former Minister for Labor and **Immigration** take great credit for the improvement in unemployment figures as a result of his scheme.

* The Australian Country Party supports this **Immigration** (Education) Bill 1973.

* But I do hope that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who is now at the table and who represents a rural electorate with a large percentage of migrants enrolled at the schools in that area, will ensure that some of these classrooms will also be provided in rural areas.

* For many years, Australia's **immigration** program was based on an incoherent system of establishing annual targets, some settlers having their full fare paid for them, and others coming here under their own steam and paying their full fare.

* This was the target balance that was set by the late 
Arthur Calwell when the **immigration** scheme was introduced in 1949.

* Mr Jay  referred to the problems of Australia's **immigration** policy and said: 
The trouble with Australia's **immigration** policy  is that it has never had one.

* Nowhere has this shown up better than in the recent statement from the Minister for **Immigration**,  Dr Forbes,  ' tossing a few random extra dollars to the Good Neighbour Councils here, pumping a little more into child migrant education there, setting up a few infactory language courses for new settlers, and grandly announcing a whole new approach to selection and counselling.

* In practice the statement is a perfect example of the twin theses which have always underlain Australia's **immigration** thinking.

* One of the main factors that certainly has contributed to the problem over the years has been the fact that the responsibility for **immigration**, rightly, has been that of the national Government.

* Admittedly, supplementary schemes have been operated by various States, but the main impact of **immigration** on the growth pattern of this nation has been rightly the responsibility of, and has been conducted under the authority of, the Australian Government.

* As the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  said in his second reading speech on this Bill, these classrooms are required at some 420 schools that have been listed by the education authorities.

* These shortcomings of course were forecast by the spokesman for the then Opposition during the debate on the previous legislation - now the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  who was then shadow Minister for **Immigration** - when he proposed just such an amendment during the original debate.

* During his absence, the Minister for **Immigration**,  Dr Forbes,  will act as the Minister for Health.

* On **immigration** policy there is a definite conflict within the Australian Labor Party.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  has in the past supported a bi-partisan **immigration** policy.

* The matter I wish to bring to the attention of the House is the appalling method used by the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs or its officers at Melbourne Airport to clear passengers who are arriving in Australia or returning to Australia.

* I had been through health clearances in Sydney and I had to go through **immigration** and customs clearances in Melbourne.

* The reason I bother to raise this matter is that, having had the benefit of visiting a number of countries during my journey to Europe, I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that the worst port in the world for people to get through **immigration** clearances must be Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine.

* It seems to me that a lot of unnecessary clerical work was being done on behalf of passengers by the **immigration** staff.

* Only four or five **immigration** officers were working at their posts.

* The speech of the honourable member for Scullin, however, was in sharp contradistinction to the speech made by the shadow Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes).

* We are talking about the Green Paper on Australian **immigration** and population.

* It seems to me that the shadow Minister will well remember the work which was done by the Labor Party on the migration system in Australiathe work of rapidly cutting back the number of migrants, the work of dispersing the Department of **Immigration** and tying up some of its loose ends in a  pot-pourri  known as the Department of Labour and **Immigration**.

* The Green Paper refers to the nexus between the rate of **immigration** and the rate of capital investment.

* Looking at the Green Paper and summing up what people in my electorate think about **immigration**, I would say the total net effect of this vacuum, which has been largely created in the Australian Labor Party term of office, is absolutely detrimental to this country.

* The Green Paper, on summing up, in my view basically supports **immigration** as a tool of population increase.

* It says that we will have an increase in demand for services with an increase in **immigration**.

* I would have thought that was self-evident but there are many people, such as the shadow Minister for **Immigration**, who seem to thinkthis is one thing I vaguely got out of his speechthat an increase in **immigration** will necessarily add to the rate of unemployment.

* But I think that it is self-evident that an increase in **immigration** will add to the demand for services and then ultimately of course to the supply of services.

* It talks about the possibility in future programs of the deployment of **immigration** for the purposes of decentralisation.

* I am very pleased that the issues of capital investment were mentionedwhether in fact an increase in **immigration** will cause a fall off in capital investment available for production as against that which will be required for the provision of social services such as schools and hospitals.

* It also notes that there should be no bar to continued **immigration** from nonEnglish speaking countries.

* Another thing I heard the Opposition spokesman say was that perhaps we do not have the resources to sustain a tremendous increase in **immigration**.

* There are traditional arguments against a substantial increase in the **immigration** programthe traditional argument of an increase in the unemployment level.

* I believe that the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs is talking about carrying out a very detailed study through the Commonwealth Employment Service of the unemployment situation among the migrant population.

* We must give the late Arthur Calwell credit for his foresight after the war in getting this country going by means of the **immigration** program.

* In my view **immigration** has added a great deal to this country and will continue to do so.

* I realise that because of the popular Press it may be politically unpalatable to talk about an increase in the **immigration** program.

* I will stand out on any limb and say that the long term results will bear out any sort of confidence that the Minister might have in the **immigration** program adding to this country once again.

* The **immigration** program will help us to take advantage of that unlimited future.

* I suggest that one of the most important decisions of the leaders of this country was to have a great and substantial **immigration** program.

* II was based on humanitarian grounds and the needs of the country and that later **immigration** under Liberal governments became factory fodder programs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
I am the Federal member for Wills, the area in which  Mr Salemi  operates.

* I was responsible in the first instance for taking up with the then Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic affairs the question of  Mr Salemi's  readmission to Australia after he had been out here at the special invitation of the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their Families, known as FILEF, had gone back home and then had come back again.

* I shall take up a few points that the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made.

* Forgive me if I am wrong but that is as I - 
Labor and **Immigration**, Postmaster-General's, Services and Property, Social Security 
I wish to respond to that new matter that has just been introduced.

* I have before me copies of the second reading speeches- both of them- made by the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar).

* In the second reading speech on the Bill that we are discussing now- the Departure Tax Collection Bill 1978- the Minister says: 
asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 

 - Mr Acting Speaker, I require the debate to be extended.

* I mentioned at the time that the Australian Government, and I in particular as the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, would keep a close watch on the unfolding events in the Lebanon and would respond to them as they occurred.

* As I have said, the Government took a decision to maintain a watching brief over this Middle East situation, and when the quasi refugee buildup was such that something extra needed to be done the Department of **Immigration**, with the co-operation of the Syrian Government and also the Royal Netherlands Government, placed an officer in Damascus.

* As a result of that consideration the presence of Australian **immigration** officials in Nicosia was strengthened, exactly in line with the actions of a number of other countries.

* As Minister for **Immigration**, my first responsibility is to the Australian population, the Australian society, the Australian nation.

* I regret to see that the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has left the chamber.

* In recent weeks the Minister for **Immigration** has made an untold number of statements.

* I am becoming sick of opening my mail and finding another 2 or 3 statements on **immigration**.

* One area in which I can agree with the former right honourable member for Melbourne and the present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  is in their **immigration** policy.

* The Government cannot have a quid each way on this issue, yet that is exactly what the Minister for **Immigration** is trying to do.

* I do not know what our **immigration** policy is.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  has consistently misled the Australian public by claiming that there is no shortage of skilled labour as a result of the **immigration** cutback.

* asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration**, who represents the Minister for Health, a question.

* In one case, a person successfully enrolled as 'HBerrill (Surname) Stop Asian **Immigration** Now' (other names) and was a candidate in that name at the recent Senate election.

* I ask the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**: Is he aware that the statistics of unemployed published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the month of February, the latest statistics available, showed the total number of unemployed persons seeking full time work to be approximately 70 000 fewer than the total number of such persons recorded by the Commonwealth Employment Service for the same month?

* The **Immigration** Planning Council met yesterday in Melbourne and is continuing its deliberations.

* When the **Immigration** Planning Council has completed its deliberations a recommendation will be made to the Government.

* We had a year or two ago - many members will remember this - the proposition of the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  and the present Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  to attempt to raise funds to buy a portion of the Simpson Desert.

* 1 ) The services relating to functions of the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs which were provided in the past in rural areas by offices of the Department of Labor and **immigration** are being continued by area offices of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* It is perfectly obvious from listening to the lame speech of the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  that he has at least found his own level of incompetence in this place.

* There is no question that there has been a huge cover-up in this Parliament involving the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs to obscure differences of opinion between the departments and their Ministers as to the effects of independent **immigration** under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System.

* We all know that until 1 January **immigration** policy covered these categories: Family reunion, special family reunion, refugees, persons freely granted residence because of the Tasman agreement, and the general eligibility provision wherein independent new migrants were selected mainly by relating their skills to the Australian 1 mainly abour market.

* Given that there has been a significant change, it is proper to ask what the attitude of the other department involved was, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, and whether the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs and the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs worked in unity to implement this new program.

* We were far from satisfied with the final decisions and the former Secretary wrote to the Secretary of **Immigration** in August 1978 setting out our objections.

* I with my equivalent in the **Immigration** Department following the Cabinet Decision to clarify the procedure for operation of NUMAS.

* First of all, this is what the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs thinks about the activities of the Minister for **Immigration**.

* That Department said to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs: 
You would need to ask the Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs that question.

* They and the second reading speech of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  leave a number of vital questions unanswered, questions which should be answered by the Minister before these Bills pass through this chamber and questions to which the growers of the wheat are entitled to have answers.

* In 1974 a joint inquiry into schools of high migrant density was undertaken by a working party from the Federal departments of Education and **Immigration** and the New South Wales and Victorian departments of Education.

* It has a legal- in fact, a constitutional- responsibility for **immigration** and the welfare of migrants and their families.

* Under the Constitutionfrom the outset- the Federal Government has been able to make laws on **immigration** and also to make laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.

* At a conference of Ministers for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs in Melbourne on 22 October last the present Federal Minister described the Federal Government's responsibilities towards migrants in these terms: 
As I understand it we do have the responsibility in terms of entry into Australia, in terms of **immigration**  programs,  deportations and the like, temporary entries and so forth.

* What the Federal Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs- a Liberal Minister- was saying in that quotation at that conference with his State peers was that once a migrant arrives in Australia he ceases to be a migrant and the Federal Government can wash its hands of any responsibility for him.

* Migrants should take note that the Federal Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs has gone on record with the view that ethnic affairs are not the concern of the Federal Government.

* My question is directed to the Minister for **Immigration**.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration** has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
This Government has sold the primary sector down the river.

* Was it because the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby),  who is now the Minister for **Immigration**, waxed so eloquent on the subject of the wine excise?

* The Minister for **Immigration** should tell his constituents that the 1973-74 Budget will take $20m in a full year out of that industry.

* **Immigration** has been a Federal matter since Federation, especially since the great post war government sponsored **immigration** programs.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 6 April 1978: 
I turn now to those parts of the.

* This policy was widely canvassed by my neighbour the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby).

* The Minister for **Immigration**, a rural spokesman in this House representing the vast meat producing electorate of Riverina, announced that this levy on beef export products would not be lc per lb as stated in the Budget but had been increased to 1.6c per ,b, a rise of 60 per cent.

* At that time there was perpetual discussion about **immigration** and whether the level of **immigration** placed too many demands upon our capacity to provide goods and services.

* Now the one variable we have, that of **immigration** has in fact been discounted by the previous administration.

* Our level of **immigration** has slowed to the point where we have no growth in the labour force and we now have built into it certain immobility and certain structural difficulties associated with relocating people and retraining people at the same time in order to fill some of our requirements in a rational way.

* I believe that the Green Paper on **immigration** and population is worthy of considerable nonparty political discussion.

* In the future, with less scope for transfers from rural areas and, possibly, less **immigration**, there could well be problems of that nature in seeking to ensure a balanced supply of the different labour skills required.

* He admitted that it was his own Government in 1974, when it split up the Department of **Immigration** and moved settlement services across to the Department of Social Security, that caused the problem.

* I have been checking to find out about these migrant welfare courses and I find that the reference is probably to a course of training for bilingual welfare officers who were to be recruited to the Department of **Immigration**.

* The telephone interpreter service for which the Leader of the Opposition claimed credit, in fact was authorised in July 1972 by the then Commonwealth Minister for **Immigration**,  Dr Forbes,  who was a Liberal member of Parliament.

* In the time left to me I want to briefly list some of the main achievements of the Government in **immigration** and ethnic affairs since December 1975 because it is important that the record be set straight.

* First and foremost, I repeat that a separate Department of **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs was established immediately we took office.

* This set aside the disastrous decision of the Labor Government which split up the previous Department of **Immigration**.

* The Government has reconstituted the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council- - APIC - on 31 March 1976.

* We published Australia's first Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* For the first time in our history since Federation the Australian people have been given the opportunity to make their views known on matters relating to Australia's **immigration** and population policies 
We broadened the family reunion categories for **immigration** and allowed for the entry of entrepreneurs and proprietors of small personal businesses in addition to national need categories.

* Since 1961, a very considerable amount of work was done, first by  Sir Garfield  Barwick as AttorneyGeneral, and subsequently by the present Minister for **Immigration** when he was Attorney-General, on proposals for the establishment of a new court .

* The then Minister for **Immigration** was  Mr Snedden.

* On 17 July 1967, addressing the fourteenth legal convention of the Law Council of Australia in Adelaide,  Mr Bowen  said: 
Since 1961, a very considerable amount of work has been done first by  Sir Garfield  Barwick and then by the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Snedden)  ....

* Two days ago a matter of public importance on **immigration** was submitted for discussion by the Opposition, and there were not enough Opposition members in the House to keep the debate going.

* The thing which they said was urgent and in which one would have thought previous Ministers for **Immigration**, including the Leader of the Opposition and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  would have some interest, lapsed because there were not enough of them in the House to support their proposals.

* That absorption has been carried out under an **immigration** programme the foundation principles of which have never been seriously challenged or criticised either inside or outside Australia during that time.

* While there have been some minor alterations to the **Immigration** Act over the years they have not made and I do not believe they were intended to make any significant difference to the initial intention of the programme.

* Indeed, one could never expect to witness within the entire community anything like unanimous approval for everything that is done or not done in the field of **immigration**.

* I say that, because those same people, both young and old, are spread over the whole of Australia, which in turn means that the whole Australian community, those whose parents were born here and those whose parents were not born here, and who also have different interests, outlooks and attitudes and, in some cases perhaps, memories or knowledge of events in the early part of this century which were not entirely palatable, is vitally interested in **immigration**.

* Those people are all involved in some way or another, and it is only natural that the subject of **immigration** always has been, and for some time at least will continue to be, a very sensitive area of deliberation.

* This being so, the fact that the plan has operated so smoothly over so many years and has not required other than minor alterations is, I believe, a very great tribute to the first Minister for **Immigration** who commenced its opera tions in the difficult early, post-war.

* opinion that any well-founded criticism in the area of **immigration** is not the fault of the plan itself but the fault of the Minister for **Immigration**  (Dr Forbes)  or of his Govern- .

* lence and has not experienced any real trouble which could be associated with or blamed upon in any way the broad foundation principles of the **immigration** programme.

* Here again the forward thinking of the Austalian Labor Party and its Minister for **Immigration** should be applauded.

* This must always be a serious consideration in any change in **immigration** policy or programme.

* Of course, the principles which are embraced in the policy of the Australian Labor Party are no different today from what they were in the very first years of **immigration**.

* The Australian Labor Party has always remained firm in the belief that an **immigration** policy must be administered with tolerance, sympathy and understanding, and I am .

* Very certainly the time is overdue for a full scale, but a fairly quick examination of the whole field to determine just what should be done in the area of **immigration**.

* However, it is in line with the misleading answers which he gave to a series of questions which had been directed to him and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby)  by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  - questions regarding the proposed visit to Australia of  Mr K.  T. Li of Taiwan.

* On 10 May 1973, during question time, the honourable member for New England directed a question to the Minister for **Immigration** asking why  Mr Li's  request had been refused in view of the Prime Minister's assurance that provided he applied in an unofficial capacity  Mr Li  would be issued with a visa.

* I direct my question to the Minister for **Immigration** representing the Minister for Health in this chamber.

* I have here the statement I released on the evening of Thursday 27 February, and because this matter was brought up by the Prime Minister and was also alluded to by the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  I just tell the House what I did say.

* That statement reads: 
This morning the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** alleged that I had been offered access to the fie on  Mr John  Stonehouse and had refused.

* My reason for saying that is that it would seem that everybody at this point of time, including myself, is agreed on the proposition that there should be an investigation into our **immigration** policy.

* The honourable member for Deakin also spoke about the history of Australia as being the history of **immigration** and if I may I will recapitulate a little of the history of Australia.

* **Immigration**, since the inception of Australia, has gone through a number of phases in our relatively short history of 200 years.

* And Australia's first **immigration** scheme was off the ground.

* One could say without fear of contradiction that this, our first **immigration** programme, was the result of a planned policy.

* The others were carefully selected for their qualities and the selections were confirmed by some of the finest judges in England, litis planned **immigration** policy continued for a number of years with the immigrants being housed in cosy little migrant hostels at Port Arthur in the south, at Botany Bay on the east coast and Moreton Bay in the north.

* Australia then entered a phase of unplanned **immigration** programmes.

* Not the least of these is in the field of **immigration**.

* Mr Chifley's  inherent ability to find the right man for the right job led him to choose the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  as he now is, to institute an **immigration** policy.

* Yet, in spite of the changed circumstances, succeeding governments, and the various and numerous succeeding Ministers for **Immigration**, including the present Government and the present Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  are still following the guidelines laid down by my colleague the right honourable member for Melbourne.

* Australia's **immigration** policy has become a matter of public debate and the general concensus would be that the policy needs review.

* 1 repeat that Australia's **immigration** policy is in need ot review.

* The article puts forward a point of view that **immigration** is a cost to the community because it draws on resources that could be applied to other things and that there is not sufficient return to the community to warrant a continued outlay.

* The Government will make its first full scale review of Australia's **immigration** programme.

* As a starting point, he had earlier  this  year approved a cost-benefit analysis of **immigration**: This project, would provide detailed information on the economics of **immigration**.

* Mr Lynch also said that he had decided to broaden the basis of Australia's consultative machinery on **immigration**.

* He said he had decided to widen the functions and membership of the **Immigration** Planning Council to include urbanisation and environmental considerations.

* I believe that **immigration** today is at a crossroads and the choice of which road to take is one the Government must face up to fairly quickly.

* In fact, **immigration** is of such vital importance that Australia's policy warrants full debate in this House.

* We know and can measure how much money is spent and charged against the **Immigration** Department and we know by book-keeping which areas cost what.

* However, it is generally agreed that the ledger has shown a credit balance in favour of increased **immigration** in the past.

* It is unfortunate and condemnatory thai the Government, which has been in office for 20 years, has realised at the eleventh hour that there is a need for reason rather than emotion to frame our **immigration** policy.

* The Acting Minister lor **Immigration** has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
-Can the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** give the House an up to date figure on those people now being employed under the Regional Employment Development scheme?

* At one stage the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who is under attack, and the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Grassby),  who has just completed his speech, were the only Ministers in the House.

* All that the Minister for Minerals and Energy has had to support him is this poor, pathetic member for Riverina, the Minister for **Immigration**.

* Possibly he would be equalled by the Acting Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  who recently sent a 600-word telegram to each of the 93 members of Caucus, but I think the Minister for **Immigration** is still in the lead.

* The Minister for **Immigration** sent an explanation in these terms: 
 I second the motion moved by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  of confidence in the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy).

* The right honourable gentleman is either playing with the House and the nation or has forgotten to confer with his colleagues, because on 3rd December 1969 his  deputy,  the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch),  who was then Minister for **Immigration**, wrote to the then Attorney-General and said: 
The bombing attack last week on the Yugoslav Embassy in Canberra ... the evidence of  a  deliberate attempt to fire the **Immigration** Offices at Barton on the evening of 1st December - 
This was a warning by the then Minister for **Immigration** to the then Attorney-General of the previous Government.

* The then Minister went on to say: 
This was written by the honourable member for Flinders, the present  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition who was at that time Minister for **Immigration**.

* He went on to say: 
To me, as Minister for **Immigration**, it does not matter at all what the pretext is for violence: Violence in our society must always be condemned.

* Under the Migration Act, the Minister for **Immigration** has authority to exclude from Australia any persons who are not members of the Australian community.

* Officers of the Department of **Immigration** here and overseas are under standing instructions in this matter and I have re-emphasised those instructions.

* At present more than 8000 Lebanese in Cyprus where Australia's Lebanese **immigration** operation has been concentrated.

* A senior officer of my Department with wide **immigration** experience in Australia and overseas was sent to Nicosia last weekend.

* He has extensive terms of reference to report on the most effective way in which the Lebanese **immigration** operation can be organised.

* **Immigration** officers did stay there and did process applications.

* I concluded my reply by saying: 
asked the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**, upon notice: 
I ask the Minister for **Immigration** a question which concerns the facilitation of travel by Australians to Rhodesia.

* At the moment there is an extremely constrictive **immigration** policy which was initiated under a Labor government and which has been carried on, I think in almost equal effect, by the present Government.

* I suggest that it is most likely that the cost of importing tradesmen, especially with the uncertainties of recognition which exist- I think the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would understand that as well as I do- would be greater than the cost of training the tradesmen within our own instrumentalities.

* If the Government is to step up the **immigration** policy in order to bring about a net gain of say 30 000 or 70 000 persons a year, it has to be prepared to do something that governments have not done in the past, that is, to provide the wherewithall in order to finance an **immigration** program at the increased rate which it determines the program should reach.

* I have not heard anyone suggest that we are going to increase the size of the **immigration** program for any reason other than a selfish reason, that the program would benefit us- not them.

* State Departments of **Immigration** go through some form of mystical process of screening migrants.

* After they have been screened and the sponsors in Australia feel that they have arrived at a situation where approval will be granted, they begin the process through which other migrants go in the normal sense by being rescreened by the Commonwealth Department of **Immigration**.

* We talk about the success of the early **immigration** programs.

* They are an important source of migrants to Australia and have provided a substantial proportion of the postwar **immigration** program.

* I do not think it is fanto say that the post-war **immigration** program was the start of migration.

* The point I am making- I think it should be made quite strongly- is that we should not be starting an increased **immigration** program merely because this would be seen to be some way of stimulating our economy or stimulating growth.

* We should not be starting an increased **immigration** program, if that is our desire, purely for selfish reasons.

* The other thing which was a feature of earlier **immigration** programs was that we welcomed the males and left the females where they were.

* I suggest that if the consequence of an increased **immigration** flow is that more people are settled on the fringes of the 2 major capital cities of Australia the program, while it might be temporarily satisfactory as a stimulant, will be regressive in its total concept because of the consequences on those capital cities which are already in a situation of turmoil because of their population and lack of social fabric.

* It is now 7 years since the McMahon Government commissioned the National Population Inquiry and a little over 12 months since the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council would prepare a Green Paper to stimulate public debate about Australia's population and **immigration** policies.

* Indicative of this policy, the Government's inefficient and  ad  /deprocedures in determining **immigration** quotas are a perfect example.

* Australia's population and **immigration** policies are vital issues of concern to every Australian.

* It is appropriate that in this period of record unemployment and deepening economic recession we reassess our **immigration** policies and the options for the growth and development of Australia's population.

* The Parliament and the public might have expected the Minister's statement to reflect the importance and magnitude of the issues involved, an analysis of Australia's past **immigration** policies, some assessment of the recommendations of the National Population Inquiry, a guide to the major issues identified by the Green Paper.

* A recurrent theme in the statement is the relationship between economic growth and the level of **immigration**.

* The Minister attempts to imply that Australia's future prosperity depends on high levels of **immigration** comparable with those of the post-war period being maintained for the next 30 years.

* Australia enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, and our **immigration** policies substantially assisted and promoted this development.

* Without a substantial **immigration** program, shortages of labour would have resulted from this reduced recruitment to the work force and would have restrained Australia's economic growth in the post-war period.

* The Committee of Economic Inquiry chaired by  Dr J.  Vernon reported in 1965 that one of the major costs of Australian **immigration** policy was the diversion of capital from investment to improved industrial productivity, to the provision of roads, houses, schools and other services for our increased population.

* The Vernon report also noted that **immigration** tended to raise the level of imports in the medium term without appreciably raising exports and leads to overcrowding and environmental deterioration of the cities.

* Under the heading "The Effect of **Immigration** on Populations' the Green Paper stated: 
Just as in Australia, the Canadians have realised that **immigration** exercises a pervasive influence on the whole of the political and cultural evolution of the national life.

* Equated with a previous Australian slogan of 'Populate or Perish' are a whole series of earlier arguments in favour of **immigration** which are familiar to Australians.

* The Canadian Green Paper on this subject questions the validity of these assumptions in a modern industrialised and increasingly urbanised society, it calls them ' dubious Mt states: 
The Canadian Green Paper is scathing in referring to the view that the competitiveness of Canadian industry would benefit from a larger domestic market, a major factor in post war **immigration**, and one on which much of the 1966 immigraton policies were based.

* The Bureau predicts that even without **immigration** the age group IS to 19, from which most of the new entrants to the work force are drawn, will exceed the level of present years peaking in 1978 and again in 1988.

* In fact there is every reason to believe that an increased **immigration** program would aggravate Australia's unemployment problem in the short term, particularly amongst the young.

* The Vernon inquiry noted that if a shortage of labour leads to an increase in the total **immigration** program this would be a more costly source of skill than to train the additional labour in Australia.

* For too long Australia's **immigration** policies, particularly the recruitment of skilled labour, has been a substitute for technical education programs designed to train and utilise Australian labour more effectively.

* His statement quite deliberately attempted to create the impression that Australia faces negative population growth in the short term and a decline in total population in the absence of a substantial **immigration** program.

* He said: 
Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an **immigration** gain, Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Past high levels of fertility and the input into the population of many thousands of young adults through **immigration** have produced an age structure with high proportions in the young child-bearing ages.

* Having been denied these justifications for a high rate of **immigration**, the Minister returned to the empty continent syndrome and implied that we must utilise our superabundant natural resources or have them taken from us.

* In fact he went even further than this when he asserted: 
If Australia adopts a high intake **immigration** policy in the future it will stand alone amongst the industrialised nations with which we usually compare ourselves.

* A series of Canadian Green Papers also questioned the value and impact of significant levels of **immigration** in the future.

* The New Zealand inquiry went on to count the cost of increased population and **immigration** and their impact on the environment.

* The Government and the nation must carefully consider this overwhelming body of overseas evidence that suggests that Australia should carefully re-assess its past **immigration** programs before extending them to our pop11lation policy for the year 2000.

* I again wish to commend the Australian Population and **Immigration** Council for its work in preparing this Green Paper, but I also intend to offer what I hope will be viewed as constructive criticism of the structure and functioning of the Council.

* Our population policies will determine the nature of Australian society in the year 2000 just as our past **immigration** programs have changed Australia over the last 30 years.

* Before any informed decision can be made about Australia's **immigration** policies the Government and the Parliament must be supplied with accurate population statistics and with adequate and up-to-date information about our present demographic patterns and the distribution of our population.

* I believe that it is absolutely essential and a vital prerequisite before an objective, intelligent approach can be made to population policy in general and particularly **immigration** policy.

* -Debates on questions of **immigration** always worry me because for many years we of course accepted the proposition that we had to populate or perish.

* But I wonder on what grounds the assumption is made that the standard of living of the community has been raised specifically by **immigration**.

* So when one comes to weigh up the advantages to Australia one should not be too glib about assuming that all the advances, or an enormous proportion of the advances in our standard of well-being, have been due to **immigration**.

* The Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  during his remarks on 30 March last year and again recently made some other observations on which I would like to comment.

* One of the arguments put forward in this whole **immigration** argument is that we need the migrants because that is the only way to get young people to help to support the old people.

* That is a lot of people, and yet the Government is still talking about **immigration**.

* Minister for **Immigration**, the Honourable A. J. Forbes, M.C.

* He will also answer questions on matters for which the Department of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is responsible The other representational arrangements in that chamber will be:  Senator Wright,  the portfolios of Foreign Affairs, Education and Science, Labour and National Service, Housing and External Territories;  Senator Cotton,  the portfolios of Trade and Industry, National Development, Shipping and Transport, Customs and Excise, and Interior;  'Senator DrakeBrockman,  the portfolios of Primary Industry, Army, Repatriation and Navy;  Senator Greenwood,  the portfolios of Attorney-General, Postmaster-General, **Immigration**, and Social Services, including Aboriginal Affairs.

* My only intent was to slight the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  but certainly not the previous  Speaker.

* Despite the elation of the Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  that the unemployment figures apparently dropped marginally in February, the fact that more than 300 000 Australians are unemployed is simply not good enough.

* One cannot help but feel that had the Government's economic and tariff policies been different much of this expenditure would not have been necessary, and perhaps the Sl.lm provided in the Appropriation Bill for the purpose of engaging extra staff for the Department of Labor and **Immigration** could have been saved or put to a more productive purpose.

* I wish to raise a matter with the Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch).

* He claims that on one occasion about  12  months ago, or a little more, two officials from the Department of **Immigration** and a third party interviewed him and questioned him for nearly  2  hours.

* It transpired during the course of the interview that the third party with the two **Immigration** officials was allegedly an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agent and that this ASIO agent informed  Mr Vorstman  that if he was prepared to become an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - that is an informer on the Communist Party, on political activity and on general radical movements in the community - this would favourably influence the outcome of his application for Australian citizenship.

* It would be highly undesirable for the Department of **Immigration** to be working hand in glove in this way with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

* But it would be even more undesirable that an ASIO agent in company with officials of the Department of **Immigration** should be in a position to say to  Mr Vorstman  or to any other person seeking Australian citizenship that although he was having difficulty and had been having difficulty for some time in obtaining Australian citizenship a more favourable attitude might very well develop on the part of officialdom if that person became an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

* The Department of **Immigration** repeatedly replies to  Mr Vorstman  in the following terms: 
One does not need to be a Sherlock Holmes to conclude very easily that his application is refused because he is a member of the Communist Party.

* The Minister for **Immigration**  (Mr Lynch),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  or any other Minister in the Government - not even that great democrat who looks after the Department of External Territories - has not a right to deprive a person of citizenship in this country if he meets normal requirements and standards which are not regarded as illegal if they are held by other Australian citizens.

* asked the Minister for **Immigration** and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 1979: 
How many of these persons were granted **immigration** visas.

* The Minister for Labor and **Immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  lives in a fairy tale world.

* That is the record of the present Minister for Labor and **Immigration**.

* Certainly the Government stepped beyond the role of honest broker when the Minister for Labor and **Immigration** appeared on television last year to support a 35-hbur week for power workers in New South Wales.
