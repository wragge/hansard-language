## Contexts in which the word "immigration" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* At the lowest level there is the simple question of illegal **immigration**, illegal fishing and so forth.

* Sir Laurence  said that instead of doing this we are bringing in, by mass **immigration**, more pick and shovel workers, for pick and shovel methods.

* I now deal with an area of specific interest to me at the moment because of my involvement in **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* I also acknowledge the statement made by the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the Member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Moss Cass),  when I tabled the Committee's seventh annual report.

* The problems of local govern ment have increased due to booming population growth which has been caused partly by an unplanned influx from **immigration**.

* Nobody on the Government side has explained to us yet how the Government intends to maintain our **immigration** intake if it abolishes the tariff system, which some honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  want.

* In the long term, the consequences of the loss of this human potential and potential consumer demand will be reflected in fewer employment opportunities in this country unless we are prepared to engage in a massive **immigration** program to try to fill this great land of ours.

* I refer to price control, **immigration** and industrial sanctions as examples.

* The distinguished member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  is uncertain as to whether or not he is any longer able to represent the concensus in the Australian Labor Party on its attitude to **immigration**.

* Full employment and **immigration** go together.

* Indonesia's continuing help in forestalling unheralded arrivals of refugees is very much appreciated, for it is much easier for Australia to take in a significant number of refugees, I believe, when this is done in an orderly way and under proper **immigration** procedures and not arriving unheralded on our coastline.

* If the statistics which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has given are correct, the **immigration** programme of which we boast - and rightly so - is a concealed failure because apparently there are more abortions than there are people coming into this country, after deducting the number of departing migrants.

* I would like to think that the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation would try to encourage the dairy industry to look at the possibility of a European-type veal production, particularly in Sydney where we have an enormous continental population as a result of the **immigration** program that has been operating since the Great War.

* The largest increase was 188,000 in 1969-70 but this was a year of very high **immigration**, when net settler arrivals totalled 159,000, including 72,300 workers.

* Many of the schools were built in the 1890s and today we have a massive **immigration** programme with migrants nocking into these schools which have no proper facilities to cope with them.

* This will probably overshadow what occurred one or two years ago and would cause quite a strain to those persons and would cause great strains on our infrastructure here including our **immigration** program and our schools.

* It has refused to review the **immigration** program in spite of the continued tightening of the labor market.

* The plain fact is that a member has not the time to read them for the simple reason that by the time he has dealt with constituency matters - social services, telephone complaints, complaints about **immigration** and the like - there is no time left to undertake the study, research and reading that he should be doing.

* Of course, the honourable member for Grayndler questioned his Party's **immigration** policy and he had very good reason to question it in view of some of his Party's policies which seem to be shunted around at the present time.

* There is on the notice paper a motion that the House take note of papers in relation to **immigration** presented by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly).

* After 25 years of a massive **immigration** scheme we still have not sorted out what ought to be done properly to recognise overseas professional qualifications.

* The honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean)  might have imagined it was an **immigration** debate for all the interest he was taking.

* We have brought forward positive policies in relation to **immigration**, education, all areas of government, exercising a degree of restraint in the national interest.

* 1 firmly believe that the Minister, not the Secretary, should have the final word, as is the case, for example, with **immigration** referrals.

* on earth; that we have eagerly supported the most unpopular war in modern times, on the ground that Asia should be a battle-ground of our freedom; that we fail to oppose the sale of arms to South Africa; that the whole world believes that our **immigration** policy is based on colour and that we run one of the world's last colonies.

* If we are going to put **immigration** in reverse and send people to live somewhere else because we cannot get them jobs here in factories, which are the only places in which they can get jobs, we are going to be in a pretty sorry state.

* In terms of the Federal powers relating to customs, **immigration**, disease control, defence, poaching and fishing the control of these waters is obviously a Commonwealth responsibility.

* Probably the most shameful episode of the period of conservative **immigration** policy occurred just before we assumed office in 1972.

* It is also quite clear that the labour force is not as docile as it was when this country was implementing massive **immigration** programs.

* The threat is more acute in those cases where there has been large-scale **immigration** of ethnic Russians, such as in Latvia, whose people and language have already been overwhelmed in the main cities.

* That projection was based on a net **immigration** gain of 50 000 people per annum and an assumed continuation of the presently low level of fertility.

* From time to time we will hear people associated with the **immigration** policies of this country and some industry leaders saying that we need more skilled tradesmen; that the only way we will get skilled tradesmen is to have a greater inflow of migrants.

* Thirdly, we took action to ensure that we would reduce the **immigration** inflow in order to minimise the impact upon employment figures because over the Christmas period approximately 190,000 people will come into the work force from secondary schools and from tertiary education levels.

* Those we call our allies are aware of our **immigration** policy that excludes most of those with coloured skin.

* In past decades of high **immigration** and rapid industrial development, there was a general presumption that all foreign investment should be welcomed.

* The latter suggests that the ethnic element must be a permanent feature of this land and this pre-supposes that **immigration** will be a continuing thing at the levels we have seen previously and that we will have a continuing quantum of new Australians within our community.

* Thus in 1971 a backbencher was able to claim that during his 2 years in Parliament there had been no full scale debate on urban development, pollution, conservation, education, road safety, transport, social services, the rural crisis, tariffs or **immigration**.

* Is the **immigration** policy of the Commonwealth, which continues to place pressures on the States, one of the reasons for the refusal of the States to accept the proposed new agreement?

* Inflationary pressures, lower birth rates, reduced **immigration**, changing patterns of consumption expenditure as incomes rise and the industrial development of other countries in our region, have all contributed to a major change in outlook for manufacturing industry in Australia.

* Indeed, the Commonwealth Government is involved because of its responsibilities for **immigration** and entry laws, for Commonwealth benefits that are paid for medical services and for general public health.

* Does a Liberal-Country Party Government intend to reduce expenditure on the **immigration** program?

* Before moving into the area of my special concern, **immigration** and ethnic affairs, I shall make a number of general remarks about the Budget.

* If I may say so, I then concluded those remarks by saying that as far as I was concerned and this Government was concerned we do not propose to alter the liberalised policy we now have in any basic way because I believe it is working and working well and is far more generous than the **immigration** policies of the other countries in the world which most often tend to criticise our policy.

* Population policy, including **immigration**; natural resource policy, including exports of natural resources; science policy, including research policy; technology policy, including pollution control; educational policy and urban policy will all be influenced by the comprehensive environmental policy.

* When the elected Cabinet agrees on those recommendations- it is that elected Ministry which must have the final say- those plans about growth rates must be converted into energy needs, manpower needs, **immigration** needs and education needs in order to make decisions on what should be the key industries, decisions on the protection of full employment in this country and decisions in many other related areas.

* With our **immigration** policy and the growth in the number of young people, the demand for homes will increase.

* After a person reads an advertisement, the next step is for him to see the Australian **immigration** officers in the United Kingdom to be counselled, to make specific inquiries and to be given literature^ - for example, a pamphlet on wage rates and employment opportunities, which is amended at least 3 or 4 times a year and contains all the information to which the honourable gentleman alluded and which is available to the potential migrant - before even making a decision to apply to come to the country and before coming into contact with a selection officer and a counselling officer who are there to see that the potential migrant has available to him accurate information about current conditions in Australia.

* The post-war **immigration** program means that the average Australian today has an ethnic origin of groups and nations all over the world and not the predominant British group as he formerly did.

* Many of those people who voted for Labor in the last elections now realise 4 months later that the situation has grown so bad in Australia that we have had to drastically curtail the **immigration** program started after the Second World War by a previous Labor Government.

* Whilst we spend - and must spend - large sums of money on **immigration** there is an even more urgent need to assist the large family that is already here.

* Additionally the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the treaty will provide for the broader co-operation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements in the Protected Zone.

* With **immigration** flowing strongly, there should be a further large addition - more than 3% - to the work-force.

* Taking into account the way in which the Government adjusts its **immigration** policy, it is not correct that in all cases the arrival of migrants lessens the employment opportunities for Australians who are unemployed.

* Honourable members would be well aware of the list of acceptable occupations for the purpose of **immigration**.

* The Australian Labor Party believes in a high standard of living, full employment, an expanding economy and a continuation of the **immigration** programme, lt is the Labor Party's belief also that workers are entitled to good conditions, long service leave, annual holidays and adequate wages.

* It is ridiculous, almost to the point of suicidal folly, for us to be thinking in terms of **immigration** programs when we are literally paying abortionists to slaughter potential population.

* I will refer to what was stated by the previous Minister for Labor and **immigration**  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  when he quoted from a Treasury minute in the year 1971-72.

* I think that we must have a very firm look at our **immigration** policy.

* 45 of 1972, relating to the Australian Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* As the honourable gentleman would be aware if he has followed the statements made by the Government, the administration of the **immigration** pro gramme has been remarkably sensitive to the situation of employment in Australia.

* However, if the program is introduced in part without the proposals that are intended to make it a more efficient and a well worth while operation then I think we will be making a big mistake because in the time I have been in this House - and it has only been short - matters relating to the Post Office, in common with social service and **immigration** matters, have been the major matters of complaint that have come to me and that I have had to raise on behalf of my constituents.

* It is a good thing that we have an **immigration** programme because the maternity allowance of $30 to $35 has been unchanged since 1943, almost 29 years ago.

* 1 submit that **immigration** ought to be stopped until unemployment has dropped below the current level.

* I do not know where the idea of a Cities Commission fits in with the Labor Party's idea of reducing the **immigration** intake and its advocacy of a zero population growth, limiting families to 2 children, as has been stated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on various occasions How do we build a country in that way and how will development survive?

* This must require more capital intensive industries in the future, and the only prospect of changing the trend would appear to be the reintroduction of a much more positive **immigration** policy combined with family development policies to encourage more, young people to have larger families.

* Is it a fact that this Committee discussed such matters as trade with the People's Republic of China, **immigration** and selected treaty matters?

* The motion is deliberately limited to matters of Commonwealth responsibility, in that this Parliament has the constitutional power to make laws with respect to external affairs, emigration and **immigration**, and trade and commerce with other countries, for instance, civil aviation.

* I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for **immigration**, Australian families, the numbers of children born in Australia and the rights of Australian children, old, young and even unborn.

* We recognise that there are many people in this country who come from other lands, but surely the spirit of **immigration** is that if a person adopts Australia as his homeland it is his bounden duty to act in the best interests of Australia and Australians.

* It has long been a general rule in **immigration** cases that the specific reasons for the refusal to grant a visa should not be disclosed.

* The Commonwealth is responsible for the important functions of defence and **immigration**.

* They include economic growth, population growth including **immigration**, defence, development of industry, Aboriginal advancement, development of education, improvement of health facilities and equity in the tax system including estate duty and personal income tax.

* I am a member of the Government parties' **immigration** and ethnic affairs committee and I know that we have a serious problem with our population growth.

* While 1 concede that all members on the other side do not sympathise with the attitude of this particular group - and I commend the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  for his question to the Prime Minister on Tuesday - it seems to me that there is an attitude of racial superiority prevalent amongst some honourable members on the other side that is demonstrated in the Government policies toward South East Asia - in particular Vietnam - towards New Guinea with its paternalistic colonialism, its **immigration** policy and its inability to carry out a concerted attack on the question of Aboriginal advancement.

* From these figures tables are produced which project the labour force under various assumptions, including constant participation rates as of August 1978 and projected participation rates from long term trends and **immigration** assumptions.

* We are confronted with these problems in Australia - particularly, of course in Sydney and Melbourne - and they are rapidly being compounded as more and more people, whether from natural increase, **immigration** or drift from the country areas, come to where job opportunities exist.

* I am quite prepared to hear and debate a statement on **immigration** but I am not having it tied up with the question of me answering a charge that has been made against me in this Parliament this morning.

* There has developed a tendency to obtain a labour force either from inexperienced peasants imported under the Commonwealth **immigration** scheme - Professor Dunphy quoted an employer as saying to him: 'If new Australians cease to come in, where will we get our labour for these sorts of industries?'

* Last year the League of Rights played on dormant racist feelings in the community by its overt support of the South African sporting teams and it attempted to gain some political mileage over minor changes in the Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* In view of the cutbacks in the level of **immigration**, what action is his Government taking to overcome these shortages, apart from the proposals in relation to industrial training initiated by the former Government and which are necessarily not short term in their impact?

* We see, from page 16 of the Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** policies and population tabled last Thursday, that the annual increase in the labour force for 1976 was somewhere between 100 000 and 115 000 people.

* Is it a fact that Australia 's reliance upon **immigration** as a source of skilled tradesmen denies training opportunities to thousands of unemployed young people, causing unnecessarily high levels of" youth unemployment?

* This will barely offset the rises in costs due to inflation and will not take into account the increase in the population of children in schools, an increase due to **immigration**, our own birth rate and also the longer time children are now expected to stay at school.

* I was reinforced in this view recently when I noted that those States made a statement upon **immigration** which has long been accepted as a Commonwealth function.

* We all know what happened to him when he supported Australia's **immigration** policy Kapow!

* In addition there will have to be an added impetus in respect of selected **immigration** to build up our building force.

* In fact, this has occurred despite the fact that Australia has embraced a stagnant or very slowly growing work force and **immigration** rates have been altered to bring down the unemployment rates.

* I turn now to the question of **immigration**.

* Often, the increase in popolation is the direct result of Commonwealth policies, particularly with regard to **immigration**.

* In particular the Commissioner mentioned the agencies of bankruptcy, **immigration** and foreign exchange.

* Will the Prime Minister answer this parochial question from an undistinguished back bencher with 50 years honorary service in the Australian Labor Party: Is it the intention of the Government to relax the **immigration** laws of this country to allow Japanese workers to be employed in the motor car industry in Australia?

* The main engines of urban growth in Australia in the last 20 years have been the Federal Government's twin projects of rapid industrialisation and large scale **immigration**.

* The Government hopes to be able to offset the present population situation by **immigration**.

* The Government goes all out to people the cities, with its **immigration** programme, but then washes its hands of what is to become of the people.

* I have availed myself of the opportunities I have had since 1956 of trying also to strengthen greatly the fabric of Australian manufacturing industry because here is a tremendous base of our strength - the base in which most employment is to be found and therefore the base upon which our **immigration** policy depends.

* The letter 'Z' is used for statistical purposes only and denotes a person granted a visa for entry to Australia as a migrant under policy relating to non-European **immigration** adopted by the Government in March 1966.

* The Government has cut down on **immigration** so as not to add to the level of the unemployed, and for doing that we are criticised.

* They must be able to take decisions without reference to higher authority and must scrupulously observe all **immigration**, customs and financial regulations.

* Of course throughout the 1930s the **immigration** to Palestine was greatly increased through the Nazi terrorism.

* With respect to the total **immigration** intake, as I have said before in this House, I am not at liberty at this stage to say what the Government's deliberations will be, but I shall keep the honourable member's comments in mind.

* We wanted to work towards an objective of l.l per cent increase or thereabouts from natural growth of population and **immigration** intake.

* The interrelation of population distribution in toto - the whole population distribution of any political area - and of urbanisation - the process by which towns grow and by which, in recent history, an increasing proportion of the total population finds itself in those towns as distinct from the countryside and which in turn affects the issues of **immigration**, decentralisation and quality of life - must be recognised and given practical attention.

* We still have a continuing **immigration** programme.

* This paper attempts to analyse the contribution of **immigration**, internal migration and natural increase of the growth of the 10 urban centres of more than 100,000 people for the period 1966- 1971.

* The availability of tradesmen under the **immigration** program is a diminishing factor.

* It has blocked our policies on housing, **immigration** and many other subjects.

* The lower birth rates, the reduced **immigration**, the changing patterns of consumption expenditure as incomes rise, and the industrial development of other countries in our region have all contributed to a major change in outlook for manufacturing industry in Australia.

* Given that **immigration** is presently contributing some 20 per cent of tradesmen entering the Australian workforce and given the known willingness and suitability of thousands of young Australians to undertake trade training, one would imagine that any rational and sane government would be committing itself to a major reorganisation of trade training and financial support.

* Consular, commercial and **immigration** activities from the areas formerly handled by the post in Bombay, have all increased since its closure in 1976.

* It also provides thoughtful, informed and some very trenchant views on the policy options available to Australia on crucial matters: How we should adjust to the rapid economic growth now taking place to our north; how we should conduct our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations; how far our interests coincide with general Western interests in relation to the Third World; what our posture should be in the United Nations and other international forums; what principles should inform our policies on such matters as aid, human rights, **immigration** and refugees.

* The growth in domestic demand and employment has been strong, stable and sustained, and it has been due essentially to the Government's unwavering commitment to full employment, its pursuit of wide-ranging manpower policies, including **immigration**, and an effective national employment service.

* After ali, it has long been the policy of this Government that the **immigration** requirements of any country are matters solely for the judgment of the country concerned.

* First, there is the question that might be summarised as **immigration**.

* His post-war achievement was marked by the commencement of an **immigration** scheme which I believe will immortalise him.

* These refugees should not be allowed to languish on Cyprus or anywhere else because Australia is too niggardly to send more **immigration** officers or more medical officers to Nicosia.

* With its lack of cultivatable land and its limited resources the West Bank has been an area of emigration rather than **immigration**.

* However, in any event, action in respect of **immigration** of overseas medical practitioners will follow from further consideration of the recommendations of the report of the Committee of Officials on Medical Manpower Supply, tabled in Parliament on 22 March 1 979.

* Coupled with growth policies of full employment, particularly in the cities where most manufacturing industries are located, the high level of **immigration** and these inflationary characteristics are virtually wrecking many of the unprotected rural industries.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of a revival of Swedish **immigration** to Australia?

* I mentioned overseas capital, questions relating to national development, education, the crisis in the primary industries, the need for a real policy of decentralisation of population, the need to deal with urban problems, the need to deal with **immigration** and the need to achieve a national identity which involves the quality of life and films which we make ourselves.

* As I see things with the considerable wordly experience which I have, the legislation is intended to tighten our **immigration** laws relating to passports.

* In the United States of America the clothing industry was started at the turn of the century by the great wave of Jewish **immigration** that took place, and later on the Italians entered the industry.

* Australia has nothing to apologise for in its current **immigration** policy.

* and (3) As I have announced, the future emphasis of **immigration** programmes will be on the re-union of immediate family members and sponsorship will also be given priority.

* In addition the Government has turned off the **immigration** tap in a quite unconscionable way.

* Our **immigration** policy is and will continue to be one of non-discrimination in the sense that eligibility criteria are applied in the same way to all people applying to migrate to Australia.

* These include civil aviation, cultural affairs, refugee problems, **immigration**, health, drug problems, travellers in distress, disaster relief, information services and numerous other responsibilities of government.

* However, lam informed that the number of unemployed registered at the end of October in the 3 Employment Office areas of Waverley, Boronia and Box Hill, only parts of which comprise the electoral division of Bruce, is as follows: 
Miss Morosi sponsored the **immigration** to Australia of a number of Filipino girls and forced them to work for $25 per week of which $ 10 weekly was paid as keep to Miss Morosi 's mother.

* Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, said it had found evidence that the organisation had systematically violated federal laws on taxes, **immigration**, banking, currency transactions and foreignagent registration, as well as state and local laws relating to charity fraud.

* My explanation arises out of the personal explanation which was just made by the Opposition spokesman on **immigration**, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes).

* My question is directed to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development who, in comments in this House today, mentioned the failure of the **immigration** programs of past governments to further decentralisation policies.

* In return for the thinnest of hopes, based on the flimsiest of logical foundation, governments of different political persuasions have imposed a price control stranglehold on British business and have been afraid to tax either corporations or individuals at realistic rates and have gone in for policies of levelling downwards which must soon begin to show themselves in the **immigration** rates.

* In regard to the preservation of the homogeneity of our people and the preservation of our **immigration** restriction laws, my views are like the laws of the Medes and the Persians - they are unchanged and unchangeable.

* Meanwhile consular and **immigration** services are also available at the Embassy in Damascus.

* Is it a fact that States' Agents-General in London have complained to the Home Secretary regarding the discrimination against and treatment of Australians entering Great Britain by **immigration** officials.

* The general position in relation to Vietnamese 'boat people ' is that they are given temporary entry permits to regularise their **immigration** status while investigations continue.

* The general position in relation to Vietnamese 'boat people ' is that they are given temporary entry permits to regularise their **immigration** status while investigations continue.

* From the point of view of the allocations - 
The question has been construed as referring to expenditure incurred for all **immigration** purposes as distinct from the costs involved directly in recruitment of migrants and passage assistance only.

* Details of such expenditure, together with revenue received by the Department of Immigra- and other sources, are shown in the following tion from migrant contributions to passage costs table: 
There were no Australians held in **immigration** camps on the 18th March 1971.

* The general position in relation to Vietnamese 'boat people' is that they are given temporary entry permits to regularise their **immigration** status while investigations continue.

* The problems associated with illegal **immigration** and so on are also involved.

* According to the story, the Leader of the Opposition had claimed that the News and Information Bureau's role was to promote **immigration**, tourism and trade.

* 'I suppose a lot of it has been occasioned by the **immigration**- by people coming here. '

* Industrial action - we are told that industrial disputes cost us  2i  million man days a year when there are  5i  million man days worked each day - more and better **immigration** and the size of the armed forces always appear as numbers and statistics, but never are any background information and reasonably accurate reports by qualified inquirers given as to what the expected requirements are or will be.

* 1 ) Did the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration recommend in general terms that where the principal interest for Australian representation in a foreign country was the responsibility of a department other than the Department of Foreign Affairs, such as trade or **immigration**, that the Australian Ambassador or High Commissioner should be appointed from that department.

* In the personal explanation I told the Parliament that it was not true that I had refused to give the Opposition an opportunity to see what was in the Stonehouse file, that the spokesman for the Opposition on **immigration** could have seen the file, that my personal secretary had indicated to him that the file would be available.

* It is not only in this area but, I have been informed, in other areas also that the Minister has been inclined to make statements announcing policies and **immigration** officers overseas have not known anything about them.

* The Government's **immigration** policy is  designed to give priority to the re-union of families in Australia.

* For example, the labour force grew quickly under the influence of **immigration** and increased participation rates.

* We remember in the last 12 months or so the Leader of the Opposition's repudiation on **immigration** of the honourable member for Grayndler, the architect of Labor's **immigration** policy.

* The only records available in respect of crews of overseas vessels are the crew lists which are submitted primarily for customs and **immigration** purposes and which lists all persons on board.

* How many of the Vietnamese who entered Australia without permits, but who were subsequently given temporary entry permits to regularise their **immigration** status while investigations continue, are now receiving (a) sickness, (b) unemployment and (c) any other social security benefit.

* While our **immigration** programme has had very good intentions, because of the interpretation placed on it people in other countries say that we are 'anti them'.

* If this had been done in the past our **immigration** programme would have been much more successful and many more migrants would have stayed in Australia.

* In my own mind I have the feeling that if we suddenly reduce the intake of migrants we might create unemployment; that in fact the pressures (hat **immigration** creates might well be some of those that have created full employment.

* I believe that the time has come for a proper evaluation of all the things that come under the heading of **immigration**, and that that will be achieved only if we do it in a bi-partisan way as a result of a committee of inquiry, as we have advocated here this evening. 
)

* The amounts paid for air travel for the Labor Group of the former Department of Labor and Immigration during 1973-74 and 1974-75 were: 
 Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a brief ministerial statement on **immigration**.

* What I have continually stated, both in writing and in speech, is that over the past 23 years Australia's growth in population has been 1.9 per cent - that is, 1.1 per cent natural growth and 0.8 per- cent growth from **immigration**.

* I have advocated that we should work towards a 1 per cent increase in population which will include both **immigration** and natural growth.

* I am informed that British **immigration** officers are instructed to extend all assistance and courtesies to the holder of any diplomatic passport.

* Xenophobic economics holds that **immigration** causes inflation, unemployment, capital loss, depletion of resources, housing shortages, inordinate strains on community facilities, excessively high economic growth and, of course, excessively low economic growth.

* The same people who told us 18 months ago that **immigration** must stop because it costs up to $50,000 per migrant family to establish them by building houses, roads, schools, hospitals, etc., and that it was uneconomic to bring them in because they were really a manpower loss, tell us that we must stop **immigration** because they take all the jobs.

* I am not suggesting that **immigration** on a large scale does not cause problems, but for goodness sake let us be rational about it.

* The following table shows the nationality of the deportees, and grounds for deportation: 
In the period January-June 1973 the employment situation improved to such an extent that the **immigration** program for 1973-74 was established at the same level as for 1972-73.

* The reason that the statistics are not included is that the Australian **immigration** officers in the Lebanon, in Beirut at that stage, were working under extreme difficulties.

* 10) Does the Government have in mind the use of preventative officers on military vessels and aircraft to act in respect of civil matters such as illegal **immigration**, fishing, smuggling, illegal ship or aircraft entries.

* The Government proposes that the Assembly have complete legislative power and executive control over (the matters listed in the schedules), subject to a right of veto by the Administrator in respect of education, **immigration**, customs services and fishing.

* I do not presume that if this qualification were deleted the Commissioner would start appointing right and left the yellow peril, which is the term sometimes used in discussions on **immigration** policies; but he should, if he is an intelligent man, be able to select good non-British subjects as teachers.

* I ask the Prime Minister whether he can say what would be the effect on Australia of an **immigration** policy confined solely to sponsorship by Australian residents of relatives and friends, without the exercise of discrimination.

* These new programs are in addition to the existing schemes of NEAT and **immigration** where there is a strong emphasis on labour market needs.

* The emphasis of my Government's **immigration** policy will be on the reunion of families and the welfare of migrants already in Australia.

* The expenditure for 1969-70 shown underItem 330/4/08 of Appropriation Bill No.1 1970-71 covers two distinct **immigration** schemes - 
The Doomsday Syndrome' by John Maddox.

* **immigration**'s Role in Australian Population Policies', an address to the 1972 Metropolitan International Relations Seminar (Association of Apex Clubs) at Picton (New South Wales) by The  Hon.

* A total of $169,200 has been allocated for **immigration** information activities in the United Kingdom in 1 976-77.

* Equally clearly, this is not sufficient and Australia must proceed with our controlled **immigration** programme and bring into Australia the most suitable people available, having regard to the economic circumstances from time to time.

* I believe that it is a matter of great regret that the long standing bipartisan policy on **immigration** was abandoned by the Australian Labor Party at its Launceston Conference this year.

* The controlled **immigration** policy instituted many years ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and supported until recently by the great majority of the people on the other side of the chamber appears to have been discarded.

* It has been a vital part of the success of our **immigration** programme that migrants be regarded and treated in all respects as human beings, not merely as statistics in terms of population growth or increased work force.

* I pay a very sincere tribute to the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  and to  Sir Tasman  Heyes for the magnificent work they did in the early post-war years in launching what has been the largest and most successful **immigration** programme of any country.

* The major proposed increases of expenditure on **immigration** in this Bill relate to migrant education services.

* That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Grayndler making a statement on the **immigration** policy of the Australian Labour  Party as  I know  it  and interpret  it.

* The only **immigration** requirement in such circumstances is sound health.

* A total of 794 persons who had entered the country legally and who have since contravened the Commonwealth's **immigration** laws were deported in the period 1 January1978 to 20 March1979.

* Hashis attention been- drawn to an incident in December 1971 at the **immigration** barrier at Heathrow Airport in London involving  Sir John  Pagan, New South Wales Agent-General in London.

* He is cutting away the **immigration** program.

* With the passing of this legislation, this will be necessary not only to protect our fishing resources but also to control illegal **immigration** and smuggling.

* High **immigration** was particularly destructive of social well-being in times of high unemployment in Australia.

* Of the Australian Conservation Foundationwelcomed  the condemnation by the Federal Labor spokesman on **immigration**,  Dr Cass.

* Did he publicly state at Sydney airport, in July 1973, that **immigration** inquiries at Australian Government offices in the United States of America were a record; if so, why.

* Clause 8 states: 
For the information of honourable members I present a review of the activities of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for the year ended 30 June 1978. 
and (2) Under Australia's migrant screening procedures, all applications are assessed to ascertain whether applications meet basic eligibility criteria for **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
Is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that proprietors of fish and chip shops, among others, are having great difficulty in obtaining unskilled workers and that these proprietors are being disadvantaged by the present **immigration** policy of excluding such likely workers coming from overseas on the grounds that such workers are still available in Australia?

* Also, Australian **immigration** officers visited Guam and are now in Hong Kong.

* 1 ) The nationalities of applicants approved for **immigration** under the entrepreneur policy up to 30 June 1 978 are indicated in the following table.

* Be it resolved that this Conference calls on the Commonwealth Heads of Government to persuade those countries to establish and maintain non-racist **immigration** policies.

* I do not recall stating that **immigration** inquiries at Australian Government offices in the United States of America were a record.

* I submit it is more than expecting an immigrant only to settle into the Australian community for the purposes of the **immigration** laws.

* What has been the cost of terminating or re-negotiating the lease of each diplomatic, consular, **immigration** and trade post which has been closed this year.

* We had Burmese selling our **immigration** papers on the streets.

* If they do so they will see that whenever the Prime Minister or  Mr Grassby  visited South East Asia there was an enormous increase in applications for **immigration** to Australia.

* I might also ask the honourable member for Grayndler whether he remembers his persistent attacks upon the Leader of the Opposition on the question of whether or not the approach of the Leader of the Opposition to the **immigration** problem fits in with the Labor Party's platform.

* The honourable gentleman must ensure that his remarks are relevant to the matter before the chair, namely, the question that the House take note of the paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The Government's Green Paper and the Borrie report tend to suggest that the major input in the future will be from **immigration**.

* I am pleased that we should continue our **immigration** program provided it brings in people who are compatible with the work force, who can work, who can contribute to our society or people who ought to be admitted on humanitarian grounds.

* We must stimulate proper **immigration**, namely, **immigration** that is compatible with our economic requirements.

* Australia does not maintain an **immigration** office in Rhodesia.

* I informed the House at that time that the Embassy had moved from its official quarters to a hotel in the middle of Beirut and that the persons dealing with the **immigration** inquiries there were doing so at some considerable risk to themselves.

* When persons make representations concerning **immigration** matters I provide them with information concerning those matters.

* In those circumstances this population and **immigration** statement is a very important one, but it is also a little distorted.

* It ought to be understood that **immigration** is part of a population policy; **immigration** is not the totality of a population policy.

* Yet as I look through this Green Paper I see that 1 per cent of it is devoted to a consideration of population policy and 99 per cent is devoted to **immigration**.

* In this respect I believe in the words and in the philosophy, which were enunciated so well after World War II, that **immigration** is a very valuable addition to the Australian population; it ought not to be a substitute for it.

* We acknowledge immediately that they might do these things purely for economic reasons, but the simple facts are that in at least four of the countries of eastern Europe which were beset with very great population problems and to which **immigration** is not allowed their birth rates have increased substantially over the last 4 years.

* All that I am saying is that I hope the Government as part of its consideration of a population **immigration** policy does not put those considerations and countries aside altogether.

* In respect of the **immigration** part of the program, the trotting out of the old argument that **immigration** itself causes inflation or causes a decrease in capital stock, that kind of argument was taken care of, defeated and put aside at the Premiers' Conferences in the early 1950s- in 1953, 1954 and 1955.

* It is also clear from the document that the committee looks at **immigration** not as a short term measure but as one which continues for decades.

* Although we have a relatively fully employed economy we still do not have enough workers, so much so that we are running an **immigration** programme to get more workers.

* However, I feel some revulsion when I read in the Press statements by various spokesmen for industry who support the continuation of an **immigration** programme - and this may well be justified - but, this is something that will be established by a current inquiry.

* He said that the Opposition was divided on its **immigration** policy.

* 1 believe that a full scale debate on **immigration** cannot be conducted under the circumstances which prevail in an estimates debate.

* I  believe it is important that from time to time we should examine the accepted norms of policies such as **immigration**.

* Because **immigration** has been largely bipartisan over almost the entire period of mass **immigration** to Australia since the Second World War, the policy itself, its aims and the manner in which it is carried out have not been subject to question.

* Because most members of this Parliament are agreed basically on **immigration** policy there has been no real examination of the cause and effect and the results of our post war **immigration** policy.

* It would be a worthwhile exercise and in the national interest for a real inquiry to be conducted into our **immigration** policies, the effects, the benefits and such detractions as **immigration** has brought about in the Australian community.

* Some time ago, about the beginning of 1970, Professor Wheelwright claimed that our **immigration** policy was absorbing such a large amount of available investment capital within Australia in order to provide the social structure to cope with an unnatural increase in population that the nation had been forced to allow overseas capital to obtain control of substantial proportions of our industry.

* I believe that it would be worth while to examine whether the conventional wisdom which has existed for so many years in relation to **immigration** is in fact wisdom or just blind ignorance.

* Honourable members have spoken about the effect of **immigration** on unemployment and about the priorities of this Government.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  made a particularly useful contribution to the whole question of the morality of **immigration**.

* There can be very little doubt that the great majority of the members of ethnic communities are very much concerned about the **immigration** program that this Government is now about to undertake.

* When he is developing proposals for which he does have some direct ministerial responsibility, such as **immigration** plans, he should have some care to take these factors into account.

* Looking again at the Minister's responsibilities directly for **immigration**, it would be mealy-mouthed to speak in a debate such as this without drawing attention to the very real concern felt about the performance of his Department in several significant areas.

* Indeed, I do not find it strange or unacceptable that the economist to whom reference has been made has a view on **immigration** - a matter of professional interest to any economist; nor do I believe that whatever views he does hold - and I must say that I am unaware of them in any detail - in fact will prejudice the objectivity of his research.

* I think that an **immigration** program that leads to that sort of situation is shocking.

* But more disturbing than that is the comment that the fall in **immigration** has dried up the traditional source of labour for the farms.

* One of the contractors said that stepping up the level of **immigration** is the only way in which to provide enough workers for the market gardeners.

* The Acting Minister for Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 

 - Mr Chairman, I wish to answer something that was said by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr 
As Acting Minister for Immigration I supply the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Acting Minister for Immigration has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
The Acting Minister for Immigration has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
The Acting Minister for Immigration has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
The following are the major source-areas for **immigration** under the Special Passage Assistance Programme: 
The statement was based on a report by the Immigration Planning Council which said, inter alia: 
The confusion and uncertainty created by the Prime Minister's actions in dismembering the Department of Immigration.

* The level of **immigration** from Iran will depend upon- 
No.

* It is an **immigration** case that should have been finalised long before this.

* In view of the reports from Vietnam of further boat loads of refugees being anticipated, can the Minister guarantee that Australian **immigration** procedures and policies will be sufficient to cope with these boat people as the trickle becomes a flood?

* I make this final point on the question of **immigration**: I am not one of those who believe **immigration** ought to be cut out.

* I am one who believes that an excellent argument can be made, for economic and other reasons, in favour of continuing **immigration** on a significant scale.

* I cannot remember who signed the particular articles; indeed I am not sure that they were signed at all, but they contain ridiculous propositions with which, deplorably, the Australian Conservation Foundation associates itself, to the effect that before the Government increases **immigration** it must consider the subject in the light of the Federal Environment Protection Act.

* Surely, if that is so, the same sort of thing should be done before it decreases **immigration**.

* In other words, if the **immigration** cutback by this Government were to continue Australia's population growth would stagnate at the present figure of around 13 million.

* As a result of this Government's policies the **immigration** program has been reduced from a peak of 185 000 in 1970 to an anticipated figure this year of approximately 45 000.

* Having created, by its tariffs and other policies, the largest pool of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression, the Government somehow believes it can cure the problem, or at least alleviate it, by cutting down on **immigration**.

* A vigorous and directed **immigration** program could well help re-stimulate the economy.

* An expansion of **immigration** would immediately lead to increased consumer demand.

* Not only has it failed to establish any connection between reducing **immigration** and improving the unemployment situation, but it has placed in jeopardy both our social structure and our long term national development.

* When the late member for Melbourne, the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, who was a good friend to many in this House, first designed and implemented our post-war **immigration** policy we had a population of some 7 million.

* I believe that the policy of the present Government towards **immigration** is wrong for a number of reasons.

* The reintroduction of a vigorous **immigration** program could do much to revitalise Australia.

* I call upon the Government to rethink seriously its present **immigration** policy.

* While the Minister fiddles, or rather talks, our traditional **immigration** program is crumbling into ruins.

* Mesmerised by the Minister's words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality British migrants of European origin, that the composition of our **immigration** program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them.

* What it means in essence is that while the Minister has been big-noting himself by claiming the previous Government's initiatives in migrant integration as his own, and emphasising the importance his Government attaches to **immigration**, he is by his actions in relation to the program storing up formidable integration problems for the future.

* Therefore, the Commission will give detailed attention to the development in other areas of social policy of an appreciation of the welfare implications of such matters as incomes policy, the taxation system, recreation, housing and **immigration** policy, urban development .

The Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians is governed by paragraph 5 of the United 
The attitude of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  is as follows: 
Why has not the Soviet Union honoured the Helsinki Pact with reference to freedom of **immigration**?

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
How many (a) black and (b) white Rhodesians have been granted residency under Australia's **immigration** program during each of the last three years.

1 ) The intake of refugees to Australia is a part of the total **immigration** program and the Government accepts that, where possible, programs for the settlement of refugees should be provided within the context of those for migrants generally.

* We are looking to increasing our population by large scale **immigration**.

* The Liberal Government which came to power in 1949 adopted Labor's **immigration** programme but not the associated regional development and decentralisation programme of the Department of Postwar Reconstruction.

* The Prime Minister is assuming a blind continuation of present population nonpolicies and the continuation of large scale **immigration**.

* He does not ever seem to realise that his own Department of Immigration is now cutting back severely on **immigration** because of the present unemployment situation.

* The Commonwealth, the body which is responsible foi **immigration**, has an internal debt which has remained nearly static during this period.

* We will progressively cut back on **immigration** to help us get on with the job of solving the problems of the cities.

* After the meeting in Paris, the Minister will visit Britain, Eire, West Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Malta, the United States and Canada to discuss with the Government's concerned problems and other matters relating to **immigration** programmes.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 May 1979: 
Yes, I am aware of newspaper reports to the effect that my Department is suggesting an increase in the **immigration** intake to 100 000 in the next year.

* -I would have thought that after being the shadow spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs for 17 months the honourable member would have understood that this matter comes within the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education.

* The previous Government had for many years been concerned and had acted to develop not only a resources diplomacy but also a trade diplomacy, an **immigration** diplomacy, an international transport diplomacy and many other diplomacies.

* Would the Minister tell me also whether it is not the normal practice for a captain of a foreign ship before sailing to report missing a crewman to the responsible Customs official who, in turn, reports the incident to the **immigration** authorities and State police, who endeavour to effect the arrest of the deserter by warrant with a view to his deportation?

* Of course sponsored **immigration** is no new thing.

* It has been a very important part of our programme, almost since the beginning of the post-war **immigration** programme.

* We propose to continue sponsored **immigration** as long as there is an **immigration** programme, particularly as it affects family reunion.

* The only reason why it has been necessary to raise the point that sponsorship patterns differ widely from country to country is that the Australian Labor Party has announced that it will base its approach to **immigration** virtually on sponsorship by friends, relatives and employers in Australia alone, in other words, virtually confining it to sponsorship.

* In a situation in which the apologists for the Labor Party tend to say that whatever the Labor Party says it will do things will remain the same, I think it important to say in relation to **immigration** that if the Labor Party does what it says it will do there will be a significant and radical change in the composition of our **immigration** programme.

* -It must have come as a great surprise to this House to learn that this Green Paper was the first that had been presented to the House in its history on the question of **immigration**.

* It is, I think, noticeable that of all things **immigration** has been the most bipartisan matter before this Parliament.

* Sure, the great **immigration** program of the recent decade was carried out under the aegis of a 
Liberal Government, but it was Arthur Calwell from the Labor Party who set that program on its course and we can regard this as a real bipartisan policy.

* The honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  very rightly pointed out that **immigration** was only one of the ways in which the population was increased and the optimum reached.

* This can be changed by **immigration**.

* So **immigration** has tailed off and it is no longer significantly contributing to the increase in our population.

* So there is reason why Australia should grow and there is reason, therefore, to have an **immigration** policy of a quite different order of magnitude from that which we have today.

I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social welfare policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian family codes and **immigration**, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia.

* Once eligibility on occupational grounds has been established and all the other criteria for **immigration** met, these applicants and their families are approved for **immigration** and issued visas on which the appropriate eligibility category code is entered.

* In fact, we have seen a discontinuance, largely, of the past **immigration** programs which have provided many of the skilled workers who contribute in this area.

* I affirm the statement that I made to my Federal Member of Parliament and which he repeated in Parliament; namely: I have never had an official letter or communication from the Department of **immigration** concerning my husband's deportation.

* In closing, I would hope that at some stage, instead of leaving it to the Galbally Committee, advisory councils and so on, we can have what the British Parliament has, namely, a parliamentary committee that looks at these questions of **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

The other point about aid is this: Every time we give to a country aid that blatantly assists people to act contrary to the Australian national interest the Government has a case to answer.

* This, together with the hard work of his Department, augurs well for the future of our **immigration** policy.

* As one who has been associated with **immigration** ever since I came into the Parliament I pay a tribute to the tremendous job they do and their keenness to co-operate with honourable members irrespective of party affiliations in every way and on every occasion.

* Undoubtedly Australia's record in the field of **immigration** is a very proud one.

* It compares more than favourably with the **immigration** records of other nations.

* It is because of our efficient **immigration** policy and the thoroughness with which we have attempted to assimilate these people that the great majority of them have become very good Australians.

* There have been accusations, as I have said before, that our **immigration** policy perhaps has aggravated unduly the trend towards inflation and rising costs, but we must balance that against what we have gained.

* Our **immigration** programme has been exceedingly successful, principally because we have moved with the times.

* As I said, the whole of our **immigration** programme has been aimed increasingly at making it possible for all the people we are bringing to Australia to become Australians as quickly as possible, to he assimilated and integrated into the community.

* Our **immigration** policy is a story of increasing success.

* Immigration, upon notice: 
and (b) The 'planned' component of the **immigration** intake is restricted to those migrants who possess professional, technical or trade skills recognised in Australia and for whom it is considered there is a strong and continuing demand.

* One would be led to believe by the remarks of the honourable member for Isaacs that the cause of all the problems of the building industry should be laid at the feet of this Government and its policies, including the responsible attitude that it has taken to the Australian **immigration** scheme which a former Labor Government introduced in the early years after World War II.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
1 ) Is an **immigration** office to be established in the Electoral Division of Riverina.

* I look at the letter tabled in this House today by the honourable member for Melbourne who is the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** matters.

* It left us with no **immigration** policy properly referrable to refugees.

* The senior Australian **immigration** officer remained in Beirut until the Embassy staff was withdrawn.

* Locally engaged staff, except for one or two people who endangered their own lives were unable to reach the hotel in which the **immigration** officer was operating.

* It was virtually impossible for those in the Lebanese community who may have sought to reach the **immigration** officer to do so.

* I have already given instructions that an **immigration** officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia.

* As soon as the situation in Beirut stabilises to the point where the Embassy staff can return and operations can begin again, a task force of **immigration** officers will be sent into Beirut.

* He has been directed to co-ordinate **immigration** arrangements for those Lebanese who reach countries outside the Lebanon.

* Most importantly, what action does the Minister or the Government now intend to take to have processed all **immigration** applications from the war-torn country of Lebanon?

* If the legislation were set on its proper course, if the Government were serious about getting the grass roots of this problem and looking at the issue of unemployment, its effects, and the rationalisation of industry together with the co-ordination of education programs for the purpose of achieving rationalisation side by side with retraining, and if the legislation had the scope to deal with population policies, the size and shape of population for the future and where those policies fit in with the **immigration** program and the availability of employment, we would - 
Accommodation costs for leases terminated or renegotiated in regard to diplomatic, consular, **immigration** and trade posts closed during 1 976 are as follows: ' 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
in consultation with and as required by the Department of Immigration, to prepare or assist in the preparation of general publicity and information material to serve as a background against which specific campaigns to attract and inform immigrants can be carried out.

* We still have a record **immigration** inflow compared with that of any other country.

* I refer to the importance of Australia's **immigration** programme and to a recent Press article concerning migrant departures from Australia.

* That letter, dated 28 August, I believe makes some quite serious allegations which the Minister has not answered and which I believe he should answer because the Opposition has been pressing for a statement from the Minister for Immigration on Australia's **immigration** progam and it has not been forthcoming.

* As you are aware,  Mr Speaker,  we have heard more about Australia's **immigration** program from  Mr Grassby  overseas than we have heard from him in this House.

* At the outset I would like to correct the misinterpretation and distortion of the policy of the Australian Labor Party on **immigration** as given by the Minister for 
Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  a few minutes ago.

* Landall offered to co-operate fully with the **immigration** task force operating in Western Australia.

* Certainly the Government is concerned at any diminution in the assisted migration programme from Great Britain because British migration has been, and we would wish it to continue to be, the cornerstone of our **immigration** programme.

* So in summary I say to the right honourable gentleman and to the House that we are determined that migration from the United Kingdom should continue to be the cornerstone of our total **immigration** programme and that steps are being taken to realise this objective.

* I principally want to oppose your ruling,  Sir, because  the question in this instance commenced: 'Would reported differences of opinion on **immigration** matters between leading members of the Opposition lead to a change in policy by the Government?'

* We argued strenuously that we should aim at a population growth, as a result of both natural increase and **immigration**, of some 1.1 per cent.

* The figure of 1.9 per cent comprised 1.1 per cent from natural causes, and 0,8 per cent from **immigration**.

* The **immigration** policy of the Government seeks to rid the nation of the inconsistencies, inequalities and discrimination that we believe should no longer be allowed to exist when we are seeking to bring people from various countries and to welcome them as citizens in their own right in Australia.

* He referred to the fact that the Opposition's bipartisan policy on **immigration** had been abandoned.

* I repeat that remark and say that it is to the credit of the Australian Labor Party that it has cast itself adrift from the discriminatory practices into which this Government has allowed itself to lapse in the interpretation of what we hoped could have continued to be an **immigration** policy that did not discriminate against people for malicious reasons.

* I want to refer to several aspects of **immigration** policy that I believe give the lie to some of the instant policies of the Government of recent times and which indicate very clearly the breakdown of what we hoped could have continued as a fair and reasonable bipartisan policy on **immigration**.

* In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's rather snide introduction to the question, let me say that yesterday I was talking about the future population of Australia, the effect of the fertility trends which are now present in the population, the likely fertility trends in the future, the contribution that people born in Australia can make to population growth and also the contribution that **immigration** can make to population growth in Australia.

* The normal **immigration** criteria were relaxed for Lebanese who had suffered hardship as a result of the conflict within the Lebanon.

* The task force will remain in Cyprus for 3 months and the special **immigration** operation in Nicosia will then be reviewed.

* It has been a constructive approach to the question of **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* Other honourable members have stressed the importance of **immigration** as a contributor to the economic well-being of the Australian nation.

* The honourable member made the statement in fairly direct terms that **immigration** equates with unemployment.

* He advanced the simplistic argument that if **immigration** is increased, inevitably it will increase unemployment.

* If I can take as a guide the number of representations the honourable member makes to me in relation to **immigration**, I am sure that he was not arguing that we should be stopping family reunion migration.

* Firstly, the Government would lose effective control of the **immigration** programme and in particular it would lose control over the composition of the programme.

* Secondly, the Government would be precluded from using the **immigration** programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development.

* I want particularly to comment on the loss of effective Government control over **immigration** which would result from Labor policies.

* Effective control of **immigration** requires firstly, that the composition of the migrant intake in terms of sources, skills and integration prospects is suitably balanced, and secondly, that action should be taken by the Government as and when necessary to ensure that the numbers and types of migrants coming to Australia are in harmony with our needs.

* In these important respects Labor's **immigration** policies would provide insufficient control.

* According to the Leader of the Opposition the Labor Party would set a numerical upper limit to **immigration**.

* The second of the major defects in Labor's **immigration** policies is that the government would be precluded from using the **immigration** programme to reinforce and ensure the success of policies of regional development.

* With only sponsored migration the government would also be prevented from using the **immigration** programme as an effective instrument of population policy.

* In this context it is relevant to remind the Parliament that the Government has commissioned far-reaching population studies which are premised on the availabality to the Government of effective control of **immigration** as a means of implementing population policies.

* In summary, regardless pf whether sponsorship is confined to relatives or is more widely based the Labor Party's policies would mean that firstly the Government would lose effective control of the **immigration** programme.

* Thirdly, if sponsorship were to be confined to relatives **immigration** would fall drastically - so much so that we would face the very real prospect of being unable to make good our own population losses through emigration.

* Fourthly, if broader based sponsorships were adopted the level of **immigration** would still fall sharply to begin with.

* It concerns the effects of Labor's .**immigration** policies on the Australian economy.

* Moreover, having voluntarily relinquished effective control of **immigration**, a government which implemented Labor's **immigration** policies would be largely powerless to redress the situation.

* The Government's stand, as reported in the  Australian,  was that Australia would not allow refugees to settle in this country unless they could meet normal **immigration** standards.

* This is not an unusual stand to take but I believe the position must not be looked at in any harsh, illiberal or rigid way because in many cases for humanitarian reasons those normal **immigration** standards and requirements must be flexibly administered.

* Apart from the appropriation by Parliament, as I indicated in brief this afternoon legislation is not strictly necessary for the purposes of this Bill as no coercive powers are being sought and the activities of the Department of Immigration in arranging for the expenditure of moneys in fact would be well within the executive powers of the Commonwealth with respect to **immigration**.

* Because in the last 20-odd years we have been supplementing our natural population increase by **immigration** the expansion of the cities has been accelerated.

* I think that the Government will have to look seriously at whether our **immigration** quota is too large to allow our urban development programmes to adapt to the rapid population increase, although, as the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  has mentioned, the incidence of crime amongst migrants is much lower than in the Australian born population.

* First, we propose to reduce the **immigration** program for 1974-75.

* Subject to existing commitments, we shall be aiming for a total intake of not more than 80,000, of which assisted **immigration** would be not more than 40,000 - that is, approximately 10,000 less than last year.

* So far as the final part of the honourable member's question is concerned - it related to the value of an Australian passport - I want to say quite clearly to the House that the value of an Australian passport is that it identifies the bearer and his citizenship to representatives of other governments, to our own representatives overseas, to carriers, to **immigration** officials at ports and airports on entry to Australia, and to this extent it is valuable because it greatly facilitates the travel of the bearer.

* I think it is about high time that the Government - and I hope this is understood - put the axe into the **immigration** programme.

* What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate facilities for processing **immigration** applications from persons fleeing hostilities in the Lebanon?

* His  work as the architect of the **immigration** policy at that time was of incalculable benefit to Australia.

* -The whole issue of **immigration** is one which has some accord politically and, indeed, throughout Australia at the present time.

* It is very much in character with the founder of our **immigration** policy,, the late Arthur Calwell.

* The unity ticket now, having had that creative work done way back in the early post-war years, is to give effect to the spirit of **immigration** and to make the passage and pathway for our migrant people more easy or reasonable.

* According to that statement, current staff is about 1,100 persons, of whom about 900 are locally engaged and about 350 are engaged in **immigration** matters.

* Accordingly I question the need for maintenance of the 350 persons engaged in **immigration** matters.

* I believe that at that time if a person could convince the **immigration** authorities that he was fleeing from communism he was OK. All he had to say was 'I hate communism' and that was nearly a passport to come to Australia.

* I now turn to the **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* It is also true, as was fairly clearly pointed out in the Vernon Report, that one of the restricting factors on increased national productivity is a high level of **immigration**.

* I ask Government spokesmen whether they are prepared to reduce the level of **immigration** into this country merely to provide the country with a greater percentage figure of increased productivity.

* -On 2 June 1977 I raised in this Parliament an **immigration** fee racket which was being practiced by a Sydney solicitor, a  Mr D.  P. Khoury who practices under the name of Benjamin and Khoury at 184 Victoria Street, Potts Point.

* We are one of the few countries that could consider the option of vastly expanded **immigration**.

* It is possible that the net benefits of such **immigration** would outweigh the difficulties in employing migrants.

* It was thought some dme ago that there may be some cases relating to **immigration** decisions which could be the subject of a judicial review, and the Government was sensitive about that and did not want to have a situation in which anybody could review a decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 May 1979: 
I had an interesting experience some time ago when 1 tried to chair a discussion between the late  Dr Evatt  and the late  Mr Townley  over an **immigration** matter.

* I understand that at the recent citizenship conference you criticised the Australian Government for its **immigration** policy on 2 scores.

* and (3) The High Commissioner and  Mr Maudling,  the previous Home Secretary, have had several talks during the last 2 years about Australians entering the United Kingdom particularly when the British Government's **immigration** legislation was being drawn up.

* On 12th May 1972, on behalf of the 6 Agents-General, the High 
Commissioner wrote to  Mr M audling  about the administration of the British Immigration Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by **immigration** officers at ports of entry.

* For the first time Australia's **immigration** policies were not criticised at an international level.

* Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by family planning and birth control measures, and that if family planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian **immigration** programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood.

* During the last days of the previous session I asked the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  whether he would call for a re-evaluation of our **immigration** policy in the light of doubts expressed across the broad spectrum of public opinion as to its efficacy.

* This incredibly illinformed, unresearched, deliberately misleading and mischievous article, the author of which not surprisingly preferred to remain anonymous, referred to questioners of the sacred cow of **immigration** as 'a melange of academics, commentators and low ranking politicians'.

* This unknown author dismissed our fears of overcrowded cities, pollution, lack of conservation, inadequate social services and shortage of schools and hospitals as just a matter of planning and priorities, entirely ignoring the fact that had there been this sort of planning and priorities the debate about **immigration** may never have commenced.

* 1 have been greatly heartened by the announcement by the Minister for Immigration that he proposes a comprehensive investigation into the effects of **immigration**, ils aims and objects.

* I understand that the survey proposed by the Department will include a cost benefit analysis of **immigration**, desirable populations levels for Australia and the effect that increased **immigration** will have on our environment and urban problems.

* The Minister is to be complimented on his response to recent public disquiet over the effect of **immigration**, lt is a measure of his flexibility and sensitivity that he has been prepared to initiate such a comprehensive inquiry.

* I would also like to thank him for the courtesy he has shown me by inviting me to discuss with him privately my reservations about **immigration**.

* 1 have a strong suspicion that it may be not as objective an analysis as it should be but an attempt to prove that increased **immigration** is desirable, lt would have been better, in my view, if the analysis were done by a body of experts outside the Department.

* Ardent advocates of increased **immigration** have been quick to rush to the defence of the present policy and have actually called for the Government to up the ante.

* Organisations such as the Chambers of Manufactures, which have never been known for their humanitarian concern for the plight of the under-priviliged, nor for that matter for anything but their own profits, have been in the forefront of those urging increased **immigration**.

* The hysterica] outbursts of late by the traditional supporters of the Liberal Party - the employers' organisations - against unions, blaming them, together with over-full employment, for the inflationary spiral, is hardly conducive to an objective assessment of our **immigration** policy.

* I hope that this survey will allow us lo examine more closely the cost of **immigration**.

* To fully understand my reasons for seeking a review of the **immigration** policy 1 think we need to examine the basic philosophies behind the present policies to see if they are still valid for Australia of the 1970s.

* As one whose prime motivation in entering politics was to try to break down the prejudices between peoples of different race, religion, class, colour, culture and nationalities, 1 regard the new broadening of the Australian's attitude towards people who are different as the greatest single contribution by the **immigration** policy.

* Mr Deputy Speaker,  you may well ask: If I am so enamoured of our past programme of **immigration** why then am 1 now questioning that same policy?

* Immigration would probably argue that the Government no longer puts forward this theory as one of the reasons for continued and expanded **immigration**.

* The final argument against any slowdown or cut back in **immigration** is based on the 'economies of scale of production theory'.

* What those who ask for a re-examination want is not necessarily an end to **immigration** but an end to open ended programmes without goals or objectives.

* My constituent,  Mr Noel  Ginn of Universal Street, Eastlakes, asked me to raise a matter which concerns **immigration**.

* This requires heavy investment in social overhead capital - housing, services, roads, schools and hospitals - although it is often overlooked that **immigration** also increases the total resources available for investment.

* Many economists argue that we could improve our standard of living by cutting back the **immigration** intake.

* Not only does **immigration** make possible technical and financial economies of scale; it also provides us with a more flexible, mobile and adaptable work force; it generates new skills, know-how and entrepreneurship; and it acts as a spur to technological innovation.

* Convinced that increased population is vital to the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding **immigration** programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* It now merely supports an **immigration** policy which is administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance, which shall include the avoidance of discrimination on any grounds of race or colour of skin or nationality.

* The Labor Party not only wants to cut **immigration** but also to limit the natural growth of the Australian population.

* The formula which will implement the new **immigration** policies was endorsed and will come into operation in all States.

* The speech of the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  was what I would describe, again in colloquial terms, as a lead balloon.

* An Australian **immigration** officer was located in Damascus in April and action was taken to strengthen **immigration** representation in Cyprus.

* In May 1976-1 am going through the historyspecial staffing arrangements were made at Australian posts in Athens, Nicosia, Cairo and Ankara and an Australian **immigration** officer was attached to the staff of the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Damascus.

* In June, the Government decided that a more rapid service could be given to Lebanese applicants by transferring the **immigration** officer in Damascus to the Australian High Commission in Nicosia.

* In September 1976 the Minister announced that a senior officer would be sent to Nicosia to report on the most effective way in which Lebanese **immigration** to Australia could be organised.

* The Coast Guard Service could appropriately be placed under the control of the Department of Customs and Excise with provisions for adequate liaison with other relevant departments, for example those departments responsible for health, fisheries, **immigration** and rescue services.

* A newspaper report there dealt with the fact that the customs and **immigration** officials learned of the plot to smuggle the Chinese into Australia and they acted as a result of the information they received.

* I refer to the Minister's statement which indicated a reduction of about 10,000 in this year's **immigration** target.

* What is the estimated saving in the cost of the  **immigration** programme this financial year as a result in the reduction of numbers?

* In view of the reduction this year is it to be taken that the Government proposes drastically to curtail the **immigration** programme for the year 1971-72?

* On page 3 of today's  Australian  there is an article reporting the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar),  the Federal Opposition's spokesman on **immigration**, as saying that a Federal Government report critical of migrant education had been virtually suppressed and quoting the migrant newspaper  La Fiamma  as describing the report as 'the gravest scandal in migrant history'.

* The last thing I want to say is that under the **immigration** programme we have placed a tremendous burden on the States and on local government.

* Is it a fact that members of the Japanese Government economic mission in Perth recently indicated that the future of Japanese investment in Australia's development of raw materials and industry may depend to a great extent on Australian **immigration** policies?

* I refer now to the opening of the post in Damascus, which is the thrust of the question so far as **immigration** is concerned.

* Should a decision be taken to reopen that post, following the report that I receive from  Mr Starey,  the officer who was left in charge of Beirut, we will of course expedite the entry of Australian **immigration** personnel, and the diplomatic officials would follow later on.

* The increase in our labour resource by **immigration**, announced recently by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  at 180,000 this year, is regarded as the greatest rate of increase which this country can satisfactorily absorb.

* It has been suggested that on this side of the chamber there is some desire to curtail the **immigration** scheme which was launched so magnificently a generation ago by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell).

* That **immigration** scheme has added  2i  million people to our community.

* Within days not only something like 40,000 Filipinos were at the gates of the Australian Mission but also there was a similar situation in Rangoon where there were 10,000 Burmese beating at the gates of the Australian Mission and Australian **immigration** application forms were being sold in the streets of Rangoon.

* It seems to me that the real justification for this Bill is to raise money to offset increased expenditure on **immigration** services.

* This happened to me with an **immigration** matter.

* -A few days ago an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Council,  Mr Jim  Kaldis, claimed that the Government's **immigration** policy was discriminatory and in particular that it discriminated against people coming to Australia from Greece.

* He said that if we were to try to achieve the pre- 1 974 situation in the labour market, we would be looking towards an increasing labour force as a result of **immigration** of some 20,000 people a year, a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates, which is considerably below what it is now, no change in the participation of young people and education in the work force, respectively, and no normal additional participation following an increase in the demand for labour.

* We are all aware of the position in Britain and America and this is the reason that previous Australian governments, including Labor governments, have maintained a restricted **immigration** policy.

* Of course, the present Hawke-Whitlam axis has changed Labor's policy in this regard and Australians may well have similar problems if a Labor government with an open door **immigration** policy ever comes to power.

* The Green Paper on **immigration** policy and Australia's population tabled by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 17 March stated: 
I did see reports, particularly in the Melbourne  Age,  of remarks which were attributed to my colleague the Minister for Productivity.

* I have never advocated an **immigration** program which at this stage would result in a large number of semi-skilled and unskilled people being brought to Australia.

* If the honourable member discusses the matter with my colleague I think he will find that my colleague and I are in very great agreement as to the sort of **immigration** program Australia needs at this stage.

* It is not generally known that he went overseas virtually to hand pick the ships which were to bring the first migrants to Australia under the great plan of Arthur Calwell when he initiated the **immigration** program.

* For 25 years there has been no funda- mental dispute concerning the principles underlying Australia's **immigration** policy.

* The tragedy is that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and his influential, intellectual friends, among them the Premier of South Australia,  Mr Dunstan,  have proposed a complete - even if disguised - overturning of the principles of **immigration**.

* In January this year  Mr Dunstan  stated without any equivocation whatsoever: 
It is perfectly clear, and undeniable, that these men played a leading role in the formulation of the policy on **immigration**, a policy on which they want an inquiry and a policy that was adopted by the Launceston Conference only weeks ago by 44 votes to one.

* Let me state the **immigration** philosophy which has been rejected, and I quote from Hansard of 2nd August 1945 what the present right honourable member for Melbourne, the first Minister for Immigration, said.

* These completely new **immigration** principles are merely another way of saying in migration first come, first served.

* All I can say is that the Leader of the Opposition either deliberately misrepresented the position because he was in a hot seat or he has a deplorable knowledge of **immigration** trends.

* Every country surely has the right to a substantial control of its own **immigration** policy.

* uncontrolled and risky **immigration** policy.

* These were the very characteristics of **immigration** to Australia in the late nineteenth century - in Queensland we know it - and to Britain in the 1960s.

* The honourable member for Grayndler,  (Mr Daly),  who a short time ago was 'axed' as the shadow Minister for Immigration, and more especially the right honourable member for Melbourne, who was Australia's father of **immigration**, have always followed and believed in those principles.

* An **immigration** policy followed by successive governments - both Labor and Liberal-Country Party- 
An **immigration** policy followed by successive governments - both Labor governments and Liberal-Country Party governments - and a policy which has served this country well, would be totally repudiated, and that is the intention.

* I agree with a number of remarks he had to say regarding **immigration**.

* Unquestionably, his greatest mark on today's Australia is the **immigration** program he pioneered.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs a question which concerns his Press statement of 2 1 May announcing that Australian residents can now sponsor the **immigration** of their parents even if the parents are not dependent upon them and are outside the acceptable occupational categories.

* An argument we used to hear frequently, and still do, about **immigration** was that we must have an **immigration** programme so we will have people to do our work.

* For instance, in relation to **immigration** Norfolk Island must not become a back door to Australia.

* To process the application requires the establishment of an **immigration** team, including medical personnel, to travel to the camps and to assess the people on the spot.

* It is not possible to deal with the nominations received from people in Australia as one would deal with a normal **immigration** sponsorship.

* Leaflets in these languages will be available at overseas posts and offices of my Department in Australia by the time the revised **immigration** categories and procedures come into effect on 1 January 1979.

* believe that the general approach we have made to **immigration** has been fairly effective but that our most miserable failure has been in the way we have approached particularly :he children who have arrived here as a result of the migration scheme.

* There can be no denying that **immigration** is an absolute Commonwealth responsibility.

* Immigration programmes must, of course, always be responsive to changing circumstances, and against the circumstances recently outlined to this House by the Prime Minister the **immigration** programme has in fact been modified.

* Many thousands, indeed millions, from other countries have found homes here, have contributed greatly to the economic strength of Australia, added to our cultural heritage and made this a much better nation as a result of their **immigration** or the **immigration** of their grandfathers, relatives or forebears to this country.

* I simply conclude by commenting on some points made the other night by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  about **immigration** and migrant education in Wollongong.

* It was not opened by the previous Government, and I can assure the honourable member for Cunningham that the volume of **immigration** in the last two years has not been so dramatic that the situation has changed monumentally in Wollongong.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration another question on Australia's restrictive **immigration** policy.

* -The population of Australia and **immigration** into Australia is a vitally important topic.

* Because the long term future of this country is concerned with the population and **immigration** problem and with other problems such as the energy problem, I rise with a heavy heart because in the short time in which I have been a member of this House I have not seen an example of the way in which the programs and procedures of the House can be perverted to match what we have seen tonight from the Opposition.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1978: 
I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: Is government **immigration** policy designed to prevent a person who was established to have been an anti-Jewish propagandist and a Nazi collaborator during the Second World War and who was regarded as a war criminal by the Government of Yugoslavia and the War Crimes Documentation Centre in Vienna from entering Australia?

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the basic reasons for the introduction of Australia's excellent **immigration** policy by the Chifley Labor Government in 1946 and continued by successive Liberal governments, are considered by many people to be no longer applicable to Australia in the 1970s?

* Will his Government bring down a white paper on **immigration** so that a cost-benefit evaluation of assisted **immigration**, now estimated at being between $500m and SI, 000m.

* There is all the difference in the world in giving a Minister a right to answer a particular matter, such as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  who may speak on the matter of **immigration** which is raised in the debate, and in providing for a Minister a period of 10 minutes in which to put on a political tirade against the Opposition or against someone else which normally would have been part of the adjournment debate.

* Following the great **immigration** intake, the great bulk of those immigrants went to the over-centralised cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* I have seen reports in today's newspapers which carry a statement from the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs alleging that Australia is laundering the entry of Rhodesians via South Africa.

* The Opposition spokesman seems to be at a loss to understand the fact that those people coming from the camps in Malaysia and Thailand are put through the process by **immigration** officers and are given resident status.

* It is likely that pasengers arriving at Tullamarine Airport on BOAC Flight 812A on 5 September may have taken up to two hours to complete customs and **immigration** formalities.

* When the tour folded they suddenly discovered **immigration**.

* I think I am right in saying that 12 months ago I was probably one of the first in this Parliament to question **immigration**.

* I asked the Prime Minister of the day,  Mr Gorton,  a question about it, and at that time he said he was shocked to hear that a member of the Labor Party was questioning **immigration**.

* In the last 12 months the whole of our community has been questioning **immigration**.

* We have not said categorically that **immigration** is bad.

* What we are asking for now is that there be a breathing space so that we can have another look at where we are going in **immigration**.

* I think one of the best contributions made this evening was that made by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  because he sees the weaknesses and the strengths in **immigration**.

* It is  a  moderate approach towards **immigration**.

* Now that the question of an **immigration** policy is seen more in the context of Australia's manpower and economic programmes as well as part of the overall view of population growth and decentralisation, I ask whether the Government has in its long term planning considerations given any attention to long term population targets?

* The Minister for Immigration who interjects, but who, without any conscience or without any sense of moral responsibility, has tried to inject crude racism into the impending election campaign centred about **immigration** policy.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 

 - Mr Deputy Speaker, what we have just heard from the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  is one of the most damaging indictments of Australian Labor Party policy on **immigration** that I have ever heard.

* I would have thought that if we were going to talk about **immigration** it would have been the shadow Minister for Immigration who would have raised the matter.

* Perhaps he is going to take over the **immigration** portfolio.

* Let us look at this total **immigration** intake because it bears close scrutiny if we are to analyse just exactly what goes on.

* On the other hand, the immediate effects of **immigration** might be to raise the unemployment numbers in particular categories of labor.

* The general evidence from Australia 's own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that **immigration** does not - 
In practice, high **immigration** has been associated with booming economies.

* It can be argued that the economic booms cause the **immigration**, not vice versa, But, it is clear that the migrant flows did not destroy the booms.

* My own view is that increased **immigration** at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits.

* The Opposition's **immigration** policies are unclear.

* The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Carlton)  yesterday in his maiden speech, which we all thought was excellent, did venture his point of view that **immigration** may well be rapidly expanded in this country.

* That was borne out by the fact that it so dramatically cut **immigration** into this country.

* These include airport congestion, bad weather, airport curfews, unexpected industrial disputes, aircraft defects and even the operations of government authorities as some people have often experienced with **immigration** controls abroad.

* There is no suggestion that I would seek to prevent the migration to Australia of people who meet Australia's **immigration** requirements but who cannot speak English.

* In fact, on 21 April this year, at a meeting between me and State Ministers concerned with **immigration**, a joint statement was issued which drew attention to the fact that English language ability was an important factor in successful settlement.

* At the end of that decision, for the first time since Federation and for the first time since the end of the Second World War when our great **immigration** program commenced, the  President  directed and found it necessary to order formally that his decision be printed in several languages, because he thought it proper that everybody affected by that decision should be able to read it and understand it.

* Has his attention been drawn to reports today which suggest that the arrival of more than 130 Spanish migrants in Brisbane has given rise to fears by State Labor Party leaders and trade union leaders that Australia's **immigration** policy will aggravate the local employment situation there?

* The Sub-Committee on the Middle East of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has now reported that its  Chairman,  the honourable member for Fremantle, wrote on 24 August to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the effect that there are strong humanitarian reasons for the re-establishment of a reasonably sized **immigration** team in Damascus and that he wrote on 1 October to the Foreign Minister concerning diplomatic representation in Damascus and aid to Lebanese refugees in Syria and Cyprus.

* I therefore ask: What progress has been made in establishing an Australian embassy in Damascus in order to reinstate facilities for processing **immigration** applications from persons fleeing from the Lebanon?

* Also, I believe we would have to consider, as referred to earlier by the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes),  the proposition that we would have to look at some of our **immigration** quotas and decide what is the **immigration** target we need most of all in order to integrate migrant intake with the other aspects of our economic planning.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  says: 'Like **immigration**?'

* The **immigration** power was given to the Commonwealth at Federation for very good reasons, and the same considerations to which I am referring - the lack of contact at the local level, and the creation of a hospital system which is malleable and adjustable to individual circumstances and the felt needs of particular communities of people and particular areas - was one of the principal reasons why the hospital power was left with the States.

* Has the level of **immigration** been adjusted because of economic circumstances in Australia.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 10 October 1978: 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that it took a passenger one hour to pass through the **immigration** procedure at Tullamarine Airport, Vic, on Wednesday, 20 September 1978, at approximately 9 a.m.

* The Agreement also represents, as the Minister has said, a completely new depature by the Government in furtherance of the **immigration** programme in that it is the first agreement with a Communist country.

* There has been and, I hope, generally will be full and constructive support of the **immigration** programme by both sides of the Parliament.

* In other words, does he believe that employers' participation in this vital part of our **immigration** program is being carried out?

* For the information of the House I would mention that the next conference of **immigration** Ministers will be held in Adelaide on 9 November 1973.

* Certainly the United Kingdom and the United States of America have adopted the practice of trying to recoup costs that it is possible to identify as being directly associated with a request from a person using the services of their **immigration** offices.

* It has adopted a new attitude towards **immigration**.

* During the remarks that I made last evening before the adjournment of the House I referred to an **immigration** inquiry as being a departmental inquiry.

* The **immigration** administration under the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  has been a failure.

* Will the Minister for Immigration give special consideration to the people who came to Australia on tourist visas under the policies of the previous Government because they were not eligible to apply for **immigration**?

* Has the Minister heard or seen reports of statements by his colleague, the Minister for Productivity, about the attitude of employers towards **immigration** to Australia?

* Is it a fact that illegal immigrants entering Australia now represent 10 per cent of the total planned annual net **immigration** rate?

* Does this not represent a substantial interference with the proper planning and administration of this country's **immigration** policies?

* It would be far better to stop **immigration** immediately, except to those people who have guaranteed employment or who are family dependents and do not affect in any way those persons who are in employment already, who are reuniting a family, or who are seeking employment in a restricted market.

* I point out that the Nimmo Committee stressed that this multitude of funds is inefficient and costly particularly because of- 
i direct my question to the Minister for **immigration**.

* What is the present ratio of skilled workers in the **immigration** programme?

* -Is the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs aware of newspaper reports recently that his Department is considering recommending an increase in **immigration** to Australia from 70 000 to 100 000 next year?

* If we applied this line of thinking to our **immigration** programme, it would mean that anyone who got off an aeroplane from England, Italy, Spain, Germany, Holland or wherever he may come from would be asked, when he reached the bottom of the gangplank: Does your country need you?'

* Neither category would be entitled to entry in the normal course of **immigration** procedures.

* The Immigration Planning Council at its meeting on 18 March 1974 considered the labour market situation at that time and recommended an **immigration** program for 1974-75 based on a gross settler arrival figure of 135,000 persons.

* The objective of the programme during the course of the next 12 months will be to hold the **immigration** programme at this favourable level.

* as many recent immigrants have a moral obligation to support dependants, mainly parents, left behind for various reasons including Australia's **immigration** laws, will he reconsider the decision to abolish the rebate.

* I ask the Acting Minister for Immigration whether he has interpreted a recent statement of public interest referring to **immigration** which says: 'the avoidance of any discrimination on any grounds of race or colour or nationality.'

* Is there a serious sex imbalance in Australia's **immigration** program?

* The Committee has recommended that further consideration be given to the introduction of a national identity card system which could also have advantages in other areas such as health and **immigration**.

* Apart from that, there is a radical departure from previous policies in that there is a reduction in the overall **immigration** quota.

* 1019)  Mr Morris  asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1  June 1977: 
Since the introduction of the new **immigration** policy and NUMAS, substantial numbers of non-immediate relatives have been assisted in meeting the general **immigration** criteria by concessions in NUMAS for persons who are nominated or otherwise assisted by family members resident in Australia.

* I think it is fairly significant that this is the first Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** policies and population ever presented in the Federal Parliament.

* It is easy to think about **immigration** policy in relation to employment or unemployment, population, demographic distribution and a whole host of other things, but this is the first time it has brought these aspects together in a single document where the language is, I believe, easily understood and where the length of the document is not so great as to deter people from reading it.

* It was a significant feature of earlier times that the **immigration** policies of previous governments were conducted largely in a bipartisan fashion.

* Unfortunately, in my view, that situation changed in recent years but hopefully the debate today has restored some of the objectivity and some of the bipartisan nature of previous approaches towards **immigration** policy.

* I think that a common feature has been the understanding, realisation and expression of support for the marked changes which have occurred in Australia particularly as a result of the consistent large scale post-war **immigration** program.

* The change consists of a pronounced slowing of natural increase and low net and gross **immigration** rates.

* Under present circumstances, taking into account the fertility patterns which are emerging in Australia, **immigration** is likely to be the only controllable variable in the population growth rate.

* On the evidence that is before us at the moment the **immigration** variable is the only controllable variable that is available to governments in terms of population policies.

* In relation to this an **immigration** variable is significant in terms of placement of people as well as numbers.

* The labour force growth rate most likely will decline even with a medium **immigration** program.

* By a medium **immigration** program, I am talking about a net gain of SO 000 per year.

* It would obviously be too long a task to go through the contributions of each  speaker  but I note in passing that the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  who is the Opposition spokesman on **immigration**, attacked the proposition that Australia should look to higher population rates and attacked the proposition that we should be looking at net **immigration** rates of approximately 50 000 per year.

* In fact, very few honourable members who took part in this debate suggested that we should not continue with the **immigration** program or that we should not look to a greater population in this country.

* I believe that it will be even more successful if it brings about in the community at large a better understanding of the background to **immigration** policy development and as a result of the increased knowledge of that **immigration** policy development, a series of submissions to the Government which will reflect community views.

* As a result of that reflection of community views, the Government will be placed in a much better position to development **immigration** policies which will be acceptable to the nation as a whole and which will bring about the development of Australia, not just in the short term but, most importantly, in the medium and long term, of a size and of a nature which we would all support.

* This seemed to be something of a surprise to some of them because every time this kind of motion is launched by the Opposition, around the headlines of the world goes the suggestion from responsible people in Australia that we are racists, and then those who have not visited this country or studied our **immigration** laws get an impression.

* He said - he had not consulted the Government - that it was only the **immigration** laws that were racist.

* This is something that our own people tend to say, because in Ceylon  -  I have studied the **immigration** laws of Ceylon and other countries of the South East Asia area - I know that the **immigration** laws are a good deal harsher than are ours.

* of the question of **immigration**.

* I was pleased to note that the Government planned to keep the **immigration** quota at 140,000 migrants for the coming year.

* Whereas the Leader of the Opposition has been most guarded and vague concerning Labor's policy on **immigration**, it must be remembered that he replaced his shadow Minister for Immigration, who is at present sitting at the table on the Opposition side, when he was expounding policies similar to the policy of the Government and that the Labor Premier of South Australia has made a call virtually to open the flood gates to non-European migration.

* We want to continue with a vigorous **immigration** programme for the benefit of Australia.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
Is any increase in the level of Iranian **immigration** contemplated by the Government.

* Here we come again to the impact of **immigration**.

* We have attempted in Australia, and I do not disagree with it, an increase in population through both **immigration** and natural growth which is an alltime record for any part of the world, or at least any part of what we might call the western democracies.

* Further proof can be obtained from the report of Australia's Immigration Planning Council which is investigating **immigration** programmes for the period 1968-73.

* It would appear that the Minister is just as mixed up in the **immigration** problem.

* Indeed, we have seen the amiable colourful Minister when on his overseas tours successfully confuse the Australian people, our Asian friends, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the ACTU, as well as his own Prime Minister and Government on **immigration** policy.

* So much for Labor's ambivalent **immigration** policy.

* Has any consideration been given to protecting the jobs of Australian workers and saving new arrivals from the personal and economic disadvantages of unemployment by immediately restricting **immigration** to the spouse, children and parents of migrants already in Australia?

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
The Government is determined to pursue its policy of continuing **immigration**.

* I want to raise the issue of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* It is rumoured that there is currently before Cabinet a submission which would effectively raise the level of net **immigration** from the current levels of 50,000 a year to 70,000 a year for each year until 1981.

* It is also to be hoped that the Government will make no decision before the promised White Paper on **immigration** policy is published and ample time is allowed for public discussion and debate.

* In my view there is no clear basis on which to announce major changes in Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Indeed, there are a number of concerns which should be taken seriously and resolved before a large-scale **immigration** program is resumed, on the lines of programs adopted in the 1950s and 1960s.

* This problem would be compounded still further if increased rates of **immigration** were adopted.

* It is hard to believe that there are not enough workers in Australia to fill these jobs or to be retrained to work on this development and that we have to emphasise the need to expand the nation's **immigration** policy.

* One does not have to be critical of the concept of **immigration** to be most concerned about current developments in Australia.

* Western Samoans with work permits have **immigration** privileges to and from New Zealand because Western Samoa formerly was administered by New Zealand.

* certainly hope to use the **immigration** program to help correct the temporary imbalances in one or two groups.

* I want to assure the honourable member and the House that we will certainly use the **immigration** program to the best extent that we can to correct the imbalances which exist in one or two ethnic groups.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the House of Representatives, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: 
I ask the Minister for Immigration: Is it correct, as reported in yesterday's edition of the Sydney 'Sun', that **immigration** officers in London are telling plumbers that they will live a life of luxury if they migrate to Australia where all plumbers drive big American cars?

* Finally I ask the Minister: If he is not in a position to answer my question now, will he initiate an immediate investigation into the allegations made in the newspaper article, and, at the same time, make available to all **immigration** officers, regardless of where they  aTe  stationed, up to date copies of the major Australian industrial awards in order that intending migrants can be advised correctly as to the Australian wages and working conditions applicable to their particular trade or calling?

* The most plausible assumption set out in the Borrie Committee report is that the net **immigration** intake will be approximately 50 000 a year and that the replacement rate of natural population will be approximately one.

* If we look at what is happening in relation to the population growth in Australia at the moment we find that the net **immigration** intake is significantly lower than the 50 000 postulated by Professor Borrie, and the net replacement rate is significantly lower than one.

* Even with a 50 000 net **immigration** intake and a replacement rate of one, the population of Australia by the year 2000 would be approximately 17.6 million, which is significantly less than the 20 million plus envisaged when the original growth centre concepts were being drawn up and plans were being made.

* If that is so, it is not to the credit of that organisation in helping to circumvent the **immigration** laws.

* One comment relates to repatriation and the other to **immigration**.

* The **immigration** program that had been started a few years earlier by the right honourable Arthur Calwell, a former most distinguished member of this Parliament, had not yet had an opportunity to flow through to strengthen the industrial base in many parts of Australia.

* Is it a fact that in an address to the New South Wales Liberals recently be stated that Australia's **immigration** policy as it related to coloured people could not be justified on moral grounds?

* Will the Prime Minister also state what is immoral about a policy that admits almost 10,000 non-Europeans and people of mixed descent yearly, gives discretionary power to the Minister, has kept Australia' free from racial hatreds and is based on the same principles as the **immigration** policies of practically every nation in the world?

* He was referring to the **immigration** policy of past years.

* By way of explanation I refer to the Minister's statement advising  that the Government has decided to reduce the **immigration** programme by 30,000 next year, reducing the target to 140,000 settlers, including 100,000 assisted migrants and at least 40,000 unassisted migrants.

* Will he also state whether the Government proposes to phase out the **immigration** programme and that this is the first instalment in the process?

* Of course, on this issue there are deep divisions between the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  and the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam),  and it was those divisions which led to the dismissal as shadow Minister for Immigration of the honourable member for Grayndler, a man who has been described by his leader in this Parliament as one of the best informed men on **immigration**.

* The leader of the Australian Labor Party in fact said of the honourable member for Grayndler, in relation to **immigration**, that one could not fault him on that subject.

* Turning to the amendment before the Chair, there is in the view of the Government no need for a joint select committee to inquire into the Government's **immigration** policies.

* The Government's achievements in the field of **immigration** are a matter of record.

* However, there has been in recent times some misunderstanding - I hesitate to use the word misrepresentation' - of the Government's **immigration** policies and programmes.

* The social, economic and demographic effects of these different components of population change vary quite substantially and changes in the size or structure of the **immigration** programme cannot entirely offset the effects of changes in the other factors.

* The particular importance of **immigration** lies in the fact that, of all the elements of population change, it is the one most effectively influenced by Government action.

* I want to say tonight that the Government has in the national interest adopted the broadest possible approach in formulating **immigration** policies and in giving effect to those policies through annual **immigration** programmes.

* It has developed extremely comprehensive consultative machinery on all aspects  ot  **immigration**.

* I do not want to stress that Government sponsorship of research into various aspects pf **immigration** dates back for more than a decade.

* These ' are imaginative and far-reaching initiatives, but they form only part of a quite impressive body of research applied or in progress throughout Australia into the various aspects  of **immigration**.

* The Australian National University has just published a bibliography and digest which constitutes impressive evidence of the scope and depth of research into **immigration** to Australia.

* But the Government will continue as it has in the past consistently and successfully to review its annual **immigration** programmes, to relate those programmes to Australia's needs, the availability of suitable settlers and our capacity to integrate them on arrival here.

* Despite what has been said tonight by Opposition membersI stress that our **immigration** programmes are not rigidly conceived, mathematically calculated and solidly pursued.

* Due to the present Government 's mismanagement of all things connected with **immigration**, language instruction is still grossly unsatisfactory, and we all know that understanding of the language is a major factor in job placement; counselling is backward and at present distrusted by those who seek to use it.

* If  Senator James  McClelland can offer no more indication of his interest in **immigration** than letting commercial misfits such as Alice Cooper into the country I believe we have yet another example of appalling mismanagement or non-management on the part of the Government.

* I could go on at some length further to document the miserable series of failures which this Government has made in the area of **immigration**.

* For the Government which has made such a great claim about its concern for minority groups in the community, its determination to be rid of inequalities and its commitment to egalitarianism, the Treasurer's statements on **immigration** show those worthy principles to be reduced to something less than farcial.

* In another outburst of miscalculations it showed to ethnic people of this country exactly what its true attitude was, an attitude so cursory and so patronising that the Government Printer had to waste no more than 3 lines on the whole ambit of the **immigration** field.

* It was not just an insulting reference of only 3 lines; the content of the Treasurer's remarks on **immigration** was as logically incomprehensible as it was short.

* These measures, which are designed further to impede the necessary **immigration** flow to Australia, are solely and indisputably a result of the Government's amateur and totally inept handling of the economy which has resulted, amongst other disasters, in a totally unacceptable level of employment.

* We have stated that **immigration** must be taken away from the present Government's restricting manpower considerations and placed in a much more broad context of a vital component of the nation's overall population policies.

* As in so many areas the Labor Government's record in the field of **immigration** is abysmal.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 1 7 November 1978: 
Under which **immigration** category were they admitted and what was their nationality at the time of acceptance.

* Immigration,  upon notice: 
Which countries have **immigration** agreements with Australia.

* Which non-European countries have sought **immigration** agreements with Australia and what was the result in each case.

* 1 ) and (2) In May this year the Government decided that Australia's 1976-77 **immigration** program should be 70 000 persons.

* That was by far the smallest intake in the post-war **immigration** program.

* These forecasts assist **immigration** selection officers and officers of my Department dealing with applications for vocational training assistance.

* The Australian **immigration** programme was initiated by a Labor government some 25 years ago, and it has been supported by this Government since that time.

* I think it is disappointing for many of us suddenly to get these revelations indicating the stark nature of the situation, **immigration** is important to Australia.

* Seventy per cent of the increase in our work force over the last 20 years has come from **immigration**.

* If all this is the case, although I know there are many who believe it is time we properly evaluated these alleged facts, clearly we should be thinking of migrants from the point of view that **immigration** is not a one-sided affair.

* The success of Australia's **immigration** programme has long been tarnished by an obtuse disinclination to evaluate the problems which migrants and their children encounter.

* Startling revelations about language problems of migrant children have now come to hand 25 years after the then Labor Government initiated our first **immigration** programme.

* There are lots of people who now say that we should now put a stop to or a brake on the **immigration** programme.

* It is clearly a possibility that we could make a knowledge of English a condition of their **immigration** arrangement.

* The Minister said that the men were met at the airport by **immigration** officials and issued with documents.

* Were their guns not noticed by the **immigration** officers?

* I have noticed an increasing public debate in relation to the level of **immigration** intake.

* As honourable members know, last week I tabled in this House a Green Paper on Australia's **immigration** and population policies.

* During the last 3 years the net **immigration** intake into this country has been some 300.000 people.

* On the question of **immigration**, there were those of us who, as we saw a state of full employment developing within the community, hoped that there would be an increase in the **immigration** quota to keep cost increases reasonable.

* We have not had an increase in the **immigration** quota but we do have overfull employment.

* Undoubtedly our **immigration** scheme, with its great contribution to Australia's development, must go down as his greatest memorial as a member of this Parliament and as a citizen.

* Those who like oratory and Australianism should read his speeches during the early days of **immigration**, particularly his speech on the Citizenship Bill.

* In directing my question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs I preface it by complimenting him on the assistance I have had from him and his Department in processing applications for **immigration** to Australia from Lebanese nationals.

* However, I would add, in amplification of what I said then, that Australia's existing **immigration** policy has allowed and will continue to allow some Asians to migrate from Uganda, in particular persons who are qualified in professions to practise in Australia and who can be absorbed readily in those professions in Australia.

* My question to the Minister for Immigration concerns recent criticism by non-Australians of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Will the Minister indicate clearly to the House that, contrary to the opinions of some international moralists, Australia's non-European **immigration** policy is our own business and is designed to preserve a community free from the tensions which characterise other parts of the world?

* During the previous Parliament I suggested the setting up of a museum or a collection of articles showing Australia's **immigration** program and its history.

* Will the Minister investigate the possibility of such a collection and museum showing the history of Australia's **immigration** program being set up as has been done in the United States?

* It comprises the Commonwealth Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and State Ministers responsible for **immigration** or ethnic affairs matters.

* In joining the Opposition's case for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee on **immigration**, I want to remind honourable members this evening that in general Australia's **immigration** programme has operated in a satisfactory manner in the past not because of any great credit that this Government could claim but rather despite the Government.

* Let me remind honourable members that Australia's **immigration** programme was planned by the Australian Labor Party over 25 years ago.

* However, the Liberal Party has never had a basic **immigration** policy of its own, and it is not unusual, of course, that so many policies that we are able to illustrate effectively in this Parliament have come to fruition by accident rather than by plan.

* I quote not only my own words this evening when I say that this Government has no **immigration** policy.

* Dr Lloyd  wrote: 
The starting point ot an; economic analysis should be the recognition that the Australian Commonwealth Government does not have, and has not had, a coherent policy on **immigration**.

* The **immigration** programme' consists essentially of an  i  in migration target,  announced  annually by the Commonwealth Government, and assorted schemes for assisting migrants by paying all or part of' their fares to Australia.

* Yet the Government, which is bankrupt of ideas for the operation of a suitable pro gramme for **immigration** in the 1970s and afterwards, is hypocritical enough to endeavour to belittle the policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* I say proudly that the Labor Party has, and it always has had, a detailed and concise policy on **immigration**.

* Honourable members, and not only members from this side of the chamber, have referred to it, but not one speaker has been able to refer to any basic policy which the Liberal Party has on **immigration**.

* The Labor Party makes no secret of its **immigration** policy, or any of its other policies for that matter.

* Our **immigration** policy is published in a book of policy, and the policy of our 29th Commonwealth Conference is available for all to read.

* I support the amendment this evening just as I  supported  the honourable member  for Grayndler  12 months ago when he suggested, during a similar debate in this chamber,  that a  select committee should  be appointed to inquire  into **immigration**.

* We say, as the  Labor Party did  25 years ago, that the  Parliament should adopt  an honest, sensible  and Australian  approach to this nation's future **immigration** programme.

* At that time I appealed to the Minister for Immigration to consider the plan to have a tame, departmentally appointed committee investigate Australia's future **immigration** needs.

* Such a time lag makes a joke of any benefit that could come from this committee's investigations because in the meantime - at least, during the last months of this Government - Australia's **immigration** policy will continue to drift along, changed to suit the whims of him who happens to administer the policy at any particular time.

* The most suitable group to study Australia's future **immigration** needs is one selected from among members of this Parliament, for it is in this Parliament that decisions on our future programme must be made.

* In quoting this example I will show how ineffective it is for any Government appointed committee of inquiry to determine any need for change in our **immigration** policy and how difficult it is to have the Government accept any recommendation for change that it might submit.

* The Committee should support the amendment, moved in relation to the estimates of this Department, seeking the establishment of a joint select committee to inquire into Australia's future **immigration** needs.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Immigration been drawn to an article in the 'Australian' on Tuesday, 13 th October, written by  Mr Peter  Ryan, in which he claims that  Mr J.  R. Wilson, who has been appointed by the Minister to head the inquiry into the costs and benefits of **immigration**, has prejudged the inquiry already by stating that he is in favour of **immigration**?

* Report of the Committee of Economic Inquiry in 1965, the Vernon Report, pointed out that **immigration** was a more costly source of skill than training additional craftsmen in Australia.

* The Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Training points out that although **immigration** has been a valuable source of skilled labour in the past it is not clear that intakes have always been sufficiently closely related to labour market needs.

* It also mentions the inflationary pressures that may arise from **immigration**.

* For many years the Leader of the Opposition made a passing reference to **immigration**.

* But the social philosophy of the **immigration** programme has been one which has influenced Australia socially as well as economically.

* Every **immigration** Minister, from the first Minister forward to the present Minister, has indicated that **immigration** in Australia provides a welcome addition to the natural increase in the Australian work force.

* Having regard to family code policies enunciated at Launceston, according to which the natural addition to the Australian work force following some second-rate left wing overseas intellectual proposition is to be reduced, he desires to increase **immigration** from non-European sources.

* He proposes that **immigration** no longer be an addition to the Australian growth programme; it is in fact to be a substitute for it.

* I do not think we can show that an increasing area of **immigration** will create more unemployment.

* But at the moment I am not inclined to come down on the side of those people who say that we ought to reduce **immigration** simply on the grounds that it increases competition for jobs, though probably not on very good logical grounds.

* I welcome this debate tonight in the hope that people will continue to look at the subject of migration in its constructive aspects and learn from the last 30 years the lessons we should apply to a continuing flow of **immigration**.

* In a way **immigration** produces a different kind of Australia for us all to live in.

* Has any consideration been given to enlarging our present staff in Beirut and to relaxing our **immigration** requirements to allow a larger number of Lebanese citizens to migrate to Australia on compassionate grounds?

* We had the division on **immigration**.

* I rise tonight to draw attention to their plight, to the inadequacies of the **immigration** programme and to propose immediate corrective action by our authorities both here and in the South American countries concerned.

* The Government considered that with the changing pattern of **immigration** into Australia and the Government's own initiatives in **immigration** policy giving priority to family reunion and sponsored' migration it should attain self-sufficiency in respect of movement of migrants and that it was no longer appropriate for Australia to remain a member of ICEM.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 15 August 1978: 

 Mr A. D. Fogarty; Department of Labor and Immigration 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1978: 
Government spokesmen, particularly the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Minister,  Mr MacKellar,  take every opportunity to point out alleged dire consequences if we do not boost **immigration** intakes to unrealisticafly high levels.

* Firstly, I point out that I have never outlined a figure which the **immigration** level should reach.

* Secondly, the same article states: 
The Government's argument is based on questionable assertions made in the recent 'green paper' on **immigration** policies and Australia's population, which was prepared by the Minister's own department on his instruction.

* This growth has been in the main accelerated by the establishment of the **immigration** policy by the then Labor Government and its continuation over the years by a succession of coalition governments.

* The **immigration** policy critical to the prosperity, development and security of Australia in the 50's was equally admirably suited to our requirements in the 60's.

* The announcement by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  that a review of **immigration** policy is to be undertaken is most timely but 1 suspect it was not very well considered before being determined.

* In regard to the number of personnel serving in Australia House I point out that of the total of just over  1,000,  some  380  are engaged in the **immigration** side of the activities of that House.

* The significance of this **immigration** activity is illustrated by the number of personnel there.

* I ask: Following the recent discussion on **immigration**, can the Minister assure the House that there will be no change in the Government's policy of facilitating the reunion of families through sponsored **immigration**, while at the same time continuing the policy of Commonwealth sponsorship of migrants from countries from which there is no tradition of family sponsorship?

* I am not sure why the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is sitting at the table and is responsible for this Bill because it is obviously not an **immigration** Bill.

* Yet we have the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs taking charge of this legislation as though he does not realise and the Government does not concede that it is not an **immigration** matter but an imposition on the workers of this country who are going away for an occasional holiday.

* I congratulate the Government on its **immigration** policy.

* Of course there are critics and in the main this criticism centres on the proposition that **immigration** inhibits economic growth, that our policy is based on just getting numbers and ignores quality.

* Other critics regard **immigration** as the cause of pollution, of the urban sprawl, inflation and so on.

* Some critics say that **immigration** is the root cause of Australia's problems.

* Inflation is neither confined to nor worst in Australia and the other great countries of **immigration**.

* The attitude that our **immigration** programme is simply some kind of numbers game is completely wrong.

* Great damage could result from Australian politicians speaking in neighbouring countries without exercising the utmost care to be factual about Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Anyone who has travelled in these countries knows that there are many misleading stories about Australia's **immigration** policy, I have been in the East, the Near East and the Far East and I have heard these stories from the indigenous people.

* There is, of course, great difference of opinion among honourable members on the Opposition side and they are definitely divided over their **immigration** policy.

* 1 **immigration** position on the Opposition side.

* In the main our **immigration** has run on sound lines.

* The Government's proposal is a forward step in the fulfilment of our ideals and aspirations in the field of **immigration**.

* This is true not only in Australia but in other countries with **immigration** programmes.

* I am pleased also to note that evidently the Minister and the Department of Immigration are taking note of submissions made in this Parliament and at **immigration** conventions, and by interested organisations, about the need for something to be done in the field of education.

* It would not be wrong, and it would not indicate any lack of support for our **immigration** problem, if a committee of the standing of the Vernon Committee were set up to inquire into the economic value and the economic cost of **immigration** to Australia and to make recommendations on any alterations that are necessary, for economic reasons, to our **immigration** policy.

* If, as has been claimed by the professor, we are spending about $4,000 on each migrant in social costs - not actual dollars - then it would not be a bad idea if we had statistical and economic data provided to show us the absolute value of **immigration**.

* We believe that Australia's national reputation has been damaged because many of its policies are interpreted as racist - I refer to those on **immigration**, Aboriginals and New Guinea, just to name a few - but primarily we believe that it is wrong to play sport against a team which deliberately excludes players of a different colour.

* Is the Government's policy on **immigration** to be altered in any way as a result of the ambivalent attitude towards **immigration** revealed in recent conflicting statements attributed to 2 spokesmen on this subject belonging to the Opposition?

* As I recall, the last part of his speech dealt with the Australian Labor Party's **immigration** policy.

* Has his attention been drawn to statements made by the newly arrived Japanese Consul criticising visa regulations applying to Japanese tourists, and to statements by Japanese business.ment about restrictions under our **immigration** laws on Japanese interests establishing industries in Australia and providing workers and executives?

* If so, in view of the obvious misunderstanding of the position, will he state the facts to the House and give assurance that the Japanese are treated no worse and no better than other nationals under our **immigration** policy?

* Will he also agree that Japanese industrialists have been encouraged and have never lacked the initiative and also the ability to expand and to protect their trade with Australia irrespective of tariff or **immigration** policies?

* I want to make a brief reference to **immigration** and how it affects the employment situation.

* As I see it, there are two important issues: Firstly, how our population is running by world standards and, secondly, what effect **immigration** has on our work force or, better still, our unemployment situation.

* Under previous LiberalCountry Party governments the broad policy was to increase our population by **immigration** by an average of 1 per cent of the population each year.

* Today, because of economic pressures, our **immigration** program has dropped off dramatically.

* Meetings of State Ministers associated with **immigration** and myself are held regularly under this Government and they now include the New Zealand Minister for Immigration.

* I would like to see in existence an arrangement whereby the total **immigration** procedures of the two countries are brought as far as possible into harmony.

* am asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1977: 
Senior officers of my Department have been in consultation with the National Urban and Regional Development Authority regarding the assistance which can be given, through the **immigration** program, to the development of regional centres and other centres outside the metropolitan areas.

* On **immigration**, the Labor Party believes that Australia should be a patchwork quilt with all the various colours opposing each other, building up hatreds and bringing about a condition within this nation which would not be conducive to a free peace loving people.

* It is up to this Government to take immediate steps to stop **immigration** to Western Australia until the employment situation eases.

* I do not believe that firms such as this should be able to add to the already high unemployment figures that exist in Western Australia or should have any say as to what happens to Australia's **immigration**.

* Has it stopped **immigration** and redirected the finance saved to unemployment relief?

* Was not that the basis of the **immigration** policies of  1945  and  1946?

* The Government hides the figures for **immigration** unemployment.

* The Government cannot regard **immigration** in  1973  as it did in  1953.

* The fact is that NUMAS was adopted to boost the **immigration** program which had been cut back severely by an absolute lack of job vacancies in Australia for the Australian born and the overseas born.

* Evidence in our possession shows that NUMAS is biased in favour of rich, white English-speaking middle class immigrants from Rhodesia and the USA, while at the same time significantly weakening the family reunion aspect of the **immigration** program.

* However, while that is not the situation, representations you receive alleging conflicts between the **immigration** policy and Australia's labour market situation are best answered by the Minister for Immigration.

* A further report, commenting on the Government's proposed **immigration** intake of 210,000 in the triennium 1978-81, says: 
It is 'rather perplexed' at the formula- 'growing unemployment, therefore increased **immigration**'.

* It asks: 'What is the point of increasing **immigration** when in Australia and throughout the world recession is on the increase?'.

* This phasing out of skilled **immigration**, 8,000 to 10,000 a year, and the projected increase in the demand for skilled labour, 10,000 a year, would require an increase of 20,000 a year on current apprenticeship intakes.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
1 am not aware, and I have nor been aware, that members of this Parliament - the honourable member or other members - have reached the conclusion that the **immigration** programme is bad for Australia, as the honourable member appears to suggest.

* For our part, we have been conducting an **immigration** programme which, in terms of numbers, has been greatly successful.

* Are they correct in saying that the States favour a change in the present level of **immigration**?

* On 18th October 1972 the AssistantDirector of the Special Reports Branch of the Department of **immigration** recommended Marincic's deportation.

* If we assume that  Senator Greenwood  was familiar with this decision - surely he would not undertake to advise the Minister for Immigration without familiarising himself with the up-to-date state of the law regarding **immigration** matters - we can only reach one conclusion about this conduct in this matter: In order to protect a terrorist from deportation, he misinformed the Minister responsible for the issuance of a deportation order about the legal consequences for the terrorist of such an order.

* If we claim the right to dictate how the South Africans should handle their internal problems, cannot other countries by the same premise place boycotts and sanctions on Australia because they might claim that they do not like the way we treat our Aboriginals or that they do not like our **immigration** policy?

* At the outset I should like to give a brief survey of the history of the Australian **immigration** programme.

* The Minister described the programme in his publication Immigration in the Seventies' in these words: 
Perhaps I could go further and say that our **immigration** programme ranks as one of the great achievements of our time and is acknowledged as such by people of all shades of politics and thought in Australia today.

* Recently the Minister announced the terms of a far reaching inquiry into all the ramifications of the **immigration** programme not, as he said, to curtail migration but rather, as he put it, to study certain aspects and allied matters that he mentioned to me in a letter which was just an endorsement of what he had already put out publicly.

* He said: 
A comprehensive review of the benefits and cost to Australia of **immigration** conducted on traditional patterns.

* The appointment of authorities on urbanisation and environment as consultants on the **immigration** programme, 
Convinced that increased population is vitalto the future development of Australia, the Australian Labor Party will support and uphold a vigorous and expanding **immigration** programme administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* In recent times criticism has been made by some sections of the community of the demands of **immigration** on our economic capacity.

* This is not an unusual pattern because similar criticism was offered by critics of sustained **immigration** as long as a century ago.

* The Minister has not stated any individual names except those appointed to certain **immigration** committees.

* The **immigration** programme owes its success amongst other things to the united support of most of the major political parties of Australia.

* With this background I suggest to the Minister that in the interests of **immigration** and its further this inquiry should have been conducted by an all-party parliamentary commitee from both Houses of the National Parliament.

* We have been seeking to lay the basis, through consideration of a Green Paper, for an on-going **immigration** policy.

* The right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  has a deserved reputation in the field of **immigration**.

* In summary, the new arrangements recently negotiated by this Government, and for which I accept responsibility as the Minister responsible for this portfolio, will involve, firstly, a change of sea contractor; secondly, the increased use of air transport by Qantas but no actual commitment to total air movement in the future; thirdly, the preservation of a choice of sea transport for those who prefer it; fourthly, a considerable saving in transport costs; and finally, in my own view and in the view of the most senior officers of my Department in Canberra with whom I have been in close consultation and of officers overseas with whom I have been in telephonic communication, no adverse effect will result to the total **immigration** programme.

* - Mr Speaker, I have moved this motion arising out of the refusal by a certain honourable member in this House to allow me to make a statement on **immigration**.

* But I can hardly remain silent today when again I am publicly misrepresented in respect of our **immigration** policy.

* I have been represented in the eyes of the Australian people as having misinterpreted or not knowing our **immigration** policy.

* I pay tribute to actions taken by previous governments and refer to the **immigration** reforms of Prime Minister Holt and the May 1967 referendum.

* We will see the end of these vicious, nasty, racist, **immigration** groups who took such a role in the last election campaign in the electorate of Riverina.

* There is a need for special orientation, lt has been suggested by speakers at **immigration** conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage women to participate; that women teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, **immigration** is one of the few subjects on which Government and Opposition members agree pretty much on all aspects.

* Going back over the history of **immigration**.

* But I believe the motives for **immigration** have changed since those years.

* One of the problems is that we cannot control the flow of **immigration** by, as it were, turning the tap on and turning the tap off.

* I am also concerned about the problems which are arising within the' Yugoslav community in Australia because, as I recollect, when this legislation was foreshadowed and the **immigration** agreement with Yugoslavia was entered into a year or so ago the arrangement was that we were to receive a very large number of skilled tradesmen migrants.

* I think there are some things in the Bill and some attitudes about our **immigration** policy that can be altered.

* the problem of increasing the skilled work force 'will not be solved by- raising the **immigration** target in order to acquire more craftsmen from overseas, although anything that can be done to increase the proportion of skilled persons among immigrants will be useful'.

* The **immigration** powers enable the Minister to deal appropriately with any such cases which come to notice.

* In the 2 1 years since the Migration Act was passed the character of the Australian community has markedly changed, with radical amendment to **immigration** policies and in the volume and nature of movements into and out of Australia.

* Most travellers respect Australia's **immigration** laws.

* Unfortunately, there are some who enter or remain illegally in Australia, regarding breaches of **immigration** laws and policies as offences of small significance.

* Clearly, people who try to evade **immigration** controls should gain no advantage over those many others who, being also ineligible to migrate to Australia, are prepared to abide by the rules.

* It believes that **immigration** laws and procedures should be observed and followed just as any other Australian law should be observed.

* By 1 973 discrimination on grounds of race had disappeared from **immigration** selection policy.

* The present level of **immigration** for settlement is relatively low, with an emphasis on encouraging only those skills in short supply.

* In this regard, I draw the attention of honourable members to the Minister's statement, 'Immigration Policies and Australia's Population', of 7 June 1978 which emphasised the Government's recognition of **immigration** as a necessary element in economic growth.

* We are pursuing a longterm approach to population building in which **immigration** is the only directable factor.

* The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend an effective **immigration** policy and program to all persons who genuinely have the future welfare of this nation in mind.

* The relatively low volume of admission for settlement in more recent years inevitably prompts attempts to circumvent **immigration** policies and procedures either by malpractice or by entering for allegedly temporary purposes but then staying on without authority.

* A visa is a document or notation specifically in the form of a stamped impression in a passport which informs the carrier company and **immigration** officer at the port of arrival in Australia that the holder, prima facie, may enter Australia.

* The search for persons who breach the **immigration** law is an expensive and an unwanted burden on the Australian taxpayer.

* A number of these provisions arose out of the recommendations of a management review which reported on its investigation of **immigration** policies and procedures in July of last year.

* The Government believes that the Bill will provide for a considerable increase in control capacity while new **immigration** legislation is being developed.

* That figure obviously shows something is wrong, but it is seen to be even more revealing when one considers the statement of the Minister for Labor and **immigration**, who I see is now at the table.

* To set against the many benefits of **immigration** there are costs in education, housing and transport which are real factors for State governments even though the cost of **immigration** itself is a minor element in total Commonwealth expenditure.

* Strange to relate, as the honourable member for McMillan pointed out quite rightly - I have mentioned this matter before time after time in this Committee - the past **immigration** programme has depended and the future **immigration** programme still is depending on secondary industries to provide employment for new settlers coming to Australia.

* I trust that the ensuing debate at least will lead to consideration of vital questions of policy in the future and will lead, to some degree, to solutions to the problems which we will have to face in the short term and the long term in relation to population policy, **immigration** and community affairs.

* He also says that **immigration** also has declined dramatically in recent times.

* What we must ask is whether the fertility and **immigration** slow-down is temporary.

* Why is **immigration** more limited at the present time than it has been in the past?

* Let us look at **immigration**.

* If we did accept the assumption of the Minister- I suggest at this point that the assumption is still very questionable indeed- that fertility rates are declining and will continue inevitably to decline and that the major way in which the Government can affect the composition of Australia's population is through regulating the level and composition of **immigration**, a whole series of other factors needs to be taken into account.

* Firstly, the rationale that the Minister presents in terms of **immigration** is one largely of turning the tap on when we need them and turning the tap off when the economic circumstances do not permit their ready integration into the workforce.

* Since **immigration** levels are determined largely by government decision, predictions must be based on political forethought.

* Australia's capability of managing various levels of **immigration** in relation to overall population size to date has largely been determined by political economy factors, particularly the capacity of many industrialists to seek cheaper labour and bigger markets.

* Indeed, the Minister for Immigration, on page 9 of his statement stated: 
Yes, it may be true that there was a national consensus in 1945 upon **immigration** for those purposes.

* For instance, one of the major characteristics of Australia in terms of **immigration** is its highly industrialised nature and the roles that immigrants are expected to play within the work force.

* When traditional British and Western European sources of **immigration** have declined Australia has had to recruit migrants from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower.

* The result of this **immigration** policy, sustained and continued by the Liberal and National Country Parties for something like 20 years, of the distribution of ethnic groups is very much now mirrored in terms of their distribution within occupations and the class nature of Australia.

* There would have been a decline in numbers working in manufacturing by some 20 per cent in the absence of **immigration**.

* In so far as community tensions are concerned, the Minister contends that it is universally agreed that the **immigration** program has been of enormous benefit to Australia.

* I turn now to the rationale for **immigration**.

* In his ministerial statement the Minister suggested that the Government should maintain its position as stated in a policy statement on **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* He talked about **immigration** being an instrument of Australia's population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those national policies are directed.

* I believe that this is a commitment to population growth with **immigration** as a prime factor in that growth.

* I believe that need should be one of the most important factors when embarking upon any further **immigration** programs.

* If we are to have **immigration** programs we should have **immigration** programs that strive for respect, equity and fairness for the individual and that reflect as far as possible respect for and the diversity of values and life styles.

* I can assure him that as the first Minister for Immigration and the one who laid the foundations ofour **immigration** programme we have to thank him for initiating the programme and for ensuring that it has been successful up to the present time.

* Are we to believe that significant modification to **immigration** policy could occur only some time in 1966?

* For the first time Australia indicated that it was ready to deal with the non-aligned and with Asia and Africa on their own terms, without racial discrimination in **immigration** policy and without overriding military preoccupation.

* I raised the question of interpreter services in State government administration and health and legal institutions with State ministers for **immigration** at a conference on 11 May 1973.

* Perhaps this is a delightful and new way to get around our **immigration** laws and to build up our population.

* Let us look at the other basic omission from the statement- the **immigration** issue.

* Is it not the case that the Australian High Commissioner there is not able to process **immigration** cases without bringing staff" from Athens?

* The people who live in the new Mallee electorate will not have easy access to departmental offices, such as those concerned with health, **immigration**, housing and repatriation.

* Our population from **immigration** alone has increased by at least 3 million.

* I am sure that the major financial difficulties of State governments flow directly from the Commonwealth's **immigration** policy, whereby it spends more than S50m a year to bring migrants here only to dump them mercilessly, relentlessly and unceremoniously into the laps of State governments to nurture, house, educate and employ them, without any consideration for the ability or otherwise of the authorities which must of necessity be the final link in a migrant's rehabilitation in his new country - the local government authorities.

* What is the Government's **immigration** programme for 1970 and 1971?

* Immigration, upon notice: 
What were the production errors which caused the **immigration** booklet 'Employment'  to  be withdrawn from circulation in 1971.

* In other parts of the world we find, for example, that after the formation of Israel in 1948 the **immigration** intake reached 239,000 per annum in 1949 on a base population of only 800,000.

* However, attention has already been drawn to the fact that **immigration** in Australia appears to be at the crossroads.

* Finally, because I have to allow other members to make a short speech in this debate, I suggest that the problem of the crossroads position of the **immigration** programme as it is seen by some is near enough to being real.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
Immigration 
The Government acknowledges the favourable impact which **immigration** has had on Australia's economic and cultural development.

* Consistent with this view the Government has decided on a target of 70 000 persons for the **immigration** program for 1976-77, compared with the estimated intake of 50 000 in 1975-76.

* In the area of my portfolio, **immigration** and ethnic affairs, the cuts are particularly savage.

* It never sees it as the result of taxation policy which destroys incentive or its **immigration** policy.

* The adjustments to the **immigration** program have taken account of changes in the level and structure of employment demand.

* They were industrial affairs - 1 am sure the Labor Party has not forgotten about that one; defence; **immigration** - the honourable member lor Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  would not have forgotten that one; cities and decentralisation; education; and health.

* Applications by Asians in Uganda will continue to be considered on their individual merits in accordance with our non-European **immigration** policies.

* The confusion in this respect is similar to the confused situation which reigns in the field of **immigration** at the present time in that the Minister for Labour appears to be adopting a different line from the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby).

* The main reasons for the increase were the economic and **immigration** policies commenced by the Chifley Government and outlined in the White Paper on Full Employment in 1945 and subsequent studies.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1979: 
1 ) How many persons have applied for **immigration** to Australia since 1 January 1979.

* How many persons have been accepted for **immigration** since 1 January 1979. 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
1 ) Has his recent move to increase the **immigration** quota by 20 000 persons provoked the comment in some sectors, that it is a deliberate attempt to increase the pool of unemployed.

* Will the increased quota mean that compassionate **immigration** for people from countries such as Lebanon will be made more accessible.

* When we consider the problems that face us in the area of migrant education we cannot escape the conclusion that Australia's post war **immigration** program has been irresponsibly administered in the area of migrant child education, in the area of migrant adult education, and in the area of migrant integration.

* The former Minister for Health would be well advised to stay quiet in view of the ineffectual way in which he handled matters affecting health and is now handling **immigration** matters.

* While there I took the opportunity to talk with our **immigration** officers in every country there in which Australia is represented.

* I might say on this general question of the departure of migrants from Australia that the figures for 1970-71 recently published by the Commonwealth Statistician which show that about 28,000 migrants left Australia or stated that they were leaving Australia permanently, have to be seen against the very high level of **immigration** that we have had in the last 3 years.

* Is it correct that there has been a change in the Government's **immigration** policy, as reported in the Melbourne 'Age' this morning?

* Is it also correct to say that the Government has re-started the **immigration** program?

* I have served with the honourable member for Grayndler on the **immigration** committee of the Australian Labor Party and I can assure the House that there has never been any division between us on that committee on any issue.

* The Labor Party has stated quite clearly in its policy on **immigration** that one of the points to be taken into consideration is whether any frictions will arise.

* We may know how insignificant is his position as  chairman  of the Liberal Party's **immigration** committee.

* Have they ever had to go to a department of **immigration** in any country and ask for a special tax stamp, when they could not speak Japanese, Italian or French?

* Nowhere in any of our international airports do we find a sign telling people where the **immigration** office or the customs office is situated.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 18 September 1979: 
Has he recevied special representations from the United States or Thai Governments or any other source regarding **immigration** of those persons known as the hill people from Laos, recruited by the US CIA during the Indochina conflict.

* Their beneficial effect to our style of living since the commencement of the **immigration** program in 1949 is well known to all of us and is welcomed.

* The estimates under consideration are not merely those of the Department of Immigration because our Department covers not only **immigration** but also emigration, settlement and welfare, citizenship and population.

* In view of the unemployment problems in Western Australia, will the Minister investigate the possibility of immediately curtailing further Commonwealth **immigration** to Western Australia except of those persons who have guaranteed employment and housing or to reunite families and will not displace or add to the employment difficulties of people who are already citizens of Australia?

* Will he make the additional funds obtained by the curtailment of **immigration** available for relief in the unemployment area until unemployment is relieved?

* by leave -  Mr Speaker,  one of the major new **immigration** initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of migrants into the Australian community.

* Careful **immigration** programs and selection process of course are major factors in smooth racial inter-relations in Australia.

* Therefore, I believe it is very important to consider the basis of **immigration** into a country when faced with problems such as those covered by the Bill.

* Problems of discrimination can be engendered by **immigration** policy.

* An essential precondition for the solution of such problems within a community such as Australia's is adequate control of **immigration**.

* One can agree or disagree with our **immigration** policies of the past but, taken in the broad and in no sense complacently, we have every reason to be enormously thankful for the capacity of newcomers to integrate and assist in the development of a fuller, more tolerant, more vigorous and more sophisticated Australian society.

* In my view it is essential that future **immigration** policies recognise the inherent sovereignty of the host country in the control of the movement of people into that country.

* I have spent some little time on **immigration** aspects of the Bill and I have pointed out that the control of the **immigration** flow, whilst essential, does not solve the problems already existing.

* In relation to the protected zone provisions permitting freedom of movement by the local people in the carrying on of traditional activities, the treaty will provide for co-operation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements.

* In relation to the Protected Zone provisions which will permit the continued performance of traditional activities by the local peoples and continued freedom of movement about the Zone for that purpose, there will be cooperation on **immigration**, customs, health and quarantine arrangements, although each country will retain the right to implement national controls to prevent abuses or other possible adverse effects of the Protected Zone provisions.

* It is quite incongruous that parliamentary committees examine all major aspects of government such as foreign affairs, defence, environment, **immigration**, public works and expenditure, yet there has been no inquiry into energy by any committee of this Parliament.

* Before dealing with the amendment that is before the chamber, which asks the Government to set up a joint select committee to inquire into **immigration**, I would like to congratulate the chamber - by that I mean honourable members on both sides of the chamber - on being embarrassed by the speech of the Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns).

* Then over the last 1 or 2 years an attack developed on the **immigration** programme, combining often contradictory economic growth arguments and so-called quality of life arguments.

* We have others arguing that in fact **immigration** is increasing our gross national product at too great a rate and that all that matters is the so-called quality of life.

* This argument ignores the fact that most of the problems mentioned are problems in all industrial societies, even those with no **immigration**.

* As the attacks on **immigration** increase both sides of the House might decide that it would be politically dangerous to defend **immigration**, no matter what the facts proved.

* This tendency to bi-partisanship, or what I would call me-too-ism, has been attached to **immigration** for a long time, but it is not peculiar to **immigration** as far as political issues in this country are concerned.

* It has been helped by the fact that Government leaders until recently have been urging another dream, that of getting bigger and bigger, and secondly that the Government has no information on a cost-benefit basis on **immigration**.

* As recently as  1969  the then Treasurer, who is now Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  was asked a question on the costs of **immigration** by the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin).

* I was sorry for the Minister when, as Minister for Immigration, he had to defend the Government's **immigration** programme at a summer school of the Australian Institute of Political Science earlier this year.

* The people there were antagonistic towards him and the **immigration** programme and he was unable to produce appropriate figures to defend it.

* It was the fault of the Government which has been in office for  22  years and has not properly analysed its **immigration** programme.

* To summarise, let us not accept as factual the belief of those people who blame a whole host of modern problems on migrants, thereby providing a unique Australian analysis of problems that in fact characterise most advanced industrialised societies, most- of which do not have **immigration** programmes, anyway, as the honourable member for Henty  (Mr Fox)  pointed out.

* It is advocated rightly by the Minister and those who spoke in the debate on the Green Paper that it should be a matter of - 
The Minister made a speech- he did not advise me that he was going to deliver his speech, so I suppose it is par for the course- and he talked about the decline in the growth rate of the labour force without **immigration**.

* We have been through periods of rapid expansion in our industrial and manufacturing capacity, of rapid population and **immigration** growth, of stock market booms, of unprecedented minerals and resource discoveries and of significant recognition by the world community and, in particular, by many of our Asian neighbours.

* The ALP supports an **immigration** policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance - 
Last year the then Minister for Immigration announced the appointment of 3 committees to inquire into the scheme.

* I  suggest to the Minister that in the interests of **immigration** and its future this inquiry should have been conducted by an all party parliamentary committee from both Houses of the National Parliament.

* If any programme deserves a committee of this type it is the **immigration** programme because the scheme itself owes its success to the sympathetic support of members from all parties in the Parliament.

* The real question to be investigated is why the Commonwealth in continuing the **immigration** programme has thrust its responsibilities in housing, education and health services on to the States and has not provided adequate financial resources resulting in shortages and deficit budgets.

* The ramifications of the **immigration** programme are enormous, and were exemplified in the Minister's speech recently when he said: 
This year 1969-70 our **immigration** programme calls for the arrival of 175,000 settlers.

* The categories of people acceptable for **immigration** ought to be extended at the Minister's discretion.

* The supply of doctors is currently running in excess of the Committee's projections because of three main factors: population has grown at a slower rate than expected; the **immigration** of doctors is much greater than expected; and medical schools are producing more graduates than expected as a result of lower student wastage rates and adjustments to courses.

* He spoke at length about **immigration**.

* He said that **immigration** should be a fundamental aspect of the proposals that are implemented.

* Of course it will be  under  this Government's **immigration** policy.

* In relation to **immigration** the Opposition has put forward a proposal that existing dwellers in this country will nominate newcomers on a relative basis.

* Does the honourable member for Reid want to perpetuate the overcrowded cities by bringing together the fundamentals of the existing Opposition **immigration** policy and then adding this proposition?

* These costs determined in Australia are heavily influenced by national policies pursued by governments - not only by this Government but also by previous governments - being such things as economic growth, full employment, the diversification of industry and the pursuance of a high scale of **immigration**.

* the Minister for Immigration nevertheless has power to make an order declaring that a particular Aboriginal does not require a permit to leave Australia even though he is subject to control; and 
The Bill we are discussing is another example of the Government's bringing to itself power to deal with certain people in the community- and that is what has happened- while we abrogate our responsibility to deal with foreign affairs, **immigration**, defence- all the matters for which we have specific responsibility, about which I feel very concerned and on which I rarely have an opportunity to speak.

* The Council will possess the necessary powers for local government activities in the village area, and will advise the Government on a broad range of matters affecting the community for example education, health and **immigration**.

* All these things are utterly inconsistent because under the present Government's policy and as far as can be foreseen, unless there is a major change in Australia's **immigration** policy, only about 2 million people will be added to the total population of Australia between now and the year 2000.

* They will not come from natural increase, and the Government's policy has effectively turned ofT the **immigration** tap.

* Whilst the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to receive monthly returns of staff employed at its posts, these reflect total numbers employed without any split-up into staff employed on **immigration** or other specific activities.

* One of the greatest difficulties is that our Government will not accept them on normal **immigration** terms because they fail to produce a number of documents considered necessary by us.

* In all cases normal **immigration** requirements of health and character must be met.

* Broadly, the publications in the Department's library cover the subjects of **immigration**, emigration, the education, health and welfare of migrants, automatic data processing and demography.

* The short title - Immigration (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the **immigration** provision in the Constitution.

* A recent review of the service required and provided in Geelong indicated that current arrangements are adequate for the amount of **immigration** business in the area.

* There has been no re-starting of the **immigration** program because the **immigration** program has continued.

* One was that it was decided that the **immigration** program of the Government in future .is to be finely tuned to the economy.

* The second was that a decision was made in the face of unemployment at that time not to import unemployment by maintaining the **immigration** intake at a level which was not commensurate with our national needs.

* There has been no suggestion of re-starting the **immigration** program; it was never stopped.

* In the first quarter of this year the **immigration** intake was something more than 11,000.

* It is the view of my colleague on this side that the administration and the equivocation of the Government's **immigration** policy has caused confusion both here and elsewhere.

* But the man who was taking the keenest interest in what was being said by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  was the man who wrote the policy of the Australian Labor Party on **immigration** and was refused the right to administer it, the man who was stripped of his position as spokesman on **immigration** and refused permission on the Opposition side of the House to enunciate his views until the then Government gave him the right to do so.

* Let me quote from John Edwards' column 'Politics' in the 'Australian' of 5 March: 
It's not easy to reconcile the announcement that Australia has dropped its racially discriminatory **immigration** policy with what few facts are available about the results of Labor's **immigration** program.

* The column quoted a cable dated 22 February 1974 from the Australian Ambassador in the Philippines,  Mr Henderson,  to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Immigration as follows: 
I believe it is a matter of some urgency and of real importance in terms of Australia's relations generally with the Philippines that Australian administrative procedures of **immigration** be brought into line with the principles enunciated by the Prime Minister.

* isn't it odd that the Australian Ambassador on the spot, presumably advised by his Second Secretary who handles **immigration**, should have misunderstood so seriously what happens inside his own embassy.

* Some allegations also have been made about the manner in which the previous Government conducted its **immigration** policy.

* This is a debate brought about by the failure of the Government to produce a coherent **immigration** policy.

* We on this side of the House, in the traditions under which migration has been debated in this Parliament for many years have no desire to spread denigration in this most sensitive arena and I will firmly resist any moves to foster debate on **immigration** along selfish, arrogant, intolerant or divisive lines.

* On the Prime Minister's recent Asian trip, he assured the Philippines Government that Australia no longer had an **immigration** policy which discriminated on the basis of colour.

* The Prime Minister was reported as telling  President  Marcos that no longer would double standards be applied to Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Crushing debt burdens imposed on these authorities by years of Commonwealth engendered **immigration** pressures and Commonwealth financial neglect must be met from a narrow tax base.

* Minister for **immigration**  (Mr Lynch)  announced outside the Parliament his private, leisurely inquiry into some aspects, and no report is yet in sight.

* It should not be thought that those people making unauthorised arrivals in Australia, largely arriving at Darwin, have not been subject to Australian **immigration** laws; they have.

* They have not travelled in an authorised fashion but certainly they are subject to all the **immigration** laws and procedures as soon as they arrive.

* I would not want it thought for a moment that Australia's **immigration** laws are being circumvented in any way by these arrivals.

* If honourable members wish to use their time in the debate on the Estimates to speak about this important matter of **immigration** there is adequate time for discussion.

* Statement on **immigration** by the Honourable A. J. Grassby, 11 October 1973.

* Honourable members will remember that earlier this year the steamer  Australis  was the vessel from which some 54 people decamped and sought to evade normal **immigration** controls.

* I should make it clear that Indian nationals are not the only people involved in efforts to circumvent Australian **immigration** requirements.

* The Department of Labor and Immigration will handle **immigration** matters in Griffith through its office there.

* Regional **immigration** offices are functioning in Wollongong, Newcastle and Townsville.

* Is **immigration** from Japan expected to rise sharply in the future following the announcement of increased interest by Japan in the development of Australia's resources?

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 March 1979: 
1 ) Is it a fact that Australian officials overseas destroy or cause destruction of a number of applications for (a) **immigration** to Australia or (b) temporary or permanent residency in Australia, before the applications are considered or processed.

* They should be given assisted passages under our **immigration** scheme.

* It is an **immigration** matter.

* I suggest that whilst she is not eligible under the family reunion provisions of the Government's **immigration** scheme, she should be eligible under the retirement provisions.

* In view of the continuing flow of illegal immigrants from Vietnam, will the Minister consider allowing another brief amnesty to illegal immigrants now in Australia who meet normal **immigration** qualifications?

* The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  was appointed as spokesman on **immigration** by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).

* The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  said that he was disappointed with an **immigration** agreement that we had wilh Yugoslavia because of the small number of skilled people who were coming to Australia from that country.

* Has his attention been drawn to the report in 'The Australian' on Thursday, 18th March 1971, stating that 2 Australians are among 237 foreign nationals who are being held in **immigration** detention camps for illegal entry into Indonesia?

* This applies also to **immigration** policy, defence and other matters.

* If one can criticise the past - I think it is perhaps legitimate for the Opposition to do this - there is probably an under-estimation of the problem that has been placed upon educational authorities by an **immigration** program that for a while introduced into Australia people who had had only 2 or 3 years schooling even in their own language.

* The report states: 
Examination of this shows that it reflects the lower proportion of refugees in current **immigration** - that is, refugees tend to stay more than other migrants - the greater ease of travel in recent years, the strong economic attraction of western Europe, and the growing number of skilled and highly qualified persons who, as part of an increasingly mobile international community, often move from Australia after a few years.

* First of all he wants to whittle away almost completely our **immigration** programme.

* It would like to get its hands if it had the opportunity on that section of government expenditure that flows in the direction, of **immigration** and put it into other fields of expenditure.

* The approach of the Government, however, to reduce the **immigration** intake by about 10,000 people is a reasonable approach and is, I believe, the kind of action that any responsible government would want to take.

* In addition we are still engaged in Vietnam and the great issues of development, **immigration** and other national problems face the nation.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
How many applications for permanent residence from Lebanese people were outside normal **immigration** guidelines between 1 January 1976 and 30 June 1976.

* As a general observation, let me say that I believe that, our **immigration** program is administered very fairly by a Minister who looks at cases impartially and tries to do the best he can for all the people who seek to bring in friends and relatives from overseas.

* That is, a visit of an Australian **immigration** team to Indonesia.

* The article continues: 
Further, the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia was reported in an Indonesian newsletter late last year as saying that his Government did not object to anyone leaving Timor who wanted to, providing he went through the normal **immigration** procedure.

* They were not met, apparently, because of difficulties of the Australian **immigration** team getting into East Timor to carry out interviews, to do the normal processing which is required of anyone who wants to come to Australia, and because various difficulties were put in the way of people wishing to come out of East Timor.

* and (3) It has long been generally acknowledged that each country has a right to determine its own **immigration** policy; it is not appropriate that the Australian Government should comment on the policies of others.

* I believe that the origins of  Mr Calwell's  administration and the administration of successive Liberal-Country Party Ministers, pursued in the **immigration** portfolio, was tremendously important in developing this country in the years after World War II.

* Two or 3 weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science which dealt with the subject of **immigration**.

* Nevertheless, the suggestion is that we have perhaps with some complacence but certainly with considerable agreement across the board or across the floor of this House and elsewhere in the community conducted a programme of **immigration** which has made various gestures and various activity projects to inculcate into migrants the best understanding that seems possible in a given time of the English language, whereby they could better be assimilated - 1 think the word is now integrated - into the community.

* This is one of the major arguments for **immigration** being continuous.

* He has lost the **immigration** division.

* 1 think that that is probably a good thing, because **immigration** ought to be kept as a separate entity.

* Why should they have to bear the strain and the sorrow of having members of their closely knit families separated by thousands of miles due to inhumane and narrow **immigration** guidelines for family re-unification?

* I welcome, therefore, that section of this Government's policy on **immigration** and ethnic affairs which states: 
I trust that this Government's **immigration** policy will be implemented in a manner which is befitting such a worthwhile principle.

* I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General's Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane **immigration** program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social welfare system presently contains regarding migrants.

* These are problems of housing, poverty, unemployment, **immigration**, the aged, the sick and the poorly educated.

* I can assure them that I will tackle their problems assiduously as their problems, whether they be problems of **immigration**, social security or education, are all national problems.

* Will the Minister for Immigration investigate whether international criminals have slipped into Australia as part of the past **immigration** program?

* Most honourable members can remember the great speeches he used to make on a great variety of high policy matters when he was in Opposition, particularly in respect of **immigration**.

* I had hoped to speak in that debate in order to call for an increase in **immigration**, but the debate was terminated rather abruptly and this was not possible.

* When  Mr Arthur  Calwell commenced the post-war **immigration** scheme Australia's population was approximately 7 million.

* Over half the increase of 6.2 million in Australia's population since World War II has been due directly to **immigration**.

* This view has again achieved some prominence in recent times, and I believe it represents a grave misunderstanding of the effects of a high **immigration** intake.

* However, I cannot but question how the Minister can reconcile that view with the present restrictive **immigration** guidelines and an **immigration** target for the forthcoming year of only 70 000.

* Canadian experience has shown that **immigration** has had little or no effect on unemployment in that country.

* High levels of **immigration** to Canada during the past 3 years have not significantly affected the level of unemployment.

* As a result of Labor's **immigration** policies, migration to Australia has declined so drastically that the rate of increase in our population has come to a virtual standstill.

* The Minister further pointed out that the rate of growth of our traditional source countries for **immigration** is decreasing, and that, if current trends continue, it will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century.

* Not a day passes without people coming to my office, wishing to sponsor close friends and relations for **immigration** to this country.

* The day may well come when the United Nations, dominated by Third World powers and the communist bloc, may endeavour to dictate to us what our **immigration** policies will be.

* Apart from the obvious need for the Australian States to establish a Federal government responsible for defence, external affairs, **immigration** and other matters, in which Commonwealth influence is becoming progressively greater, I believe that few problems could have influenced the founders of federation more than the hotchpotch of railway systems of that time, with various gauges in various States.

* To cease **immigration** will not solve the problem.

* [ have always found it a source of amusement when I have had to sign an **immigration** form for entry to the United States of America, for example.

* When I have explained to the poor **immigration** officer who had put the question that I was not really a citizen of the Soviet Union he has said, 'No, it does not mean that'.

* T have always explained to the **immigration** officers in great detail - I am happy to be patient with them - that if I am an Aboriginal I can be quite black and I am also a Caucasian anthropologically speaking.

* When this has happened the **immigration** officer has looked at me with some horror and has said that apparently Congress had not heard about it.

* To be more specific in relation to the measure before us, this Bill comes down against a background of widespread questioning of our **immigration** programme.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, on notice, on 8 May 1978: 
What are the specific statistical bases for the Government's planned **immigration** policy in the light of (a) the inadequacy of current Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force surveys in terms of identifying (i) the extent of unemployment at State levels by age, (ii) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, and (iii) the incidence of unemployment among specific ethnic groups and (b) the inadequacy of current Commonwealth Employment Service registration figures in terms of identifying (i) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, (ii) the nonregistration of married women with working husbands, and (iii) the arbitrary accreditation in Australia of qualifications gained overseas by job applicants.

* The Minister for Labor and Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: 
Australia's **immigration** program is totally and completely nondiscriminatory and based, in fact, on the assessment of individuals and not on their racial background, the pigmentation of their skin or their religion.

* I feel sure that the honourable gentleman has read the Government's published **immigration** and ethnic affairs policy.

* Having regard to the fact that the honourable gentleman so deliberately sought to challenge the policies and views of the present Government, I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  the published policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties on **immigration** and ethnic affairs dated August 1975.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
am asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 April 1977: 
asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
How many **immigration** inquiries were made at Australian Government offices in the U.S.A. during the first six months of (a) 1971.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Has the Government's new **immigration** policy meant the end of a Nurses Training Program in Australia for Asian girls?

* I do not blame the **immigration** officers who were sent to Chile to augment the meagre numbers of people examining those so-called Chileans seeking entry into this country.

* He said: 
asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
What are the titles and dates of all agreements made with other countries on all matters affecting **immigration** since 1945. 
by leave- The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  on the progress report of the Immigration Advisory Council on its inquiry into the departure of settlers.

* I would ask the Minister to consider making a ministerial statement which would set out the full details of the new Government's approach to **immigration**, the basic principles which it is following, the determining factors which influence the total number of migrants which the Government intends to seek to bring to Australia this year and their impact upon the whole migrant program.

* But we invite the Minister, through his Ministry - 1 am sure he will be anxious to do this - to provide the House with an opportunity to debate the whole question of the Government's **immigration** program.

* No responsible government should abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the **immigration** program to be determined simply by the uncoordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and abroad.

* The former Government combined 2 processes in its **immigration** program - sponsorship programs designed to encourage family reunion and actively seeking migrants under government sponsorsip to fulfil those needs not met by family sponsorship.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the conditions he announced yesterday in relation to family reunion of Vietnamese are narrower than those that apply under the normal **immigration** program?

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
If so, how many migrants have settled in each State since the commencement of the **immigration** programme.

* Another point I make concerns the Government's record on **immigration**.

* The Fraser Government's **immigration** policies acknowledge none of these depressing realities.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Immigration been drawn to an article in the 'Daily Telegraph' on 
Australia is being destroyed by its **immigration** policies - 
Immigration,  upon  notice: 
the investigation of offences against laws administered by the Department and of organised circumvention of **immigration** policies and procedures; 
the establishment and development of procedures for the prevention and detection of **immigration** malpractice; 
In respect of persons granted citizenship, advice is obtained from time to time from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

* But I still believe that we can control inflation by proper integration of our policies' on tariffs, subsidies, **immigration**, investment, education and profit and price control.

* those who have entered the country legally and who have since contravened the Commonwealth 's **immigration** laws, as well as those who have entered the country illegally, have been deported during the period 1 January1978 to date.

* The first is in relation to structural unemployment and retraining, and the second is in relation to **immigration**.

* The other matter to which I want to refer is **immigration**.

* When the Whitlam Government took office and unemployment began to rapidly escalate, that Government reduced **immigration** to 30,000 persons per annum.

* On coming to office the Fraser Government increased **immigration** to 70,000 persons a year under strict guidelines.

* These were his words: 
asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
1 ) The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following information: 
Following publicity given last year to claims that large numbers of Papua-New Guineans were entering and residing illegally in the Torres Strait area and northern Queensland an **immigration** task force visited the area on a number of occasions and found the claims to be greatly exaggerated.

* Nevertheless the information obtained by the task force has formed the basis for recommendations to interested Ministers on measures to overcome illegal **immigration** in the area, keeping in mind however the traditional rights and movements of Papua-New Guineans in the Torres Strait.

* But, tonight, I think the honourable member for Grayndler gave us a very reasoned and studied approach to the subject of **immigration**.

* 1 think that his suggestion of an all party committee to look into the subject of **immigration** is something that is well worth considering.

* lt is just over 25 years since Australia's post-war **immigration** programme came into operation and it is interesting to note that, at this time, we are hearing criticism of the scheme.

* As one journalist wrote recently: Australia's **immigration** programme has been taken out of the sacred cow category and subjected to increasing criticism'.

* The Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  has been aware of this type of criticism for some time, and recently, as the honourable member for Grayndler said, the Minister announced that the Government would undertake a full scale review of Australia's **immigration** programame.

* The present scheme was introduced by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  when he was Minister for **immigration** in the Chifley Government, and it has been continued by succeeding Liberal and Country Party Governments.I think it is a matter for some pride, that Australia has absorbed some 2.6 million migrants since 1945.

* Immigration started in Australia when the first 850 people landed at Sydney Cove in  1788,  and it has been said that the history of Australia has been the history of **immigration**.

* All of us in this House, are either immigrants ourselves, or descendants of immigrants, so that we might say that Australia's growth and economic strength have been founded on its **immigration** policy.

* I was pleased to read a. recent statement by the Minister that **immigration** to Australia would continue at a high level and that some 2 million new residents could come to Australia in the 1970's.

* But those of us who have been bom in this country do not have to look far to see what **immigration** has contributed in so many ways to what we have now come to accept as the Australian way of life.

* But our restricted **immigration** policy is not based on any theory of racial superiority.

* Australia's **immigration** policy is directed to maintaining a predominantly homogeneous population, mainly because we would not like to see Australia become the breeding ground of racial prejudice and hatred such as we are witnessing in America and England today.

* Most countries have a restricted **immigration** policy for varying reasons.

* But for moral reasons as well as those of national security, let us not slacken in our efforts to expand this wonderful country by continuing our **immigration** programme.

* He makes numerous statements and now nobody seems to know what is the present **immigration** policy of this country.

* Perhaps we should look very carefully at our **immigration** policy.

* Australia has a very sound **immigration** policy.

* The Australian **immigration** policy had one great architect.

* This has been his general attitude, and perhaps that is the reason why he dumped the peasant from Grayndler as Labor's spokesman on **immigration** matters.

* It certainly has been a restrictive **immigration** policy, but not nearly as restrictive as the policies of many Asian countries.

* With its vaunted high standard of living, culture and all the rest, the problems which it faces are a striking example of how difficult this **immigration** question is.

* We have Britain's example of what happened when she allowed unrestricted **immigration**.

* Eventually she had to restrict **immigration**.

* Today we have many policies on **immigration**.

* Here again, in an attempt to gain political popularity he has fallen down on his face again because the Australian people do not want his **immigration** policy or the policy of so many others who have expressed variations of Labor's policy.

* As a matter of fact, I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party has an **immigration** policy today, because it has left the policy of the right honourable member for Melbourne and the honourable member for Grayndler.

* We Australians have established an **immigration** policy to give us a homogeneous society, and we are determined to maintain it.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
I am very pleased that this question has been raised today because it gives me the opportunity to explain away some of the misconceptions which presently exist regarding the Government's **immigration** policy- misconceptions which seem to be shared by honourable members opposite.

* At this stage we do not have any clear indication from the settler arrival statistics of what the precise impact of the various categories of the new **immigration** policy .

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  should also examine the principles of **immigration** which are followed by this Government and which were presented to the House by the Minister last year.

* The second of these principles states: 
This clearly is the basis of NUMAS and the basis for the administration of our **immigration** program.

* If honourable members opposite are concerned about relationships between **immigration** and unemployment, they should have a close look at their own party's policy in this area.

* In other words, the bulk of the Opposition's **immigration** intake would not be related to labour market considerations at all.

* It is strange that the Opposition, when in office, brought **immigration** levels to the lowest point on record and did away with a separate Department of Immigration, incorporating that Department with the Department of Labour.

* Now it would promise an **immigration** intake comprised mainly of those people who would be competing for jobs at the most competitive end of the labour market, that is the unskilled area, or the area where there is no specific occupational demand.

* The Labor Party never seems to accept that there are positive employment aspects to a sensibly controlled **immigration** program.

* Of course, **immigration** means a greater demand for housing, consumer durables and other goods and services produced in Australia.

* rightly points out that it is illogical to concentrate attention on the effects of migration on the supply of labour, especially during recession, without admitting the demand-creating features of our **immigration** program.

* The general evidence from Australia's own history as well as the post-war histories of European countries which absorbed vast numbers of guest workers and immigrants, is that **immigration** does not increase unemployment.

* My own view is that increased **immigration** at this time would probably act as a valuable stimulus to the economy, yielding widespread benefits.

* He refers to the Green Paper that followed the Borrie report, and is critical of the **immigration** program, of the ideological commitment of the Liberal Party to pursue population growth policies.

* The power over **immigration** and emigration - who comes into their country and who goes out of it - would be a very important step in self-government and 1 believe that it would lead to certain changes in attitudes that might improve race relations.

* However, the comparability of the figures is limited by factors such as the retention of students in the same grade for more than 1 year, **immigration**, interstate migration and movement between types of school (particularly during the final years of secondary schooling), details of which are not available.

* 1 ) Australia's **immigration** policy is non-discriminatory.

* But one  of  the situations that have developed as a result  of  some  of  our **immigration** policies is that a man can come here from  America,  take up a position in Australia with one  of  these companies and replace Australians.

* I am concerned that our **immigration** policy allows a person to come here in this situation, to replace a highly skilled Australian and to obtain special benefits in taxation and other things.

* I would like to say a few words about the Government's recently announced intention to increase Australia 's **immigration** intake.

* Firstly, I state that under the Labor Government in 1975-76 Australia's **immigration** reached the lowest level since 1947 when there was an intake of 52,000 people.

* This Government, on the other hand, has decided to increase the net annual **immigration** intake to 70,000 for the first year of the triennial rolling program which commenced in the year 1 978-79.

* On balance, in my opinion, this expanded **immigration** program should be welcomed by all Australians; but it must be done sensibly, with caution and with a certain degree of flexibility.

* It is difficult in times of high unemployment to gain widespread acceptance of the need for an expanded **immigration** poliCy.

* Also, **immigration** can provide a labour force mobility which might not otherwise exist.

* In addition, **immigration** can meet occupational shortages and help to overcome lags in domestic retraining schemes.

* Also, **immigration** can help to provide a balance to the work force component of the population which would grow only at diminishing rates with the present and projected combination of a declining natural population growth rate and an aging of that population.

* I also make the point that those who state that higher **immigration** rates, coupled with capital intensification, will lead automatically to higher unemployment should realise that historically Australia has been able to maintain near full employment at times of high **immigration** and increasing capital to labour ratios.

* But there are also a number of unknowns which could influence the nature of the **immigration** program.

* On balance, I support an expanded **immigration** program on both economic and non-economic grounds; but it must be implemented with caution, flexibility and good sense.

* I also mention that **immigration** policy has to be framed within a long term perspective.

* Decisions taken now, and within the next few years, about **immigration** matters will have a permanent, long term effect on the size and composition of the Australian population.

* We are entitled to know how he came to escape the screening of Australian **immigration**.

* Not only do we have a trade agreement with Yugoslavia, but we have an **immigration** agreement with that country.

* In response to the statement on **immigration** policy by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  on 22 August I made the following comment: 
The point is that the students claim that they are advised by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to apply for permanent residence visas when they seek to stay here in order to gain work experience.

* The post-war era was a long period of dynamism fuelled by the baby boom of the 1940s and the 1950s and a wave of high level **immigration**.

* Taking into consideration that there has been a net increase in **immigration** of 300,000 and that over 200,000 marriages have taken place during this period, one will realise the record of the home building industry since 1970.

* A great deal has been spoken about **immigration** and about all the various factors relating to **immigration**, yet here is a case which I think is - I use the word sincerely - a disgrace to the 'Department, that over a period of time the Department cannot give a reply to a member making representations.

* We have had 9 Ministers for Civil Aviation, 7 Ministers for Shipping and Fuel, 12 Ministers for Air, 8 Ministers for External Affairs, 7 Ministers for Immigration, 9 
-The estimates set out in terms of costs Australia's **immigration** policy for the year 1978-79 and the extent of its assistance to ethnic groups.

* Since World War II our population has accelerated and has become more of a European blend because of the **immigration** policy directed towards getting our skilled workers from that general geographic area.

* Their financial cost to the nation for **immigration** was absolutely nothing, but their financial and cultural contribution to Australia today cannot be calculated.

* Keeping that in mind, let me now quote in part from the **immigration** platform of the Australian Labour Party as defined at Terrigal in February this year.

* It reads: 
Labour supports an **immigration** policy administered with sympathy, understanding and tolerance.

* Clause (f) of the policy which provides that there shall be no discrimination on grounds of race, nationality, politics, creed or sex lies at the heart of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Just as we have a global **immigration** policy, so too we have within its non-discriminatory provisions a global refugee policy.

* -I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: In view of the rapid decline in Australia's population growth and in view of the fact that substantial gains on account of net migration made in the 1960s have during the 1970s been turned into net losses, will the Minister give urgent consideration to converting the present annual **immigration** target of 70 000 settler arrivals into a target of net population gain through **immigration** of 70 000?

* That is what he has been doing since he became responsible for **immigration**, in dismantling a lot of the worst excesses of his predecessor,  Mr Grassby.

* Working mothers have managed to maintain momentum behind economic development in this country since the early 1960s when it was discovered that, with the fall-off in **immigration** and the contraction in birth rates in earlier years, unless working mothers entered the workforce the economic momentum of this country would be set back.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  in his Budget speech devoted 11 lines in Hansard to the **immigration** program and to all the problems which have been uncovered in recent times in connection with the settlement of people in this country in recent years.

* He capped this 11-line reference to **immigration** with a sad attempt to create further divisions in our society by talking about people disliking migrants - surely a strange phrase in a nation of migrants.

* I welcome what the honourable member said concerning the importance of Australia's **immigration** programme which in the post-war period has successfully brought some 2.6 million new settlers to this country.

* The honourable member for Scullin mentioned the matter of an **immigration** museum.

* Finally, the honourable member for Riverina raised the question of an **immigration** office in Asia.

* They did not realise that partly because of the Labor Party's **immigration** policy and partly because of the downturn in the birth rate, Australia was growing at a rate of about 114 per cent compared with the 9 per cent at which the Labor Party wanted the Australian Capital Territory to grow.

* Certainly there was not going to be **immigration**; the Labor Party demonstrated that it was not in favour of **immigration** in this country.

* This rapid growth cannot be sustained in a country which has cut down on its **immigration** intake because of Labor's policies, and in a country which has a rapidly decreasing birthrate.

* It is my personal opinion that the reduction in our **immigration** intake must be a factor in the increased rate of inflation.

* I have never believed **immigration** to be inflationary, but on the other hand I believe that the numbers of immigrants who have come to Australia together with their dependants have provided a steadily increasing local market for our primary and secondary industries.

* In fact, there was no proper explanation of Government policy given to this House in the form of ministerial statements in many significant areas of Government policy - areas of selfproclaimed Government concern - such as the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and, of course, a field very dear to the heart of the Leader of the House, **immigration**.

* The Leader of the House knows full well that he sits in the Ministry with a colleague who has been throughout the length and breadth of Asia proclaiming the concept of a new **immigration** policy for Australia.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 26 October 1978: 
Has his attention been drawn to the recent Australian Medical Association Federal Council resolution that **immigration** of doctors be controlled and to previous projections that Australia suffers from an over-supply of doctors?

* I ask the Minister: Is it not a fact that certain skilled Japanese workers may enter Australia under our **immigration** laws as they are applied at present, and that the real restrictions to which the Japanese dignitaries refer are industrial limitations imposed by certain sectors of the trade union movement?

* a Melbourne report, referred to the fact that the Japanese were concerned about our restrictive **immigration** policies affecting joint ventures.

* -On 7 June 1978 the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  made a statement on **immigration** which held out considerable promise in the field of family reunion for the ethnic communities.

* We already have substantially high unemployment in this country and many of those people who are coming to Australia today under the present system of **immigration** will also be unemployed.

* Annual **immigration** targets are determined year by year by the Australian Government and, where necessary, in consultation with the Government concerned.

* In relation to the other matters raised by the honourable member, I have never said, and this Government has never said, that **immigration** should be seen as a substitute for training or retraining.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Australia's post-war **immigration** programme, which has played such an important part in our national development, is to be continued in the 1972-73 financial year.

* The Australian Labor Party at its Launceston conference last year made a radical departure from its traditional **immigration** policy by proposing to abolish all forms of discrimination.

* The longstanding bi-partisan policy on **immigration** has unfortunately been abandoned officially by the Australian Labor Party, and its chief spokesman for many years on **immigration** matters, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  has been unceremoniously dropped because he does not agree with the proposed removal of all forms of discrimination.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 22 August 1978: 
What differences exist between the **immigration** restrictions of Australia and those of Papua New Guinea on persons moving between Papua and the Torres Islands.

* For these and other reasons we have had a sustained **immigration** programme since the end of the Second World War.

* I believe that this aspect of **immigration** policy was a valid one, and still is, though perhaps to a lesser extent today when military technology has, to a certain degree at least, overcome the advantages previously enjoyed by sheer numbers of people.

* However, it is in the increase of our economic strength that the **immigration** policy has had its most easily measurable impact.

* In addition, cultural benefits have also been derived from our **immigration** policy.

* That there are problems and costs associated with the **immigration** scheme nobody denies, and I would like to look at some of the criticisms that have been raised, lt has been said that not enough use has been made of many skilled personnel who emigrate to Australia and I believe that in some cases this is and has been the case.

* There are some other aspects of our **immigration** policy which have disturbed me in the past but I believe that steps which have recently been taken will do much to overcome criticism.

* I firmly believe our **immigration** policy should be based on the needs of this country, the availability of suitable migrants and the capacity of the Australian community to integrate migrants into our society.

* Research into desirable future population levels together with the structure and distribution of the population within Australia can only be of great assistance in assessing desirable levels of **immigration**.

* A cost-benefit analysis of **immigration** and time span surveys of migrants during their early years will provide much needed back-up data and disclose avenues for further initiative in the selection and integration of settlers.

* The approach adopted by the Minister and his Department, particularly the efforts quantitatively and qualitatively to assess the selection procedures, desirable intake levels, assimilation procedures, and contribution of new settlers will do much to answer the questions of those who view our **immigration** policy with some suspicion.

* I welcome his agreement that in such matters as **immigration**, of which he was speaking, Australia should, to quote the words of my Party's platform, avoid discrimination on grounds of race*.

* The main purpose of these regular conferences is to enable Ministers for Immigration to keep each other fully informed on current activities and developments in relation to the **immigration** programme.

* There has been a change in the attitude of the Government in relation to an **immigration** program.

* I would like to make it clear, because of inaccurate Press reports, that there has been no questioning by the Japanese Government to the Australian Government of our **immigration** policy.

* In the light of the question that was asked by the honourable gentleman I point out that the Australian Government has not thought it necessary to raise the question of Japanese **immigration** policies with the Japanese Government.

* In relation to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question, I think all I can say is that our **immigration** policy does not, of course, differentiate between the nationals of countries according to the amount of trade that those countries do with us.

* He was commissioned to undertake a costbenefit analysis of **immigration** into Australia.

* by leave- Ordinarily the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  would have been followed by a statement from my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  who is the spokesman for the Australian Labor 
Party on **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* I have already given instructions that an **immigration** officer of the former Beirut staff, who is now in Athens, should proceed immediately to Damascus to process those people who would be eligible to come to Australia.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
Will he provide a list of all Inquiries relating to **immigration** since 2 December 1972.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 29 August 1979: 
-I preface my question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs by quoting from an article in the Johannesburg  Star  of 13 January 1979: 
Australian **immigration** officials confirmed this week that it has doubled to four its **immigration** staff in Pretoria to handle the growing number of applications by white Rhodesians to come to Australia.

* It is of course a new homogeneitey; it develops as our **immigration** develops.

* The **immigration** policy is up; it is down; it is stopped; it is started.

* We do not know what is the level of **immigration** in this country at the moment.

* I must say that I am unaware of the reasons which were advanced for it but I want to observe that over a quarter of a century in which Australia has had experience in the promotion of a high level **immigration** programme our record in relation to selection and assessment of the 2.6 million migrants who have come to this country post- 1945 has been very good.

* I think of the reports we have received of the incidence of mental illness and crime among migrants; of the reports that we have received on migrant youth; of the fact that the Australian system has been well commended by international authorities in the field of **immigration**; of the fact that our experience has been sought by other countries with high level **immigration** programmes, and finally of the fact that 2.6 million people who have come here in the post-war period have with some difficulties been effectively integrated into the Australian community.

* I want to say to the honourable member and to the House that this is not a question on which one can take any position of complacency because undoubtedly, in view of the fact that **immigration** is a difficult experience and because of the human factor, mistakes have been made in the past and will no doubt continue to be made in the future.

* Some Greeks thought it strange that **immigration** officers should be despatched on a mission which appeared to be on behalf of the Liberal party 
How true.

* Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  removed the honourable member for Grayndler from his position of shadow minister with responsibilities in conection with the handling of the Labor Party's side of **immigration**. ]

* He is looking for friends because we all know that when Labor does not win the next election fearless Freddie will be back in favour steering the destiny of this nation insofar as he can as Labor's spokesman on its **immigration** policy.

* I wish to direct my comments this evening to the **immigration** aspect of the appropriations for the Department of Labor and Immigration.

* But, having regard to the smaller **immigration** program- 80 000- decided upon by the Government for 1974-75, there would need to be a significant reduction in the approval rate.

* Yet, in Division 366, which is the appropriation to which I am speaking, we are being asked to approve a proposed expenditure of $4,884,600 for Overseas Services which are basically related to **immigration**.

* In conclusion what I am saying is that in my mind the Government is tackling the problem of **immigration** back to front.

* It is time the Government woke up and realised that **immigration** has played a very important role in the advancement of this nation.

* The first matter I want to raise is in relation to the **immigration** part of the Department of Labor and Immigration.

* Basically, his policy was to lift the population of Australia through **immigration** but at the same time keep a homogeneous population.

* In past years **immigration** has been a subject of non political consequence.

* To see how our **immigration** policy will affect Australia in the long term one need only look at the position in the United Kingdom at present.

* Yes, I agree to some extent with that point of view but surely a matter connected with a change in Australia's **immigration** policy is something for which the Minister is responsible.

* Admittedly both New Zealand and Canada do not worry to the same extent as we do about **immigration** matters.

* Because we are reducing our **immigration** programme I believe that the personnel associated with **immigration** should be reduced from the 318 that I have mentioned to a much lesser number.

* They fought and died to keep Australia a free and democratic country, and part of that freedom and that democratic process is the right to decide what sort of **immigration** policy we should have and what sort of criteria should be administered.

* Apart from the fact that I think the leaflet exaggerates the problems in Great Britain, I point out that Australia in the formulation of its **immigration** policies has always tried to learn from the experiences of other countries.

* One of the aims of our pattern of **immigration** is to try to ensure that we do not have developing in particular areas under-privileged enclaves of people who form a problem in an area.

* There is room for sensible debate about **immigration** policies in this country.

* But to try to base an attitude towards **immigration** on the sort of puerile propaganda contained in this type of leaflet does not do any good for the Australian community.

* 374)  "  Mr Scholes  asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Has a decision been made on the proposal to establish a permanent **immigration** office in Geelong.

* I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or welfare officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of **immigration**, repatriation, social security and other social welfare needs.

* Within 3 days it would be incumbent upon the company to convey its nominees to the State **immigration** office so that they could be given an advisory talk on such subjects as house purchase, contracts, hire purchase and many other matters that were of vital concern to a new migrant coming to this country.

* It is exaggerated by the Government's dated policy of considering **immigration** in a compartmentalised capsule divorced from all those policy areas affecting it.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  was appointed as spokesman on **immigration** by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).

* In other words the appointment by the Leader of the Opposition of me as spokesman on **immigration**.

* I would like to point out to the House that to my knowledge the publication from which the honourable member for Prospect was quoting was one from which he quoted some 2 years ago and it bore no relation to the appointment by the Leader of the Opposition of me as spokesman for **immigration**.

* Of course, this is not a Commonwealth responsibility but, since **immigration** is a Commonwealth responsibility, it is not too much to expect that the Commonwealth should make very firm representations to the States that the rigid educational facilities and staffing establishments in the schools affected should be made more flexible so that the job can be carried out properly.

* The Acting Minister for Immigration has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's questions: 
Office accommodation occupied by the Department of Immigration in the Australian Capital Territory is as follows: 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 21 February 1979: 
On three occasions recently Fred Daly, whom you have appointed as shadow Minister for Immigration, has given a racist interpretation of Federal ALP policy on **immigration**.

* It is being exacerbated by the deflationary economic policies of this Government and its failure to implement adequate retraining, manpower and **immigration** policies.

* We understand that they have contributed much and will contribute much more to the future development of Australia if the **immigration** program is not continually diminished in size as it appears the Government would want to do.

* Later he served as an **immigration** officer.

* When the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  authorises a cost benefit analysis of **immigration** as it affects the economy the facts arising from that investigation are not available to me.

* It has shown the need, in the context of inflation, for fuller study of our tariff system, our **immigration** programme, our powers in respect of restrictive trade practices and of our taxation structure.

* Before discussing **immigration** policies, I would first like to address myself to the findings of the first report of the National Population Inquiry.

* The Population Inquiry highlights some quite startling facts which I believe must provide the basis for future government planning, not only in **immigration** but in almost all areas of government policy.

* If this is the case, one should think very carefully before accepting the necessity for high **immigration** rates.

* Of course, this has strong implications for future **immigration** programs.

* As a result and in the absence of any **immigration** program a continued decline in fertility rates in my opinion will lead us not only to zero population growth but even further to negative rates of population growth in the future.

* In these circumstances, Australia's governments in future will have to look increasingly to **immigration** programs to maintain reasonable rates of population growth.

* I agree wholeheartedly with the comment by the honourable member for Lilley that **immigration** should be seen as a very valuable addition to the Australian population but not as a substitute for it.

* Given that any initiatives to redress that imbalance would take a long while to implement, quite clearly there will be a case for a much higher **immigration** intake in the years to come.

* Therefore, in view of the predicted decline in the rate of natural growth to Australia's population, on balance I support the view that higher **immigration** rates are required for the future.

* First, we need to consider such an **immigration** program in terms of Australia's economic structure.

* If the **immigration** intake is undertaken together with some restructuring of domestic industries in order to allow the laws of comparative advantage to take effect, such a program is well justified and is in the best interests of both Australia and our trading partners in the region.

* The second qualification I have relates to the rate of increase in the **immigration** intake.

* But having made those qualifications, on balance and for the reasons I have already stated, I would support the need for a substantial **immigration** program for Australia for the foreseeable future.

* One of the main functions of Australia 's **immigration** program in the past has been to increase the labour force.

* Also, in the absence of **immigration**, coupled with declining fertility rates, Australia will become an ageing nation and it is suggested that within, say, one generation the total proportion of the population dependent on those of working age will increase.

* Before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the need for Australia to increase its rate of **immigration** over the longer term primarily because we had a humanitarian obligation to the poorer nations to develop our richly endowed country for their benefit and also for our longer term benefit.

* Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our **immigration** program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those women who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families.

* The last passenger completed **immigration** formalities at 1 1.45 a.m.

* The Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  has suggested today that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had sufficient guts to talk about Jewish **immigration** with the Russians.

* In his wonderful achievements in the external fields, why was it that in one country alone on his visit- I refer to Holland- he was prepared to accept in his discussions on **immigration** that there should be a preparedness by the Australian Government to consider an increase in migrants?

* Why did not the Prime Minister visit the Middle East, another area about which there is tremendous concern in Australia and a source of a good deal of **immigration** to this country?

* Following the statement of 23 September 1976 concerning the Government's review of **immigration** policy relating to persons normally resident in Lebanon, all members of the family are now eligible for migrant entry subject to their completion of normal health and character requirements.

* At a time when the British Government is revising its **immigration** rules the British migrant to Australia expects a clear and definite revision of Australian citizenship.

* Surely this is an indication of the needs of modern **immigration**, as individuals desire to become a part of another country within the framework of its laws and constitutions.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
by leaveOnly a handful of issues has, in the last few months, attracted more persistent speculation than the prospect of a revised **immigration** policy.

* The question of **immigration** is rarely argued in detached terms.

* The issue of Indo-Chinese refugees has brought all Australians face to face with the reality that no longer are we insulated and isolated from **immigration** questions of immense significance.

* The issue between us has never been the fact of **immigration** but the quantum and nature of intake.

* Since 1974 **immigration** policies have been very tightly defined.

* While there has been a shortage of hard data on which to reach firm conclusions regarding the economic effects of population growth and **immigration**, many have seen a link between post-war economic development and large-scale **immigration**.

* There is a remarkable degree of unanimity among the States on the importance of a continued positive approach to population building through **immigration**, and on related policy measures.

* There has never been, in Australia, so comprehensive a review of **immigration**.

* Though the Government must give priority to resolving the prevailing economic difficulties facing Australia, it believes that population and **immigration** policies lay the foundations for tomorrow.

* Surely honourable gentlemen opposite have seen **immigration** forms from various countries around the world when they have travelled, as many of them have done and do extensively, where the first name is described as the given name.

* Population increases in the urban areas also result from natural increase, and from the movement of native-born persons to urban areas as well as from **immigration**.

* Most financial assistance provided by the Commonwealth is designed, inter alia, to help State Governments cope with the increasing demand for State services occasioned by the growth in population whether from **immigration** or natural increase.

* by leave- I should like to elaborate on three matters mentioned in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  concerning matters within the **immigration** and ethnic affairs portfolio.

* In my statement of 7 June 1978 to the House on **immigration** policy, I indicated that while other temporary residents would no longer be eligible for permanent resident status while in Australia, private overseas students would continue to be eligible for permanent residence pending the review of the private overseas student policy.

* Yet we have a program under which we intend to increase **immigration** this year to 70 000 people.

* That is the policy of the present Government yet it talks about increasing **immigration**.

* The situation is that during the 23 years from 1949 the **immigration** intake continued at a rate around 2 per cent.

* The average growth rate for those 23 years of Liberal-National Country Party Government was something like 1.1 per cent in natural population and 0.8 per cent in **immigration** population.

* The fact is that under the conservative forces of this country, between 1949 and 1972, 70 per cent of the **immigration** increase in the population of this country settled in the cities and urban communities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* He not only supports a proposition for an increased **immigration** program but also he supports a program of increased natural birth.

* By making a rational decision in relation to our **immigration** program we would then be able to look at a population of something like 17.5 million by the year 2000.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
1) Is it a fact that people with epilepsy, regardless of the degree of incapacity, are considered unable to meet health requirements for **immigration** to Australia.

* If so, when was the last time this condition was assessed for the purpose of **immigration** health requirements.

* If this condition has not been assessed within the last 2 years for the purpose of **immigration** health requirements, will he consider reviewing the matter in view of the availability of modern drugs to control the effects of this condition.

* If there Is to be any reduction in our **immigration** intake, will he see that British, Irish and European people will be given precedence over people whose presence endangers, and will continue to endanger, the social, wage and housing conditions of Australians, whether bom here or naturalised.

* Will he urge the Catholic **immigration** authorities in every State and the World Council of Churches to concentrate their efforts on helping Australian Aborigines and part-Aborigines on the principle that charity begins at home.

* I trust, too, that the Government will consider at an early date the reintroduction of an **immigration** program somewhat similar to that of a few years ago.

* It has always been my belief that in the short term **immigration** may interfere with employment opportunities.

* But in the long term **immigration** creates employment.

* To achieve this end we must increase the level of **immigration** on a gradual basis.

* asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Working Party established to examine the question of the distribution of certain functions previously carried out by the former Department of Immigration that a Standing Interdepartmental Committee should be established to ensure a continued, co-ordinated and integrated approach to all matters relating to **immigration** and the welfare of migrants.

* According to the first report of the National Population Inquiry- page 302- if fertility stabilises at around 1975-76 at net reproduction rate = 1 the population to be expected by the end of the year 2001 would be 15.9 million in the absence of **immigration** and 17.6 million if net **immigration** averaged 50 000 a year.

* Secondly, net **immigration** is currently running at well below 50 000 a year.

* It was in the context of the need for long range perspectives on population and **immigration** that the Liberal-Country Party Government, on the strong recommendation of the then Minister for Immigration, the  Hon.

* In so far as Australia has had a population policy in the post-war period it has been in terms of **immigration** rather than policies designed specifically to increase births to achieve desirable population policy goals.

* There are people who suggest that Australians should be encouraged to have more children as a substitute for **immigration**.

* Therefore, external **immigration** will continue to be the only major instrument available to government to influence the level and composition of our population.

* The second is that the rate of population growth in most of our traditional source countries for **immigration** is decreasing and, if current trends continue, will do so to a much greater degree from early in the next century.

* What population goals should **immigration** be directed towards in the medium and long term?

* A precedent is the 2 per cent population growth rate policy following the Second World War and the introduction of annual **immigration** programs.

* The agreed policy was that Australia's population should increase by an average of 2 per cent per annum, approximately 1 per cent resulting from natural increase and the balance from **immigration**.

* One only has to consider that since 194S some 3.3 million migrants have come to Australia and that one person in five in this country is a migrant to appreciate the impact of post-war **immigration**.

* It is almost universally agreed that the **immigration** program has been of enormous benefit to Australia.

* We are a larger and more diverse nation than the one which set out on the large-scale post-war **immigration** program.

* There are groups who see our standard of living rising by upgrading the skills of our work force and developing our natural resources without the assistance of further **immigration** or even population growth.

* If the community sees some cause for concern in an ageing population, it may even be desirable to direct **immigration** in such a way as deliberately to have a 'younging' effect on the populationfor example by lowering the general age eligibility limits or by giving preference to younger applicants.

* Our example, and even massive **immigration** from them, will not have any significant effect on the scale of their problems.

* For its part, the Government maintains its position as stated in its election policy statement on **immigration** and ethnic affairs: 
Immigration is an essential instrument of Australia's population policies and of the broader national strategies and objectives to which those population policies are directed.

* That is a commitment to population growth, with **immigration** as the prime factor in that growth.

* But- and I emphasise this- it is not a commitment to **immigration** simply to add to our population without any assessment of the effects of doing so and what is needed to meet those effects.

* The Government believes that Australia's population and **immigration** strategies must not be a numbers game but must have a sound basis which takes account of the medium and longer term implications of various growth options.

* The reconstituted Council will advise me on such matters as regular monitoring of, and research into, population change; major developments and research in Australia and overseas concerning population and **immigration**; the longer term implications of changing patterns of **immigration** intakes; ways in which future **immigration** intakes can be planned to complement other policies; and implications of population change for various aspects of resource allocation.

* The functions of the new Council indicate the importance which the Government attaches to population policies and show its determination to base **immigration** policies and programs on a range of considerations, inclusing the population objectives to be developed with the assistance of the Council.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Despite the current horrific rates of unemployment for all Australians, particularly migrants, the Government goes on blindly insisting that the rate of **immigration** should be substantially increased.

* Any increase in **immigration** does nothing to change the current situation and may indeed exacerbate it.

* While the Government insists on a large scale **immigration** program to meet the needs of industry, it does little to alleviate the continuing problems of migrants after their arrival in Australia.

* The Government has shown little concern for the high rate of return home to their countries of origin among migrants, particularly the professional and skilled- those groups which supposedly justify further increases in the rate of **immigration**.

* Is it not time we stopped using people as factory fodder, as tools of economic management, and developed a policy for migrants, not just an **immigration** policy.

* To ask the Committee of the Immigration Advisory Council now undertaking an Inquiry into the Departure Movement of Migrants to differentiate between assisted and unassisted migrantsin determining the size of this movement 
To continue to tailor the size and content of the **immigration** programme to Australia's needs and the nation's ability to absorb migrants.

* The honourable member has asked whether we can do something about recording the history of **immigration** properly in an authoritative volume.

* I am at present considering a submission that would enable the commissioning of a history of **immigration**.

* A list of 47 academics, authors and writers has been compiled and I hope that from that list a selection can be made to commission a history of **immigration** and the Australian people.

* I assume that the honourable gentleman is referring to part of the Opposition's **immigration** platform as adopted at the Launceston conference.

* It will be clear to this House, as in fact I believe it is clear to the Australian people, that there is no consistent, coherent voice on the Opposition benches in relation to its approach to Australia's **immigration** policy.

* I will refer to the approach to **immigration** of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party.

* He complained that there had not been a full scale debate on **immigration** policy for the last  5i  years.

* (Mr Daly)  it could be said that we did have a bipartisan **immigration** policy.

* While stating that its **immigration** policy shall be administered with the avoidance of discrimination on any ground of race, or colour or nationality, the same Labor Party Conference adopted a policy to advise Australian mothers to limit their families.

* Surely it is better to retain control of **immigration** as this Government has done, to be able to draw back the numbers of migrants rather than to be confronted with a flood of people over which there can be no control concerning race, colour of skin or nationality.

* Many thousands of migrants already are living happily in Australia and the **immigration** policy of the .

* Australia clearly enunciated its goal to achieve through **immigration** an annual population growth of 1 per cent to supplement natural increase which was also expected to be about 1 per cent.

* Having established the goal, it set out to achieve it through a vigorously promoted, but selective, **immigration** program.

* This is not to say that Australia's **immigration** programs during the past 3 decades have not been accompanied by problems.

* Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an **immigration** gain, Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of **immigration**.

* Over recent years, we have also seen a rapid rundown in the rate of population growth through **immigration**.

* This represents a growth rate for the financial year of less than 0.15 per cent through **immigration**.

* In considering the **immigration** options open to Australia, we must bear in mind that Australians themselves are a mobile people.

* If we are to avoid regular losses of such needed skills, it is imperative that Australia should maintain some level of **immigration** which is selective in regard to occupational skills.

* This component of our **immigration** program would also appear indispensable unless its underlying humanitarian objectives are to be jettisoned.

* This element also, I believe, should be a necessary part of any **immigration** policy and I hope to announce soon the policy guidelines within which Australia's future responses to such situations will be made.

* As the Green Paper indicates, issues underlying **immigration** cover a diverse range of topics.

* In terms of an annual **immigration** program, the Green Paper suggests that feasible limits might be net gain in the range of zero to 100 000 persons per year.

* It is now 30 years since the great post-war **immigration** program was begun.

* That **immigration** program was introduced by a consensus of people of vision, people confident about the future of Australia, a growing Australia.

* It dealt in general terms with trade, commercial and **immigration** matters.

* To this end: It has ratified the Convention on the Status of Refugees; it is a member of the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and contributes to the resettlement funds of the UNHCR; it recognises the need through its **immigration** policy to fulfil the legal obligations required by the Convention and to develop special humanitarian programs for the resettlement of the displaced and/or the persecuted.

* Earlier today the Leader of the House and the Minister for Immigration claimed that the Government had been refused leave to make a statement on **immigration**.

* There was not, and the words of the Leader of the House as reported in Hansard confirm that no opportunity was provided for a debate on **immigration** and on **immigration** alone.

* I repeat the challenge to the Government: Any time it wants to debate **immigration** it will be debated.

* In that year Arthur Calwell, who was then the Minister for Immigration, announced the establishment of a concerted **immigration** policy on the basis that increased population was essential to the growth and full development of the Australian economy in the post-war period.

* One of the fundamental principles underlying the continuance of the **immigration** program was the great economic and social benefit that flowed as a result of it.

* The first point is the failure of the Government to inform the House adequately of changes in **immigration** policy.

* The 'Australian Financial Review' of 20 February 1974 had this headline '"Social" **immigration** for a balanced Australian society'.

* But it is ALP policy to have a non-discriminatory **immigration** scheme.

* I think earlier this afternoon the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  in his remarks referred to the Minister for Services and Property because he had a very definite policy on **immigration**.

* am asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs the following question, upon notice, on 9 March 1 977: 
I have allocated a high priority to the role of **immigration** in regional development 
At the Conference of Federal and State Ministers for Immigration on 9 November, general agreement was reached on the need to meet the special labour requirements of development areas.

* 51 **immigration** officers visited premises occupied by the Children of God on 29 November 1 976.

* The visits were carried out as a routine **immigration** activity by officers in the normal course of their duties and no separate costing is therefore available.

* 141 persons were spoken to, of whom approximately 70 were interviewed to a greater or lesser extent concerning their **immigration** status.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
asked  the  Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Has his attention been drawn to the declaration, signed by Professor E. G. Saint who was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Queensland, which appeared in the West Australian' on 20th November 1963, in support of a claim that Australia's **immigration** policy needed reappraisal so that our restrictiveness should balance a regard for our national interests with some concern for the susceptibilities of our coloured neighbours; if so, why was Professor Saint appointed a member of the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications in March 1969. 
asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 28 February 1979: 
asked the Minister representing the Minister for Labor and Immigration and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters, upon notice: 
I am pleased that the Government has concentrated its endeavours on sultanas.

* There are many aspects of **immigration** now which are of very great concern to people who have migrated here and who want to bring friends and relatives here; there are many aspects which are of vary great concern to those areas of Australia where municipal and other institutions have exceptional burdens because of the **immigration** programme.

* That the following words be added to the motion: and also to permit the Minister for Immigration to make a statement on the Government's policy on **immigration**.

* I was disappointed that there was no reference in the Governor-General's Speech to an increase in **immigration**.

* The Whitlam Government cut **immigration** to 30,000 people per year when it became apparent that unemployment in Australia was approaching 5 per cent of the work force.

* When departures from Australia were taken into account, this reduced **immigration** figure resulted in a net loss to Australia of between 5,000 and 8,000 people per annum.

* The report read: 'Unemployment could be cut by stepping up **immigration** rather than cutting it back',  Mr Ian  Spicer said yesterday.

* When it came into office in 1975 the Government increased **immigration** from the 30,000 of the Whitlam Government to 70,000.

* I believe that **immigration** must be stepped up in the not too distant future.

* From the previous Minister for Immigration we heard this evening adequate reason for us to say with every certainty that the Australian **immigration** program was in a shambles because of the attitude of the previous Government.

* It is easy to appreciate the massive task that the present Minister had to face on assuming his portfolio in setting out to lift the standard of our **immigration** policy in the eyes of the rest of the world.

* I note also that an advertisement has been placed by the Opposition spokesman on **immigration** in a newspaper called the  Middle East News,  in which he makes some assertions about the number of Lebanese in Australia.

* In 2 countries, Belgium and the Netherlands, the **immigration** authorities conduct a limited programme with technical assistance from ICEM.

* I ask the Minister to see what can be done to speed up **immigration** to Australia in these cases.

* The other factors are the high levels of consumption generated by the high wages and salaries that are paid; the present rate of **immigration** which imposes further pressures and demands; the degree of protection accorded the secondary industries, protecting their costs of production from overseas competition and protecting the high levels of employment; and, another factor not often mentioned, the fixed exchange rate which is creating an unrealistic, insulated, high internal cost structure and inflation.

* A recognition of these fundamental truths has until recently bound the major parties in this Parliament together in a bipartisan approach to **immigration**.

* 4472  (Hansard,  25 September 1979, page 1530) concerning the necessity for the use of the English language in incoming passenger cards and outgoing passenger cards, is it a fact that the words 'The card must be completed in the English language' appear on the back of each card and that the instructions are printed in the English language alone which might give rise to an inference that no other language will be understood by **immigration** officials.

* While English is the official language in Australia and presumably is the official language in Great Britain, is he able to say whether the British **immigration** authorities do not regard it as necessary to say that it is compulsory for British **immigration** forms to be filled in in English.

* 4472, have **immigration** officials ever complained that passengers have in practice made their tasks difficult by the use of native scripts; if so, what were the native scripts in question and in what way would the answers to questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 12 on the exit form and questions 1 to 9 and 1 1 and 13 on the entry form differ if they were written in a language other than English.

* Is the Minister aware that I learned first hand during my self paid for visit to the United States of America that his Department in that country had received 9,050 **immigration** inquiries during the month of January this year?

* - Mr Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to make a statement on a matter that has become of great personal interest to me in particular and one that is of great importance to the Australian public - that is the **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* But arising out of the meeting of that Committee I was designated to write a policy in support of the established **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party as we knew it at that time.

* That was the time of the initiation of our **immigration** programme.

* He knows very well that we have supported and had supported for a long while a bipartisan **immigration** policy.

* He also knows very well that he is one of the architects of a destruction of a bipartisan **immigration** policy which is certainly not supported by all members on the Government side of this House.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs whether he is aware of reports in the ethnic Press that the Government is to radically change its **immigration** policy to admit only those people who speak English.

* How could any Minister responsible for **immigration** and citizenship go out to the million here now and the tens of thousands still coming and draft them off like so many sheep and cattle, saying: 'You go to the one year pen; you to the 3-year pen; you to the 5- year pen.

* There can be little doubt that Australia's post-war **immigration** policy, and its implementation, has been remarkably successful.

* At the same time, our whole way of life, our culture, and our economy have been enriched by the application of a selective **immigration** policy which has allowed and supported this massive inflow of people from all over the world.

* This is something which needs to be emphasised and repeated again and again, until people from all oyer the world will realise that Australia's **immigration** policy is not a racist one bat, like those of most other countries, is a selective one.

* There are 2 aspects of our **immigration** policy upon which I would like to comment.

* I know and appreciate the work being done by the research groups set up by the Government, which will appreciably assist the assessment of desirable levels of migrant intake, and a host of other factors concerned with **immigration**.

* But it is on the second aspect of our **immigration** policy which I mentioned that I would like to spend some time.

* As we all know, the Labor Party at its recent conference at Launceston came up with a different form of words for its Party platform in relation to **immigration**.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  who, as we all know was described by his own leader as knowing more about **immigration** than anyone else in the Labor Party - and hence is of insufficient capacity to be retained as shadow minister for **immigration** - said on 22nd July this year: 
From what I have read in the Press, the changed  vording  of the **immigration** policy does not  represent  any significant change from my interpretation  of  the policy before the conference.

* Firstly, family reunion has always been given the highest priority in Australia's **immigration** programme.

* very interested to know that the Party traditionally seen as representing their interests in fact had an **immigration** policy which could be interpreted as advocating, introduction of cheap labour.

* The Premier of South Australia has been most outspoken on the issue of non-European migration and has been quoted as saying that he advocated a system of Asian **immigration** to Australia similar to that operating in Canada, and also of putting the proposition that a homogenous Australia was nonsense and that he would like to see the country as a radical melting pot.

* Has this attitude to assisted **immigration** ever been repudiated by any member of the Opposition?

* On **immigration** as on so many other policy issues, the Labor Party speaks with many tongues.

* elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; 
As conceptualised by the Galbally report, the proposed Institute of Multicultural Affairs was welcomed by the Opposition in 1978 as a multipurpose resource centre serving the needs of a polyethnic society.

* As we saw it, the Institute would document the phenomenon of **immigration** to our country, trace and comment on the growth of ethnic communities, sponsor crosscultural awareness, help preserve the heritage of our ethno-cultural society, promote mutual tolerance and esteem between all groups and investigate cross-cultural experiences, lifestyles and needs.

* The Vernon Committee, way back in the past, had views about **immigration** but felt contrained to support the policy of the then Government.

* It was not allowed to make comments on **immigration** policy in relation to economic affairs, although I understand that in the substance of its report it stated that it was not able to conclude that **immigration** in fact gave rise to the economic benefits that were so loudly touted at the time.

* The Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs - 
Elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures; 
-I bow to your ruling,  Sir.

* The Oposition is using this kind of procedural issue - we are getting familiar with it from day to day - to avoid the main and paramount issues of the day such as industrial relations, the **immigration** policy - (Quorum formed).

* We look down the list at the Post Office, defence and **immigration**.

* On the other hand we have the question of the people of Papua and New Guinea and the question of our own **immigration** policy.

* A question arising from our **immigration** policy is how to confront the simple issues that arise in electorates.

* asked the  Minister for  Immigration, upon  notice: 
Can he provide details of Commonwealth assistance to State, semi-government and local government authorities to compensate them for the burden imposed by the Commonwealth Government's **immigration** programme.

* The Australian Government closed our Embassy in Beirut on 28 March and on 1 April the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  issued a statement in which he made the point that Australian missions existed in Cairo, Athens, Nicosia, Ankara and Tel Aviv and that special arrangements were being made to post an **immigration** officer in Damascus.

* Are we to continue to have the Treasury dictating the foreign- policy and **immigration** policy of this country?

* Whilst the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  gave us interesting but sometimes misleading information about **immigration**, he did not get very close to the Bill.

* But let me say to him at the outset that migrants in Australia are not offended with the role of the Australian Labor Party or of the Opposition in this Parliament in the migration programme because they recognise that there probably would never have been an **immigration** programme had it not been initiated by this Party.

* Cost Benefit Analysis- directed by Associate Professor J. R. Wilson of Sydney University and aimed at analysing the effect which **immigration** has on the Australian economy: Com- menced July 1970; to be completed by mid- 1974.

* May I deal very quickly with some of the pretentious nonsense often regurgitated by all sides in the **immigration** debate.

* Of course, the Broken Hill Company, General MotorsHolden's, the Ford Motor Company and others supported **immigration** on the basis of obtaining unskilled labour as well as consumers.

* I would also like to criticise more specifically some of the opponents of **immigration**.

* They are basically the same people who opposed **immigration** ever since it became fashionable to do so.

* I suppose that ever since large scale **immigration** started its opponents have argued that in periods of full employment the cost of basic services required for migrants- the so-called build-up of a social infrastructure- was so great as to use up our very limited resources.

* Such people in most cases are still opponents of the **immigration** and now argue the opposite, namely, that **immigration** will cause unemployment.

* I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon for bringing to the notice of the Australian people the shoddy tactics of the Minister in declaring in this chamber that he was basing his **immigration** policy on the result of a gallup poll.

* I am not decrying their importance but I am yet to hear any member of the National Country Party rise to his feet and take an interest in technical education, **immigration** or social welfare.

* Ministers responsible for **immigration** within the States are well aware of this.

* I commend the Government on its allocations for **immigration** and ethnic affairs in this Budget.

* This Government has not even taken into account the problems which have been caused by our **immigration** programme, particularly as it affects these schools.

* I am pleased to have an opportunity to take part in this debate on the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The debate and much of the discussion is looking ahead not to next year, not even to the next decade, but to the next century because the policies that we implement with regard to Australia's **immigration** program and, putting it in a wider context, with regard to Australia's population, will determine the manner of the future development of this country.

* At.the outset, I want to stress that I think Australia needs increasingly to see its **immigration** policy as a part of its population policy.

* As a result, the major influence on Australia's population will be our **immigration** policies.

* So when we read in the Green Paper that a series of **immigration** options have been put forward, I think that we should rephrase the term '**immigration** options' and refer to 'population options '.

* A point I want to make at this stage is that over the past few years we have looked at **immigration** programs upon the basis of the number of new settler arrivals and we have said that there will be 100 000 new settlers coming to Australia in a particular year.

* The fact is that the settler arrival figures give a totally false impression of our current **immigration** program.

* Net migration, rather than gross settler arrivals, is used in measuring population growth due to **immigration**, as it takes account of departures from Australia.

* If **immigration** was stopped, population growth in Australia would be determined by natural increase (i.e.

* Yet there is a certain illogical position for those vehement critics of **immigration** who see the stimulatory effects of **immigration** during inflation but fail to admit the potential for recovery from recession in the same source.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
What is the Australian Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians.

* What would be the Australian Government's attitude to the **immigration** of Rhodesians in the event of a negotiated settlement between the Smith regime and the British Government.

* On the latest population projectionsallowing for an **immigration** target of 70,000 persons annually and assuming that we return to the participation rates of February 1 978 which were much lower than those for 1977 or 1976- the work force can be expected to rise from 6,384,200 in 1978 to 7,000,000 in 1981.

* Within our community we are beginning to get more detailed consideration of **immigration**- it has been exemplified by statements tonight- not just in terms of **immigration** but in terms of the broader context of a population policy for Australia and that is what we are seeking.

* I was very pleased that a number of honourable members referred in this debate this evening to **immigration** not just in terms of **immigration** for itself but in terms of a broader policy.

* This is a gross over-simplificatoin of the **immigration** program for this current financial year.

* Therefore he can only be arguing with that section of the **immigration** intake which is related to occupationally selected migrants.

* In fact, the people who will be competing with Australians for jobs in terms of the **immigration** intake fall largely within the family reunion category and humanitarian category both those sectors of the intake which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said we must continue.

* He spoke in the longer term about an increase in **immigration**.

* I believe bis contribution was part of the series of contributions which related **immigration** to population policies.

* However, successive governments in Australia in relation to **immigration** policy have set aside the policies pursued by other governments- that is the guest worker concept.

* The only other comment I would make in relation to the speech made by the honourable member for Grayndler is in respect of his suggestion in a Press statement he put out earlier this year that there was something racist about the Government's attitude towards **immigration**.

* In general, I am very pleased that at least some of the contributors to the debate in relation to the estimates for my Department took the opportunity to draw **immigration** in the wider context of population policies.

* The **immigration** policy for Papua and New Guinea was a long standing one based on the need to avoid the sort of problem which has arisen in other developing countries over the admission of alien racial groups.

* Two men are involved and we cannot see the application of an **immigration** policy to their appointment.

* Then to issue a statement that a **immigration** policy applied to the man.

* The other explanation related to **immigration**.

* For some reason the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to embark upon ethnic Press conferences, presumably because he has taken note of the comments of some members of the ethnic media who have described his shadow minister for **immigration** as a likeable but incompetent shadow minister.

* He also failed to differentiate between the **immigration** program and the refugee program.

* One must remember that the Labor Party is the party which slashed and for all practical purposes cut out **immigration** in 1 973 or 1 974.

* Firstly I wish to deal with the subject of **immigration**.

* I appreciate that the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  has a difficult time making decisions on matters of **immigration**, but I must protest at the constant frustration which is being experienced by one of my constituents, a  Mr David  Crane of Rivervale.

* I think it is quite wrong for the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Sainsbury)  to suggest that there was anything about the Labor Party when it was in office or in Opposition which could possibly suggest that the Labor Party was against **immigration** or that it was against migrants.

* There is evidence that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is suggesting that in those circumstances, where we now have 6.2 per cent of the work force unemployed- by the new year, the percentage will be considerably higher- we ought to increase the rate of **immigration** which, I believe, will therefore increase the rate of unemployment.

* The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations suggested in its submission to its Minister: 
The direct effect of **immigration** for two decades (that is, excluding the inflows from Australian born children of migrants) was to contribute at least 40 per cent of the annual increase in the Australian labour force: Indeed in the 1950s the contribution would have been in excess of 50 per cent per year.

* Every country has a right to its own **immigration** policy and a duty and responsibility to ensure that that policy is administered in the best interests of its own people.

* The overriding objective of Australia's **immigration** policy is to ensure the continuing development of a cohesive and homogeneous community, well integrated and harmonious, without persisting divisions or disunity.

* During the recess last year the Government members **immigration** committee flew to Perth and joined the migrant vessel 'Australis' on its trip to Melbourne.

* All have very properly singled out his pioneering of the post-war **immigration** program as his most important and enduring achievement.

* When Labor was in office it linked up **immigration** and all the matters related to our ethnic people with matters concerning labour- we had a Department of Labor and Immigration.

* Honourable members opposite know, as I do, that that Council has been asked to consider the implications of population change, developments in research in Australia and overseas in the areas of population and **immigration**, the probable long term effects of changing patterns of **immigration** intakes and, additionally, the way in which **immigration** intakes can be planned to complement other national policies.

* As a result of that, Australia's first Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australian population was produced and published.

* During this debate on these important funds which are being allocated to bring immigrants to Australia, I ask the honourable member whether he is prepared to state clearly in what areas he would run down our **immigration** program.

* After reading through the speech he made in this House on 22 March 1977, I should like to know whether perhaps he wants to tail down the family reunion aspects of our **immigration** policy.

* Or is he perhaps saying that if we tail down our active **immigration** policy, which is evidenced in the document we are debating, it is the refugees whom he does not want?

* This is the gentleman who wants to tail down our **immigration** policy because he happens to believe m minimum population growth.

* As the spokesman on these matters for  Her  Majesty's Opposition he might be prepared at some point of time to clarify which area of our **immigration** program he wants to see tailed down, because these estimates allocate the funds necessary to maintain an active **immigration** program.

* Recovery will be generated indirectly through an active **immigration** program bringing skilled workers to Australia.

* During his term of office the Minister has expanded the family reunion categories for **immigration** and allowed people who are bringing business skills, money and so on to Australia that will enable them to commence businesses in Australia, to be eligible under the criteria for entry to this country.

* I am one of the people who hope that our population projections which have been reduced in the past few years for two reasons- lower fertility rates and much lower **immigration**- will move ahead somewhat more quickly than at present projected.

* The progress could be made by an increase in **immigration** rates to try to counteract the very rapid decrease that honourable members opposite caused when they somehow ceased to believe in **immigration** to this country.

* Against the economic circumstances recently outlined in this House by the Prime Minister, the **immigration** programme for 1970-71 has been modified to include the arrival of 120,500 assisted migrants and 49,500 unassisted migrants - a total this year of about 170,000 migrants.

* Gullible folk are persuaded to part with their savings under the mistaken belief that, no matter what the Australian **immigration** officials say, they will gain permanent residency when they get to Australia.

* First of all I would like to make some brief reference to honourable members on the Government side who have spoken this evening on this matter of **immigration**.

* Obviously it would make a nonsense of any **immigration** program.

* These are exotic animal and plant diseases and illegal **immigration** from Papua New Guinea.

* Illegal **immigration** from Papua New Guinea to the Torres Strait Islands and eventually to mainland Australia is a well-known practice, and one which poses a major risk of disease entering Australia through animals brought into Australian territory by Papua New Guineans.

* Whilst the Committee was pleased to hear recently that the Department is now confident that the situation is under control, it believes that this control must be continued and strengthened through expanding the number of **immigration** officers permanently stationed in the area.

* This of course was understandable as the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population was due to be tabled and debated in this House, as it was yesterday.

* I had intended to participate in that debate as I am particularly concerned about **immigration** policy, but this was not possible as the debate in this House was curtailed.

* I hope that the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population will stimulate throughout the community dialogue and debate regarding the quantity and quality of Australia's migrant intake.

* It said that if **immigration** were stopped completely the country would be unable to replace the skills of the 30 000 to 40 000 Australians who leave the country each year.

* This figure dwindled to only 50 000 in 1975 under the Labor Government's restrictive **immigration** guide lines- the lowest figure since post-war migration commenced.

* In actual fact there was a net loss in 1975 of more than 6000, perhaps almost 8000, in the number of people entering and leaving the country- the first net loss since our present **immigration** program commenced in 1946.

* Former Liberal and Country Party governments had set a goal of at least a 2 per cent annual population growth rate- 1 per cent through natural birth and 1 per cent through **immigration**.

* I believe that it would in Australia's best interests if the Government were immediately to increase the **immigration** target from 70 000 to 100 000.

* I believe that we are being horribly short sighted- not only the Labor Government before us but even the present Government, even though it has expanded migration- in restricting our **immigration** to such an extent.

* I hope that, following the publishing of the Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population, the Government will review our whole migration program.

* A great deal of this increase has been the result of **immigration**.

* The second double standard, if I may use that expression, under which the Labor Party is operating may be seen from a comparison of the so-called health policy of the Labor Party with its **immigration** policy.

* At the same time the Labor Party has a new policy on **immigration**.

* On 27th December he was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' as having said: 
The emphasisin future **immigration** programs will be on sponsorship, and family reunion will be given a high priority.

* So, on the one hand, the Australian Labor Party wishes to control the natural increase of Australian born children while on the other hand allowing the uncontrolled **immigration** of people into Australia, irrespective of their country of origin and including nonEuropeans, merely on a family basis.

* Some have put it- I think this overstates the case- that we have come to the end of an era, the post-war era of strong growth fuelled by high level **immigration**, import replacing manufacturing and the growth of the tertiary sector.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
1 ) What was the **immigration** target for 1973-74.

* By the year 2001 this figure will increase to 8.5 per cent of the population if account is taken of existing **immigration** trends or 9.1 per cent if **immigration** is not considered.

* Action to overcome the shortages is being taken through the **immigration** program, a number of training programs, including CRAFT, and initiatives taken by the Government to increase resources for technical education.

* It is quite clear that the numbers involved are no threat to Australia's **immigration** policies.

* For this reason, the amalgamation of the old departments of Labour and 
Immigration will ensure that there is a much closer relationship between **immigration** and manpower policies than there has been in the past.

* Future policies will need to account for this development unless the birth rate increases- I suppose that is unlikely- or we adopt a deliberate **immigration** policy aimed at bringing young people into the country.

* Even such an **immigration** policy would have difficulty in effecting a 'younging' of the 
Australian population, if I may put it that way.

* To some extent at least that would counteract any attempt to introduce younger people into the community through a deliberate **immigration** policy.

* It is in support of the estimates relating to the important subject of **immigration** to which I want to speak.

* In the total reach of the new policies and programs already undertaken, and others in process of preparation and introduction which have occupied the Government of which I am a supporter, none has more incisively and imaginatively gripped the mood and temper of the nation than has the subject of **immigration**.

* It would seem to me that there are 3 possible reasons to support a program of **immigration**.

* If I could return for a moment to the third of the reasons I advanced for support of an **immigration** program, it would seem to me that it is the only moral and valid reason.

* I must pay some credit to the efficiency of **immigration** officers in Australia in the manner in which they issue passports.

* Knowing human nature as I do, I know that the most foolproof scheme that can be implemented in any **immigration** office or bank is not foolproof unless the honesty of those enforcing the scheme or carrying out their duties is beyond reproach.

* I believe that this should be applied not only to people in the **immigration** office, about whom I am not making serious allegations.

* The first question may relate to Aborigines, the next to the state of the economy and the third one to **immigration**.

* I have an emphathy with the honourable members for St George and Grayndler, feeling deeply as they do about the personal problems they face among the large ethnic groups within their electorates, but I hope we will soon see the whole subject of **immigration** lifted to its former position of warranting bipartisanship on the part of all members of this House, rather than slanging matches across the Chamber.

* This is no easy subject to discuss and I believe it a great shame that the **immigration** debate has become so very political in the last two or three years.

* Therefore in theory when a government wants to start a new program or wants to spend more money on defence, **immigration** or whatever it may be, it has to go out and defend that proposition before the public.

* What is the Labor policy in respect of **immigration**?

* I agree with the honourable member for Wannon that there is an urgent need for re-examination of the total **immigration** policy of the present Government.

* I feel that it highlights the confusion and doubt about the **immigration** policy of the present Government under the administration of the present Minister.

* The **immigration** programme with its many social problems, the international scene, the need for members and senators to be freely available throughout their electorates, the increased cost of travel, population increases, larger electorates, the needs for members of Parliament to be informed electorally and on the Territories of the Commonwealth all present heavy demands on time and money.

* Is the Ministerial Member who is in charge of **immigration** and emigration in Papua New Guinea empowered, on his own authority, to deport persons in the Territory and to refuse entry permits to persons wishing to come into the Territory?

* This is a feature which we ali accept - the decline in the volume of **immigration**.

* The nomination was sent to the chief **immigration** officer in Rome in the usual way.

* The action taken was to advise the Australian **immigration** officials at the Australian Embassy in Rome to review the case further.

* After examination by the appropriate authorities in Australia the **immigration** officials in Rome were advised to undertake a further examination, to seek a further review and to make a report.

* The proportion of unsponsored migrants in the total **immigration** program will in future vary according to Australia's needs.

* Under the **immigration** policies of the present Government, there will be 3 main elements in the **immigration** program: 
My understanding was that some of the non State schools in Victoria received their dividends from this legislation faster than schools in the State school system.

* by leave- A study of the economic costs and benefits of **immigration** was one of three projects commissioned by the Commonwealth Government in 1970.

* These two reports provide a valuable data base for the formulation of Australia's future population and **immigration** policies.

* I now refer to the report on the third project, the cost benefit study of **immigration**.

* Associate Professor J. R. Wilson, of the University of Sydney, in 1970 undertook to carry out a cost/ benefit study of **immigration**.

* 1 believe that I will, in expressing some regret about the apparent quality of the report, speak not only for myself and the Government but also for previous Ministers for Immigration who, like me, had hoped for a greater contribution to an understanding of the economic impact of the post-war **immigration** program than this report offers.

* The easy visa system was introduced to permit genuine visitors to come to Australia with a minimum of inconvenience in respect of **immigration** formalities.

* I am glad that on this point, as is usual with **immigration** matters, my opposite number in the Opposition agrees with my comments in this regard.

* But by and large, the visitors themselves cannot be exonerated from complicity in a calculated evasion of Australian **immigration** policy.

* -Iwill take a minute or two to raise an **immigration** matter which I think has very distressing and exceptional factors.

* Believing erroneously that the Australian **immigration** officials were inquiring whether she was economically dependent and, having a job, she answered no.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Any Australian **immigration** action in East Timor requires the co-operation of Indonesian authorities to locate and assemble nominees for migration procedures.

* In accordance with normal **immigration** procedures, this information is for internal departmental use only and is being obtained on a form used, where required, in cases involving family reunion.

* He issued this statement following the Australian Labor Party's Federal Conference at Launceston: 
My view on Labor's **immigration** policy and particularly on non-European migration, should be very well known as I have expressed them publicly on many occasions.

* To achieve that end Australia should continue the position of preferment which has characterised that relationship, particularly having regard to the overall basis of our **immigration** policy.

* It indicates a failure by the Minister for **immigration** and the Government to put before this House and the people of Australia a cohesive and meaningful **immigration** policy.

* The Minister knows full well that some weeks ago he was deliberately challenged - I confess the use of the word 'deliberate',  Mr Speaker  - to bring down in this House a comprehensive statement of Australia's **immigration** policy.

* Yet the **immigration** policies of the Australian Labor Party advocate and require that the Commonwealth Government should withdraw from the search for migrants.

* In addition, the **immigration** policies of the Australian Labor Party would mean significantly fewer migrants coming to Australia from such countries as Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia and Malta.

* I pointed out also that the experience of the Department of Immigration gauged over 25 years of **immigration** was that migrants generally waited more than 8 years before deciding to apply for citizenship.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 8 March 1978: 
Taking as an example those persons who were sponsered by the Fairbridge Society and qualified for entry in 1976-77, how are these applicants classified under the Government 's **immigration** policy?

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Has he or the Government given undertakings to any governments, or the representatives of any governments, for the issue of visas to citizens of those countries for travel to Australia without all normal **immigration** clearances, providing such visitor nominees are recommended or referred by their respective governments.

* This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social welfare administrators which recommended that **immigration** policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a child-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the child would not promote his or her welfare and best interests.

* As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since federation, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a crisis in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an **immigration** policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community.

* I want to refer to a few matters that really go to the point of the failure of the Government to keep its promises, firstly, in the area of **immigration** and ethnic affairs which is the area of my responsibility.

* Although the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar),  in stating a policy on **immigration** and population, is laying the groundwork for bringing more migrants into this country, the Government cannot take adequate care of the people in the country at the present time.

* Even though times have changed drastically, with hundreds of thousands of people out of work, there has been no change of which I am aware in the Government's commitment to large scale **immigration**.

* Whatever may be its strange attitudes to future **immigration**, or even to the future of Australia, the Government is demonstrably at fault in its attitudes to existing communities of people born overseas and the children of parents born overseas.

* In accordance with the usual practice on agreements affecting **immigration** the text of the Agreement was referred to all six State governments and each signified that it had no objection to the signature of the Agreement as proposed.

* It has always been basic to Australia's post-war **immigration** policy that the right to determine who may be admitted to Australia for permanent settlement rests with Australia.

* As with all other countries from which migrants are taken, Yugoslavia has a legitimate and reasonable interest in the number and occupational categories of those moving to **immigration** countries.

* Those sections may be invoked in the following circumstances: 
asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 April 1 978: 
I should Uke to address myself to some of the more basic questions on **immigration** in this country from a long-term point of view.

* I would also like to criticise some of the opponents of **immigration**.

* They are basically the same people who opposed **immigration** ever since it became fashionable to do so.

* I suppose that is ever since the time **immigration** started.

* The same people, who are still opponents in most cases, now argue the opposite- namely that **immigration** will cause unemployment.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 2 June 1 978: 
asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
1 ) Will the Minister provide a list of all inquiries relating to **immigration** since 2 December 1 972.

* The honourable member for Melbourne, who is the Opposition's spokesman on **immigration**, suggests that the period should be one year.

* The post-war **immigration** boom was begun under a Labor government but unfortunately for the thousands and thousands of migrants, services fell very quickly under a government that did nothing for them for 23 years.

* At page 3804 of the Victorian Hansard,  Mr Hamer  said: 
What is the estimated revenue received by the Commonwealth from the establishment of the aluminium industry in Australia as (a) taxes on mining and processing Australian bauxite, limestone and coal, (b)net profits and interest paid to the Commonwealth as a result of the increased requirement for electricity in the industry, (c) taxes paid by migrants employed in the industry less their **immigration** fares and assimilation costs.

* It may be an administrative one which would gather under its umbrella all the housing areas which are at present administered by the Commonwealth Government, such as housing for Aborigines, certain **immigration** procedures and defence service homes.

* This matter relates to problems of interpreting the law concerning **immigration** and, even worse, to the misinterpretation of what might be deemed to be Press releases of a Minister announced as being government policy.

* Let me say at the outset that during the last election the Government announced its policy on **immigration** with the famous line: 
Subsequent to that we had the benefit of the Ombudsman's decision which clearly indicated that he felt Salemi was entitled to remain here.

* What could have been a sensible attempt to balance, economic growth against other objectives has become a narrow prejudice against **immigration** which threatens to slow our rate of development, limit our room for economic manoeuvre and dry up opportunities for all Australians.

* Restriction of **immigration**, in spite of the rationalisations of the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby),  is occurring.

* Ever since the postwar **immigration** scheme was launched by the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  to whom I pay tribute, it has been accepted as axiomatic by both sides in this Parliament that the national interest requires the effective control of the size and structure of the migrant inflow.

* I say has been accepted' because the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in his speech on the Budget with his penchant for trimming his policies to the prevailing fashions of the patio intellectuals, has become an advocate not of control but of laissez-faire in **immigration**, because this is what natural migration, open migration or sponsored migration is.

* The Leader of the Opposition who would introduce controls and planning into virtually every aspect of our economic and social life, has become an advocate of laissez-faire in **immigration**.

* No responsible Australian Government could abrogate its responsibilities by allowing the size and structure of the **immigration** programme to be determined by the unco-ordinated decisions of thousands of individuals here and overseas.

* Indeed, the intemperate nature of some recent attacks on **immigration**, and even particular migrant groups, can be described adequately only in terms of the legal definition of fraudulent misrepresentation.

* To advocate, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, a totally passive role for the Commonwealth Government in the field of **immigration** is completely unrealis tic.

* Parenthetically, I make the point that to confine our **immigration** programme to sponsored cases would effectively preclude Australia from accepting refugees who, with few exceptions, are wholly Government sponsored.

* Critics of the Government's policies also forget that **immigration** is not an end in itself.

* But, as in the past, the **immigration** programme - and particularly assisted migration - will continue to be directed towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population.

* But the social, economic and demographic effects of the components of population change - births, deaths, **immigration** and emigration - vary quite substantially.

* Changes in the **immigration** programme cannot entirely offset the consequences of changes in other population, and work force, factors.

* Neither is natural increase and **immigration** the mutually conflicting possibilities which they are sometimes represented to be.

* Indeed, an increased birth rate as an alternative to **immigration**, as sometimes advocated, is neither feasible nor relevant to Australia's needs.

* But natural increase and **immigration** are not mutually conflicting alternatives.

* Yet we are traditionally a country of **immigration** and.

* The most that we can reasonably ask of **immigration** is that it improve the situation which otherwise would exist.

* It is foolish, and indeed dangerous, to regard **immigration** as some kind of economic and social 'wonder drug' which will overcome all our problems.

* But it is, of course, just as foolish - and just as dangerous - to regard **immigration** as the sole or principal cause of these problems.

* In fact, the essential purpose of the **immigration** programme is, as I said before, to contribute towards our major national objectives through its influence on the size and structure of our population and work force.

* It is against this background that Australia's **immigration** programmes are being developed.

* This information will be used by the Government, together with other considerations, in determining the size and structure of future **immigration** programmes.

* This study is concerned with establishing the costs and benefits of **immigration** under existing Australian conditions.

* In conclusion I would remind the House, that as previously announced and for reasons then given, the Government has decided on an **immigration** programme of 140,000 for 1971-72.

* Even in the short term however, a smaller **immigration** programme is not going to be some kind of universal panacea.

* Most certainly, also, the decision to set a smaller **immigration** programme this year was not, and is not, intended by the Government as a convenient substitute for action by others in their particular fields of responsibility.

* In determining the **immigration** programme for 1971-72, the Government has acted with the courage of responsibility.

* Firstly, he gave the wrong figures for **immigration** for last year.

* Secondly, he confused the figures for net and gross **immigration**.

* Thirdly, he included the refugee intake figures among the **immigration** intake figures.

* I said that he had got the **immigration** figures wrong.

* He tried to say that the net political gain figures were the **immigration** figures.

* The spokesman on **immigration** for the Opposition, the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass),  made a number of criticisms.

* Whilst I generally take the view that he does try to conduct debates on the matter of **immigration** and ethnic affairs in a relatively bipartisan manner, I felt that some of his criticisms were nit picking- if I can describe them as suchand really did not get to the substance of the Bill.

* The amendment put forward by the Opposition then states that the Bill ought to be redrafted in order to elaborate the functions of the Institute to include research into the history and phenomenon of **immigration** to Australia and issues related to the development of ethnic groups in Australia and their diverse cultures.

* If the Minister has forgotten when there was a debate in the Parliament on those matters concerned with **immigration** his memory is even more defective than I would have believed it to be.

* The honourable member for Maribymong has over recent times changed the approach of the Opposition in relation to its **immigration** policy.

* He suggests that we should- I think I am using his words- cut **immigration** to the bone but in doing so we should continue the family reunion and refugee categories.

* He talked about a suggestion that the Government is in favour of a highly increased rate of **immigration**.

* He will know that under the Labor Party Government, in 1975-76, **immigration** declined to an all time low of 52,000 people- the lowest since 1947.

* While I am on that point, I point out to the honourable member for Maribymong, the spokesman on **immigration** and ethnic affairs for the Opposition, that in all instances all State Premierswhether they be on my side of politics or on the honourable member's side- have supported a continued active **immigration** program.

* I conclude by stating one fact which should never be forgotten: Under the Labor Administration we saw a halving of the **immigration** rate and a doubling of the migrant unemployment rate.

* If that story is confirmed, as I believe it most certainly will be, it is a disgraceful use of the Government's **immigration** power and its visa power to give the Prime Minister an apparent trade victory as a result of that particular venture.

* The main reasons for the increases in population were the economic and **immigration** policies started by the Chifley Government.

* We are looking to increasing our population by sustained large-scale **immigration**.

* I join in opposing the views put by members of the Opposition regarding our **immigration** policy.

* I cannot accept the view that, because we have high unemployment in Australia, we should curtail our **immigration** program.

* I submit that what we want in Australia is a medium **immigration** policy, a policy which will allow the re-uniting of families with a greater spread than is applicable at present.

* I hope that, in the ensuing three years, our Government will have a good, hard look at **immigration** on the basis of a wider family re-union.

* I make no comment other than to say this: An analysis of **immigration** statistics shows that there is presently an increasing number of non-white people coming to Australia as compared with the situation 10 or 12 years ago.

* Surely white Rhodesians who have exactly the same type of living oppressions in their homeland as other refugees do, are entitled to be considered for **immigration** to Australia.

* I make that point because at present there is very great concern amongst the Australian people about our **immigration** policies.

* I say this: Turn on the taps of **immigration** at a moderate rate so that we can have family re-union and so that we can have skilled workers and some unskilled workers.

* The Wilson report on **immigration** has been under way for almost eight years, yet no Government has seen fit seriously to consider that report.

* What a curious ambiguity there is in our **immigration** policy when we can allow people in- admittedly they are refugees- without great attention to the procedures they have undergone to get here, yet we refuse to allow into our country a blind girl from England.

* I shall leave the matter of **immigration** at that point.

* The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  ignored the requirements of this legislation when he decided to proceed with an enlarged **immigration** program for this financial year.

* However, the direct costs of the **immigration** programme over the past 25 years,' during which time some 2.6 million settlers have come to Australia, average out at about $285 a head.

* in fact, an important purpose of the cost-benefit analysis of **immigration** for which I have arranged, on the recommendation of the Immigration Planning Council 
Melbourne.

* Our normal population growth is 1.9 per cent- 1.1 per cent being natural growth and 0.8 per cent representing **immigration** growth.

* I shall be asking APIC to proceed with preparation of a Green Paper on population and **immigration** policies.

* Taking account of the problems of comparing statistical series and the different time periods, it is apparent that the high levels of **immigration** into Canada during the past 3 years have not had a significant effect on the level of unemployment On the other hand, Australia has sharply reduced **immigration** during a period of rapidly increasing unemployment.

* Canada has sought to achieve a consistent approach to population growth and to **immigration**.

* The question of consistency in **immigration** programs is a most important matter for us all to consider.

* There is also the great question of creating new job opportunities in the emerging post- industrial society, though there is evidence that **immigration** itself helps to create jobs and to generate economic development.

* As **immigration** is a Federal responsibility, is it not also a Federal responsibility to provide adequate finance so that migrants may be encouraged to learn English quickly?

* The proposed charges are: 
In Europe and North America it is usual to charge for a wide array of **immigration** and consular services.

* On 7 June the Minister stated that for 1977-78 'a gross intake of around 77,000 is expected to yield a net **immigration** of about 70,000'.

* The Minister has manipulated the figures for the last year to create the illusion that net **immigration** was 70,000 persons when in fact it fell well below this level.

* By doing this the Minister has been able to manipulate the figures to create the illusion that he was not increasing the **immigration** intake.

* In fact the Government has increased its net **immigration** target by over 25 per cent at a time of still increasing unemployment.

* By including in the net **immigration** figures people already in Australia who were granted a change of status, the Minister seems to be saying that last year some 10,000 to 15,000 visitors were permitted to become permanent residents.

* Such action would make a mockery of the Government's selected **immigration** program.

* On 7 June the Minister condemned the use of visitor entry to circumvent the **immigration** program and claimed to be tightening up on such activity.

* If this new policy is as successful as the one that the Government followed last year we can expect our net **immigration** intake to be around 85,000 persons, which is a significant increase on the stated target of 70,000 new settlers as permanent Australian residents.

* By the year 2000 we may even have only 17 million or 18 million people, depending on where and when our falling birth rate stabilises and on the net gain from **immigration** in the coming two decades.

* This would bring Christmas Island into line with 
and (2) The screening of migrants from Britain has been the subject of representations to the British Government from time to time since the commencement of post-war **immigration**.

* I am not one of those who believes that **immigration** is the cause of unemployment in Australia.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs: 
I wish to inform the House that the Minister for Immigration,  Dr Forbes,  is leaving Australia tonight for official discussions on **immigration** in Europe and North America.

* It is now concentrating on **immigration** and consular work relating to Lebanese who have applied to come to Australia.

* With the easing of civil unrest in Lebanon, normal **immigration** procedures have now replaced the special concessional arrangements under which some 10,700 Lebanese came to Australia in 1976-77.

* As I said, normal **immigration** procedures have now replaced those special concessional arrangements.

* As we have seen over the years, there are 2 ways of administering the **immigration** laws.

* I think that the Minister's actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the **immigration** laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the rights of members of Parliament of the British Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity.

* Additional costs for **immigration** purposes are incurred under appropriations controlled by other departments.

* I am very pleased that the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes),  the spokesman for the Opposition on **immigration** and ethnic affairs, has once again brought the plight of Lebanese people to the attention of the House.

* Keep in mind that any **immigration** program, and particularly any program in relation to refugee or quasi-refugee resettlement, must take into account the full global situation.

* It deals with the question of inequalities, particularly as they relate to **immigration**.

* If one is to speak about inequalities in the Australian society, the Australian **immigration** policy is one area where one should look to find that we are not as egalitarian as we would like to think we are.

* Under the fourth category of the new **immigration** policy announced on May 7 by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, citizens of New Zealand, and Commonwealth and Irish citizens resident in New Zealand, are generally exempt from the requirement to seek prior authority to enter Australia while citizens from other countries have to go through lengthy procedures.

* They all reflect that race and a sense of class is demonstrable within Australia, especially in relation to our **immigration** policies.

* He said that it seemed that the Green Paper was taken up with **immigration** and perhaps submerged the total question of population.

* If the figure given in the Green Paper relating to the fertility rate is correct and there is no gain at all in **immigration** we will have a very low population by the year 2000 compared with what we may have anticipated 10 years ago.

* On the question of any stepping up of the **immigration** program on the basis of family reunions this will necessarily mean that because most migrant families live in Melbourne or Sydney there will be an increase in the population in those 2 cities.

* Mrs Chan advised that she applied to the Australian **immigration** authorities in Sydney for a further six months extension visa on 25 July 1978.

* Prior to the amalgamation of the former Department of Immigration with the former Department of Labour the services of an **immigration** officer were regularly available in Geelong on, I think, five half-days a week.

* Because of the present **immigration** restrictions there are large numbers of migrants who have raised **immigration** queries relating directly to members of their families who may or may not, in the final analysis, qualify for entry to Australia.

* It would appear that an extension of our **immigration** program is to take place.

* I believe that any relaxation in our **immigration** policy should be along these lines.

* The honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  referred to the **immigration** portfolio and the Immigration Act.

* He proposes as the greatest diversion in Australia since the Snowy River project a joint select committee to look into the operation of the **immigration** programme.

* If in fact this Liberal-Country Party Government has any problems with inflation they are only meagre compared with the problems which obviously are faced by the Labor Party - and the personalities in that Party which clash - on **immigration** policy.

* For example, in commenting on the gratuitous intervention of the British Race Relations Board and the gratuitous advice we go from them on the matter of **immigration** the right honourable member for Melbourne said this: 
The British political parties, both Conservative and Labour, have made a hell of a mess of **immigration** and now they appear to want to pass it on to us.

* In commenting in this House on **immigration** policy, in conjunction, in fact, with his Leader, the honourable member for Grayndler went further.

* He went on to say: 
But I maintain that Australia's **immigration** policy should bc based on the principle laid down by successive governments since Federation, that we need to maintain a homogeneous population.

* On  Mr Fraser's  weekly radio and television programme he said that  Mr Daly  had every right to decide that the misinterpretation of his attitude to Labor's **immigration** programme had gone too far.

* His  gratuitous advice on **immigration** to the Prime Minister of Singapore is fairly well known.

* I am referring to  Mr Dunstan,  the Premier of South Australia, who sent to the Prime Minister of Singapore a telegram which referred to close and most effective ties between Singapore, South Australia and the Australian nation as a whole in trade, culture and lastly **immigration**.

* He rejected claims that his statement would breach ALP **immigration** policy.

* Mr Dunstan  said: 
1 will now quote, as I have been doing - this time from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition made last Sunday in which he reiterated Labor's policy on **immigration**.

* He and the Government have done four main things: Firstly, they have restored the **immigration** program which was cut off at the roots by the Australian Labor Party Government.

* I have had many cases in which people have come to me in circumstances where approval was given a few years ago and then it was arbitrarily cut out overnight because the former Government got into economic trouble and decided that the way to overcome that trouble was to cut out the previous **immigration** program.

* The second thing the Minister did was to institute a thorough and sensible population and **immigration** inquiry.

* It is time that the people realised that the Australian Labor Party stands for the abolition of censorship, the recognition of Scientology, the breakdown of the standard of our **immigration** programme, the importation of unemployment, because of the stated views of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to tariffs and the revaluation of the Australian dollar and because the Labor Party is pushing for shorter working hours without any regard for increased productivity.

* asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: 
The Government's policy, that is, the policy of the Liberal and Country Parties, on **immigration** has not been changed in substance since March 1966 when the then Minister for Immigration announced what our policy was - not static, because we are constantly looking at the problem of migration to see whether there should be any liberalisation.

* Since the postwar **immigration** scheme started nearly 4 million migrants have come to live in Australia.

* 1 believe that every country which has embarked upon an **immigration** program has had this experience.

* In a statement to the House on 1 April, following the closing of our Embassy in Beirut, the Minister pointed out that there were Australian missions in Athens, Nicosia, Tel Aviv, Ankara and Cairo and that special arrangements were being made to post an **immigration** officer in Damascus.

* In support of his claim that Australia had done more than any other country to assist Lebanese wishing to migrate, the Minister cited, among other things, the presence in Damascus of the **immigration** officer he had referred to in his ministerial statement on 1 April.

* On 2 1 May the Minister issued a statement announcing that Australian residents can now sponsor the **immigration** of their parents even if the parents are not dependent on them and are outside the acceptable occupational categories.

* Before I argue the case, or appear to be knocking **immigration**, let me assert the areas in which I am in favour of accepting migrants.

* The honourable member's views on **immigration** and matters of this nature are very well known.

* He said that the Australian Government's **immigration** policy is well known.

* It seems to me that when the question of **immigration** is mentioned not only the honourable member for Boothby but also a number of other honourable members on the other side of the House seem to be very condescending in their attitude towards the whole question.

* Those honourable members seem to forget that Australian history is one of **immigration** and that the honourable member for Boothby is a descendant of immigrants, as 1 am and as is every other member who sits in this House.

* As I stated at the beginning of my speech - 
This year's Budget is further testimony to the Commonwealth Government's support for **immigration**, for migrants and for the development of a socially cohesive and culturally diverse Australian community.

* At no time in Australia's history has there been such a wide range of achievements in **immigration** and ethnic affairs as there has since the beginning of 1976.

* Following an extensive review of **immigration** policies in the context of Australia's population, new **immigration** policies and population objectives were announced on 7 June last year.

* We have an active **immigration** policy with denned objectives over rolling three-year periods; we have relaxed family reunion entry categories in a responsible way; we have introduced new opportunities for independent applicants to be considered for migration under a systematic selection system known as NUMAS, which is based on the collective experience of settlement in this country over many years.

* We in the Government believe that a continuing **immigration** program is a crucial element in policies and programs for the advancement of Australia.

* We believe also that we must link the **immigration** intake with effective post-arrival settlement programs so that the process of **immigration** is one that is satisfying and productive to migrants themselves and to the Australian community.

* This is essential expenditure to ensure that adequate information is available to decision-makers in the Australian community for resource allocation, for **immigration** planning and for use by those who have to plan and carry through services to the community as a whole and to elements within the community.

* More than 20 years ago when Australia was going through a difficult period of unemployment and economic problems, there was a clamour from some people that **immigration** should be cut or that it should stop completely.

* Fortunately, good sense prevailed and a majority of Australians, not only supporters of the Government of the day but also leaders of the trade union movement, recognised the importance of **immigration** to Australia's development and economic well-being.

* Planned **immigration**, based on the need to maintain a balanced program, both ethnically and industrially, continued to lead us into the prosperous 1960s.

* Attitudes, especially of some sections within the Opposition in more recent times, are reminiscent of those calls for reduced **immigration** in 1956 and 1957.

* Our **immigration** and ethnic affairs policies have been stated in this Parliament.

* The ALP's **immigration** policy is a very imprecise one but it does say that family reunion must have a high priority.

* In a statement on a new approach to **immigration** and community relations, the Opposition spokesman said that family reunion is a concept that includes: 
There is no clarification in recent Press releases from the Opposition spokesman on Immigration.

* It is a pity that in a debate on **immigration** the Opposition should have descended to the sort of level where the Opposition hovers around waiting for innocuous pieces of paper, in some instances early Departmental drafts, to become available as the basis for unintelligible Press releases.

* Our **immigration** and ethnic affairs policies and programs are based on Australia's interests, compassion for our fellow men and women and playing a responsible role in the international arena.

* In Geelong an officer is working in the **immigration** area with the Department of Social Security.

* They were provided up until the time **immigration** became part of the Department of Labor and Immigration.

* 2408) 
-I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs concerning illegal **immigration** to Northern Australia.

* 1 per cent natural growth and 0.8 per cent **immigration**.

* Let me examine the Green Paper on **immigration** and population which is before us.

* Using the Borrie yardstick we can expect a population of approximately 16 million people by the end of the century if we rely only on natural growth and exclude **immigration**.

* The crucial question for policy making is whether we accept that target figure and adjust our policies to it or whether we accept 16 million people as a base which can be increased quite substantially by a deliberate **immigration** policy of allowing in up to 20 million or even more new migrants.

* Heavy **immigration** programs impose immediate burdens on resource allocation and can cause gross distortions in our economy.

* That 1.1 per cent would include both natural growth and **immigration**.

* The natural growth would need to be supplemented by a modest **immigration** program.

* We know also that there has been strong population growth in Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, in South Australia, even without a major **immigration** program these trends will continue.

* We have already started an in depth survey of population, including **immigration** and emigration, rates of births and deaths and similar matters.

* I refer to prices, government policy and **immigration**.

* It is interesting to note that between 1961 and 1966 the population of Australia increased by 1 million - 487,000 coming from **immigration** - while the rural population of Australia declined by 65,000.

* The cost of **immigration** for the year 1968-69 was $61,835,007; in 1969-70 it was $67,925,000.

* I am not one who opposes **immigration**; I support **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: 
There is no field within which there is a greater necessity for an explanation of where this country is heading more than **immigration**.

* There is confusion as to just what is meant by Australia's current **immigration** policy and whether there is still an opportunity for persons in Asia to come to Australia and on what terms and conditions.

* The first thing I want to say about present **immigration** policy is that it is regrettable that the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  suffers from verbal diarrhoea.

* In confusing the understanding of the Australian electorate and people abroad on the Australian **immigration** policy he performs equally admirably.

* Finally, I believe that at this stage there is a real necessity for Australia to embark on a concerted **immigration** program.

* I believe that its practical approach to **immigration**, by curbing the number of immigrants to Australia to 110,000, was long overdue and should have been adopted by the previous Government.

* There could be no more fundamental matter for debate at this point of time than the question of Australia's **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  in bringing the Green Paper before this Parliament pointed to the fact that this was the first green paper dealing with Australia's **immigration** policies and Australia's population ever to be tabled in this 
Parliament.

* As one who has ventured to express some views on Australia's **immigration** policies may I be heard to say on this occasion that this Minister is one who does give one a hearing and is responsive and sympathetic to the submissions one puts before him.

* It is incredible when one considers that with a population of 13.9 million in one of the richest countries in the world, that this is the very first time that there has been a Green Paper on this matter placed before this Parliament for the Parliament as a whole to debate, giving it an opportunity to consider Australia's future population growth and in particular **immigration** policies.

* As the Minister said when he introduced the Green Paper into the Parliament, the previous **immigration** policy which has operated in this country for nearly 30 years was responsible for bringing to Australia over 3.3 million new settlers who, together with their children born in Australia subsequent to their arrival, have been responsible for about half of Australia's postwar growth from 7.4 million to 13.9 million people.

* If we were to take note of some of the comments which have emanated from the other side of the House we would have no **immigration** policy at all.

* There are some who are frankly so petrified at the question of **immigration**, thinking in some way it is an electoral issue which could put them out of Parliament, that they are not prepared to face up to the realities and the challenge that is before Australia at present.

* I commend the Minister and the members of APIC for coming out and telling the Australian people quite bluntly that we can expect a considerable increase in **immigration** to Australiamuch larger than many other people would have believed.

* The honourable speakers who have preceded me have pointed to the fact that increased **immigration** leading to increased population will lead to increased demand and increased productivity.

* Far from endangering the jobs of Australians I believe it will make available to Australians more jobs than they would have if there were in fact a negative **immigration** growth in this country.

* Unless there is an increase in the birth rate we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and in the absence of an **immigration** gain Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Indeed, the experience of several developed nations suggests that Australia could even be facing further falls in its birth rate and a future loss of population in the absence of **immigration**.

* Like the Minister I draw to the attention of the House that unless we have a proper **immigration** policy not only will we have reached the situation of zero population growth but we will find that this country in the 1980s- that is barely 3 to 4 years off- will have a very severe manpower shortage.

* Might I just say in passing that I welcome the indication that we might now be talking in terms of **immigration** in net terms rather than raw figures.

* The establishment of a small, permanent team of **immigration** officers in Bangkok is one proposal I put forward.

* It is true that the reduced **immigration** programme for this year will provide an opportunity, as I said in my statement on the size of the programme, to extend and develop our welfare and education activities amongst migrants.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 27 September 1978: 
1 ) What were the nationalities of applicants approved for **immigration** under the entrepreneur policy up to 30 June 1978.

* Mr Fraser,  labour and **immigration** spokesman, said he generally supported the plan by the Labour Minisster,  Mr Cameron.

* If anything it would have more old age pensioners who had originated overseas because America's main period of **immigration** was in the early part of the 20th century and many of the people who migrated to the United States then have now become eligible for the old age pension.

* Once a foot is placed on Australian soil it is difficult to have it removed even when there are others who seek to enter this country through the authorised door of normal **immigration** procedure and should have a higher priority.

* In all areas of defence, security, health, **immigration**, foreign affairs and drug trafficking we should be alert to the dangers and change accordingly.

* Many people who are prevented from bringing to Australia close friends or relatives because of the job aspects of our **immigration** policy complain bitterly about our open-handed policy towards these Vietnamese refugees.

* It is nice to be able to chalk up a plus when we are beating our heads against all the reams of red tape whether it involve **immigration**, passports or whatever.

* I should like to address my remarks to the Department of Labor and Immigration but specifically to one relatively small aspect of **immigration** into Australia.

* This concerns **immigration**.

* Suddenly, about one year ago, it was decided by the Australian Government in its wisdom- or lack of wisdom- that these people could not be considered for **immigration** into Australia unless they had a passport which was stamped showing Australia as one of the countries for which it was valid.

* Do we accept the proposition of the police forces of those totalitarian regimes that these people are suitable for **immigration** into Australia or do we use other methods?

* -In Australia **immigration** must surely form a very important part of any Government's policy.

* Our **immigration** intake over the past few years has diminished considerably.

* Secondly, the estimated net **immigration** rate in the current financial year is little more than 30 000 people, compared with only 21 000 people in 1975-76.

* It all adds up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from **immigration**.

* Australia's real population building took place in the post-war period when we embarked on a major **immigration** program.

* As a member of a parliamentary delegation last year I was able to see at first hand the methods of our **immigration** officers in Turkey, Yugoslavia, Great Britain, Ireland, Greece and some other countries.

* If I could be critical of our past **immigration** policy it would be in this sector.

* In the past 3 years **immigration** programmes reached considerably higher levels than previously.

* Public debate on a matter as important as **immigration** is essential.

* The Government has clearly stated its policy so that the community can formulate informed views on future **immigration**.

* Australia has critics of our **immigration** policy.

* In the main the criticism is that **immigration** inhibits economic growth, that our programmes are based merely on getting numbers and ignoring quality.

* Some critics regard **immigration** as the cause of pollution, the urban sprawl, inflation and so on.

* At times critics give the impression that they believe that **immigration** is the root cause of everything wrong in Australia and that Australia alone suffers from these problems.

* Our **immigration** programme takes into account changes in the employment situation, availability of housing and accommodation, balance of the sexes, worker dependent patterns, and factors bearing on the successful integration of migrant groups.

* Hundreds of the hopeless can be seen milling around the **immigration** office where our **immigration** officers do their best to cope with the mess that this Government has created.

* In the second place there were hundreds of people already in Nicosia and other 
The result of what the Minister did was a flood of Lebanese into Cyprus and other places which aggravated in particular the situation in Cyprus and made the task of overworked **immigration** officers even more difficult.

* There are now arrangements for people to go back to the **immigration** office in Nicosia as late as 3 April this year.

* It is absolutely necessary that even now the Government reinforce the staff of the **immigration** post at Nicosia.

* When I was at Nicosia just a fortnight or so ago, literally hundreds of people were nulling around the **immigration** office, standing there like cattle, and being processed at a rate that was deplorable.

* The Government set up **immigration** committees to deal with category A applicants alone.

* In the course of his speech a few moments ago the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  said that I would not allow a debate on the subject of **immigration**.

* If the honourable member for Wannon wishes to discuss **immigration**, I invite him to get up and put up or shut up.

* The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  has said that there will be full opportunity for any member of this Parliament, especially myself and the honourable member for Lyne  (Mr Lucock),  to speak about **immigration** in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Speech of  Her  Majesty the Queen.

* It is not the same as a specific debate on **immigration** policy.

* The honourable member for Wannon - a former Minister - suggested and stated during the course of his remarks that I had made no statement on **immigration** to this Parliament.

* When he sought to make a statement in this House on **immigration** on a previous occasion leave was denied to him to do so and he had no alternative but to present a paper without comment.

* The Liberal and National Country Parties are therefore committed to the active encouragement of **immigration** at a level and of a pattern which best suits Australia's national interests.

* A Liberal and National Country Party government will constantly re-appraise its **immigration** policies to ensure that they continue to contribute to the steady improvement of the standard of living for all people in Australia.

* Immigration Programme 
The Liberal and National Country Parties believe that an active **immigration** programme is essential to the growth of Australia's population.

* The humanitarian and compassionate aspects of **immigration** will not be subjugated to short-term changes in economic conditions.

* The Liberal/National Country Parties will establish a separate Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to ensure the efficient administration of **immigration** policy through a single department instead of the present fragmented approach.

* A separate Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will also ensure the coordination of **immigration** policy with other major national objectives and provide a single focal point through which matters of interest to migrants can be given prompt and effective attention.

* A Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will give explicit effect to Liberal/National Country Party objectives of taking **immigration** out of the narrow ' manpower policies ' which at present dominate it.

* These committees will help to ensure a more coordinated **immigration** policy between the Federal government instrumentalities, the States and the ethnic communities.

* In furtherance of its **immigration** policy, a Liberal/ National Country Party government will also- 
One matter of concern, of course, is the adequacy of teachers who can teach in migrant languages.

* The question of **immigration** is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.

* We are, of course, receiving an increasing number of **immigration** applications from people in Rhodesia.

* Were passengers arriving at Tullamarine Airport in BOAC 747, Flight 812, on 5 September 1973, delayed nearly two hours in clearing customs and **immigration**.

* Are there separate **immigration** desks for returning Australian citizens so that they are not unnecessarily delayed by the more extended procedure necessary for migrants; if not, why not.

* Lance Johnston; and that they were meeting the **immigration** authorities early the next morning.

* At about 3 o'clock on the Monday afternoon I heard that Georgi Ermolenko had gone from the **immigration** office at 11 a.m. to the Parmelia Hotel, to which all the Russians had returned.

* Lance Johnston and  Mr Badger  had been prevented by police, **immigration** officials and other departmental officials from actually seeing Ermolenko or indeed any of the other Russians.

* Let us not forget that when Ermolenko emerged from the **immigration** office in St George's Terrace, Perth, he gave an interview to the Press.

* First was the **immigration** program.

* Let us assume a continuation of current **immigration** policies resulting in a net contribution to the labour force of approximately 20,000 a year; a return to the pre- 1974 trend in female participation rates by about 1981, remembering that our female participation rates are still significantly below those in a number of industrialised countries; and that young people participate in education and the labour force at present rates.

* Australian people and that an ageing population growing at zero growth is not in the best interests of this country's contribution to the prosperity of its own people and the South East Asian region and that, therefore, policies be adopted concerning **immigration** and the Australian family, which remedy the present trend of events having regard to the development, employment and social justice obligations of Government.

* It relates to **immigration** and to the social justice circumstances of **immigration** programs developed in Australia.

* We are concerned now with **immigration** because we are concerned with the economic defence of Australia.

* So, for a whole host of social and hard economic reasons, I ask the Government to be bold in relation to **immigration**, and to be bold with a sense of justice.

* Because of **immigration** there was a slight boost in the second half of last year.

* I ask the Government to consider what it might do in respect of the deposit gap for young marrieds who have the care of children, at the same time as it looks at a new and bold **immigration** policy that might be implemented with a sense of justice.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
There can be no doubt that one of the principal responsibilities of any national government is the framing and administration of **immigration** policy.

* The results of **immigration** policies are irreversible.

* Because the effects of changing migration policies and administration are so far reaching, the Opposition believes that the Government owes to the people of Australia, both recent arrivals and those who could claim to be native sons, a clear and detailed explanation of the reasons behind the recent changes wrought in the **immigration** field.

* The possible effects of this inquiry's recommendations in relation to future **immigration** policies and administration are obviously enormous.

* Let us look at another field of uncertainty and unease - the relationship between foreign affairs policy and **immigration** policy.

* It is a fact of life that **immigration** policies do have some bearing on these relationships.

* Again, the results of the Government's emphasis on sponsored **immigration** and family reunion are unclear.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
My own personal view is that Australia should drastically cut her **immigration** programme.

* We should question whether it is in the interest of Australia to continue our assisted **immigration** programme in view of the pressure of **immigration** on the States, on education, on health and our hospitals, on local government, on spiralling land and housing costs; in fact on all aspects of government.

* We have to ponder not only our population increase but also our increased **immigration** intake.

* Department of Labor and Immigration Department of Social Security Department of Foreign Affairs Department of Education Department of Police and Customs Department of the Media Department of Housing and Construction Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet 
The principal functions of the Interdepartmental Committee are to exchange information and to promote coordination and co-operation between Departments involved in aspects of **immigration** or migrant settlement, rather than to examine and recommend on substantive matters of policy.

* 1 - an **immigration** cutback of 3,000 to be effective at Christmas time; No.

* It is obvious that there are great divisions within the Opposition over its **immigration** policy.

* During the very short time at my disposal I want to speak in support of **immigration**.

* As I said during the debate on the Budget it has become fashionable, for some reason, to knock **immigration**.

* I am yet to be convinced that **immigration** contributes either to unemployment or to inflation.

* I sought 3 tables of statistics relating to 6 selected countries and to the subjects of the annual rate of increase of the consumer price index, the percentage of the work force unemployed and the net long term **immigration** as a percentage of mid-year population for each *&gt;f those countries.

* I could have selected any other 5 countries to make a comparison with Australia but I chose Canada and New Zealand as countries of **immigration**, Japan and the United Kingdom as countries of intense manufacturing industry and as countries which have not increased their population through migration, and I chose the United States of America both as  a  highly intensive manufacturing country and as a country which still attracts migrants in reasonable numbers.

* Surely those statistics indicate that we should be looking elsewhere than to **immigration** to find the reasons for the present rate of inflation and increasing unemployment.

* I believe that our **immigration** programme has been made the scapegoat for changing economic conditions which have affected countries other than Australia.

* In fact, statistics show that Australia, which has the highest percentage of migration intake, has managed to combat the problems of inflation and unemployment far better than countries which have either no **immigration** intake or a lesser one than Australia.

* But in my opinion **immigration** is not to blame.

* Opposition when he addressed the Perth Press Club only last Sunday on the subject of Labor's approach to **immigration**.

* Referring to the impact which migrants who have come to Australia under the Government's **immigration** policy have, he said: 
One of the biggest problems we have in Australia is our low productivity.

* I turn now to the infamous case of the application for **immigration** by some Italian people.

* There has been aU this talk about receiving 65 000 representations in relation to **immigration** pOliCy, but who changed the **immigration** policy?

* The honourable member has raised a serious question, because in the early days of the **immigration** program there was no doubt that there was a considerable imbalance in the sexes, which led to a great deal of sterile competition.

* There is allegation our citizens have offended against **immigration** laws.

* What used to happen - this has happened and is on file - is that one brother would apply for **immigration**.

* Suggestions have also been made that Australia has built up bad relations in our neighbourhood because of its **immigration** policy.

* A few years ago a leader of Singapore said: 
Australia's **immigration** policy has done irreparable harm not only to Australia, but to all European nations with interests in Asia.

* The honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  spoke of the proud record of the United Kingdom-Australia relationship, but the present **immigration** policy of the United Kingdom towards Australia certainly is not a proud one.

* I would like to read to the House an extract from the **immigration** policy of the United Kingdom presented in the House of Commons on 25th January by the Secretary of State for the Home Department,  Mr Robert  Carr, which is reported at page 654 of the House of Commons Hansard.

* After talking about the interdependence of Commonwealth countries, the United Kingdom, the colonies and **immigration** policy he said: 
With this in mind, it is all the more important to reduce the **immigration** of citizens of other countries - both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth - to the inescapable minimum.

* We have heard of this preferment or alleged entitlement given by the United Kingdom to Australian citizens, but in fact under the present **immigration** laws of the United Kingdom Australian citizens do not have any automatic entitlement to United Kingdom citizenship.

* On the economics side, the decision of a lot more people to remain in Australia after having arrived here means a great saving to this country in terms  Of  the cost of **immigration**, housing and assimilation.

* I mentioned earlier a statement on **immigration** policy by the Secretary of State for the Home Department in the United Kingdom speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom Government.

* In New Zealand, which would be a sister country to Australia in terms of **immigration** policy, renunciation is not required.

* It is not so much a criticism of what has been or is being done for migrants in this regard but rather that a more comprehensive scheme has been delayed so long, particularly in view of the constant urging by conventions and **immigration** authorities.

* Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947 in the opening days of post-war **immigration** schemes or, if I may say so, in the infancy of the programme.

* Since that time, great changes have taken place in the **immigration** programme, such as increased numbers, differing types of migrants and methods of transport.

* Surely, with this problem being stressed by **immigration** authorities everywhere, including citizenship conventions, advisory councils and other interested parties, a scheme might well have been expected at a much earlier date.

* After all, industry has benefited a lot from the **immigration** programme.

* Members of an Opposition parliamentary committee on **immigration** recently visited a centre where the intensive scheme was in progress.

* It is an endeavour to offer a constructive approach to improving the education of adult and child migrants and to relieving the States of some of the responsibility for a national programme of **immigration**.

* In the publication setting out Labor's policy **immigration** takes up little space, something less than 2 inches, and like most of the Labor Party policies is capable of being interpreted in a number of ways.

* On one line it says that the basis of Labor's policy on **immigration** will include: 
These 2 statements are self-contradictory.

* This is the reason why we get statements from the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  claiming that the present **immigration** policy would continue under a Labor government and such contradictory statements from the South Australian Labor Premier,  Mr Dunstan,  that a Labor government would virtually open the floodgates.

* Our **immigration** policy is not based on any strange idea that, because our colour is white, we are superior to someone whose colour is black or something else.

* There are 2 basic reasons why Australia's **immigration** policy should continue in its present form.

* Also the shadow Minister for **immigration** and community relations, the honourable member for Melbourne, committed Labor to a dramatic increase in education spending.

* The Minister knows that the **immigration** ministers asked that urgent attention be given to the question of rights^' of Australian workers or their dependants if they lived in another State or went to" live in another country.

* It is a simple matter of fact that people from the United Kingdom and Eire have formed the backbone of the **immigration** program for many years.

* They provide a far more difficult **immigration** problem than normal migrants.

* In particular, **immigration** on a large scale seems to bring about a more unsettled state of affairs.

* How they got through the screening of our **immigration** officials in other lands is beyond me.

* Our **immigration** officials must be incompetent.

* The introductory remarks which were made this afternoon by the honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and his colleague the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  made it clear to me and I am sure to most thinking Australians that if both of these gentlemen were entrusted with  thz  responsibility of writing an **immigration** policy for the Liberal Party, each of them would produce a vastly different policy.

* Without seeking to embarrass the honourable member for Kooyong, I must say 1 am sure that his genuine ideas on non-discrimination would be much closer to the Australian Labor Party's policy than would the attitude and policies of the present Liberal Party spokesman on **immigration**, the honourable member for Wannon.

* I say quite clearly to the Opposition that it is entirely dishonest to claim that this Government has failed to inform the House adequately of changes in **immigration** policy.

* The Labor Party's policy on **immigration** has received the attention of honourable members opposite ever since we came into office.

* Over a period of some years before our success in 1972, **immigration** in Australia had fallen into a state where successive Ministers for Immigration applied their own policies.

* For a period of 23 years the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government had control of Australia's **immigration** program.

* The effects of the **immigration** policy of the previous Government showed clearly that it did have such a policy.

* I suggest that the Minister is a temporary bird of passage in the **immigration** ministry.

* The **immigration** policy of the Liberal-Country Party Government was discriminatory.

* Other speakers have pointed out that for 25 years **immigration** has been a major item of Commonwealth Government expenditure and that 2.6 million new settlers have been the result.

* Indeed, the honourable member for Deakin  (Mr Jarman)  and the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  pointed out that our **immigration** history is a much longer one.

* The honourable member for Deakin pointed out that the number of migrants we have received in modern times have given us a lead over the **immigration** rate that even (he United States of America achieved.

* 1 was very much impressed in the United States to see the museum of **immigration** that has been set up at the base of the Statue of Liberty.

* The Opposition believes that a proper **immigration** programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia's national and economic security, the welfare and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation.

* I compliment the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Lynch)  and his Department because I believe they possess the same sort of principles and believe in a questioning of the proper role of **immigration**.

* The Minister has initiated major examinations of aspects of **immigration**.

* Although the Minister has assured the House that the numbers refused naturalisation for political reasons were small, I am very concerned with the development of this view among migrants under our **immigration** plan, particularly amongst such a very responsible group.

* He said, amongst other things: 
It is important that Australians understand what can and what cannot reasonably be asked of the **immigration** programme.

* If **immigration** is not intended as an alternative to adequate industrial and occupational training facilities, if it does not absolve us from our responsibility to train professional, skilled and other key workers, then the complete lack of forward long term Australian objectives in education and quality of education, which was highlighted in the recent debate on the estimates for the Department of Education and Science, should not exist.

* Our **immigration** officers overseas, particularly in countries sending large numbers to Australia, can and do start this process from the time the first approaches are made, wherever practicable.

* I think it is appropriate to draw to the attention of the House that the **immigration** authorities should be concerned with one thing only - that entry in proper circumstances is allowed and that at the appropriate stage the person concerned is able to leave the country.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
The amendment ignores the substantial measures taken since the early days of post war **immigration** by this Government and by the government before it to develop a comprehensive programme of migrant education.

* Firstly, let me emphasise the point that **immigration** is not totally a Commonwealth responsibility.

* Of course, in the particular context of the economic circumstances with which this nation is now dealing, these conditions provide further restraints on Government spending and support the view that **immigration** funds should not be used to finance capital works in the States.

* This major study, along with the cost benefit analysis, will provide in the future that information which we, as a Commonwealth Government, need to structure better future **immigration** programmes to our objectives in the 1970s.

* The cost benefit study of **immigration** is a long overdue attempt to provide an evaluation of the costs and benefits to Australia of **immigration**.

* The honourable member for Bowman  Mr Keogh)  asked us to be reassured that the Australian Labor Party will maintain an **immigration** policy which will be in the best interests of Australia.

* One has only to look at other countries which have brought in trouble through **immigration**.

* We have to look at the **immigration** policies of some of the colonial powers.

* We can be friends with these people and can give them support but we can be taken over not by war but because of our **immigration** policies.

* Our **immigration** programme has to be closed down to a great extent.

* I noticed one or two things that I thought might have been mentioned perhaps in the first place by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  when speaking on legislation concerning **immigration** in the last 2 days.

* Now, for many years, dating back to the start of **immigration** with Arthur Calwell, the Labor Party al least has had a very consistent, easily understood and quite plain **immigration** policy.

* Now we have a new Labor doctrine on **immigration**.

* I do not know whether it goes beyond the Leader's sort of private remarks made in the atmosphere of the moment, but the new Whitlam policy in regard to **immigration** is to bring to Australia the relatives of those who are here, but not to bring new members of the work force.

* Wherever this controversy may settle - and a lot of people have different views - it is quite plain that the advantage that we get immediately out of the **immigration** programme is the acquisition to the work force of skilled workers who are immediately productive.

* I do not know whether this new scheme will emerge as the new **immigration** policy of the Australian Labor Party.

* It would be interesting to know because the Opposition spokesmen on **immigration**, as well as other people, over the years have pointed out that the one thing that cannot be done with an **immigration** policy is to turn it on and off suddenly for temporary reasons.

* If the case for **immigration** is for Australia's benefit alone then as an advanced, rich country we surely stand condemned for taking only those who are well qualified to fit easily into this country.

* If the case for **immigration** is to help relieve population pressures in the countries of origin then again with our technique of selection we are taking the ones who are a minimal burden to their homeland.

* If the case for **immigration** is to provide a refuge for those who wish to leave their countries of origin because of persecution, such as is the case with those being expelled from Uganda, then again, to be consistent in our humanitarianism.

* During the years of our massive **immigration** programme we were not very selective in terms of quality as long as the immigrants were white.

* 1 deplore the dreadful racism involved, but 1 wish to discuss the effect of this non-selective white **immigration**.

* The Government would lose effective control of **immigration** if assisted migration was stopped, according to the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes).

* What was the outcome of the meeting on 19th October 1972 between the Australian High Commissioner and the British Home Secretary about the administration of the British Immigration Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by **immigration** officers at.

* If there is anything that can be guaranteed to bring out into the open this racism, it would be an **immigration** program that increased the competition for already scarce jobs.

* I ask the Minister: Does he intend actively to recruit suitable persons to fill these gaps, or will the Government continue its **immigration** administration simply by taking skilled workers if, and only if, these persons offer themselves?

* It is vital that we base our **immigration** policy on the long term projections rather than the temporary day to day fluctuations.

* What is happening under this Government is that while the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is increasing the level of **immigration**, so creating a greater need for these support services, the Treasurer is hell-bent on dismantling the same services.

* But what sort of logic is it that increases the **immigration** intake and at the same time reduces the quality and quantity of the services available once these people have arrived in our country?

* We have never in the past exceeded the quota of migrants eligible under the occupational skills criteria of the **immigration** program.

* I wish to make only one last point about the Government's **immigration** program and that is to draw attention to the impression that the new Minister has given that he is intent on returning to the traditional sources of migrants for this country, in other words the United Kingdom.

* The child was not subject to any court order in Australia but, had it been, our court order would have been nullified in deference to the **immigration** laws of another country.

* I do not know the provisions of the **immigration** law relative to this matter, but I should not think they would be so loose as to allow that situation to occur.

* If the Australian **immigration** laws have no provision which will prevent a Maltese national registering a child on his passport without the permission of his wife or the child's mother, that loophole should be closed.

* If this is how our **immigration** laws stand at the moment they contain a serious loophole which should be closed.

* In entering a debate on Australia's **immigration** policies and population it strikes me as rather odd that the honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron),  who preceded me in this debate, spent all his time talking about Aborigines.

* I want to talk about the human face of our **immigration** policies.

* Whilst people have commented from time to time on the way in which certain programs have administered by the Government and on certain directions that the Government is now seeking to take, basically we have been talking in largely theoretical terms about directions of **immigration** policies.

* I believe that we can get a good picture of Australian society now if we look at something that the Commissioner for Community Relations said in his first annual report last year: 
I do not like to see a word like 'etcetera' in reports like this; it is fairly sloppy-  is so poor that consideration should seriously be given to stopping or at least reducing non-English-speaking **immigration**.

* It is interesting also to look at the dissection of the figures in regard to this Department, with particular attention to amounts of money being spent in the various fields and facets of **immigration**.

* These are 2 important aspects of the **immigration** sector and it is pleasing to see increases there.

* These figures must give rise to alarm about Australia's **immigration** program.

* Our **immigration** policy must also, of course, take into account our capacity to pro vide employment.

* This is another important aspect of a successful **immigration** policy.

* This Government's policy is for an **immigration** intake in 1973-74 of 110,000 migrants.

* It should give us some valuable information and assistance with regard to **immigration**.

* I think that our **immigration** policy at this point of time should be stepped up.

* In addition, because of the present difficult economic and employment situation in Australia, **immigration** programs have been decreased significantly to a point where the 52 748 migrants arriving in 1975-76 represented the lowest intake since 1947 .

* Australia is a country whose population is based on **immigration**.

* I think that in looking at **immigration** and population policies one must involve oneself in an examination of the unemployment question in Australia todaywhether the unemployment is long-term or whether it is short-term.

* He also makes the point in relation to **immigration** in Britain and refers to an anti-**immigration** backlash in that country.

* But looking at **immigration** policies in the future one would have to be very careful about how such policies were handled in that regard.

* The **immigration** program has brought to Australia a number of things that we would not otherwise have.

* It affects our population, our family policies and our **immigration** programs.

* These trends add up to the fact that we face the prospect of an Australia with little or no natural increase in population and only a very small net gain from **immigration**.

* We can see from the Budget Speech that the Government has decided not to set a specific **immigration** program for 1977-78 but to determine intake on the basis of numbers eligible through overseas selection processes.

* Provision is made for assisted passages for 16,000 people, which is approximately the same number as that provided for under the **immigration** policy last year.

* This is similar to the number which arrived in Australia under our **immigration** policy last year.

* It is interesting to note the employment figures in the various **immigration** offices that Australia has established throughout the world.

* Australia must keep up an active **immigration** policy immediately the economic 
Lilley, in criticising the honourable member for Melbourne, talked about the dynamics of population in other countries which are not comparable to Australia in the light of our economic and industrial set up.

* He expressed surprise that a Green Paper entitled 'Immigration Policies and Australia's Population' should spend so much time dealing with the subject of **immigration**.

* in the Australian context, **immigration** remains the major instrument by which government can directly and significantly influence population growth.

* That, of course, makes one wonder about their validity in considering them  vis a vis  **immigration** policy.

* Australia's post Second World War **immigration** policy under Caldwell was based partly on humanitarian grounds and partly on the growth of Australian population that was needed at the time.

* There was very little in the way of social planning programs to accompany that **immigration** intake.

* It is part of some of those measures which must be considered in looking at an **immigration** policy and a population policy.

* At that stage the fighting was escalating in Lebanon and the **immigration** staff in Beirut was reduced.

* The honourable member has mentioned already the temporary establishment of an **immigration** office in Damascus.

* In late June advice was received from the Syrian authorities that it would not be possible to extend our **immigration** activities in Syria beyond the end of June.

* Clearly, the question of Australian diplomatic representation in Syria must be resolved on the basis of a wider range of issues rather than the need just to maintain a shortterm **immigration** operation, and that an operation to process applications from people outside Syria.

* That was the stage at which an announcement was made that a senior officer had been sent to Nicosia the previous weekend to investigate and report on the most effective way in which the Lebanese **immigration** operation could be organised.

* The criteria for entry into Australia has been extended on compassionate grounds and additional staff added to existing **immigration** offices surrounding Lebanon and a special **immigration** office has been established in Damascus with the sole purpose of assisting the Lebanese who have fled to Syria.

* It was a significant feature of the **immigration** policy under the previous Government, to such and extent that by the time we of the Australian Labor Party came to office in December 1972 some 25 per cent of our annual migrant intake was being lost by wastage of migrants returning to their home countries.

* Like this gentleman in Geelong, the brother in the Lebanon is also an Australian citizen and therefore there are no problems in respect of entry or **immigration** but, unfortunately, he is crippled and unable to travel alone.

* I believe that in this instance the strict interpretation of the **immigration** guidelines should not necessarily be applied.

* It is time that consistency was observed in this type of operation where the strictest interpretations of the **immigration** criteria are being applied to people who are in tragic circumstances.

* I mention first those dealing with **immigration**.

* I think that **immigration** too often is viewed on a statistical basis rather than on a human and sociological basis.

* The short title - Immigration (Education) Act 1970 - indicates that the source of power for the Bill derives from the **immigration** provision in the Constitution.

* I am pleased that the Minister raised this question because 1 think it shows quite clearly that this Government should also introduce similar types of legislation dealing with **immigration** (hospitals), **immigration** (mental hospitals), **immigration** (councils) and **immigration** (all kinds of issues).

* Apparently he believes - and 1 hope he is right - that under the **immigration** provisions of the Constitution money could be fed to areas such as the States and local government where extra money is needed.

* The fact that we have increased our population bv **immigration** by a huge number of people has put terrific pressure on other areas of government and not just on education.

* The Minister for Immigration recently attended a summer school organised by the Institute of Political Science al which a number of people were critical of Australia's **immigration** programme.

* The point I would like to make is that **immigration** after 21 3'ears of extensive operation is coming into disrepute.

* Surely if the Minister really believes that the **immigration** programme ought to be continued, from the point of view of public relations, if from no other aspect, it should be possible to show that a certain amount of money is being given to the States and local government on the basis that it is money to reimburse them for extra costs due to the **immigration** programme.

* I think that he is sympathetic to the general **immigration** proposition and the problems surrounding it.I think that a danger exists these days because many people who support the views expressed by the Government and Opposition Parties in this House are starting to talk about the quality of migrants.

* I was disappointed that at the conference to which I referred earlier there were people who talked about racial equality, who opposed our so-called white Australia policy and who encouraged **immigration** on a non racial basis.

* These people are making value judgments in the same way as those who oppose the **immigration** of Chinese are making value judgments.

* In considering the subject of **immigration**, I believe that to some extent we must look at it from the point of view of the migrant.

* 1 hope that the Minister, when he is dealing with people who criticise our **immigration** policy by using statistics as many people do.

* I believe that **immigration** is a vital issue.

* Tonight we are talking on the question of **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* This is a very serious matter to contemplate because we can now be laying a basis for **immigration** policy that can last Australia for the next 30 years or so.

* The Labor Party is proud of the fact that the **immigration** program was one of its creations.

* I suppose that on this occasion, as has been the case on many other occasions, a tribute can be paid to the architect of Australia's **immigration** program- the late Arthur Calwell.

* After Labor initiated this program- and a former colleague of mine, the previous member for Parkes,  Mr Leslie  Haylen went round the world in a difficult situation gathering up the ships to bring these people to Australia- we found that a unity ticket evolved on the question of **immigration**.

* The intake from **immigration** has slowed down as well.

* It was proper that the intake from **immigration** should slow down in that situation.

* For many years we had a **immigration** target of one per cent of the population.

* In 1975 our net loss in **immigration** was 8000.

* It is apparent that there is a very real relationship between the net **immigration** figure and the state of buoyancy of the Australian economy, the availability of jobs, the availability of houses and the like.

* It is interesting to look at the **immigration** intake and to see from where our migrants came.

* 1 would take the lower of those 2 figures if I were having a stab at the kind of **immigration** intake that we should have at present.

* I believe that the net effect of **immigration** would be beneficial to Australia in that it would have the capacity to increase consumer demand in Australia.

* Let me mention that the population trend in Australia is very serious in that we have had a decline from the stand point of both natural and **immigration** population growth.

* Our **immigration** has the effect of offsetting this declining fertility.

* I think sufficient figures are available already to indicate that if Australia is to sustain its population and if it is to provide the population expansion which is necessary from many points of view, including the point of view of defence and point of view of getting effective utilisation of our generously endowed resources, it ought to be at this stage laying the basis for an **immigration** program which will contribute to the well being of this nation, to the growth of our economy and to the prosperity of the Australian Community.

* For example, a good friend of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam), Mr Evasio  Costanzo wrote in 'La Fiamma' that Labor had killed **immigration**.

* He tried to justify the decision and to prove that the dismemberment of the Department of Immigration was not a process of killing Australia's **immigration** program.

* If we look at events that have occurred since we find that the **immigration** tap as it is sometimes described has been turned off.

* The decision to turn off the tap is really a decision either to close down the **immigration** scheme altogether or it is a guise to introduce quotas.

* What will the quotas be when the **immigration** tap is turned on, if it is to be turned on by this Government, when conditions change?

* There is close cooperation and consultation between New Zealand authorities and Australian authorities in both the **immigration** area and the police area.

* It was raised again at the most recent meeting of Australian Ministers concerned with **immigration**, which was also attended by the New Zealand Minister.

* I refer to **immigration**.

* put the axe into the **immigration** programme.

* Today it is fashionable to knock **immigration**, and the critics of our **immigration** policy point to the demands which the **immigration** programme makes on the economy and the additional amount of money which has to be spent on roads, schools, hospitals and sewerage systems because of the number of migrants which we as a government have brought to Australia.

* The critics of Australia's **immigration** policy base most of their criticism on the demand for capital which they claim is aggravated by our intake of migrants.

* My question is also addressed to the Minister for Immigration and refers to a statement in the Budget Speech last week which said: 
The Government has decided not to set a specific **immigration** program for 1977-78 but to determine in-take on the basis of numbers of eligible applicants.

* In fact, the same type of provision could be included in future agreements made with countries concerning **immigration**.

* Throughout the years since its commencement our **immigration** programme has had the support of both sides of this Parliament.

* I am sure that all honourable members look forward to a continuation of this general agreement in future **immigration** policies.

* May I point out that probably the first occasion on which this Government implemented our policy was in the field of **immigration**?

* Our **immigration** policy has been administered in the past in a way that has met with the approval of all political parties.

* My colleague, the honourable member for Robertson  (Mr Cohen),  questioned the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  on the effectiveness of the present **immigration** policy.

* Unfortunately, even though it was very early in the day, during question time, the Prime Minister missed the point of the question and answered that he did not realise that any members of Parliament thought that the **immigration** policy was bad.

* I would like to support the proposition put so capably this evening by the honourable member for Grayndler on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that the most suitable type of inquiry to investigate the future **immigration** needs of our nation is, without a doubt, a joint committee of both Houses of this Parliament.

* At this Convention I heard a number of very interesting matters associated with **immigration** discussed.

* In these work categories, a minimum of 3 years' practical experience together with appropriate academic qualifications is required for **immigration** purposes.

* I am sure the honourable gentleman will appreciate that provision for repatriation has been a feature of Australia's post-war **immigration** programme and that provision for repatriation is included in a number of bi-lateral agreements which have been signed since the early 1950s.

* Although undoubtedly this item is a financial debit to Australia's **immigration** programme, I say quite deliberately that it is a debit generated from a sense of compassion and a realisation that, of the hundreds of thousands of people who come to Australia year in and year out, there will be some who for very good reasons will be quite able to conform to conditions here.

* This is a very small expense indeed when measured against the tremendous advantages to Australia of the **immigration** programme since its inception.

* It is certainly true that it would not have been possible for Australia to develop, in terms of economic growth, per capita income and employment, without the large scale post-war **immigration** programme which has been directed specifically and expertly to satisfying shortages of labour and Australia's other needs.

* I believe that should a Labor government in Western Australia or a possible future Labor Federal government announce its intention to withdraw from the specific approach to **immigration** that has proved so successful over the years and to confine it purely to the whims of people already in Australia - that policy has been enunciated and was made even clearer recently by the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland - it will be disastrous for Australia.

* No longer would we have the process by which an expert **immigration** service selects the people with the skills and of the categories we require and the economic growth, advancement and development which Australia has had in the past would not be fired.

* I hope that the Minister can advise us of the details of whether these stamps will be available at the various **immigration** offices, in the capital cities, in the regional areas all over Australia and the Department of Foreign Affairs offices.

* As an instance, on television last night, in respect of **immigration** policy, another great issue of the Australian Labor Party- 
No, but the point was made by the Leader of the Opposition that members on this side should support this great matter of importance.

* Therefore I am against the suspension of Standing Orders because I consider that it is nothing but an endeavour to float this particular policy but not other policies, such as the policy on **immigration**, which could perhaps be more embarrassing to the Labor Party.

* asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: 
Is a record kept of the numbers of persons with professional qualifications who have migrated to Australia since the commencement of the **immigration** scheme.

* I desire to bring to the attention of the House a matter concerned with **immigration**.

* 1 have kept closely in touch with the **immigration** programme over the years, not only because of my own interest as the Minister who first planned the post-war intake of migrants but more particularly because of its vital importance to Australia.

* It is not universally accepted practice that the departments of **immigration** of various countries charge clients- or applicants for visas to visit those countries- for the processing of the various forms and applications.

* Insofar as there is now a significant component in the **immigration** welfare program which is really directed at and for refugees, one could claim that immigrants generally will be paying for their own postarrival welfare and for that of refugees.

* It is rather sad that the Committee, in looking at the estimates for the Department of Labor and Immigration, is observing in relation to the **immigration** side of things the demolition of a department which once was held in very great esteem and which played a tremendous part in the development of this nation.

* 1) 1974-75 that the amount for the item concerning **immigration** studies and research is down from the appropriation of $92,000 last year to the appropriation of $9,400 this year.

* Most members of this chamber and, I am sure, most people in Australia have a very clear idea of the benefits which have accrued to this country from the major **immigration** program which has been going on since the end of the Second World War.

* There are foreign policy implications about any nation's **immigration** policies.

* Rather than building up international goodwill by the application of the new policies of the Labor Government in **immigration**, in fact we are running the very real risk that international goodwill will be broken down.

* Will he also give us an opportunity to have a full scale debate on this important area of **immigration** policy?

* It is in this context, recognising the importance of citizenship, that we debate the Government's latest legislative initiative in the area of **immigration**.

* The legislation seeks to remove the position of preferment which British migrants have enjoyed since the inception of Australia's **immigration** program.

* On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove discrimination in various pieces of legislation, particularly the **immigration** program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the **immigration** area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment "which is currently enjoyed by British citizens.

* If he seeks to bring down some universal application across the board in the field of **immigration**, perhaps I could put into his mind, if only in passing, the question of the visa system.

* Since the days of first settlement **immigration** has been a feature of Australia's development.

* In the years since, even as the base of our **immigration** program has broadened as never before, British migrants have continued to be the cornerstone, the very real base, of **immigration** to this country.

* I am certain the Minister would be the first to recognise that the pattern of **immigration** ought to be at the rate of integration in this country.

* Our overseas **immigration** posts did not just happen; they did not appear like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.

* I believe the future of some of these posts has been placed in jeopardy by some of the critics of our **immigration** policy.

* Some people blame **immigration** for the increased level of unemployment in Australia.

* For this reason they want either greatly to reduce our **immigration** intake or cut it out completely.

* The records of our **immigration** intake over the years show that in those years in which we had the greatest number of migrants coming to Australia we had our lowest level of unemployment and we also enjoyed some of our greatest levels of prosperity.

* The matters  1  have mentioned are very positive gains which we have made from our **immigration** programme.

* But I think it is wrong to attribute unemployment, congestion and pollution to **immigration**, as quite a number of people have done.

* Let us have a look at some of the benefits which we have derived from our **immigration** programme.

* A vigorous **immigration** programme is essential to the development of Australia.

* I believe that it is in Australia's best interests to retain the very efficient **immigration** posts which have been already established overseas.

* I have referred to some of the tangible benefits of **immigration**.

* The effects of **immigration** have in fact permeated the whole life of the nation.

* Over the last 200 years, except for brief periods of war and economic recession, Australia has been a country of large-scale **immigration**.

* Australia has succeeded in maintaining social harmony and national cohesion throughout this period of **immigration**.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  who has just resumed his seat said how important **immigration** is to his electorate and to the Opposition.

* Perhaps he does this because he has no concern, as is the case with the majority of Opposition members, for **immigration** and its impact on the Australian community.

* We did split **immigration** into its real area of concern- **immigration** and ethnic affairs.

* The Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population should remind us all that we should be taking more notice of population trends.

* The preface of this Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population indicates that the size, composition and distribution of our population will have a major influence on the nature of our future society.

* If we close our minds and eyes to the problems of the pressing necessity of a large part of the undeveloped world- much of it a starving world- we will no doubt shelve our **immigration** problem with probably the excuse that because we have a high percentage of unemployed we cannot allow more migrants to enter the country.

* That is at the present rate of **immigration** intake.

* I do not say that that is the only consideration that should be taken into account when we are looking at altering our **immigration** intake.

* It seems to me that speakers from both sides of the House do not appear to be advocating an all-out **immigration** policy.

* We should make it known that we reject the proposition that **immigration** can be used to solve economic difficulties or that it should provide an underpinning of unskilled labour to be hired or fired at the whim of an industry, whether in a time of full employment or in a time of high unemployment.

* In accordance with these principles, a moderate level of **immigration** should be proposed with special consideration given to parents and dependants of former settlers.

* Our **immigration** policy should always be balanced with these considerations.

* Other speakers have claimed that **immigration** cannot be turned on and off but it seems to me that the facts of life would indicate that we cannot leave the gates wide open irrespective of how much we would like to admit people from the developing countries.

* We should support an **immigration** policy administered with - 
In discussing the estimates for the Department of Immigration I do not want to raise the propositions to which I referred in my speech on the Budget.

* I recently wrote to the Minister for Immigration concerning a case in which the relatives of a person who has been rejected for **immigration** are living in Australia.

* In the two or three minutes remaining to me I would like to repeat a point which arises from the general question of **immigration**.

* In addition to the points that have been raised tonight on whether migrants should be allowed into this country, 1 think to some extent we must realise that some of the opposition to **immigration** has developed because of the popularisation of what is commonly known as zero population growth.

* But do not let us get carried away with slogans to the effect that the only way we can teach India not to increase its population is by not increasing our population in Australia and then to go on to the next step and say that the only way we can stop Australia's population increasing is by stopping **immigration**.

* There is a theory that **immigration** adds to unemployment.

* I am very pleased to know that in the past year or so, for a change, the **immigration** question has been removed somewhat from the emotional area and the debate has become much more informed.

* I believe that this is one of the signposts of the **immigration** debate and that people are beginning to realise just where and when in the trade cycle **immigration** causes stresses or benefits on employment and other matters such as the balance of payments.

* Too often in this place debates on **immigration** become emotional.

* Sometimes people get up and say: 'If we have an increased level of **immigration** we are bound to have to that same extent an increase in the level of unemployment'.

* If **immigration** were to be used as a means of economic stabilisation there would be a need to cut **immigration** at the peak of the trade cycle and increase **immigration** at the beginning of economic recovery.

* One of the things that is spoken about in this paper is the fact that at the bottom of the trade cycle when there is an excess capacity **immigration** in the first instance tends to use up only that excess capacity, so the increased demand from the new immigrants will not add so much to employment levels and, therefore, may add to unemployment.

* Even though I admit that perhaps at the bottom of the trade cycle **immigration** will add less to demand than it would at the peak, there is a case to be made, perhaps more strongly than even Ainsley Jolley has put it, that **immigration** at all stages of the trade cycle will add to demand especially of course at the top of the trade cycle, and that is a time when **immigration** perhaps needs to be cut.

* But when we are feeling the first very fragile commencement of a very solid movement forward in the Australian economy, now- right now- is, in my view, the time to increase **immigration** heavily in the way that it is apparently being done.

* Often there is a feeling in the Australian community- certainly this applies in my electorate too- that a low level of **immigration** is a means of cutting back on unemployment.

* Many people forget, however, that a low level of **immigration** is in many ways a contributor to our present condition.

* It does need to be said that it was the previous Labor Government that apparently did not believe in **immigration**.

* It was the Government that cut back the levels of **immigration** which made it so difficult for qualified brothers and sisters of migrants already in Australia to enter this country.

* It was the Government that created a situation in which in one year the net **immigration** to Australia was only about 20,000.

* There has been a steady increase in the net **immigration** intake.

* I want to see good and steady increases in **immigration** to this country as one of the prime methods of getting this country back on its feet.

* The additional areas  of  assistance to industry and expenditure  on  the Territories, education, the Austraiian Broadcasting Commission, Aboriginals, research and **immigration** - all of which I believe are essential items of expenditure which the Government must undertake - represent 10% of the proposed total Budget expenditure.

* Nevertheless, the Opposition commends the Government on finally producing an agreed **immigration** policy; that is, I take it, agreed amongst themselves, because even in the last couple of weeks there has been some discord between various Ministers over this question.

* For what purports to be a major statement on the Government's **immigration** policies it says remarkably little and virtually none of it is new.

* Nevertheless, the Government is proposing a substantial increase in the **immigration** intake to 90,000 people a year.

* According to the Minister 'this program underlines the Government's faith in **immigration** as an element in economic growth'.

* This is a far cry from his previous statements arguing that **immigration** provides an economic stimulus and increased employment opportunities.

* To increase our **immigration** intake when Australia faces a high and, in seasonally adjusted terms, rising rate of unemployment and a growing indigenous work force is totally irresponsible, in our view.

* The Government claims that there is a shortage of skilled workers which can be met only by increased **immigration**.

* More significantly, selective **immigration** has tended to have a negative effect on our training programs.

* Despite the Government's rhetoric to the contraryand I am not blaming the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for this because it is not his responsibility- **immigration** has acted as an alternative to training or retraining our own work force.

* The exploration of long-term solutions to unemployment has been put off partly because the Government and the employers can avoid the difficult decisions by claiming to overcome shortterm skill shortages through **immigration**.

* Today's unemployment problem is not merely a reflection of the low level of economic activity but, even if it were, an increase in the **immigration** intake would not have any significant effect on the level of economic activity.

* It is claimed that by enlarging the domestic market **immigration** will increase the efficiency of industry through economies of scale.'

* Economic recovery by new investment stimulus is more likely to result from recovery in demand for our exports rather than from the dubious stimulus to domestic investment attributable to marginal increases in the size of the market from **immigration**.

* After all, the proposed level of **immigration** would represent a growth rate in the market of less than half of one per cent over the present rate of increase; hardly of much relevance to manufacturers unable to sell their goods today.

* In other programs such as the initial settlement program, cost estimates by the Galbally committee were based on the current **immigration** intakes, and even then it would take three years to cover the estimated bare minimum of those needing such a service.

* Will the Government now undertake to increase funds for those programs in line with its increase in **immigration** as proposed by the Minister?

* How can an increased selective **immigration** program be justified to those people who have already migrated to Australia?

* by leave - I take this opportunity to make comment not only about the particular matter that the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  has mentioned but also about other aspects of his **immigration** administration for the simple reason that the Minister has resolutely, over a long period, not encouraged, not enabled and not taken any measures in this House to permit a proper debate of the alleged **immigration** changes he has made.

* But there is another area in which the Minister for Immigration and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in particular are culpable in relation to Australia's **immigration** program in a way in which no similar charge can be laid against any other Minister for Immigration or any other Prime Minister since the days of Arthur Calwell, the first and possibly the greatest Minister for Immigration whom Australia has had.

* It is a pity that his tradition in helping to establish a bi-partisan approach to this matter could not have been continued because it was Arthur Calwell - it was probably only a member of the Labor Party who could do it - who gained trade union support for a large and continuing **immigration** program.

* Now, partly from grandstanding and partly from belief and a search for publicity that general trade union support for a continuing **immigration** program looks like being threatened.

* The important point in this proposal is that it runs the risk, as has become most evident in the last few days, of jeopardising continuing trade union support for a substantial **immigration** program that Australia needs.

* It is a situation that would seriously jeopardise the continuing support of the trade unions for an **immigration** program.

* Again, the Minister for Immigration and particularly the Prime Minister are culpable for having established the circumstances in which aspirations which will not be fulfilled have been aroused in the Philippines and in which fears have been aroused in the trade union movement for the first time since Arthur Calwell, to his continuing and lasting credit, sold an **immigration** program to the trade union movement of Australia.

* He is interested in the froth and not the responsibility of administering **immigration** matters.

* He would do much better to look to his responsibilities to the Australian Parliament and people and to the administration of his Department rather than perpetually to seek flamboyance and headlines which will damage the **immigration** program in Australia.

* I hope that the contempt with which he treats the Parliament in relation to major statements of **immigration** policy, of which there is none that I can recall in this Parliament, and the contempt which he has so far shown for the Notice Paper by failing to answer questions, will not be continued.

* I ask him to make a statement on **immigration** and to allow it to be properly debated - not by one or two speakers a side but properly debated - in this Parliament.

* The honourable member also raised an **immigration** complaint.

* He should realise that the Minister receives approximately 65 000 representations per annum in respect of **immigration** matters.

* Before doing so, I clarify a misunderstanding that has arisen following comments made by me in the last few days concerning my attitude to migrants and **immigration**.

* Now let me turn to some of the doubts about our assumptions on **immigration** that have got me into hot water in recent days.

* The Minister and I were both asked for our comments on one particular chapter which dealt with **immigration** and unemployment.

* In his Press release the Minister said: 

 Dr Cass has called for **immigration** to be cut to the bone as happened under the Whitlam Labor Government.

* If migration does do the thing it is claimed to do- be an economic stimulus and create jobs- the Government should rapidly and immediately increase the migration rate now and not wait until economic circumstances improve, for that implies that **immigration** inhibits or depresses economic recovery.

* Surely the cautionin other words, the fact that the Government does not rapidly and immediately increase **immigration** rates- reflects the true effect of **immigration**, and the stated policy, or what the Government goes on about publicly, about increasing **immigration** is simply humbug, an ideological hangup, a nefarious plot to weaken the trade union movement by increasing the pool of unemployment or, worst of all, a simplistic acceptance of up to now generaly held myths whose consequences have never been assessed.

* Just what are the effects of high **immigration** rates?

* The Government should stop talking in this humbug fashion about **immigration** helping to stimulate all these things.

* In short, **immigration** needs a dose of open government because for the last IS months it has had a good solid dose of closed, secretive government and of refusal to supply answers and facts.

* This question concerns details of **immigration** - it is question number 999  -  such as the number of people coming to Australia and the number of assisted migrants.

* But the Hansard record would show that the total debate for the estimates of the Department of Immigration lasted about 2 minutes less than one hour, and that does not comprise a proper debate on **immigration**.

* But it does not come to the substance, the purpose and the direction of Australian **immigration** policy.

* The direction, purpose and consequence of an **immigration** program depend upon the numbers of people who are coming to Australia and the countries from which those people come.

* If that is the kind of thing that is to result from the Minister's handling of the **immigration** portfolio it certainly is not going to result in great advantage to Australia.

* We have seen the Minister jeopardising union support for a continuing **immigration** program, which only the Minister for Immigration would be capable of doing.

* What has been the trend in South East Asian countries in inquiries and applications since the Government announced its new **immigration** policies?

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1979: 
Is it a fact that **immigration** entry cards state that answers to questions must be given in the English language.

* For many years, Australia's **immigration** program was based on an incoherent system of establishing annual targets, some settlers having their full fare paid for them, and others coming here under their own steam and paying their full fare.

* This was the target balance that was set by the late 
Arthur Calwell when the **immigration** scheme was introduced in 1949.

* Mr Jay  referred to the problems of Australia's **immigration** policy and said: 
The trouble with Australia's **immigration** policy  is that it has never had one.

* In practice the statement is a perfect example of the twin theses which have always underlain Australia's **immigration** thinking.

* One of the main factors that certainly has contributed to the problem over the years has been the fact that the responsibility for **immigration**, rightly, has been that of the national Government.

* Admittedly, supplementary schemes have been operated by various States, but the main impact of **immigration** on the growth pattern of this nation has been rightly the responsibility of, and has been conducted under the authority of, the Australian Government.

* On **immigration** policy there is a definite conflict within the Australian Labor Party.

* The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  has in the past supported a bi-partisan **immigration** policy.

* I had been through health clearances in Sydney and I had to go through **immigration** and customs clearances in Melbourne.

* The reason I bother to raise this matter is that, having had the benefit of visiting a number of countries during my journey to Europe, I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that the worst port in the world for people to get through **immigration** clearances must be Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine.

* It seems to me that a lot of unnecessary clerical work was being done on behalf of passengers by the **immigration** staff.

* Only four or five **immigration** officers were working at their posts.

* We are talking about the Green Paper on Australian **immigration** and population.

* The Green Paper refers to the nexus between the rate of **immigration** and the rate of capital investment.

* Looking at the Green Paper and summing up what people in my electorate think about **immigration**, I would say the total net effect of this vacuum, which has been largely created in the Australian Labor Party term of office, is absolutely detrimental to this country.

* The Green Paper, on summing up, in my view basically supports **immigration** as a tool of population increase.

* It says that we will have an increase in demand for services with an increase in **immigration**.

* I would have thought that was self-evident but there are many people, such as the shadow Minister for Immigration, who seem to thinkthis is one thing I vaguely got out of his speechthat an increase in **immigration** will necessarily add to the rate of unemployment.

* But I think that it is self-evident that an increase in **immigration** will add to the demand for services and then ultimately of course to the supply of services.

* It talks about the possibility in future programs of the deployment of **immigration** for the purposes of decentralisation.

* I am very pleased that the issues of capital investment were mentionedwhether in fact an increase in **immigration** will cause a fall off in capital investment available for production as against that which will be required for the provision of social services such as schools and hospitals.

* It also notes that there should be no bar to continued **immigration** from nonEnglish speaking countries.

* Another thing I heard the Opposition spokesman say was that perhaps we do not have the resources to sustain a tremendous increase in **immigration**.

* There are traditional arguments against a substantial increase in the **immigration** programthe traditional argument of an increase in the unemployment level.

* We must give the late Arthur Calwell credit for his foresight after the war in getting this country going by means of the **immigration** program.

* In my view **immigration** has added a great deal to this country and will continue to do so.

* I realise that because of the popular Press it may be politically unpalatable to talk about an increase in the **immigration** program.

* I will stand out on any limb and say that the long term results will bear out any sort of confidence that the Minister might have in the **immigration** program adding to this country once again.

* The **immigration** program will help us to take advantage of that unlimited future.

* I suggest that one of the most important decisions of the leaders of this country was to have a great and substantial **immigration** program.

* II was based on humanitarian grounds and the needs of the country and that later **immigration** under Liberal governments became factory fodder programs.

* As a result of that consideration the presence of Australian **immigration** officials in Nicosia was strengthened, exactly in line with the actions of a number of other countries.

* I am becoming sick of opening my mail and finding another 2 or 3 statements on **immigration**.

* One area in which I can agree with the former right honourable member for Melbourne and the present Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  is in their **immigration** policy.

* I do not know what our **immigration** policy is.

* The Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  has consistently misled the Australian public by claiming that there is no shortage of skilled labour as a result of the **immigration** cutback.

* 1 ) The services relating to functions of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs which were provided in the past in rural areas by offices of the Department of Labor and **immigration** are being continued by area offices of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.

* There is no question that there has been a huge cover-up in this Parliament involving the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to obscure differences of opinion between the departments and their Ministers as to the effects of independent **immigration** under the Numerical Multifactor Assessment System.

* We all know that until 1 January **immigration** policy covered these categories: Family reunion, special family reunion, refugees, persons freely granted residence because of the Tasman agreement, and the general eligibility provision wherein independent new migrants were selected mainly by relating their skills to the Australian 1 mainly abour market.

* It has a legal- in fact, a constitutional- responsibility for **immigration** and the welfare of migrants and their families.

* Under the Constitutionfrom the outset- the Federal Government has been able to make laws on **immigration** and also to make laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.

* At a conference of Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Melbourne on 22 October last the present Federal Minister described the Federal Government's responsibilities towards migrants in these terms: 
As I understand it we do have the responsibility in terms of entry into Australia, in terms of **immigration**  programs,  deportations and the like, temporary entries and so forth.

* Immigration has been a Federal matter since Federation, especially since the great post war government sponsored **immigration** programs.

* At that time there was perpetual discussion about **immigration** and whether the level of **immigration** placed too many demands upon our capacity to provide goods and services.

* Now the one variable we have, that of **immigration** has in fact been discounted by the previous administration.

* Our level of **immigration** has slowed to the point where we have no growth in the labour force and we now have built into it certain immobility and certain structural difficulties associated with relocating people and retraining people at the same time in order to fill some of our requirements in a rational way.

* I believe that the Green Paper on **immigration** and population is worthy of considerable nonparty political discussion.

* In the future, with less scope for transfers from rural areas and, possibly, less **immigration**, there could well be problems of that nature in seeking to ensure a balanced supply of the different labour skills required.

* In the time left to me I want to briefly list some of the main achievements of the Government in **immigration** and ethnic affairs since December 1975 because it is important that the record be set straight.

* We published Australia's first Green Paper on **immigration** policies and Australia's population.

* For the first time in our history since Federation the Australian people have been given the opportunity to make their views known on matters relating to Australia's **immigration** and population policies 
We broadened the family reunion categories for **immigration** and allowed for the entry of entrepreneurs and proprietors of small personal businesses in addition to national need categories.

* Two days ago a matter of public importance on **immigration** was submitted for discussion by the Opposition, and there were not enough Opposition members in the House to keep the debate going.

* That absorption has been carried out under an **immigration** programme the foundation principles of which have never been seriously challenged or criticised either inside or outside Australia during that time.

* Indeed, one could never expect to witness within the entire community anything like unanimous approval for everything that is done or not done in the field of **immigration**.

* I say that, because those same people, both young and old, are spread over the whole of Australia, which in turn means that the whole Australian community, those whose parents were born here and those whose parents were not born here, and who also have different interests, outlooks and attitudes and, in some cases perhaps, memories or knowledge of events in the early part of this century which were not entirely palatable, is vitally interested in **immigration**.

* Those people are all involved in some way or another, and it is only natural that the subject of **immigration** always has been, and for some time at least will continue to be, a very sensitive area of deliberation.

* opinion that any well-founded criticism in the area of **immigration** is not the fault of the plan itself but the fault of the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  or of his Govern- .

* lence and has not experienced any real trouble which could be associated with or blamed upon in any way the broad foundation principles of the **immigration** programme.

* This must always be a serious consideration in any change in **immigration** policy or programme.

* Of course, the principles which are embraced in the policy of the Australian Labor Party are no different today from what they were in the very first years of **immigration**.

* The Australian Labor Party has always remained firm in the belief that an **immigration** policy must be administered with tolerance, sympathy and understanding, and I am .

* Very certainly the time is overdue for a full scale, but a fairly quick examination of the whole field to determine just what should be done in the area of **immigration**.

* My reason for saying that is that it would seem that everybody at this point of time, including myself, is agreed on the proposition that there should be an investigation into our **immigration** policy.

* The honourable member for Deakin also spoke about the history of Australia as being the history of **immigration** and if I may I will recapitulate a little of the history of Australia.

* And Australia's first **immigration** scheme was off the ground.

* One could say without fear of contradiction that this, our first **immigration** programme, was the result of a planned policy.

* The others were carefully selected for their qualities and the selections were confirmed by some of the finest judges in England, litis planned **immigration** policy continued for a number of years with the immigrants being housed in cosy little migrant hostels at Port Arthur in the south, at Botany Bay on the east coast and Moreton Bay in the north.

* Australia then entered a phase of unplanned **immigration** programmes.

* Not the least of these is in the field of **immigration**.

* Mr Chifley's  inherent ability to find the right man for the right job led him to choose the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell),  as he now is, to institute an **immigration** policy.

* Australia's **immigration** policy has become a matter of public debate and the general concensus would be that the policy needs review.

* 1 repeat that Australia's **immigration** policy is in need ot review.

* The article puts forward a point of view that **immigration** is a cost to the community because it draws on resources that could be applied to other things and that there is not sufficient return to the community to warrant a continued outlay.

* The Government will make its first full scale review of Australia's **immigration** programme.

* As a starting point, he had earlier  this  year approved a cost-benefit analysis of **immigration**: This project, would provide detailed information on the economics of **immigration**.

* Mr Lynch also said that he had decided to broaden the basis of Australia's consultative machinery on **immigration**.

* I believe that **immigration** today is at a crossroads and the choice of which road to take is one the Government must face up to fairly quickly.

* In fact, **immigration** is of such vital importance that Australia's policy warrants full debate in this House.

* However, it is generally agreed that the ledger has shown a credit balance in favour of increased **immigration** in the past.

* It is unfortunate and condemnatory thai the Government, which has been in office for 20 years, has realised at the eleventh hour that there is a need for reason rather than emotion to frame our **immigration** policy.

* At present more than 8000 Lebanese in Cyprus where Australia's Lebanese **immigration** operation has been concentrated.

* A senior officer of my Department with wide **immigration** experience in Australia and overseas was sent to Nicosia last weekend.

* He has extensive terms of reference to report on the most effective way in which the Lebanese **immigration** operation can be organised.

* At the moment there is an extremely constrictive **immigration** policy which was initiated under a Labor government and which has been carried on, I think in almost equal effect, by the present Government.

* If the Government is to step up the **immigration** policy in order to bring about a net gain of say 30 000 or 70 000 persons a year, it has to be prepared to do something that governments have not done in the past, that is, to provide the wherewithall in order to finance an **immigration** program at the increased rate which it determines the program should reach.

* I have not heard anyone suggest that we are going to increase the size of the **immigration** program for any reason other than a selfish reason, that the program would benefit us- not them.

* We talk about the success of the early **immigration** programs.

* They are an important source of migrants to Australia and have provided a substantial proportion of the postwar **immigration** program.

* I do not think it is fanto say that the post-war **immigration** program was the start of migration.

* The point I am making- I think it should be made quite strongly- is that we should not be starting an increased **immigration** program merely because this would be seen to be some way of stimulating our economy or stimulating growth.

* We should not be starting an increased **immigration** program, if that is our desire, purely for selfish reasons.

* The other thing which was a feature of earlier **immigration** programs was that we welcomed the males and left the females where they were.

* I suggest that if the consequence of an increased **immigration** flow is that more people are settled on the fringes of the 2 major capital cities of Australia the program, while it might be temporarily satisfactory as a stimulant, will be regressive in its total concept because of the consequences on those capital cities which are already in a situation of turmoil because of their population and lack of social fabric.

* It is now 7 years since the McMahon Government commissioned the National Population Inquiry and a little over 12 months since the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  announced that the Australian Population and Immigration Council would prepare a Green Paper to stimulate public debate about Australia's population and **immigration** policies.

* Indicative of this policy, the Government's inefficient and  ad  /deprocedures in determining **immigration** quotas are a perfect example.

* Australia's population and **immigration** policies are vital issues of concern to every Australian.

* It is appropriate that in this period of record unemployment and deepening economic recession we reassess our **immigration** policies and the options for the growth and development of Australia's population.

* The Parliament and the public might have expected the Minister's statement to reflect the importance and magnitude of the issues involved, an analysis of Australia's past **immigration** policies, some assessment of the recommendations of the National Population Inquiry, a guide to the major issues identified by the Green Paper.

* A recurrent theme in the statement is the relationship between economic growth and the level of **immigration**.

* The Minister attempts to imply that Australia's future prosperity depends on high levels of **immigration** comparable with those of the post-war period being maintained for the next 30 years.

* Australia enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s, and our **immigration** policies substantially assisted and promoted this development.

* Without a substantial **immigration** program, shortages of labour would have resulted from this reduced recruitment to the work force and would have restrained Australia's economic growth in the post-war period.

* The Committee of Economic Inquiry chaired by  Dr J.  Vernon reported in 1965 that one of the major costs of Australian **immigration** policy was the diversion of capital from investment to improved industrial productivity, to the provision of roads, houses, schools and other services for our increased population.

* The Vernon report also noted that **immigration** tended to raise the level of imports in the medium term without appreciably raising exports and leads to overcrowding and environmental deterioration of the cities.

* Under the heading "The Effect of Immigration on Populations' the Green Paper stated: 
Just as in Australia, the Canadians have realised that **immigration** exercises a pervasive influence on the whole of the political and cultural evolution of the national life.

* Equated with a previous Australian slogan of 'Populate or Perish' are a whole series of earlier arguments in favour of **immigration** which are familiar to Australians.

* The Canadian Green Paper on this subject questions the validity of these assumptions in a modern industrialised and increasingly urbanised society, it calls them ' dubious Mt states: 
The Canadian Green Paper is scathing in referring to the view that the competitiveness of Canadian industry would benefit from a larger domestic market, a major factor in post war **immigration**, and one on which much of the 1966 immigraton policies were based.

* The Bureau predicts that even without **immigration** the age group IS to 19, from which most of the new entrants to the work force are drawn, will exceed the level of present years peaking in 1978 and again in 1988.

* In fact there is every reason to believe that an increased **immigration** program would aggravate Australia's unemployment problem in the short term, particularly amongst the young.

* The Vernon inquiry noted that if a shortage of labour leads to an increase in the total **immigration** program this would be a more costly source of skill than to train the additional labour in Australia.

* For too long Australia's **immigration** policies, particularly the recruitment of skilled labour, has been a substitute for technical education programs designed to train and utilise Australian labour more effectively.

* His statement quite deliberately attempted to create the impression that Australia faces negative population growth in the short term and a decline in total population in the absence of a substantial **immigration** program.

* He said: 
Unless there is an increase in the birth rate, we will be approaching a situation where the numbers of births and deaths will be equal and, in the absence of an **immigration** gain, Australia will experience zero population growth.

* Past high levels of fertility and the input into the population of many thousands of young adults through **immigration** have produced an age structure with high proportions in the young child-bearing ages.

* Having been denied these justifications for a high rate of **immigration**, the Minister returned to the empty continent syndrome and implied that we must utilise our superabundant natural resources or have them taken from us.

* In fact he went even further than this when he asserted: 
If Australia adopts a high intake **immigration** policy in the future it will stand alone amongst the industrialised nations with which we usually compare ourselves.

* A series of Canadian Green Papers also questioned the value and impact of significant levels of **immigration** in the future.

* The New Zealand inquiry went on to count the cost of increased population and **immigration** and their impact on the environment.

* The Government and the nation must carefully consider this overwhelming body of overseas evidence that suggests that Australia should carefully re-assess its past **immigration** programs before extending them to our pop11lation policy for the year 2000.

* Our population policies will determine the nature of Australian society in the year 2000 just as our past **immigration** programs have changed Australia over the last 30 years.

* Before any informed decision can be made about Australia's **immigration** policies the Government and the Parliament must be supplied with accurate population statistics and with adequate and up-to-date information about our present demographic patterns and the distribution of our population.

* I believe that it is absolutely essential and a vital prerequisite before an objective, intelligent approach can be made to population policy in general and particularly **immigration** policy.

* -Debates on questions of **immigration** always worry me because for many years we of course accepted the proposition that we had to populate or perish.

* But I wonder on what grounds the assumption is made that the standard of living of the community has been raised specifically by **immigration**.

* So when one comes to weigh up the advantages to Australia one should not be too glib about assuming that all the advances, or an enormous proportion of the advances in our standard of well-being, have been due to **immigration**.

* One of the arguments put forward in this whole **immigration** argument is that we need the migrants because that is the only way to get young people to help to support the old people.

* That is a lot of people, and yet the Government is still talking about **immigration**.

* asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 16 September 1979: 
How many of these persons were granted **immigration** visas.
