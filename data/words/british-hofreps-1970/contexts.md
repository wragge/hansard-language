* The **British** Committee of Privy Councillors looked into this matter in considerable detail and concluded that there were a number of reasons which might commend themselves to a government in order that it ban this activity, but that there was only one real reason to prevent it and that was that the restrictions on the freedom of an individual to go and fight in another country were warranted because under international agreements the relations of the 2 countries could be seriously impaired.

* I think that people of all political persuasions have to be very careful in introducing legislation which may damage the close relationship we have with overseas reinsurers, particularly **British** reinsurers.

* The actions of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  bring disgrace on him in a very personal sense but, more importantly, because he is Prime Minister his actions seriously compromise the parliamentary institution whose importance cannot be overstated, even though in the **British** speaking world we accept it as an everyday thing.

* We could even quote actions and statements displaying the ultimate objective of our socialist Prime Minister to make Australia a republic, to overturn our established **British** parliamentary system although it must be admitted that the Government is doing a pretty fair job of prostituting open and free debate in this Parliament by gagging and guillotining procedures.

* Therefore I will not expand to any great extent on this other than to draw the attention of the House to the **British** white paper - I suggest to those who are interested that they might read it - and 'he sort of things it is thought the corporation would do better than the existing departmental organisation.

* The market that is available is that which requires for home consumption some 650,000 tons of sugar, some 335,000 tons which is contracted to be sold to the **British** Government, and Australia's basic export quota under the International Sugar Agreement, which is of the order of 1 million tons.

* I propose therefore, as this challenge has been thrown down, to talk about the problems that face Qantas and the need for this Bill, in the first place the Government, which is making these arrangements for a vast sum of money to be made available to Qantas to purchase these aircraft, does so with the customary ill grace that all governments in **British** Commonwealth countries provide funds for any reason.

* This, the rejection of a Budget, is clearly the most critical thing to have arisen in this Parliament in its 75 years or in any **British** national parliament for 65 years.

* I am Clydie Cameron- 23 years a member of the Australian Parliament', the **British** authorities would permit him to stay?

* The **British** Government, which placed orders at about the same time as we did, withdrew from the contract in 1967.

* Every primary producer in Australia would have given his complete blessing to the Minister for Primary Industry, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Industry being overseas at that point of time doing exactly what the NZ Minister was doing - camping on the doorstep of the **British** Government and of the Ministers of the Common Market, talking day and night of the common agricultural policy.

* Referring to those areas in the Maralinga region which I mentioned in an answer to a question yesterday, might I say that the **British** Government spent a very large sum of money making areas as safe as possible by pouring great quantities of concrete to fill in areas that had been dug deep, and in restoring the surface area as much as possible.

* Government is no longer a thing that you could do in the afternoon between a good lunch and those other things that gentlemen used to do in .the evenings and sometimes still do, even in this House, in the days when the **British** Constitution comprised the monarch, the parliament and the foxhounds.

* Let me put it another way: If by dint of narrow numbers in this chamber the Prime Minister of the day should have occasion to go to the Governor-General and say T find the burden of governing with a narrow majority difficult' - for example,  Mr Wilson  in the present **British** circumstance - it would mean that the Senate automatically would have to be pulled out.

* The second question concerned membership of the **British** Commonwealth.

* But having heard at close range the Concorde flying, and having seen the outcries in the **British** papers over the noise levels of the Concorde, I can assure the House that the 120,000 or 130,000 people in the Geelong area will not be very happy to find that they are likely to be guinea pigs in the training operations of this aircraft in Australia.

* The agreement on the maintenance of a continued **British** naval presence in the Indian Ocean Ls very welcome because this is a strategic vacuum which Russia is hastening to fill.

* It is true that the **British** Phosphate Commission operates on the basis that phosphate should be extracted at the lowest possible cost.

* As the honourable gentleman implied in his question, the House will be very much aware that the **British** pound has depreciated against the United States dollar by some 5 per cent since 4 March.

* As Uganda is, in terms of the Minister's comments today, quite obviously not a member of the **British** Commonwealth in good standing, I hope that the Australian Government will now seek the views of other member nations with a view to dissociating themselves from the present regime in Uganda before the next Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.

* The State governments' offices in London are undoubtedly being used as a back door way of bringing **British** migrants to this country in preference to persons from other countries who, I believe, have just as good a claim to come to Australia to make new lives for themselves and their families.

* One recalls a similar type of proposal being put forward by the last **British** Labour Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, in his first year of his Labour government, speaking of the need for the United Kingdom to increase its growth rate.

* I want to add that the movement in and out of Australia of Ronald Biggs does indicate the need for the closest possible liaison between Australian and **British** authorities in matters such as this.

* Awards under the Order of Australia, which will be far fewer than those made under the old **British** honours system availed of by some State governments, will be for outstanding and distinguished service to Australia.

* Whether there will be a need for a bilateral agreement between the Australian Government and the **British** Government is something that has to be worked out.

* We in Australia would be speaking as  Mr Arek  spoke if the same decisions we are imposing on Papua New Guinea were being debated in the **British** House of Commons in relation to Australia, In defence of the perpetuation of these decisions we of course say that they are not ready and by some mysterious judgment of the wise man say that at some future, distant, undefined date they will be ready 
The Opposition accepts the technical necessity for this measure which arises to some extent from the longer time that has so far been given to the discussion of the Estimates this year.

We have inherited a great tradition, one that has given the **British** world so much that is good in that it inculcated a spirit of service and fair play that was carried to the end of the earth wherever Englishmen served.

* Airways Ltd and **British** Airways, which are the two major operators out of Brisbane airport, have had to divert all their services via Sydney so that they could uplift enough fuel to get them to Singapore on their first stop.

* It would cost $3.8m a year more than an overseas tanker crewed by a **British** crew, and Britain has a reasonable standard of living to be sure.

* After the first World War the **British** Government financed migrants to come to the south west of Western Australia and a group scheme was started in 1921 at Manjimup.

* I shall come back to the **British** disease in a moment.

* Of course it is not peculiar that I have referred to the **British** disease.

* I point out to those on the other side of the chamber who pretend that I am saying something racist and pursuing a vendetta against all **British** migrants, that that is arrant nonsense.

* In fact, many **British** migrants left Britain to come here to escape the same shop stewards who they find, to their regret, have followed them here.

* In fact, most **British** migrants have contributed enormously to the wellbeing of this country.

* -Even though the honourable member who is now interjecting does not agree, he realises that the fractionalising of the Australian trade union movement which has taken place as a result of the intervention of **British** shop stewards, has been rejected by many of those who are significant Australian trade union leaders.

* Let me quote from  The **British** Disease  by Professor G. C. Allen, Emeritus Professor of Political Economy at the University of London.

* Indeed, many **British** migrants nave written to me, communicated with me, and said that they too are concerned.

* It is true that the **British** disease does not exist only in the trade union movement, but it is important that we register its effect in the trade union movement.

* One letter I received from a gentleman in Victoria stated: 
I work in an industry, which, in Victoria, employs approximately 5000 people, and at least 90 per cent of all shop delegates are of **British** origin.

* The extent of our problem has been so bad that at one stage we had a complete embargo on the hiring of anyone of **British** origin.

* Similarly, in the same industry in South Australia in the early 1970s, migrant (predominantly **British**) workers were involved in repeated unofficial stoppages and alleged acts of industrial sabotage.

* Many **British** migrant unionists, unencumbered by a language barrier, familiar with similar trade union institutions and practices in Britain and often schooled in a union system that relies heavily on strong shop-committee organisation, have been responsible for a substantial militant input into the Australian trade union scene.

* Dr Stephen Haseler, a **British** Labour member of parliament and the author of the book  The Death of **British** Democracy,  in his seventh  Sir Robert  Menzies Lecture in Perth said: 
There we have the link with the philosophers of the Left, and there are many others.

* Let me quote  Mr Paul  Johnson, **British** socialist and editor of the  New Statesman  magazine, who visited Australia last year.

* The tragic truth is that **British** socialism has had a devastating case to make out against postwar union leadership.

* They have encouraged **British** industrial workers in habits and attitudes, in rules and procedures, in illusions and fantasies, which have turned the **British** working class into the coolies of the Western world and Britain into a stinking bankrupt industrial slum.

* I hope, as we all do, that the **British** economy will recover, but those who see the harmful effects of some elements of the economy equally need to be listened to.

* The  Chairman  of the Fabian movement has said: 
Tragically, there is a **British** disease.

* The **British** disease does not affect everybody.

* The **British** disease, as I have spoken of it, affects a few.

* It is one of those elements which unfortunately have contributed to the rundown of the **British** economy.

* I hope that the **British** economy is on the mend and that the optimistic forecasts of the **British** High Commission will be realised.

* He proceeded to instruct his little community in strict Christian ways and deep abiding loyalty to the **British** Crown.

* South African Embassy $174.00 **British** High Commission 32.00 Embassy of Portugal .

The legislation has been pursued in Papua since 1888 shortly after it became a **British** Protectorate and was extended to New Guinea when the Australian Administration commenced in 1921 under the League of Nations Mandate.

* Safety of Life at Sea were convened by the **British** Government.

* We all know that in **British** parliaments the tradition is that if a money Bill is defeated, as the receipts duties legislation was defeated last June, the Government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies.

* Are these companies registered as foreign corporations in any other State or Territory of the Commonwealth or of any country, either inside or outside the **British** Commonwealth; if not, do their trading activities reveal any breach of the law in this respect.

* What is the anticipated effect on Australia's travel deficit arising from the recently introduced APEX (advance purchase) fare between Sydney/London and London/Sydney by Qantas and **British** Airways.

* 1 ) Following his announcement of proposed cheaper air fares between Australia and London, will the implementation of these fares provide a virtual monopoly or duopoly for Qantas and **British** Airways.

* The Committee of Privy Councillors appointed by the **British** Government to inquire into the recruitment of mercenaries spent some time considering these types of advertisements.

* In its report the Committee was particularly concerned about the recruitment of **British** subjects in the armed forces of the National Federation for the Liberation of Angola.

* It was found that the recruits answered advertisements like the one that I have mentioned has been used in 
Australia, and as a result of the advertisement some 160 **British** citizens served in the armed forces of the FNLA.

* Active recruitment in Britain came to an end when it became known that a number of the **British** mercenaries had been massacred by their own side in the African conflict.

* The United States citizens who joined up in the **British** Air Force before their own country entered World War II could be said to be mercenaries.

* The **British** Jews who fought in the Israeli Army against the Arabs also could be said to be mercenaries.

* In saying that, I do not mean for one moment to denigrate persons who have come here from the **British** Isles.

* The **British** have tended, through the normal mechanisms of competition, to buy an alternative at a cheaper price.

* Did he at any time give an undertaking or commitment of any kind to the **British** Minister for Defence, Lord Carrington, to the effect that Australia would maintain its forces in Singapore under the Five Power Arrangements.

* We all know that the tradition in **British** parliaments is that if a money Bill is defeated the government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies.

* we of the Great **British** family are privileged to live in unity under a young and lovely Queen, a great Queen to-day but one who is bound to be greater and greater as the years move on.

* The **British** Governor and his officers were there too.

* The **British** put us on the stage but with no part to play.

* In fact, his brother was a former Australian and **British** Empire lightweight boxing champion and  Mr Kelso  used to be his second.

* We are alone amongst the **British** colonies on this point because the Aboriginal people were a hunting people.

* They did not till the land and we took their soil from them in a way in which **British** settle.ment did not take the soil from the Indians in Canada or in other parts of the world.

* If one looks honestly at the situation in South Africa it can be said that the **British** government of the day ensured that land was reserved for the native people of South Africa and other colonies in Africa.

* Well 31 March is the timetable for the report to come to me from the International Review Committee, government will need to consider that, there will need to be consultations with the **British** Government at this end- 
Clearly, the countries of the ASEAN group see air travel as another commodity in international trade.

* However, only last month we saw in the  Sydney Morning Herald  a report of a statement by a spokesman for **British** Airways, who stated that there would be: 
That appears to be the public view of **British** Airways of what kind of timetable is involved.

* Will he study Canadian, French, **British** and other overseas anti-pollution legislation designed to maintain purity of rivers and streams with a view to following their lead.

* <para pgwide="yes">It is also advised that Port Moresby registration was issued by the Registrar of **British** Ships to the following vessels during the calendar year 1970.

* In the event of Great Britain joining the European Common Market, will the Government take the opportunity to reduce all tariff rates to the **British** preference rate; if not, why not.

* Such corporations have been a fundamental feature of the **British** new town program.

* Will the Prime Minister protest to the **British** Prime Minister about the blatant discrimination against Australian nationals seeking employment in the United Kingdom?

* North Vietnam's protest was disclosed by **British** diplomats here who said their Hanoi embassy had received a similarly worded protest about a frigate being sent to evacuate refugees.

* 1 ) Yes, I am aware that **British** Airways is providing one flight per week with a scheduled elapsed time of 23 hours and 45 minutes.

* Airlines involved are usually Qantas, **British** Airways or Air India.

* in view of their importance, make a statement indicating the attitude of the Australian Government to the **British** policy of supplying naval arms to South Africa.

* This particular project was helped by a grant from the **British** Trade Union Congress and the International Federation of Free Trade Unions.

* The Confederation of **British** Industry has been left in the role of idle spectator.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a statement by  Dr Geoffrey  Bennett, Chief Medical Officer of the **British** Department of Trade, that 2% of aircrew are alcoholics?

* Has his attention been drawn to a report of the **British** Automobile Association claiming that rustproofing of new vehicles is possible for a cost of little more than $1 per vehicle.

* The speech sent a shock wave through the foreign shipping industry and produced reports in the **British** Press that Australia intended to practise flag discrimination.

* Did the **British** SWANN Committee recommend in 1969 that antibiotics used in treating human disease be proscribed from use in animal feeds; if so, was this adopted in 1971.

* The New South Wales producers are Bellambi Coal Co.- the Shell Co. of Australia and Mcllwraith McEacharn have recently purchased 64.8 per cent of Bellambi; Clutha Development Pty Ltd, 100 per cent owned by **British** Petroleum; Austen and Butta Co. Ltd, 37 per cent owned by Shell and 10 per cent by two Japanese companies; and Kembla Coal and Coke Pty Ltd, 50 per cent owned by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia.

* I have said in this House before that the new arrangements with the **British** Government certainly go part of the way towards creating a cheaper fare regime.

* Last year Australia paid $16.6m for overseas films and most of this money flowed into the pockets of American and **British** producers.

* In the 17 years between 1950 and 1967 the **British** Corporation invested $70m in assisting the production of 694 feature films and 164 short films.

* The **British** trade unions have brought Great Britain to her knees.

* They are exporting what is called the **British** sickness, a terrible and shameful phrase and one that we do not like to hear because it is true.

* If there is one thing that is fundamental in our democracy, in our system of **British** justice, in our understanding of the common law rights of the citizen, it is that each citizen not only should have the opportunity to receive the services of the law but also should have the right to obtain the services of the lawyer of his choice, who is independent of everyone- government and individuals.

* If the details are as stated, what would be the main items of expense that would lift the projected cost of the Australian DDL design sp much above the **British** design.

* and (2) The screening of migrants from Britain has been the subject of representations to the **British** Government from time to time since the commencement of post-war immigration.

* With reference to the **British** Advanced Passenger Train project and reports that it will be operating commercially within three years, have any steps been taken to: 
I should like to pay a brief tribute to Frank Green.

* I remember that sometimes he used to depart from this place saying that he was going to look up  His  Holiness 's telephone number, which meant Vat 69, or was going to pay his respects to the **British** Royal Family, which meant King George IV.

* There have been occasions, unfortunately, in **British** constitutional history when Governors-General have sought to act beyong their power.

* The GovernorGeneral chose to appoint somebody else to be 
When does the Government propose to block all further investment of **British**, United States and Japanese capital in Australian secondary and primary industries.

* Do not members of the Opposition know that the problem with the **British** taxation system after the war was that insufficient incentive to the people subject to that taxation system was allowed and while the **British** Government devoted itself to welfare in the years immediately after the Second World War, **British** growth was retarded right throughout the 1950s because that principle was forgotten.

* Need I remind Opposition members, after all, that other Labor governments - the **British** Labor Government and the Australian Opposition when it was in power - administered taxation but they did not administer it so as to assume maximum growth.

* income levels, it tries to claw back from those people, distribute it elsewhere and in fact commit the errors of the **British** Labour Government when it was in power for many years.

* What makes me so disturbed when I hear the Opposition speak of these things is that it does not seem to have learned anything from the **British** Chancellors of the Exchequer in the years 1946 to 1949 and in latter years.

* It would be necessary to refer to the **British** Department of Health and Social Security for advice as to whether sickness benefit would be payable in the circumstances mentioned.

* What examination has the Department of Primary Industry undertaken of the impact of **British** entry into the European Economic Community on all Australia's exporting industries.

* The eminent **British** sociologist,  Dr Raymond  Pahl, once stated: 
**British** veterans in receipt of Australian Service Pensions are eligible to receive Pensioner Health Benefits on the same basis as Australian veterans.

* They were, however, forced by the **British** to include a provision in the Constitution providing for certain limited appeals.

* In fact, in answer to a question on 9 May I placed on record the fact that he was the  deputy  to  Sir Robert  Mark and **British** law prevents the  deputy  taking over as Commissioner.

* The **British** system of a constitutional monarchy with its centuries of continuity was naturally and inevitably passed down to its colonial peoples.

* Another aspect of the Bill about which I want to comment is clause 5, which is a list brought up to date of Commonwealth countries whose citizens have the status of **British** subjects.

* **British** subjects who have been resident in Australia or New Guinea for 5 years - providing no crimes have been committed which render them liable to deportation - may merely notify their desire to become Australian citizens.

* Registration whereby a migrant with the status of **British** subject or an Irish citizen who is eligible to be granted a certificate of citizenship may be granted if he satisfies the Minister This may become effective without an oath of allegiance being taken in any public naturalisation or - as the Bill now describes it - citizenship ceremony.

* The Government feels that this is particularly necessary, for many **British** migrants are under the mistaken impression that their United Kingdom background and their long residence in Australia automatically confers Australian citizenship upon them.

* If I have earlier in my speech spoken on the non-**British** migrant and his second-class citizenship, it would be a serious omission on my part if I did not indicate that the interests of the **British** migrant are safeguarded in this Bill.

* The **British** migrant will reap the full benefits of the new proposals.

* If comparatively few **British** migrants have in the past sought Australian citizenship either by notification or registration, we as Australians have only ourselves to blame.

* Whilst we have, accorded non-**British** migrants citizenship under the official Commonwealth orders and ceremonies, we have left the **British** migrant to be welcomed by Good Neighbour Councils and other non-governmental bodies.

* Can we wonder that some **British** migrants have looked a little wistfully at our citizenship ceremonies and have wondered why they were not encouraged to participate in an oath or affirmation of allegiance.

* At a time when the **British** Government is revising its immigration rules the **British** migrant to Australia expects a clear and definite revision of Australian citizenship.

* That Australia welcomes all migrants as candidates for citizenship under common and uniform conditions for all countries will, I know, appeal to an inbuilt **British** sense of justice.

* The **British** Home Secretary,  Mr Robert  Carr, on 25th January in the House of Commons said: 
I must say that the very fact that we have announced that we are to make a review of the whole **British** citizenship laws is an indication that we think the time may have to come when changes will be needed.

* It is perhaps an interesting coincidence that the **British** Government and our Commonwealth Government have such proposals before their parliaments.

* We have exports prospects in areas such as Canada and Japan, but time is needed to enable us to develop alternatives to the **British** market.

* Did the prune industry lose $27,620 as a result of the decision of the Commonwealth Government following the **British** devaluation of sterling.

* Not only had European and **British** buyers been involved, but the Japanese during this selling season had been 'very ready learners indeed,' they had said.

* Those are the views of one of the **British** Labour Government's top and well known economists and advisers during its recent period in office.

* However 1 have asked my Department to obtain for me the results of the reported investigations by the **British** Government if these become available.

* Points in Australia - Biak or a point in Indonesia - a point in **British** North Borneo - Manila - Hong Kong - Tokyo.

* The **British** Radcliffe Commission had this to say about suggestions to substitute a complex of direct controls for the traditional controls over the money supply: 
-I do not want to sit down until such time as we get an assurance there will be an investigation into what money was paid, and honourable members opposite do not want that.

* I think the **British** Parliament has a higher standing.

* Suddenly the New South Wales Supreme Court has insisted on his presenting a certificate of naturalisation or other certificate to show that he is a **British** subject.

* For all this time he has thought that he was a **British** citizen.

* He has now found out that he is not a **British** citizen.

* 1 checked with the Department of Immigration and found that his name was included on the application for naturalisation, but due to a clerical error he was not naturalised and is not a **British** subject.

* It remains for the **British** Parliament to make a decision whether or not to accept the terms negotiated.

* The future policies on the **British** market are therefore of critical importance to many Australian agricultural industries.

* Clearly, we must face the fact that the favoured position we have enjoyed for so long in the **British** market will disappear.

* Over the years Australia has made known to the **British** Government, the Governments of the Member States of the Community and to the Commission of the EEC.

* I emphasised the point that some continuing access to the **British** market was needed during the transitional period in order to enable the Australian industries concerned to have time to adjust to the new situation inherent in Britain becoming a member of the Common Market.

* In my talks with the **British** Government, I concentrated my representations on the lack of precise provisions for the phasingout over the transitional period .of the access provided for Australian exports to Britain by our Trade Agreement with Britain.

* When the Australian Government had previously informed the **British** Government of its concern about the effects of **British** entry on Australia, we had been told that Britain would seek in the negotiations, for Australia's benefit, the longest possible transitional period.

* It was therefore with some considerable dismay that in Europe I found that, during the negotiations in May, the **British** delegation accepted an arrangement which, while affording a transitional period for **British** agriculture and for raising food prices in Britain, faces Australia with the pospect of possible immediate exclusion from the **British** market for some of our traditional exports and harsh consequences for many others.

* Up till the May negotiations, we had been told that the **British** were seeking a phasing-in of what is known as the principle of community preference.

* However, after the meeting in May, we were told that as part of the negotiations the **British** had agreed that upon entry to the Community - generally regarded as being 1st January 1973 - they would adopt the mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy and would apply in full the principle of Community Preference.

* Furthermore, **British** quantitative import restrictions, which give some assurance of access for outside suppliers of some products, would be terminated from that date.

* When I stressed the serious implications these provisions would have for Australia's exports of primary products, particularly for products like butter and sugar, the **British** pointed out that, in agreeing to the arrangements I have just mentioned, they had obtained from the Six an understanding in relation to a safeguard clause to be used in the event of a disruption or threat of disruption of the trade of third countries.

* The **British** Government asserts that the safeguard clause will be better from the point of view of protecting Australian trade interest during the transitional period than provisions for the gradual phasing-in of community preference together with a gradual phasing-out of quantitative restrictions.

* I made strenuous efforts to see whether changes could be made and I also expressed grave concern that we were told of the change in the **British** negotiating position only after they had agreed to the terms so that we had no chance of influencing the course of the negotiations on this point.

* I have already said that Australia could not claim, as New Zealand did, that her economy was dependent on continued access to the **British** market for one or two primary commodities.

* We have stressed that in negotiating the terms for **British** entry and afterwards, the members of the enlarged Community should see to it that the Community plays a full and responsible role in international trade matters consistent with its position of the world's largest trading entity.

* The **British**, whose market is still enormous, argue that when they and the other applicants join the Community, their influence will be felt by an acceleration of growth of the total Community and and that this in turn will have a stimulating effect on world trade.

* Though, as I have said, I have reservations about the effect of this union on world agricultural exports, and hence on ours, if the **British** are right then we as one of the world's big traders must be among the biggest beneficiaries.

* For that reason, since the major withdrawal of **British** forces from this area, Australia has entered into an agreement not only with the United Kingdom but also with other small countries of the region for our mutual security - the Five Power Agreement.

* What qualifications are required to apply for and be granted Australian citizenship by migrants from (a) **British**, (b) Asian, and (c) other countries?

* 1 ) Are United Kingdom qualified nurses accepted in all States of Australia, or are there some States which do not recognise **British** standards.

* What would be the Australian Government's attitude to the immigration of Rhodesians in the event of a negotiated settlement between the Smith regime and the **British** Government.

* This 80 per cent will not include usage in collecting refugees, as announced by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  this week; nor will it include usage for overseas personalities such as **British** royalty, heads of state from friendly countries and other official guests who come to this country.

* Has his attention yet been directed to the decision by the **British** Labour Government to withdraw **British** forces from this hemisphere?

* Finally, will he employ this parliamentary recess to prepare a proper defence plan for Australia to give us protection over that short term so that when the House meets on 1 1 
The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:  1 The number of Australian experts, advisers and consultants engaged on projects under the Australian aid programs in Fiji, Western Samoa, Tonga, Naw Hebrides and the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorates: 
Financial assistance for the 1974 conference was provided by the Highlands and Islands Development Board and the **British** Council.

* If so, what duties are they performing and, if personnel are located in Great Britain, are they releasing **British** soldiers for service in Ireland.

* Are **British** ex-servicemen receiving Australian service pensions entitled to the pensioner health benefits; if not, why not.

* In accepting the untried **British** Brooke-Marine 42m vessel with an unknown speed capability, rather than the proven 45m German Luerssen Went vessel with a known capability of at least 30 knots for the fourteen new naval patrol boats to be built in Australia, has the Government decided to adopt a simpler fishing protection vessel, rather than a comprehensive Naval patrol boat.

* I have read some of the debate that took place at Westminster in 1969 when the **British** Parliament voted for the abolition of the death penalty.

* In the House of Lords debate the Archbishop said: 
How many of the passengers referred to in Part (3) were carried by (a) Qantas and (b) **British** Airways.

* **British** Labor Prime Minister Callaghan finally woke up in 1976, but too late for him, when he said: 
Efforts to plug up the cracks in the system by attempted filching of manpower from the **British** Services have produced nugatory results, but at considerable public expense.

* This practice was introduced 2 years ago, and up to the middle of this year fewer than 40 **British** officers had been enticed from their home Service.

* On the face of it, recent pay increases plus general conditions and benefits for married men seemingly make engagement in the **British** Services a superior proposition to the rundown in conditions of service in Australia.

* There needs to be a development of benefit; for servicemen's dependants and for retired servicemen and their dependants along the lines of those available to the United States and **British** Services.

* It has been said before in other ways and I repeat now that the Government, as  Mr Samson's  letter indicates quite precisely, is totally opposed to any form of socialised medicine which even approximates the oft cited - but not often enough cited - **British** example.

* The two reports were prepared by officials of the **British** Government which has applied the classifications in both cases.

* Payment of Repatriation Pensions to **British** and Allied Ex-servicemen  (Question No.

* 2966) 
Is he able to say what is the classification and employing agency of each member of the **British** negotiating team.

* Cost benefit studies which were carried out in 1972 by Political and Economic Planning for the **British** Family Planning Association established that averting the birth of an unwanted child saved in public health and welfare services alone $1,350 in the case of a child born fourth in its family, $1,510 in the case of a child born fifth in its family and $8,728 in the case of the illegitimate child.

* Can he name any other Commonwealth country which expressed the same attitude as Australia's to the **British** proposal to sell arms to South Africa.

* All our **British** tradition was trampled underfoot by the Prime Minister.

* According to my recollection, the number of **British** settlers who will arrive in Australia this year under the United Kingdom-Australia assisted migration programme is at least 68,000, which is slightly fewer than the 73,000 for the previous year.

* However, this figure should certainly be assessed against results over a wider period of time as there have been considerable fluctuations in the intake of assisted **British** settlers over the past decade.

* This, of course, is a most complex situation which does not lend itself to simple elaboration, but if one assumes that the pull factors, that is, the conditions in Australia, have remained constant, some of the factors which have influenced **British** thinking in relation to the downturn would be marginal improvement in economic conditions in Great Britain, the prospects of Britain's entry .into the European Economic Community, a very good summer in Britain in 1969 and the difficulties which many **British** people who wish to come to this country are experiencing in selling homes quickly.

* Certainly the Government is concerned at any diminution in the assisted migration programme from Great Britain because **British** migration has been, and we would wish it to continue to be, the cornerstone of our immigration programme.

* I can assure the right honourable gentleman and the House that we are most vigorously prosecuting our migration programme in the United Kingdom to ensure a greater flow of **British** settlers to this country.

* We need more **British** settlers, and as an indication of the positive steps which have been taken I would instance these facts: In the first place, the number of regional offices has been expanded over the years.

* This is quite remarkable when one considers that this is a nation which needs as many friends and as many buyers it can possibly get, particularly at a time when there is the threat to our trade of **British** entry into the European Economic Community.

* Is a Canadian of **British** birth to be appointed permanent head of the Department of Transport.

* On what occasions, in what form and with what result have consultations taken place between Britain and Australia on the political future of the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate.

* A United Kingdom statute, the Foreign Enlistment Act, in force since 1870 and applicable to the **British** dominions, dealt with enlistment by **British** subjects in foreign forces but in terms inappropriate in today's circumstances.

* The reasons given by the Committee for this view were: 
1 ) Is Australia a member of the **British** Phosphate Commission; if so, by whom is it represented.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of **British** exporters for whom marketing rights in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original **British** technology?

* What are the names of the present Commissioners of the **British** Phosphate Commission.

* Last year the **British** Government set up an inquiry: 
Electoral Registrar is not satisfied that the claimant is a **British** subject.

* **British** Government to seek any changes to the Crown as an institution.

* Have you the status of a **British** subject?

* My question which I direct to the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerns Kampuchea, Are reports that the **British** Government intends to move in the United Nations' Human Rights Commission for an investigation into alleged atrocities in Kampuchea correct?

* If so, will Australia support the **British** move?

* One article in particular draws attention to the **British** committees, one of which has the rather dubious title of PESC I do not know whether it is regarded as pesky but is initials are PESC it being, I think, the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.

* Those larger economic enterprises have found themselves to be much more vulnerable to control both by the central government and by **British** trade unions.

* Paul Johnson, previously editor of the **British** Labour weekly, the  New Statesman,  laid out very clearly his own dissatisfaction with the **British** Labour Party for these reasons and also indicated quite clearly the ultimate intention of the **British** Labour Party in regard to small business.

* The **British** Empire was built on the lower end of the Laffer curve and dismantled on the upper end.

* Taxes were low from 1816 to World War I, the age of **British** commercial dominance.

* The **British** Conservatives have acquiesced to punitive taxes, and conservative Republicans in the United States have only recently embraced tax reform.

* **British** Consul-General in Hong Kong  (Question No.

* 3211) 
Has his attention been drawn to a report in "The Australian' of 7th April 1971 that a Government spokesman said after question time the previous day that the Prime Minister had given a very high security classification to the communication received through the **British** Government on the sale of Australian wheat to China?

* Has his attention been drawn to statements by Western Australian secessionist leaders that the question of secession should be settled within Australian jurisdiction and not **British**, and drawing attention to the Australian Government's statements that the **British** Parliament has no right to decide Australian issues; if so, will he clarify the situation.

* washings from **British** service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1 957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh Airfield for cleaning and maintenance.

* In port- 1969  Leslie J. Thompson;  1973  **British** Bombadier,  1976  Cellana;  1978  P. J. Adams.

* As to the second part of the honourable gentleman's question, I did have long discussions with  Mr Rippon  about the conditions of entry of the **British** into the European Economic Community.

* Is he able to say whether married officers of the **British** and United States Armed Forces are provided with married quarters in which all furnishings down to cutlery are provided by the Government.

* What are the words of the oaths taken or affirmations made by members of (a) the Federal Executive Council, and (b) the **British** Privy Council.

* The original Whitlam Bill was so sloppy that, for instance, a **British** widow could have resided here for a bare 12 months, qualified for an Australian pension and then quit the country taking the pension with her.

* The current **British** rates are $13.15 single and $21.25 married and although some additional means-tested assistance is also available, its pension is treated as part of taxable income.

* Some people say that an adult in our Constitution means what it meant in Britain when our Constitution was enacted by the **British** Parliament in 1900.

* Therefore I would urge the Government, gracefully and promptly, to give voting rights to those citizens, just as such citizens will have that right in this year's United States elections, as they have had in the **British** and will have in the Canadian elections, as they have had in Papua New Guinea, as they have had in Western Australia as they will have in every future South Australian election.

* As the **British** Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Harold Wilson, said on 2 February: 
Furthermore, the United States Administration is still of the mind that votes at 18 years of age should apply to the United States Congress.

* The forthcoming **British** elections will see votes for all of 18 years of age.

* Adding definitions for 'broadcast', 'broadcasting station', 'televises' and 'television station'; providing for a substitute Assistant Returning Officer at a place outside Australia when the original appointee is temporarily absent; providing for the Minister to engage persons to assist the Distribution Commissioners and to fix the remuneration and allowances to be paid to Distribution Commissioners and persons engaged to assist; by substituting 'Given name' in lieu of 'Christian name' in respect of enrolment and voting; substituting 'Status of a **British** subject' for '**British** subject' in respect of qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature; enabling the Electoral Registrars to correct the roll by altering the address of electors in the case of renumbering or re-naming of any building, thoroughfare, locality, etc.

* Can he supply details of the recommendations of the **British** Library Association on standards of library provision in colleges of technology and other tertiary colleges.

* At this very time the **British** Government faces a dilemma over the siting of the third London airport and this has arisen because of an earlier decision to ignore the recommendations of an extensive inquiry and locate the airport 55 miles from the centre of London at Foulness, primarily to appease the great pressures being applied by persons and organisations whose principal concern was not in finding the best site, but rather in ensuring that their local interests were not disturbed.

* Now the **British** Government is faced with a growing realisation of the enormous economic implications of the earlier decision and the probability that an airport constructed at Foulness would be a very expensive white elephant.

* This provision will be similar to the provision in the **British** Act and will not be along the lines of the somewhat old-fashioned and cumbersome methods .

* From which **British** Commonwealth countries has the Department recruited marine surveyors.

* But I can say to him that I am seeing  Sir Mortice  James, the **British** High Commissioner, on this matter this afternoon and the honourable member would know it would be quite discourteous for me to deal with the question - 
The then Minister wrote to me on 6 July last year and informed me that while Queensland traffic regulations specified that replacement windscreens should be made from non.shatterable transparent material, it is in fact the practice of the administering authority to require the use of safety glass which conforms to current accepted standards.

* while the glass sample you provided has been through a heat treatment process akin to that required to meet safety glass specifications, it does not meet United States, **British** or Australian standards for wind screen safety glass.

* Does he believe that this hallmark was exhibited in the Menzies years by the four Directors-General of Posts and Telegraphs who, on retirement or resignation, immediately became respectively Chairman and Joint Managing Director of the **British** General Electric organisation, Chairman and Managing Director of Standard Telephones and Cables Pty Ltd, Chairman of a commercial radio station and General Manager of the International Telephone and Telegraph organisation for our region?

* The **British**, a conservative society 1 suppose, but often most imaginative and adventurous in social exercises, have the open university.

* Civil Aviation Adviser to the **British** High Commissioner CML Building 330 Collins Street Melbourne, Victoria 3000 Telex 30660 
I suppose it might be said that there are two other Bills upon which we have had a cognate debate, one dealing with the Australia Council and the other with the Australian Film Commission.

* For instance, the title Australia Council was used on the analogy of the **British** Council and the Canada Council.

* 1 ) and (2) My Department has no detailed knowledge of either the health risks encountered by United States personnel or the monitoring procedures employed during the United States atomic weapons testing program and it is not possible to make a comparison with the tests conducted by the **British**.

* During the first debate in this Parliament on defence matters in 1901 a very distinguished member of the Parliament,  Sir George  Reid, observed to this effect: The strength of this nation and its interests will always be protected by the glory and the strength of the **British** Empire.

* Then, of course, for many years we did depend upon the corporate strength of the **British** Empire and then we did depend upon Britain and the United States of America.

* It says that in England the country that they look to most the **British** Labour Government should have taken over only the more profitable industries.

* So is this Labor Party going to tell the Australian workers that it is going to follow the **British** plan of nationalisation in such a way that industry becomes unprofitable and that nationalised industry becomes a massive drain on the national economy, thereby leading to unemployment, to stagnation and to depression?

* The World Health Organisation rates alcohol as the fourth largest medical problem in the world, and a White Paper of the **British** Parliament rates alcohol as the third largest killer of mankind.

* I would commend the Minister to look at the United Kingdom system and tell us when he responds whether the Government intends investigating the **British** system with a view to considering its application to Australia.

* **British** Petroleum owns 100 per cent of Clutha Development, a NSW collier, 49 per cent of the Clarence colliery and, for good measure, 50 per cent of Roxby Downs, one of the largest copper/ uranium mineralisations in the world.

* in terms of **British** justice.

* The great advantage of **British** justice has been the jury system.

* Is the Treasurer aware that this year the Brooke Bond company has been the subject of criticism by the **British** Prices Commission for overcharging on its tea by 30 per cent?

* The report alleged that there was bad management in the **British** shipping industry.

* Bearing that in mind,  8  of the  9  ships in this consortium are owned by **British** interest.

* I draw his attention to something that "The Economist' said on 25th March 1972 when commenting on the **British** budget.

* A billion dollars in the context of the **British** economy, sluggish as this one is, would be something like $2 50m in the context of the Australian economy.

* The Forum also requested me to take up with the **British** Government later in my visit the question of French tests in the Pacific, since that Government is responsible for dependent territories in the area including Pitcairn Island, the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and, in part, the New Hebrides.

* Of that 17 per cent 10 per cent are held by **British** interests, 6.3 per cent by American interests and 1.2 per cent by Asian interests.

* Many of the overseas personnel, both **British** and American, who have come there have become extremely good citizens.

* It is being developed by the Fiat Co. of Italy, the Messerschmidt Co. of West Germany and the 
**British** Aircraft Corporation.

* We can go to some parts of the **British** Isles - I will not specify which parts - and when we start talking to the population we are not sure whether we can talk English or whether they can talk English, but certainly we do not talk the same language.

* Migrants other than **British** migrants will not have a vote in Australia for 5 years after their arrival.

* To this end the **British** Government introduced fair rent1!

* The **British** Government provided a rent rebate or allowance for those who could not afford them and larger subsidies for local authorities with the worst housing problems.

* The **British** plan envisages a two to three month period of direct rule by a governor despatched from England pending new elections.

* It seems to me that the **British** proposals at this time are the most practical ones in all the circumstances.

* According to the **British** Bullock report, preparing a teacher for the passing on of reading skills should occupy at least 100 hours of training course time, and preferably ISO hours.

* But within the freight rates of that period was absorbed the cost of transporting the container cargoes from the Continent to London or to other **British** ports.

* The investigations over many long months had spanned not only Australian industry but also **British** industry.

* As this agreement operates at the moment, if the **British** Board of Trade had said that it could provide this machine in the United Kingdom, although the crop was not even grown there, our innovator would have had to pay up the 7i per cent.

* But the **British** Board of Trade said that despite the fact that their own people were using imported machines the United Kingdom could provide a machine.

* Where there is doubt as to the meaning of particular standing order we invoke the great historical work of Erskine May, which has been the guide for **British** parliamentary institutions.

* Originally it was a guide for the use of the House of Commons, but it has subsequently become the vademecum of the other countries which have accepted the **British** parliamentary system.

* We have not reserved our position in expressing our concern to the **British** Government in this direction.

* In the consideration of our defence responsibility and capability it would be unreal to place heavy reliance or, indeed, much reliance upon **British** involvement.

* There are the coming generations of those who will be born within the **British** Isles who will be influenced by new considerations and new convictions as citizens of a new Europe.

* I have never been asked to consent to a prosecution of **British** Petroleum.

* But it so happens- I think the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith ought to be aware of this- that proceedings against **British** Petroleum are afoot at present.

* The **British** Government stipulated the method of packaging and transport and supervised the packaging of the material to conform with its requirements for repatriation.

* There is one quite general question ... of supreme importance to the continuance of the rule of law under the **British** constitution, namely, the right of the public affected to know what that law is.

* The maxim that ignorance of the law does not excuse any subject represents the working hypothesis on which the rule of law rests in **British** democracy.

* I think that what is needed are the following requirements: We need increased quotas for Australian content - we should aim, like the Canadians, for 60 per cent; we need special emphasis to be placed on drama and the present 2-hour quota should be increased to 4 hours a week; Australian drama should  be  defined as that written, acted and produced by Australians; repeats should not be allowed to qualify as part of the quota and the clause that allows **British** Commonwealth productions to qualify" for 50 per cent of their time value as Australian content should be removed.

* Order of the **British** Empire (Question No.

* Has the Board ever examined or is it authorised to examine the cost and convenience of transferring some of the remaining departments, such as the Department of Works, the Postmaster-General's Department and the Bureau of Meteorology, to a mid point such as Albury - Wodonga, just as the **British** Department of Social Services has its headquarters not in London but in Newcastle-on-Tyne?

* We submit that this has given the Australian listener a wider variety of choice than either the American commercial enterprise or the **British** national system could provide.

* It is pertinent to point out that **British** radio only recently has gone commercial.

* Yes, the reports are correct and, yes, we will give strong support to the **British** move.

* Finally, as I confirmed at the outset of this answer, the **British** are pressing for an independent inquiry and we are supporting that move.

* The **British** system makes it clear that the popular House is paramount in matters of Supply.

* There has never been a suggestion that the Upper House should exercise such powers, and the proposed action, if successful, is against all the traditions of our **British** system.

* He referred to  Sir Owen  Dixon as: 'The greatest judge in the **British** Empire'.

* Sir Owen  Dixon is not just the greatest judge in the **British** Empire; he is the greatest judge in the English-speaking world '.

* At an international level both the United States and **British** governments have called for an inquiry into Steve Biko's death.

* Tt pointed to what it saw as deficiencies in those schemes, particularly in the **British** national health scheme.

* Anybody who has examined in any way the history of the **British** national health scheme will know that any faults in that scheme are clue to the 13 years of tory rule in Great Britain, during which a systematic attempt was made to bankrupt the scheme established by a Labor government.

* The Ord River project appears to be sick, our beef export industry is in the doldrums and we have lost the **British** contract for our sugar exports, although this may not be a bad thing for a while, as Britain will now have to buy at the world market price for sugar but only until the European beet sugar production takes over; and then what happens to our **British** market?

* We should be initiating matters with our neighbours in the islands of the Pacific, such as the **British** Solomons, Fiji, Tonga, the Cook Islands and all the rest of them.

* 1 ) How many Commonwealth policemen were stationed at Maralinga and its immediate surrounds over the period of the **British** weapons testing program.

* 1 think that it is about time we stopped wringing our hands and deploring such facts of life as the **British** withdrawal from east of Suez and the possible American reluctance to maintain a military presence in Asia.

* I believe that this is a carefully planned policy to contain China and, at the same time, to expand the Soviet influence into South East Asia as the **British** move out.

* The Minister has told us that as a result of an exchange of notes with the **British** Government the notice necessary for the termination of this Agreement has been reduced from 6 months to one month.

* The **British** authorities have agreed to that.

* It is not unique; in fact compensation provisions are quite common in **British** law.

* The letter, whether from our Department or the **British** Department, indicated that the proponents of Concorde, **British** Airways and Air France, had been asked to prepare a final environmental impact statement.

* They are **British** citizens.

* They have asked for reciprocal rights in respect of social services which other **British** citizens, such as those in the United Kingdom, receive.

* The **British** experience is now before us and it is one of the additional factors that we have to assist us in determining what we should do.

* We have watched the **British** experience.

* Recently in many vital respects we have been ejected from the sterling area, and the present **British** Government has given notice that in future it will adjust its exchange rate according to the vagaries of the **British** domestic economy rather than to international considerations.

* At present the annual cost to an Australian shipowner of employing an Australian able seaman is about $23,000 which is more than 200 per cent higher than the cost to a **British** shipowner.

* An Australian seaman enjoys 6 weeks more leave per annum than his **British** counterpart.

* The Extradition (Foreign States) Act of 1966-72 deals with extradition to and from countries other than those in the **British** Commonwealth.

* It provides for continuation of former **British** extradition treaties and authorises the Governor-General to apply the Act to any other foreign State by regulation where a treaty exists.

* The Minister for Defence also mentioned the 1968 report of the **British** Government's waste which remains at Maralinga.

* In signing a memorandum of agreement at that time the Austraiian Government sold out the Australian people's interest to the **British** Government.

* As head of the **British** Commonwealth, the Queen is a source of hope and inspiration to many people and it gives me very much pleasure to have this opportunity of expressing my continued loyalty to her.

* This is a challenge that the young people of the **British** Commonwealth countries must face up to.

* should now like to quote from a man who, al the time he made the speech, was the  President  of the New South Wales Branch of the **British** Medical Association.

* In 1961, referring to the manner in which hospital medical staff discussed all manner of things relating to the mechanical functioning of the hospital, he said: 
And this is not me talking, but the New South Wales President of the **British** Medical Association not so long ago -  in our system which, in my opinion, the profession must attempt to correct if we wish to avoid more direct government interference in the practice of medicine within ihe hospitals, lt is quite unrealistic for the profession to expect to avoid  nationalisation of hospital services if it is unwilling to assume its obligation to the community in this respect.

* We must also ensure that our community understands that the **British** influence, the old imperial concept, has finished and that we cannot live in the past.

* In order to clear up what is perhaps a misapprehension, I should point out that I did not make an announcement that we were attempting to lure more **British** migrants to Australia.

* I would say to those who have seen this as a call for more **British** migrants that this is not the case.

* Regarding the areas involved in the assisted programme, I can indicate to the honourable member that the reduction will be basically effected in the **British** programme where our operations have been inhibited .

* markedly by communication difficulties consequential upon the recent **British** Post Office strike.

* I refer to the case of the **British** Colonial Secretary, James Henry Thomas, in 1936.

* The resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was consistent with the Westminster tradition and **British** practice.

* All honourable members who have done any reading on the subject would know that the role of conventions in the **British** tradition of constitutional law is very great indeed.

* It is true that in the Australian Constitution which is in a written form, unlike the **British** Constitution which is in an unwritten form, the role of the conventions is not as great as it is in Britain.

* I refer to the statement of the **British** Labour Prime Minister,  Mr Harold  Wilson which he made to the **British** nation on 21 August 1975, 2 days after the presentation of the Hayden Budget.

* The **British** Government has directed all **British** operators to apply world wide a new limit of liability of approximately $45,000.

* Having spoken as he did at the conference about Great Britain it seems odd that tonight he should have attempted to make some belated sort of apology by saying that he did not insult the **British** people.

* After insulting the **British** people it does not seem appropriate of him to recall their stand during the war.

* For example, in June 1973 the Australian dollar was worth 3.5 deutschemarks, 379 yen or 55 **British** new pence.

* Only 6 months later the Australian dollar was worth more than 4 deutschemarks, 420 yen or 64 **British** new pence.

* Tonight I would urge that negotiations between the Australian and **British** governments be brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible so that we will not see such a lull occurring in the numbers not only of people coming to this country but of Australians travelling overseas.

* I would urge the Minister for Transport to ensure that the utmost pressure is put on his **British** counterparts to make sure that those negotiations are finalised and the fares come into operation as soon as possible so that there can be a real benefit to travellers leaving Australia but, most importantly, a very real increase in the number of foreign tourists coming to this land.

* I have pointed out previously in this place what **British** trade unionists, for example, have said.

* Joe Gormley, the well known and oft quoted **British** miners' leader said that an anti-nuclear energy motion would 'send us back to the jungle'.

* He said, in effect, that because of changing circumstances in the world, nine-tenths of the great **British** Fleet bad to be withdrawn to home waters in the United Kingdom.

* Some people say that the **British** policy of withdrawing forces from east of Suez is something sudden and new, but in view of what was said in 1910 I wonder whether that is the case.

* So far from section 4 of the Statute of Westminster delineating a new method of altering the Constitution of Australia the purpose of that section was to put to rest the fears that the then dominion governments had that the **British** Parliament might not have surrendered for aU time the right it had hitherto asserted to pass laws which had application to Australia and the other constituent parts of the then **British** Commonwealth.

* I can tell him that the 'Queen Elizabeth II' is fitted with it, as arc the Norwegian cruise ship, the "Oslo Fiord', the **British** Post Office cable laying ship, the 'Alert', and the **British** cargo ship 'Prominence'.

* In due course the **British** Government found it necessary to float the pound sterling.

* The **British** economy has been subjected to very real difficulties as a result of the statement made by the shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.

* I notice that the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  foreshadowed in his second reading speech that a provision would be introduced in the future to regard ex-servicemen of **British** Commonwealth countries as eligible for Service pensions after, of course, a continuous period of residence in this country.

* I have noted that the Minister said in his second reading speech that this matter will be looked at later, but I think that the Government would find it a little difficult to exclude them when it brings in such a provision for members of **British** Commonwealth countries.

* The historic position of the House of Representatives in the Australian Parliament and the House of Commons in the **British** Parliament has been that it has been the protector of the people against the excesses of the Crown.

* It derives its power from its exclusive right to approve the appropriation of expenditure, a right which was won from the Crown by the blood of members of the **British** Parliament, by a near revolution, and by the actual execution of one monarch.

* 8 **British** coaling station ' which was what Admiral Henderson conceived it should be.

* There was the chain of 10 bases where **British** ships could coal in their function of patrolling the world.

* There was an effective upward valuation of the **British** currency and, largely as a result of that decision, the **British** economy deteriorated during the late 1920s and unemployment rose.

* What appears to be the traditional **British** view on the relationship between Government and the police, of total independence from the elected government, is rejected in Australia.

* Yet we find  Sir Colin  Woods importing the **British** view into Australia.

* The honourable member will know that the former **British** Government had one policy in relation to this area and the present **British** Government has another policy on maintaining forces of the 3 arms in the Singapore-Malaysia area.

* The United Kingdom Minister for Defence has very speedily visited all the countries concerned, indicating the new **British** Government's views and seeking the views of Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand.

* The point that I intend to convey here is this: We have had the bad practice, I believe, of introducing fictions into **British** and Australian law to the extent that we follow **British** law.

* In fact, it was mostly concerned with criticism of the **British** Government because of its attitude to the Simonstown Agreement.

* I now think a lot of that criticism would have abated because it is clear that there is a legal obligation on the **British** Government to supply certain types of equipment to the South African Government.

* The **British** Government, of course, is a major shareholder in the **British** Petroleum Co. Ltd.

* Honourable members will better appreciate the real significance of the changes to our patents system proposed by the Bill if I explain that existing Australian patents law is founded upon principles developed within the **British** patent system at the time of the introduction of a national patent system in Australia in 1904- almost 75 years ago to the day.

* Additionally, those early reviews relied heavily on the reports of counterpart reviews of the **British** patents laws; again without regard to whether the results of those reviews were relevant to the specific needs of the Australian industry.

* Britain's patents laws have been amended to accommodate the needs of **British** industry in its new relationship with the European Economic Community.

* I point out also to the honourable member that this attempt to use the **British** parallel to emphasise his concern about costs is also groundless because there legal aid is provided essentially on the basis of the private profession.

* The **British** system is run today as is the system that applies in the Australian States.

* This Government has been unable to accept the position that what existed prior to World War II and subsequently- the **British** Empire or the **British** Commonwealth of Nations- has gone.

* Has he been advised that details of the very real ill treatment of these internees were published in the **British** Hansard in 1941, when the House of Commons discussed the 'Dunera' scandal at great length?

* Requirements for reconnaissance and search and rescue in the Malaysia/Singapore area after the **British** withdrawal and the division of responsibility for these tasks are amongst matters currently under consideration by staffs of the four nations concerned.

* Overall, there will be no requirement for additional support and communication facilities in the Malaysia/Singapore region following the **British** withdrawal.

* Some withdrawn **British** facilities will need to be replaced.

* Replacements will be mainly of manpower, as all four countries with forces in the area will use relinquished **British** support and communication facilities to the maximum extent practicable.

* The negotiations are expected to be finalised by **British** and Australian Ministers by June 1976.

* Some unfinished **British** trials will be completed during the run-down period.

* The Budget proposals should also encourage those who nourish the hope that one day a **British** Government will be persuaded to think along similar lines.

* It wants to copy the **British** scheme.

* When Aneurin Bevan introduced the **British** scheme he did not know what inflation was.

* Is the Minister aware of the difficulties being imposed upon the people of the New Hebrides by the failure of the French and **British** Governments to create a viable legislative assembly and to take effective steps towards self-government for the Territory?

* Will the Minister use whatever strength of persuasion Australia can muster with the French and **British** authorities to have a new constitution drafted granting adequate powers of self-government to the local people with new elections to be held as soon as practicable?

* Periodically, and prior to the start of its nuclear power programme, the **British** Government published white papers setting out its programme, the first being in 1955  -  Command paper No.

* When **British** power stations are proposed there is an option for public hearings prior to construction.

* I noted with interest an article which appeared in the  Canberra Times  of 3 March 1976 and which indicated that the **British** House of Commons' had passed a Bill making the wearing of seat belts compulsory and suggesting that that would save 1000 lives in the first year of operation.

* So the **British** Parliament is now catching up.

* However, the honourable member and any other honourable member who may be interested in seeing spy planes might watch at 8.30 tonight on Australian Broadcasting Commission television a film produced by the **British** Broadcasting Corporation called **British** Strike Command'.

* The **British** are going home, too.

* It is also proposed to change the qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature from '**British** subject' to 'Status of a **British** subject'.

* After years of struggle against marauding Arab bandits and disease, against the Turks and the **British**, against the indifference and prejudice of the rest of the world, we finally established a viable Jewish community in Palestine.

* The armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon launched a massive attack against our new nation that had been but a few hours before a mandated territory administered by the **British**.

* When the **British** departed in 1948 hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were forced, by the brutal Israelis, out of their homes and to flee for their lives.

* But the **British** market is limited by quotas, requiring restraint to be exercised by Australia, New Zealand and other suppliers.

* The quotas may have resulted in a reasonably stable price for butter on the **British** market, but returns from that market can scarcely be called remunerative.

* By that I mean migrants from **British** Commonwealth countries who are entitled to place their names on the electoral rolls without the requirement of citizenship.

* They have had to go through all sorts of exercises at that stage to get a **British** passport or they have had to become an Australian citizen in very short order.

* I instance **British** navies in the eastern Mediterranean.

* I noticed that he referred to a **British** Act, the Shipping Contracts and Commerical Documents Act of 1964.

* The **British** had to pass that in similar circumstances to protect themselves against, again, the United States companies in the antitrust position.

* Is it a fact that the **British** Government has opened all its  Duneera  records to public inspection.

* The simple fact is that what we were referring to initially was an alleged statement between the **British** Charge d'Affaires in Peking and somebody who was not what could be regarded as a member of the Government of the People's Republic of China but who was an official of one of the Chinese departments.

* But, as I have stated - and 1 stated it again yesterday - it was oral communication in Canberra as between the **British** official himself and representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* But the venerable **British** Tobacco Co., which was first incorporated in England in 1904, will do very well.

* The **British** Tobacco Co. made a net profit of $ 12.2m and paid a dividend of 14 per cent last year, and with between 20 and 25 huge properties spanning between 2 million and 3 million acres, it could be eligible for thousands of dollars from the scheme which was conceived, so we were told, to help the poor, struggling grower.

* **British** Post Office service, despite the establishment of a corporation, the loss in the last financial year was no less than $53m.

* I think we can all recall that earlier this year one of the most serious industrial disputes experienced in any postal service occurred in the **British** Post Office.

* For example, clauses 9 and 10 propose to change enrolment qualifications from '**British** subject' to 'status of a **British** subject', which is in line with related laws.

* Just to draw a comparison, although comparisons are odious, I would point out that last year the **British** Overseas Airways Corporation made a net profit of only a few hundred thousand dollars more than Qantas.

* Can the Minister inform the House whether any progress has been made in talks with the **British** delegation led by the **British** Minister of State in the Department of Energy,  Dr Mabon,  in regard to the supply of uranium?

* Were those talks affected by the outburst from the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition attacking the Leader of the **British** delegation?

* As we know, the **British** military presence in this area has diminished to a very great extent.

* The **British** are becoming very concerned with their entry into the European Common Market.

* In the early days of that scheme the **British** socialists, the equivalent of the Australian Labor Party, did not foresee that the cost of the scheme would rise so astronomically.

* The position in England today is that the **British** health scheme is being crippled and.

* The position is that Yugoslavs, like all persons ordinarily resident in Australia whether **British** or of any other nationality, are required to register for national service in the same way as Australians.

* However, in accordance with section 35a of the 
In relation to long-lived fall-out the situation is complicated by the fact that some parts of the very large injections of these isotopes by U.S., Soviet, and to a lesser extent **British** tests, are still appearing in Australia.

* The workload, of course, is primarily dependent on **British** requirements.

* The whole operation will require a great deal of administrative and technical planning and consultation with the **British** who are our partners in the Woomera project.

* What that means, because of the differential between the cost of Australian crews and, for example, **British** crews, is that the freight rate for coal would need to go up from $9 a tonne to $ 1 8 a tonne.

* The fact is that the cost of using Australian crews in this trade is 233 per cent higher than for using **British** crews.

* Labour Minister from the United Kingdom to place some affinity- although I am not too sure what affinity there is- with the Australian Labor Parry above the **British** national interest and above the national interest of the working people of the United Kingdom.

* The suggestion that the **British** Government would secretly supply nuclear material to Israel to build a nuclear weapon is scurrilous in the extreme.

* The previous  speaker  from this side of the House, the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Yates),  was a member of the **British** Parliament before coming to this country.

* It pleases me to draw to the attention of the House a decision of the **British** Government on 26 September to abandon the program of forced metrication.

* Since my announcement on 17 October that the Woomera range activities would be run down and instrumentation and facilities held in readiness for a revival, negotiations have been proceeding with officials of the **British** Government.

* These negotiations will determine the arrangements for the completion of some **British** trials which will run beyond the period of the present agreement and the level of maintenance necessary to ensure that in the event of a requirement of either country, the range could be reactivated without prohibitive cost.

* A study by the Mining Association of **British** Columbia has estimated that in 1973 a mining industry employment multiplier of 2.5 operated within that province and a multiplier of 7.7 within Canada as a whole.

* Malaysia at the very time when the United Kingdom Defence Minister was in those 2 countries beginning to work out the terms and conditions and circumstances in which there will be a continuing military presence of the three arms of the **British** Forces, arms which are welcomed very much by these 2 countries and by Australia as adding once again to the general security of the region and as continued acceptance of traditional **British** responsibility in this part of the world.

* It is far less difficult for a **British** migrant to be assimilated into the Australian way of life than it is for a non-**British** migrant.

* But under the present constitutional position the States are self-governing **British** colonies with Governors who are agents of the **British** Government as well as formally representing the Queen.

* For example, the **British** were said to believe that God must be an Anglo-Saxon.

* The similarities in the history and attitude adopted by both the **British** and Japanese deserve very serious examination.

* The honourable gentleman refers to the **British** Prime Minister and the German Chancellor of 1 939.

* 1 would simply say this: The **British** Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister were pragmatic people.

* Sir George  Godber, the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security in the United Kingdom, published a letter in the **British** 'Medical Journal' of 18th November 1972 in which he stated:   the number of legal abortions has increased greatly but seems to be reaching a more stable level.

* The background to this is that the **British** held a lease from the Malaysians and when the **British** wanted to move out of Malaysia the lease was handed back to the Malaysians.

* In a reply to a question I put on notice, on 13th September the Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  said: 
As I informed the right honourable member in my answer to a question on notice which was reported in Hansard for 1 9th September, the original inquiry was held by the **British** Government and not the Australian Government.

* Those records are held in the **British** archives and I have no mechanism by which they oan be made available in our archives.

* A United Kingdom statute, the Foreign Enlistment Act, in force since 1870 and applicable to the **British** dominions, dealt with enlistment by **British** subjects in foreign forces but in terms inappropriate in today's circumstances.

* The reasons given by the Committee for this view were: 
November regarding agricultural subsidies in the European Common Market and following the **British** Prime Minister's recent statement regarding agricultural price support, can the Minister inform the House and Australian rural producers what are the chances of Australian farm produce gaining easier access to European markets in the foreseeable future?

* As is admitted by the architects of the scheme which Labor seeks to introduce in this country, it is fundamentally an amalgam of the **British** and Canadian schemes.

* I did notice that the Leader of the Opposition expressed the view that the Australian Government should have protested to the **British** Government or expressed some opposition to the **British** Government's considering the provision of maritime arms to South Africa under the Simonstown Agreement.

* Periodically, and prior to the start of its nuclear power programme, the **British** Government published White Papers setting out its programme.

* When **British** power stations are proposed there is an option for public hearings prior to construction.

* If he had the qualifying period in the United Kingdom before he came here, as many of these people have, he would be entitled to draw a **British** pension as well as an Australian pension.

* He would be entitled to draw the two because the **British** pension, being a contributory pension, is of the nature of property.

* I do not believe that that is the method of governing for which the **British** parliamentary system stands.

* I believe the **British** parliamentary system means that a series of departments will be directly responsible to the Ministers, and the Ministers will be charged with the responsibility for seeing that certain points are put before the Government.

* Another main group of amendments relates to visiting **British** ships .

* Part II of the Act deals with crewing matters, and until recently was in line with similar provisions in the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act, with both laws applying to a visiting **British** ship whilst in Australia.

* It will be with us for ever, as the **British** socialised health scheme is with the **British** people, as are the schemes that exist in Canada and New Zealand.

* Is it not a fact that the **British** had a ship in the area?

* Is it not a fact that the **British** Government took readings?

* From the correspondence that I have received during the course of the last few days the **British** Government has seemed to me to be taking this matter very seriously and to understand the position taken by the Australian Government.

* So far as I am able to ascertain, the **British** Government is anxious that the special relationship between the 2 countries should be sustained.

* Mr Rawlings  demanded the difference between the Australian and **British** rates and placed bans on the ship.

* The payment was refused by the **British** crew who were already on a bonus system considerably more beneficial to them than the differential payment which had been demanded by  Mr Rawlings.

* Earlier policies based on an intake of migrants predominantly **British** had been abandoned but **British** migration was still seen as the dominant element in the migrant intake.

* Factors taken into consideration by the Committee were: quantities specified in similar legislation overseas; quantities of each particular drug which were seen to be consistent with personal use; where no other information was available SO times the maximum therapeutic dose shown in the **British** Pharmacopoeia.

* Great Britain has had during the past 24 years, 17 years of Conservative government and 7 years of **British** Labor Party Government.

* Britain's economic problems have continued for years under both political parties- the honourable member for Kooyong knows this full wetland the major reasons for the **British** voters throwing out the Heath Government was the economic chaos that had reigned early this year and during 4 years of Conservative rule.

* In 1972, before my Government was elected, two of the State governments asked the **British** Government to recommend to the Queen of Britain that this question be referred to the **British** Privy Council.

* During the last war, for instance, multinational corporations which built machines of war in America built machines of war in Germany for use against the **British** and American nations.

* The essential difficulty lies in translating into the second half of the twentieth century a code that was devised in the second half of the nineteenth century -our Bills of Exchange Act 1909-1958 is still essentially the **British** Act of 1882 - and, furthermore, a code that is primarily concerned with the elaborate ritual of the nineteenth century merchant doing business with bills of exchange rather than with the modern business use of cheques.

* Such a comprehensive review has not yet been attempted in any of the countries of the **British** Commonwealth; their legislation is still based on the **British** Act of 1882.

* It deals with the arrangements between the **British** and the United States publishers which make it very difficult indeed for the main sections of the Australian publishing industry.

* It centres on an arrangement whereby an American publisher sells the copyright to a book to a **British** publisher.

* I quote from  Mr Max  Harris's article in which he sets out the kind of damage that this does to the industry: 
It became almost a law of life that Australia could only purchase **British** editions, and that Australia could only publish nationally books of Australian authorship.

* That does not stand for the Order of the **British** Empire; it means outside the **British** Empire.

* He goes on: 
But the **British** system is one of united blackmail.

* The **British** Publishers Association will not, by private joint agreement, purchase copyright just for the U.K.

* The reason for the dedin; of **British** trade unionism has not been any original sin among either ordinary or leading **British** trade unionists.

* The fight was for a **British** Commonwealth title.

* One contestant came in under the Canadian national anthem while the other, an Australian, came in under the **British** national anthem.

* This is the message which came by Lord Halifax, the **British** Ambassador.

* In return for the offer of Lend Lease, an agreement to be signed which was not acceptable, the **British** spokesman said: 'We are unwilling to barter Empire preference for planes, tanks, guns, goods, etc., because of the political repercussions which will result with Empire members'.

* Twenty-eight years later, we have another emissary, this time of a recently elected **British** Government, coming to Australia and telling us in no uncertain terms that the moment of truth has arrived, that we are now mature, that we are standing on our own, that we are big boys and that we are well and truly able to fend for ourselves.

* Deputy Chairman of the **British** Steel Corporation, at an international conference on steel technology in Tokyo a couple of weeks ago.

* With Britain entering the Common Market, ifI know the **British** worker and skilled tradesman, be will not accept the economic consequences of Britain's entry into the Common Market.

* 1 do not want to reflect in any way on the Continental workers who will have the right to enter Brtiain, but the **British** worker and skilled tradesman will not welcome the competition from the Continental worker.

* A very substantial proportion of the **British** population will want to get out of the country.

* I am glad that the honourable member for Holt has made that observation because, contrary to many comments made about the **British** health scheme and its cost, in total terms the cost of the **British** health scheme is not as high as that of the Australian health scheme or the American health scheme.

* It is of further interest to recall that when the Australian Constitution was passing through the **British** Parliament and the external affairs power was under discussion in the House of Lords, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Earl of Selborne, said: 'I want to assure my noble lords that the existence of this provision'- that is the external affairs provision- 'does not indicate that Australia will ever have a paraphernalia of ambassadors and consuls separate from the **British** Empire.'

* (9A) Where it is proposed to engage for employment under this section a person who is not a **British** subject, or a person who is a **British** subject but is also a national of another country, the Minister may, after a report from the Board and if it appeals to him that the employment of that person would not be prejudicial to the national security, the preservation of official secrecy or any other interest of  the Commonwealth, determine that the last preceding sub-section is not to apply in relation  to  the engagement of that person.

* The reality of the Government's Budget is that it will lead Australia closer and closer to the **British** disease.

* In any case, the Australian Labor Party is not advocating the **British** health scheme.

* We have a rather distinct scheme and an approach different to that of the **British**.

* The **British** position has been quoted a great deal.

* Towards the end of last year  Sir George  Godber who is the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health and Social Security in a letter appearing in the **British** 'Medical Journal' complained that there has been selective and incomplete quoting from his report on maternal deaths.

* It is claimed in that country that an injection of another Stg500m is needed to save the **British** health scheme.

* It is also claimed that this amount of money will only get the **British** scheme back on to its knees again.

* He was one of my tutors in the days when I was a student in a subject called **British** History D. The last term of **British** History D was devoted to all that was taught in Melbourne University of Australian history.

* I have been provided with some figures by Professor Barbara Shenfield, a distinguished authority in the field of national health in Great Britain, who says that the **British** national health service was estimated to cost 170m a year.

* Official statistics say that the present **British** health scheme, which is very similar to this proposed scheme, now needs an additional 500m to be pumped into it immediately as a bare minimum to prevent the service from breaking down completely.

* It houses a number of economists, social scientists and political scientists who are working on a lot of the subjects that are being dealt with within the **British** Treasury, the **British** Department of Health and the Department of Social Services.

* In listing the matters of which he would divest himself, the Prime Minister singularly failed to mention one longstanding anomaly dating from the days when William Morris Hughes persuaded the **British** Government to allow him as Prime Minister to communicate directly with the **British** Prime Minister and absolved the Australian Governor-General from reporting to the Dominions Office.

* I have not heard a single argument for a generation why communication with one country should be through the Prime Minister's 
As 1 understand it, reports did appear in the London Press and reappeared in the 'Northern Territory News' that the **British** Government was exhibiting an interest in obtaining parts of Arnhem Land for establishing a base.

* Now, I wish to point out to the House that, whilst the Australian Government has a very keen interest in facilitating the **British** staying east of Suez, immense difficulties would arise with such a proposition.

* Her  Majesty, in declaring the conference open, welcomed all delegates to London and to Westminster Hall, the birthplace of **British** parliamentary institutions.

* Speeches of welcome were also made by the Prime Minister and the  president  of the **British** group, the Right Honourable Harold Wilson and the  president  of the Inter-Parliamentary Council,  Dr G.  S. Dhillon of India.

* Of course there was a time when the Australian Labor Party used to like to refer to Britain and say when the **British** Labour Party had done something 'that it was a marvellous thing.

* Looking at the state of the United Kingdom economy at present-rit is under a **British** Labour Party- it is strange that we do not seem to hear that argument today.

* I ask the Prime Minister Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of **British** exporters for whom marketing rights in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original **British** technology?

* The **British** Phosphate Commission went before the Industries Assistance Commission and, from the Commission's evidence, it is quite plain that the extra cost of Australia having an Australian manned ship in the superphosphate trade will be $6.5m to superphosphate users throughout Australia.

* The **British**-German-Dutch centrifuge consortium has staled that if a **British** or German tender for an enriched uranium fuelled plant is chosen for the Jervis Bay project the consortium would make arrangements whereby Australian uranium might be enriched in Australian plants.

* Has the **British** Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at any time transmitted through the Commonwealth a suggestion that Commonwealth forces should keep order in Rhodesia during a period of transition to majority rule and for some time thereafter?

* Section 137 of the Customs Act which was made law in 1901 presently provides for the payment of duty in **British** currency.

* Does the Australian Broadcasting Commission intend to establish a Complaints Commission comparable to that which operates in respect of the **British** Broadcasting Corporation; if so, when.

The **British** people love the Royal Family as their own and honour them for what they are - a wonderful example to each and every one - through war and peace.

* -I ask the Attorney-General: Is it correct that the court in Paraguay which refused extradition of the Bartons did so because it did not consider that the **British** extradition treaty with Paraguay applied to Australia?

* Do we rely on **British** treaties for extradition procedures with a substantial number of other countries?

* Was the decision to begin construction of the Australian boats made before the **British** prototype was launched and proved?

* Let us examine for a moment some of the criticisms that have been expressed in relation to the development of the **British** health system.

* The **British** health system has been the victim for some 20 to 25 years of vigorous hostility from people who have come to this country and from honourable members on the other side of the House who see in this scheme some insidious evil Socialist force which will overwhelm the good health of the community.

* The national health scheme in Britain was one of the great contributions to **British** society.

* There is no doubt that before the last war **British** health services were inadequate and their hospitals were inadequate.

* The health of the **British** people on the lower incomes was at a very low level.

* So said Lord Hayter, who is leading the **British** Hospital Equipment Trade Mission to Australia, in Melbourne .

* The average working class man who arrives in Australia with his family is struck by the inordinate costs of social welfare in Australia both in the field of education and in the field of health, lt would pay honourable members to make a study of the advantages and disadvantages of the **British** medical service.

* An article which I have before me points out some achievements of the **British** national health service.

* Seventy per cent of Australian-born and 70 per cent of post-war non-**British** migrants were in favour and the majority of post-war **British** migrants were also in favour of the change.

* I refer to **British** migration, which has long been of great strength to our total migration programme.

* What is being done to generate a greater flow of **British** settlers to this country?

* In view of the statement by the Deputy Premier of South Australia that information made available to his Government regarding radioactive materials at Maralinga did not appear to be of such a nature that it should remain classified, will the Government now request the **British** Government to declassify all aspects of the Pearce report other than those details which would disclose security arrangements or the location of material which could constitute a public hazard?

* I refer the Prime Minister to discussions on the question of nuclear safeguards that the Government is having with the **British** Government.

* They were born in Australia, but they had lived outside Australia for many years and they are in breach of international law, Australia's laws and **British** laws.

* 1 direct a question to the Prime Minister as the Minister responsible for communications with the **British** Government.

* I ask: Did the Australian Government or the Australian High Commissioner in Great Britain suggest to the **British** Government, as has been widely alleged, that the provisions of its Immigration Bill should not apply to patrials - in effect, to persons who had at least one grandparent born in Britain?

* Also it is not suitable for connecting to the **British** Instantaneous Coupling, which is not a threaded coupling.

* The **British** Instantaneous Coupling is used in Western Australia and is also fitted to mobile appliances used by the Department of Civil Aviation and the Services Departments throughout Australia and by the Northern Territory Fire Brigade.

* For example, for the Ensemble Nipponia the Japanese Ambassador is invited; for the Royal Shakespeare Company the **British** High Commissioner is invited.

* The Minister referred to the original **British** idea and stated that such a committee presently operates.

* Representatives of the U.K. authorities have indicated that if Australia decided to use **British** enriched uranium reactors, arrangements might be made whereby the process could be operated in Australia at some future date.

* How far this would give Australia full access to **British** technology is not clear.

* The present **British** Government has the same system as our present Government has: it is motivated by the same philosophical approach of socialism.

* 1 invite the attention of the Pari Lament to the fact that the Government of New Zealand, another island nation, has seen fit to accept in total the provisions recommended by the **British** Board of Trade.

* Will the Prime Minister ensure that the Queensland Premier is advised in detail of the success of the Prime Minister's recent trip and the discussions that he held with both the Queen and the **British** Prime Minister as the only government leader entitled to speak officially internationally on behalf of all Australians, including the Queensland Premier?

* At this point I should like to recall to the House the threat to the very existence of large sections of Australian primary industry as depicted in the statement of the Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr McEwen)  to the House last week on the consequences for Australian trade of **British** entry to the European Economic Community.

* What was the outcome of the meeting on 19th October 1972 between the Australian High Commissioner and the **British** Home Secretary about the administration of the **British** Immigration Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by immigration officers at.

* It states: 
That is the **British** Departmenthave  asked that the proponents now proceed with the preparation of the final Environmental Impact Statement.

* Having studied the submissions received as a result of the procedure for public comments, we do not anticipate that any other than minor editorial changes to the EIS are required, and that subject to these editorial changes, the Draft - 
**British** Airways 7207 revenue passengers uplifted in Brisbane and disembarked in London on scheduled services, and for the year ended June 1976, Qantas carried 5052 and **British** Airways 7852 such passengers.

* He established his forces and he proceeded to suborn, subvert and destroy Malaysia in order to prevent the **British** from carrying out their program of bringing that country to an appropriate independent status.

* Finally the **British** had to remain.

* The immediate future will be very important because it is quite obvious that the **British** will be withdrawn from this region by the Wilson Government.

* The earlier problem, during the period from 1948 to the early 1960s, was met and dealt with by men of the calibre of Field Marshal Templer and significant numbers of the **British** armed forces, at enormous cost to the home government as well as to Malaysia itself.

* Is it the Government's intention to bring to Australia **British** trade union specialists in the field of collective bargaining to explain details of the **British** system to members of the Government and the Australian trade union movement.

* The **British** Medical Association in its evidence to the Latey Committee supported the view that adolescents today mature earlier than in previous generations.

* In order to put at rest this Press speculation and to overcome some of the uncertainty it has caused in the travel industry and within the Australian community, I have agreed, in consultations with the **British** Government, to outline today the indicative fare levels I am hopeful of achieving on the United Kingdom-Australia route.

* There is no firm agreement on this matter between the **British** Government and the Australian Government.

* Then, we had a man who was not a radical; as a matter of fact I think that he was a Conservative Member of the **British** Parliament,  Mr Malcolm  Macdonald, the **British** 
Commission'.

* The Prime Minister went on to mention that the **British** Government had borrowed from Arab sources.

* The **British** said in their statement- as I think it ought to have said- that borrowing negotiations were first carried out by the Bank of England and then the commercial banks, as agents carrying out their normal functions under the Bank's supervision.

* Over the weekend when being questioned by various interviewers I said that it would be necessary for the Australian Government to have discussions with the **British** Government on a commodity to commodity basis to see how the arrangements are going to affect the marketing of different commodities in Britain.

* We can clearly see how certain items will be phased out of the **British** market but in the case of other commodities the position is quite indefinite.

* We have not reached any conclusion on the phasing out arrangements in respect of many items now enjoying preference on the **British** market, and this is one of the matters that will have to be discussed more fully.

* However, the Government has not been inactive in terms of trying to divert trade away from the **British** market.

* We have a fundamental basis of science in the **British** tradition, without the population that has enabled Britain to develop a sophisticated technology around its science.

* In our opinion it imposes a quite unreasonable burden of responsibility on an accused which is contrary to the general principles of **British** justice.

* I am not saying that it is not a practice that is written into **British** law.

* It was clearly and properly pointed out by the **British** seminar on criminal conduct, at which all the experts discussed criminology in the fashion which criminologists would be prone to discuss it, that they had left somebody out of their considerations.

* We apparently inherited the **British** method of building a very substantial prison structure.

* It should be noted that comparable cost data are available to the **British** Government and that the cost of penicillin in Australia is  2i  times that in the United Kingdom.

* Briefly, it is the provision of repatriation benefits of various sorts for **British** ex-servicemen.

* The gravamen of those representations from  Mr Winstanley  to myself was to the effect that repatriation benefits should be made available to **British** ex-servicemen.

* He said: 
The- **British** authorities have pointed out in the past that they would nor consider any arrangement which would result in varying rates of pension and other benefits for their ex-servicemen in other parts of the world.

* The **British** authorities had expressed the view that they would not countenance any system that would give differing benefits to their ex-servicemen who were in the United Kingdom or who had migrated to one of the Commonwealth countries.

* However, subsequent to that I attended, by invitation, a meeting of the **British** Sub-branch of the Returned Services League.

* 1 want to express to the Committee the tentative conclusions to which I have come about this matter of the provision of repatriation benefits for **British** exservicemen.

* Concisely stated they are as follows: In the first place, it seems that the whole approach of looking at repatriation benefits for **British** exservicemen on the presumptions that the Minister expressed to me and which previous Prime Ministers have expressed, is, with respect, wrong.

* I suggest that it is not a proper approach to consider what the **British** Government expects its expatriates to receive in repatriation benefits or any other form of social service benefit.

* **British** migrants settle in Australia.

* They make their homes here and many of them become Australian citizens, lt seems to be unreal that we should be shackled to any direction or request by the **British** Government as to what benefits should or should not be received by **British** migrants, especially those who have become Australian citizens.

* I would suggest that the proper course is to look at the position of the **British** exserviceman in Australia to determine what are appropriate benefits to give him, regarding him as an equal for this purpose to an Australian born ex-serviceman.

* If that is done benefits such as war service homes loans and service pensions should be available to **British** ex-servicemen as much as they are available to Australian exservicemen.

* If one uses the basic test I have suggested - that is, that we look at the exserviceman in Australia to see what he should or should not be entitled to in the light of Australian conditions and standards - the proper question to ask is why should **British** ex-servicemen not be entitled to war service homes loans and war service pension.

* To put this aspect of the matter concisely, I think it is time we imposed an Australian test for entitlements of exservicemen and not some direction or request from the **British** Government.

* The next point that should be made is that **British** ex-servicemen in Australia far from being at an advantage over their compatriots who remained at home are at a positive disadvantage.

* Firstly, they do not have the benefits of the **British** free medical and hospital scheme that they would have available to them in the United Kingdom, in their capacity as ex-servicemen.

* As an ex-serviceman in Australia the **British** migrant is on the same footing as an Australian who is not an ex-serviceman and who has to participate in the contributory national health scheme.

* Secondly, if he is receiving a **British** war pension the rate of his pension is not based on the realities of Australian conditions and prices, although he is living under them, but on **British** conditions and prices.

* In particular, devaluation must mean that he is now getting less value for his **British** pension than he got before devaluation.

* Thirdly, the **British** ex-serviceman in Australia does not have the advantage of appearing in person before a repatriation body or appeal tribunal.

* Although the Australian Repatriation Department acts as agent for the **British** war pension authorities, and although this is obviously a benefit and a useful service, the immigrant does not have the advantage of personal appearance before the body that decides his pension entitlement or the opportunity that goes with that advantage of being able personally to describe his condition and of enabling the tribunal to assess the exserviceman's case by seeing him in person.

* It would seem to me that the **British** exserviceman in Australia is at a disadvantage in these respects when he should not be.

* The loss suffered by the **British** ex-serviceman has been suffered through no fault of his own and it seems to me that there is at least a prima facie case for some compensation, especially for those **British** immigrants who have taken out Australian citizenship or otherwise evinced an intention to settle permanently in Australia.

* Secondly, could not the agency of the Repatriation Department be extended by agreement with the **British** authorities to use the Australian machinery for the examination and determination of claims in Australia with an undertaking by the **British** authorities that the decision reached by the Australian body will be final and binding on the **British** body?

* I would go further and say that such a reform would give the **British** ex-serviceman the advantage possessed by his compatriot at home of personal appearance before the body that makes the decision on his case.

* Likewise, the **British** soldier fought not only for Britain but also for Australia.

* Secondly, the **British** ex-serviceman in Australia is taxed to provide finance for, amongst other things, war service homes loans and service pensions.

* I know he will not lake any exception to my raising them on this very appropriate occasion because it seems to me that the interests of **British** exservicemen deserve that these views be expressed and that some recognition should be given to the representations and work of the **British** Sub-branch of the Returned Services League for what 1, at least, consider to be a desirable end.

* 1 ) How many seats are offered at the  new  Apex air fare rates on (a) Qantas and (b) **British** Airways on services operating from Brisbane and Sydney to London?

* He is using this for personal motives in a way that, is utterly unscrupulous and utterly foreign to the traditions of the Australian Parliament or any **British** Parliament.

* Did he discuss the subject with any leader, minister or official of (a) The **British** Government and (b) the United States Government.

* Did the Indian Prime Minister request that he support the objective of a zone of peace and neutrality in the Indian Ocean with (a) the **British** Government and (b) the United States Government: if so, did he do so.

* I believe that we will have to move to the **British** position in relation to nursery schools.

* Its health care scheme will do to Australians what the **British** Labor Party's health scheme has done to the **British** people.

* He is a doctoran administrator- at one of the leading **British** hospitals.

* He said: 
The **British** scheme was starved for funds because of the economic climate.

* The shortage of money, together with the **British** Government 's reorganisation of the scheme on a regional basis, had caused chaotic conditions.

* This is what that kind of health scheme has done to **British** medicine.

* As with the **British** scheme, we will find people queueing to see a doctor, not knowing which doctor they will see at the local clinic.

* However,  Sir Samuel  Griffiths' decision was at variance with the **British** Admiralty definition of the Talbot Islands.

* In 1942 at the request of the **British** Prime Minister, the late  Sir Winston  Churchill, Lord Casey assumed the position of Minister of State for the Middle East and had the rank of Cabinet Minister in the **British** War Cabinet.

* In the Government's view, should Uganda still be regarded as a member of the **British** Commonwealth in good standing?

* The other point about this matter is that because these teachers are not **British** subjects they will be denied a number of rights which cannot be backdated to the time of their joining the service.

* The Leader of the Opposition reminds me of the **British** political leader who confessed: 'There are two problems in my life.

* The honourable member for Lilley has already drawn attention to **British** Labour attitudes to indirect taxation.

* One of the things that was added in the **British** context of indirect taxation was a thing called the selective employment tax.

* The lack of it was, I submit, al the base of the decline of the **British** economy.

* Furthermore, last year Qantas and **British** Airways alone agreed to the current $850 advance purchase excursion fare to London.

* It is designed to change a system of compensating people for injury which has been long established within the common law jurisdictions of **British** speaking nations.

* Dr Bennett was referring to the **British** airline industry.

* Taking into account different crewing requirements and different rates of pay, we find that for every $1 spent on a **British** seaman on a **British** merchant ship, the equivalent cost for an Australian ship is $3.60.

* Even the costs of crewing Scandinavian ships, whilst these are twice as much as for **British** ships, are only SS per cent of Australian crew costs.

* It is also doing something for the **British** monarchy and doing great things for the parliamentary system.

* The **British**, bound still by so many bonds to Australia - bonds of history and kinship - are not altogether surprised at the behaviour of the new Whitlam Government.

* The first thing I want to say about clause 17 is that it reproduces a piece of legislation which the **British** have seen fit to repeal and not replace.

* Do we think that we have a state of revolution in this country which the **British** do not have?

* 1 ) When the visa requirement for entry to Australia was extended on 1 January 1975 to include all **British** and Irish citizens the Government gave special consideration to the facility available to young Australians to make working holiday visits overseas- mainly to Britain.

* 1 ) The **British** preferential margin could be eliminated by reduction of the general tariff rate for about 700 items.

* The **British** preferential margin could be reduced by reduction of the general tariff rate for about a further 100 items.

* Both **British** preferential and general tariff rates could be eliminated for about another 100 items.

* I was referred to the House of Commons Hansard for 3 April this year in which the Secretary of State for Social Services,  Sir Keith  Joseph, is reported as saying - witta what I think is called typical **British** understatement - in reply to a question: 
-The first part of the question has been answered at length by my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs.

* One of the things that annoys the Opposition, I think, is that it realises that the Prime Minister, in a speech in February of 1969, made a commitment on behalf of Australia for the support of the regional defence in the Malaysian-Singapore area, believing then that the **British** were going lo withdraw their forces from the area.

* Now, with a change of **British** Government, we have a direct bonus from this Australian initiative announced by the Prime Minister - the return and the maintenance of **British** forces in this area on a continuing basis.

* There are literally dozens and dozens of people coming to Australia who do not have the great good fortune to be **British** subjects.

* The electorates comprising the inner suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne contain in the schools thousands of customers who are not **British** subjects and it is quite idiotic to have this proviso in the Bill.

* Does the Australian Navy have its own reconnaissance to monitor these movements, or are the statistics supplied by **British** or United States or other reconnaissance.

* Has he any information as to whether Soviet, American, **British**, or any other satellites also sweep the Indian Ocean area in regular orbits.

* As a warning to them I would like to quote from an article in the 'New Statesman' of 31st July 1970 headed 'US Lesson for **British** Doctors'.

* It states: 
**British** doctors who rail against increasing assaults upon their professional freedom by government and other interfering and uninformed outsiders often look longingly towards the US.

* The lesson is still predominantly conservative **British** medical profession- 
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Jnr, the United States Chief of Naval Operations, gave testimony to the Sub-Committee of the Committee on Appropriations in the United States House of Representatives on 15th March 1971.

* In particular we look at the **British** position.

* The **British** Government has rejected the sort of attitudes expressed by the Australian Prime Minister.

* no intensification, of the forces already used by the **British** Government in this area.

* We should remind the Fraser Government that the **British** Labour Government, like other enlightened governments in Europe, has sought the co-operation of the trade union movement, not confrontation with it.

* It consulted with the **British** trade union movement and entered with it into a contractual agreement which has become known as the social contract.

* In return the trade unions acted with restraint and patience in a time of economic difficulty and the **British** Government made concessions which recognise the great burdens borne by those workers.

* Similarly, some years ago the United Kingdom amalgamated its publicly owned airlines **British** Overseas Airways Corporation and **British** Empire Airlines to form the present airline BA or **British** Airways.

* My Government will continue its  efforts  in this field, and is at present negotiating with the **British** Authorities to maintain Australian beef exports, and to safeguard Australia's rights and interests, in the United Kingdom market.

* The Malaysian Government leased the site to the **British** Government.

* The **British** Government pulled out and, under the terms of the lease, the whole base returned to the Malaysian Government.

* The **British** Government has returned this base to the Malaysians along with $12m worth of Australian investment.

* He cannot be expected to oversee every detail but for the general policy and administration, by **British** Parliamentary convention, the Minister must and should bear responsibility.

* It is also appropriate to observe that the insurance industry in this country- the life section of industry as well as the underwriting section of the industry- operates somewhat in the **British** tradition and that in that tradition it has always had a very proud history.

* That is perhaps best examplified by the fact that when well known European consultants were asked to depict the best and worst aspects of **British** industry for viewers on the European continent they chose as the worst industry, for one reason or another but not due to personalities, the **British** shipbuilding industry, which had run into immense and enormous difficulties for a variety of reasons, and they chose as the best industries operating in the United Kingdom from an economic point of view the city and the insurance industry.

* What he said about the EEC has been repeated officially by  Mr Rippon,  by the **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Heath,  and by  Sir Alec 
Only  say that if the Prime Minister has returned home to Australia in a happy frame of mind at what he achieved in the United Kingdom with respect to the Common Market and what  Mr Heath  and  Mr Rippon  told him he must have been treated as a sucker, because there can be no question, as I will illustrate later with one commodity only - sugar - about how he has been taken for a ride in the commodity field by the **British** authorities.

* Britain succeeded in inserting a safeguard claude last June that would allow the Community to take special action in the case of sudden dislocation of **British** markets.

* This was stated officially by the **British** Government last June yet the Prime Minister came into the House tonight and repeated this almost word for word as something new.

* He made the point that the future of **British** preferences in Austrafia will be a bargaining point when Britain enters the Common Market.

* This agreement has meant that **British** goods have a differential as regards the tariff.

* This is logical and there is nothing new in it 
Let me now illustrate how seriously the **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Heath,  and Britain's chief negotiator,  Mr Rippon,  really treated the Australian Prime Minister - the close co-operation that the Prime Minister mentioned.

* This was made a firm understanding following the talks between the senior commercial adviser,  Mr Donovan,  and **British** officials during the time when the Prime Minister was in London.

* Last Tuesday in the House of Commons Britain's Minister for Agriculture,  Mr James  Prior, said that Australia's share of the **British** sugar market would be phased out after 1974.

* The situation is that after the Prime Minister's visit to London the position with respect to sugar has worsened, not improved, if the statement by the **British** Minister for Agriculture to the House of Commons can be believed, and there is no reason why it should not be believed.

* Apparently the Prime Minister's attention has not been drawn to the statement by the Minister for Agriculture because if it had been he would not have made his statement tonight about assurances from the **British** Prime Minister and  Mr Rippon  concerning bilateral agreements and co-operation with Australia.

* Such attacks have been deeply resented by the **British** Government as well as by the 6 European Economic Community nations.

* I think that the Leader of the Opposition might have gone back a little further in his resume to the initial statement made in this House on behalf of the Government when the decision was made to retain Australian troops in the Singapore-Malaysia area, even after the withdrawal of the **British** forces.

* At the moment the 5-power arrangements which were drawn up and which were the subject of a communique issued in London differ from the previous arrangements under which **British** and other troops were stationed in that area.

* Previously, the **British** had the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement which was quite definite and quite specific that they were required to take certain action in certain circumstances.

* would have no parallel in the **British** Commonwealth of Nations.

* It is no good including in a second reading speech reference to the fact that this Bill replaces some aspects of **British** law going back to  1300.

* **British** and American trade unions will abate no fraction of their right to strike.

* There was no outcry over the former **British** territory of Socotra at the end of the Red Sea being used for training operations for Russian naval personnel.

* There seems to be a great effort by these propagandists to assist our enemies to prevent the **British** operating from the naval base at Simonstown.

* I believe we are following our **British** traditions in doing these sorts of things.

* Hong Kong is a **British** Crown Colony.

* There is no **British** Consul-General in Hong Kong.

* It is concerned about the slight devaluation of **British** currency last year, and many people have advocated the payment of compensation.

* It has come about because of previous policies on the **British** Government in Britain's former colonies, which brought in outside work forces to develop a country.

* One sees it in Fiji; one sees it in Mauritius; and one sees it in **British** Guiana.

* When she is acting as Queen of Australia, are her appropriate advisers the Australian Government or the **British** Government?

* The second factor, I think, is the visit by  Dr Mabon,  the **British** Minister who distinguished and contrasted sharply the approach taken by the **British** Labour Party and the **British** Trade Union Congress with that of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian trade union movement.

* As is so often mentioned, Great Britain intends to withdraw from east of Suez, It will return its troops to the **British** mainland as we all know.

* But 1 have no doubt whatsoever - and 1 say I have no doubt because of discussions which 1 had back in 1968 at Westminster with leaders of the **British** Government and Opposition - that Britain has no intention of turning her back on this area of the world when this area of the world, including Australia and New Zealand is in trouble.

* This is where I return to the responsibility of this country to build and maintain necessary bases if we expect - and in fact we would expect - the **British** and others to be with us in any time of crisis.

* Whilst in Britain following those discussions I also spoke with **British** Ministers and I was very pleased with the response I got.

* I think that the attitude of the **British** Government has been highlighted in the last few days by a speech by Prime Minister Callaghan, who openly came out and attacked the common agricultural policy, saying that there must be changes in three areas.

* These comments by the **British** Prime Minister are most welcome and I hope that they are being listened to by the member countries of the EEC, because some of them are hell-bent on a course which must ultimately lead to disaster, not only for themselves but also for other countries.

* However members of the **British** Insurance Association sustained a loss of $56.

* Has he sought the views of the **British**  and  Irish Governments.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and  Mr Speaker  would know, the Camerons have had a very distinguished historical involvement in the direction of the **British** monarchy.

* derived as it is from the Westminster system and the **British** Parliament that I should desire to speak on the value and importance of the monarchy to Australia.

* I expressed the view then, to which I still hold firmly today: 
Let me then canvass some of the history of the involvement of the **British** Monarch in the politics of the United Kingdom.

* There have been occasions this century when the **British** Monarch has been forced to become involved, in Britain, in matters of a politically controversial nature.

* In 1931 during the term of a **British** Labour government, George V was again required to be involved in a difficult political decision.

* The dramatic reduction was due principally to the **British** people blaming the Socialist Labour Party for the effects of the depression.

* It was George V who successfully sought to bring together the **British** party leaders to discuss at least the Irish question following the Liberal Government's Bill granting home rule to Ireland.

* This local example, with a **British** precedent, serves to highlight the advantage of the presence of a Head of State of the status of the Monarch or her representative.

* Students of more recent **British** history will have found mentioned in ministerial autobiographies instances wherein George VI is alleged to have raised procedural questions with his Ministers, and, when the response was based upon a firm and logical foundation, he accepted with good grace the ministerial view.

* **British** history has evolved a Monarchy divested of virtually all active influence in daily politics, but the Monarchy is much more than a simple expression of history.

* However, fair-minded people must be agreed that the 20th century has produced most acceptable **British** Monarchs The same cannot be said for all the 20th century Presidents of the handful of countries that I have mentioned today.

* Because we have as our Head of State the **British** Monarch, and we use the Westminister Parliamentary system, it cannot be fairly construed that we even remotely resemble a colony.

* 1 was saying that because we have had as our head of state the **British** monarch, and we use the Westminster parliamentary system, it cannot be fairly construed that we even remotely resemble a colony.

* This in no way implies **British** interference, because the governments of the various countries have the exclusive right to advise the Queen on their own affairs, and in our case our own affairs.

* But it has been observed: 
My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry and refers to statements by him that United Kingdom entry into the European Common Market means a drastic revision of the preferential rate of tariff applied to **British** goods entering Australia.

* I ask: In the interests of damping down inflationary pressure in the economy and as a measure of relief to the hard-pressed export industries, particularly primary industry, will he explain why the revision of the **British** preferential rate cannot take the form of applying this rate to all imports?

* Why is it that it must necessarily mean further increasing the price of **British** goods in Australia and almost certainly increasing the price of goods from other countries once these commodities are not compelled to meet the competition of the presently less costly imports from the United Kingdom?

* Thank God, the **British** journalist.

* Australia has adopted the **British** common law and I believe it gives the average person a better chance for justice than there is in any other country.

* The **British** principle of justice has worked better than the system of any other country.

* We have accepted the **British** common law.

* In the meantime are Maltese migrants with **British** status restricted to a residential qualifying period in the same way as are aliens.

* In all, the IAC found that the **British** preferential margin could be eliminated by a reduction in the general tariff rate for 690 items, that the **British** preferential margin could be reduced by a reduction of the general tariff rate for a further 115 items, and that both the **British** preferential and the general tariff rate could be eliminated for 94 items.

* We have seen how the less militant **British** Labour Party has wrecked Britain's economy and has failed to moderate the irresponsible extremes of trade union responsibility.

* The suggestion that the Chief Justice should seek the permission of the Prime Minister to carry out some act is totally at variance with 2000 years of **British** and subsequent Australian constitutional history and development.

* The Tribunal would have available to it the recent report of the **British** Monopolies Commission, which concluded that this drug is grossly overpriced in Britain.

* It would also be aware that the current price in Australia is high even by **British** comparisons.

* It could also consider the reports of the **British** Monopolies Commission in the past, particularly that into Glaxo Laboratories, which indicate that the standard justification for high prices by the big drug companies in terms of research effort is simply not valid.

* He worked with a **British** company even though he was an Australian.

* He is a man of whom the community should be proud because of the efforts he made to keep a competitive airline system in existence when the **British** interests and the Holyman interests decided to go out of Australia.

* It was the then government, the Menzies Government, which persuaded him to stay - 

 -Mr Speaker, I regard it as being an honour to commend to you and to the House the appointment of  Mr Philip  Ernest Lucock, Commander of the Order of the **British** Empire and the honourable member for Lyne, as the  Chairman  of Committees of this House.

* Did the Government complete its negotiations with the **British** Minister for Energy,  Dr Mabon,  before he returned home?

* I preface the question by saying that as a result of recent talks with **British** Ministers about the proposed entry of Britain into the European Economic Community one was given the very clear impression that such entry posed little or no problem for the great rural industries of this country.

* If it is a continuing representation, how has the current thinking prevailed in the ranks of the **British** Government?

* Finally, even at this eleventh hour will the Minister in his forthcoming tour point out with some vigour to the **British** Government that the rural industries of this country face grave danger, and in particular that the rural industries of my State of Tasmania, for example, could face ruin if Britain does join the EEC, which now seems very likely?

* For example the United States, with 170,000 miles of pipeline, is attempting to upgrade coal gas to raise its calorific contents from 400 **British** thermal units to about 1,050 **British** thermal units which is the average content of natural gas.

* I have taken out some facts by way of illustration of the work carried out by committees of the **British** Parliament in the last 2 years or 3 years.

* The Plowden Committee and the Duncan Committee reported on the reorganisation of the **British** Foreign Office.

* These are just some examples of the activities of **British** committees over the last 2 or 3 years.

* The Concorde is manufactured jointly by the **British** Aircraft Corporation and Aerospatiale, a French aircraft company.

* Twelve years ago, before the age of the passenger jet, the **British** authorities introduced at Heathrow Airport a maximum noise limit of 110 EPNdBs - the measurement of noise - for day movement and 102 EPNdBs for night movements.

* Years before this Government got around to instituting an inquiry into aircraft noise, the **British** Government had set up a committee on this subject.

* That committee had taken evidence, had produced recommendations and the **British** Government had acted upon them years before, as I say, we ever got around to such action.

* Some years ago the **British** Government established a post office trust fund similar to that established by the PostmasterGeneral and to which I have just referred.

* But the **British** Government went further and gave its post office the power to raise loans.

* The **British** experience did not solve the problem.

* Where the United Kingdom is represented and we are not, and it is not practicable to send in a consular officer, or the case needs continued attention, we have long turned to **British** representatives for consular assistance.

* I pay the warmest tribute to successive **British** governments and to the numerous **British** consuls, who have traditionally extended such assistance to Australians.

* Another area where obviously the Government is not taking any action but in fact is removing certain things is that covering the **British** preferential tariff.

* The **British** devaluation has in fact altered the relative position.

* As I understand it, the removal of the **British** protective tariff merely restores that country's position to what it was prior to Australian devaluation.

* Financial Times writer Samuel Brittan examines the **British** version of a similar compact and finds: 
Some 'monetarist' economists, while admitting that this is a theoretical possibility, deny that union power has been used in such a way, and claim that **British** inflation and stop-go episodes can be explained by other means.

* In return for the thinnest of hopes, based on the flimsiest of logical foundation, governments of different political persuasions have imposed a price control stranglehold on **British** business and have been afraid to tax either corporations or individuals at realistic rates and have gone in for policies of levelling downwards which must soon begin to show themselves in the immigration rates.

* I do not believe it appropriate for me to make a comment about the relations which the States, which are **British** colonies, have with the **British** Government concerning the award of **British** honours.

* The **British** Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, under which we sell at a very satisfactory price, ends in about two or three years.

* If Britain by that time is in the European Common Market and buying sugar made from beet on the continent of Europe, the highly desirable **British** market will disappear or will be enormously reduced.

* The Victorian State  President  of the Returned Services League was reported in the Melbourne 'Sun' of 15 January as saying that the Minister for Defence, prior to the election and when he was  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and spokesman on defence and repatriation matters, had informed the  President  of the **British** subbranch of the Returned Servicemen's League that if elected the Australian Labor Party would amend the appropriate Act to provide war service homes loans for **British** exservicemen resident in Australia.

* I ask the Minister: Did he make such a promise in writing to the  President  of the **British** sub-branch of the Returned Servicemen's League prior to the election and, if he did, when will eligibility be extended to this group?

* Compared to the new likely price of 19c per litre in Sydney, the French motorist pays 39c, the Japanese motorist pays 38c, and the German, Swedish and **British** motorists all pay over 30c.

* Many years ago Australia made an agreement with the **British** - hopefully it will conclude now that the **British** have deserted us - that we would impose tariffs which would enable the **British** to compete on the Australian market.

* The **British** Labour Party once proposed introducing such a tax and had to give the idea away.

* And to this crime I of course add the near simultaneous murder of no fewer than 18 **British** soldiers attempting to carry out their peace-keeping functions.

* Neither is it helpful to rake over the agonies of the problem's emergence from earlier **British** colonial history.

* He was the last of the **British** raj but he was also the most visionary and the most humane of the great Viceroys of India.

* The **British** influence in Indonesia, in the recent happenings in Bangladesh and in Malaysia - the **British** contribution there as part of the Five Power treaty that has been mentioned on several occasions is not insignificant.

* It is a pity that the **British** role has not been recognised in the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

* **British** Parliament in June 1969 had this to say: 
Can he say whether (a) the Spanish Government intends to set up a Government owned national uranium company, (b) uranium resources in Sweden are under the control of A.B.

* Atomenergi, a government organisation rather than a private company and (c) the **British** company, Nuclear Fuels Ltd, is wholly owned by the **British** Government.

* I move to certain aspects of history of the **British** Broadcasting Corporation.

* Until 1954 the Corporation enjoyed a monopoly of **British** television.

* That has been the experience on the **British** scene.

* Briefly, the article states that the  **British** Medical Journal  says that an apple a day may not be as effective as salted peanuts in keeping the dentist away.

* In view of the decline of the apple industry will the Minister have his Department investigate the  **British** Medical Journal's  outrageous suggestion and also check reports that the Premier of Queensland and the  President  of the United States of America have an undue influence on the  **British** Medical Journal?

* Has his Department initiated any moves to assess what procedures and methods are being used by the **British** and French Governments to deal with the oil spill and pollution of the coastline.

* Will the Government ensure that in the present world financial crisis Australia follows the strengthening **British** pound' and that it does not follow deflationary currencies?

* The **British** Government, I believe, has increased charges recently by about 35 per cent.

* The document from which I am reading is entitled  The Instruments of **British** Policy 1763-1765.

* The almost wistful commands of the **British** monarchy 2 centuries ago are spelt out there.

* That point had been put by me to the American and **British** authorities both in Australia and in Washington and London.

* The background to this is that in June 1958 the Australian Government entered into an arrangement with the **British** and New Zealand governments for contributions towards the cost of building the Terendak base.

* The **British** contribution was 54.1 per cent, the Australian contribution was 27.7 per cent and the New Zealand contribution was 18.2 per cent.

* The arrangement was that the United Kingdom held the lease from the Malaysian Government for 30 years but under that lease, when the time came for the **British** to relinquish the base, they handed the base back to the Malaysians; and that is precisely what happened.

* The **British** had the arrangement with the Malaysians, we had a rather extraordinary arrangement, with the **British** and so, when the **British** handed it back, our investment - the Australian taxpayers' investment - went lock stock and barrel to the Malaysian Government.

* Although Australia was the operational commander of the base, this base was returned by the **British** to the Malaysian Government.

* 32 **British** entry to the European Economic Community - Consequences tor Australian trade - Ministerial statement - Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate on the motion, That the House take note of the paper.

* In its conduct of the pipeline, the Authority would need to regulate most carefully the **British** thermal content of the natural gas which varies greatly from the different Australian production basins.

* I suggest to the Government that when it appoints these delegations it should look to the **British** system.

* For years the late Brigadier Ward- unfortunately he passed away after the Bonn Conference- was a tower of strength to all **British** delegations.

* Whether a Conservative government or a Labour government was in power, the members of the **British** delegations were appointed on the same basis as are delegations from this Parliament.

* I think it is time that we had a look at the **British** system of having one official permanently in attendance.

* Even the **British** Prime Minister has publicly recognised the positive value of national restraint.

* The whole of Texas was pretty well owned by **British** capital late in the last century.

* Indeed, only this morning in another article in the  Australian Financial Review  I noticed that  Mr John  Silkin, the United Kingdom Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries remarked on the fact that the EEC has sold subsidised butter to the Soviet Union at a price of about 47.5 pence a pound compared with 60 pence a pound paid by **British** shoppers for the same product.

* One would only hope that the statements by the **British** Prime Minister and the **British** Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries are registered by their colleagues within the European Community, for the price at present being paid by the European consumer is maintaining a generally inefficient and highly overpriced system of agriculture which unfortunately tends to react to the detriment of Australian primary producers and our whole nation.

* I commend the honourable gentleman for his sentiments and I hope that the efforts of the **British** Government will be successful.

* For example, in the field of automotive parts, forging and engineering, TRW of the United States of America took over Duly Hansford and **British** Leyland took over Pressed Metal Corporation.

* In textiles and footwear, Courtaulds took over the Hilton Corporation, 
Is the Treasurer aware that in his Budget Speech yesterday the **British** Chancellor of the Exchequer,  Mr Barber,  announced the abolition of the voluntary programme on **British** investment in Australia?

* What effect does he consider it will have on the level of **British** investment in Australia?

* Most weed killers are imported duty free from **British** Commonwealth sources; these are subject to a 10 per cent duty when manufactured in other countries.

* It is reported that the corporation is to be 50 per cent owned by the State Power Board and 50 per cent by private and municipal utilities, (c) **British** Nuclear Fuels Ltd, is at present wholly owned by the United Kingdom Government.

* I understand that the **British** scheme is working extremely successfully.

* In looking through the directory of the Commonwealth Universities Year Book I find that throughout the **British** Commonwealth - to use an out of date term - generally speaking universities have been pretty restricted in the kind of council structure that they have.

* He lost an argument with the **British** Trade Union Congress about an agreement he was seeking for, I think, a five per cent wage increase throughout the course of the year.

* Then the **British** Prime Minister, I believe with great courage in his environment, made it perfectly plain that since there was no wage restraint and since the fight against inflation was of paramount importance for his Government and, in the judgment of his Government, for the people of Britain, he would therefore have to take consequential action on fiscal and monetary policy to compensate for the fact that there would be less restraint in the wages area than he and the Government of Britain had sought.

* The Prime Minister of Britain was saying quite plainly to the Trade Union Congress and the **British** people that without wage restraint there would be reduced government expenditure and a tougher monetary policy.

* I think it would do our colleagues on the opposite side of this Parliament no little good to read the speech of the **British** Prime Minister and to note his courage and honesty in terms of the economic debate.

* One of my duties at the Parliament Street office was to collect monies received in London as a result of an appeal letter sent by  Sir Malcolm  Ritchie to prominent **British** companies and industrialists requesting donations for the Australian Liberal Party.

* WoodsideBurmah, together with **British** Petroleum, Shell and California Asiatic holds leases totalling some 143,000 square miles.

* It is beyond question - and I disagree with the previous  speaker  - the largest gas off-shore provinces in the world, an area larger than the **British** Isles or the **British** sector of the North Sea or the entire concessions in the Gulf of Mexico.

* The remaining interest is held by Shell, **British** Petroleum and California Asiatic with 161 per cent interest each.

* The Senate's objections to the present Appropriation Bills are not based on **British** precedent.

* Obviously the Opposition has no regard for **British** precedent or tradition.

* A former distinguished leader said he was **British** to the bootstraps.

* No parties are so anxious to throw **British** parliamentary tradition to the wind as are the Liberal and Country parties.

* It did repeal some legislation that the **British** lawyers have repealed and have not reproduced.

* Honourable members will be able to read this list and to see, for instance, that BP Australia Ltd which is 50 per cent owned by the **British** Government, owns 100 per cent of the New South Wales coal producing company, Clutha Development Pty Ltd, which is operating in the southern coalfields where it has reserves of 500 million tonnes in the Burragorang Valley in New South Wales and 500 million tonnes of reserves in Queensland.

* The 50 per cent ownership of BP by the **British** Government, means that Clutha is 25 per cent owned by the **British** Government.

* Here we have the position where the Minister, this Government and the back benchers, such as the last speaker, would utterly oppose the Australian Government having ownership in coal companies but they are quite prepared to see BP, which is 50 per cent owned by the **British** Government, own 100 per cent of Clutha, an Australian company.

* The honourable member may not know that when the Open University was established in the United Kingdom 1 am advised that the **British** visited the University of New England to gain experience or learn from the experience that that university had had in establishing quite excellent external studies courses.

* For present purposes, however, it is clear that, at least since the end of the 18th century (in effect, that is to say, throughout the whole history of **British** settlement in Australia) international law has recognised a belt of the open seas adjacent to the coasts of  Her  Majesty's dominions as being within the sovereignty of  Her  Majesty.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court, at the instance of the Federation itself in relation to the Province of **British** Columbia.

* 1 refer first to the unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, which 1 have already mentioned and which was given shortly after the **British** North America Act the exclusive right to control the off-shore mineral resources of Canada, .outwards from the low-water mark, belonged to the Federation, to the total exclusion of the Provinces.

* Electoral: **British** Migrants from Malta (Question No.

* 5798) 
I think the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  has made plain to the Committee the definition of a **British** subject as it appears in the Bill.

* Briefly, a **British** subject is a person who is a citizen of Australia or of a country specified in the Citizenship Act and the countries specified are countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.

* This provision is very much the same as the provision in the Public Service Act except that in the Public Service generally there is no exemption - one has to be a **British** subject.

* So, to the extent that we have moved away from that - applying the possibilities of exemption to the rule of **British** subject - we have met the inclinations of the Opposition.

* -We approach the **British** Government on many matters.

* He tells the story of how, when in the first Australian Imperial Forces he was serving with some **British** colleagues, he came across some **British** troops who, in the tradition of the **British** Army of that day, were tied to the wheel of a gun carriage as a form of punishment imposed on them by their officers of that day.

* I express no view on it other than that the **British** Army fought no better for following a policy of punishment of that sort than the first AIF fought following a policy that did not impose such punishment on its men.

* This has long been recognised by both Britain and Australia and I have agreed with **British** Ministers that, on the current timetables of accession to the EEC, UKATA will have to be terminated as from 1st February 1973.

* I have, however, agreed with **British** Ministers that the existing contractural benefits to both parties should be maintained up to that date.

* With this in mind, I announced on 28th July 1972, that it had been agreed under an exchange of notes between the **British** and Australian governments that, with effect from 31st December 1972, the required notice for the termination of UKATA had been reduced from 6 months to 1 month.

* The importance of the preferences accorded to Papua New Guinea and the former  or  existing **British** territories is also fully recognised and if, after examination, it appears to the Australian Government that some action is necessary in relation to those preferences, discussions will be held with the particular territories concerned.

* I also said that we had carried out investigations both through the **British** Charge d'Affaires in Peking and other avenues in order to ascertain his whereabouts but that the Communist Chinese resolutely refused to give any information.

* On the last occasion in October when we approached the **British** Charge in Peking we asked him if he could try to obtain verification of statements made of the possible presence of  Mr James  in Canton.

* We were also informed by the **British** that this practice is adopted when Britain's own citizens arc concerned and that they cannot get any satisfactory replies.

* The reason for this was that the Letters of Credence were incorrectly addressed to the  President  of Ireland in the form used by the **British** Government, that is, the form acceptable to Buckingham Palace for **British** Ambassadors.

* The **British** form is that the  President  of Ireland is addressed in Letters of Credence by name only his title not being mentioned.

* In 1958 the Australian and Irish Governments agreed to use a form and title of address different from the **British** practice.

* It was the **British** Consul-General I was writing to, I explain for the benefit of the -honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown),  who may not know where Hanoi is, being interested, as all young Liberals are, in keeping as far away from Vietnam as possible.

* If so, has he considered approaching the **British** Government to make appropriate amendments to the Act, since the Australian Government, Parliament and people cannot themselves effect such amendments.

* We must remember that it was essentially the **British** scheme.

* In the Dyason lecture delivered a few weeks ago at the University of Queensland Lord Trevelyan, a distinguished **British** diplomat, said he saw a growing role for Australia in the maintenance of a peaceful and economically viable South East Asia and that Australia's role in the region is bound to increase as Australia develops into  a  strong economic force.

* Because of the complex problems confronting most of the Asian countries, a **British** presence in Asia until the turn of the century is of major importance.

* I fully endorse the remarks of the Minister for External Affairs  (Mr McMahon)  when he stated in a speech in the autumn session of this Parliament that it would be a major misfortune for the region if **British** influence was withdrawn.

* Never before in times of peace has there been such need for a strong **British** presence in Asia, as Britain's tact and diplomacy in handling the troubled situation which occurs from time to time is urgently needed today.

* Most of the trouble spots we have in the world today - the Middle East, Africa and Asia - have only risen because **British** tact and diplomacy is no longer there.

* We believe that the requirements in relation to  a **British** subject are out of date and that some of these old Public Service requirements which we go through automatically in every Bill should be omitted.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to recent articles in various Australian newspapers stating that the **British** Foreign Secretary,  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home, has written a letter to a Labor backbencher,  Mr Leslie  Huckfield.

* Is the Minister aware that the way some of these articles are written suggests either that  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home was not aware of the criticism you had made of the apparent lack of **British** action to protect Australian interests or that you never made such criticism?

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports that the **British** Government is investigating the possibilities' of setting aside much more numerous and extensive non-smoking areas in public places.

* I would like to quote a couple of arguments for and against the 2 main types under consideration - the Canadian CANDU reactor and the **British** steam generating, heavy water reactor.

* a thick steel pressure vessel for the core is not required; access to centrifuge technology if **British** design is chosen.

* The **British** and New Zealand High Commissioners were similarly informed.

* **British** Force Reductions in Malaysia and Singapore - Britain has announced that her forces in the Mediterranean, Middle and Far East were reduced by a total of some 3,600 during 1970 and that in the financial year 1971-72 the strength of her Army Combat Forces in the Far East, including Hong Kong, would be some 5,900 less than in the previous year.

* Previously the company had made a reasonable profit in most years and in spite of company publicity that sperm oil is an essential substance the end came when the traditional **British** buyers of sperm oil failed to place advance orders.

* Whilst the **British** Department of the Environment did not believe that whale species were endangered, a junior Defence Minister announced in June 1978 that the **British** armed forces would no longer use sperm oil.

* The purpose of the devaluation allowance is no longer applicable because sales to the **British** market are only one-sixth of what they used to be and will be nil when Britain enters the European Economic Community in 1973.

* To give the lie briefly and decisively to the program which the Australian Labor Party would foist on the Australian community I quote again the words of the **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Callaghan: 
It might be noted that the importance of this cardinal principle of parliamentary operations has been recognised lately, it would seem, by the United Kingdom Government as well.

* We are all very much aware that through its long struggles the **British** Parliament has developed into 2 distinct Houses.

* As recently as last year the **British** Government was known to be considering proposals for this purpose.

* We are in excess of that and consequently the **British** Government has undertaken to give us guarantees that if there is any devaluation of sterling we will get the equivalent in undepreciated dollars.

* Estimates indicate that the operation of dedicated all-economy flights for APEX traffic would have a significant impact on the 20 services per week now provided by Qantas and **British** Airways between Australia and London with a possible reduction of the order of 20 per cent it the number of regular services to Australian ports, given the current levels of demand.

* Agencies involved include the **British** and US Armies, US Coast and Geodetic Survey, and US Defence Mapping Agency.

* In any event, I did quite a bit of reading in the public library in Brisbane, and one of the most influential documents I read was a report on this subject by the **British** Ministry of Social Welfare.

* First of all, as the honourable member for Reid said, the **British** Government, the **British** Aircraft Corporation and **British** Airways produced a draft environmental impact statement on Concorde operations in Australia dated December 1975.

* The **British** Government takes the same attitude to my Government as it took to my predecessor's government, namely, that the **British** Government regards the Australian Government as the government in Australia with which it communicates.

* On infrequent occasions safe hand couriers from my Department who would normally fly **British** Airways from New York to London have been upgraded to Concorde at no extra cost when their regular flight has been cancelled.

* It is interesting to reflect upon the fact that when the Australian delegation went to the United Kingdom 75 years ago to present to the members of the Imperial Parliament the draft of our Constitution the central point of contention between the Australian delegation and the **British** authorities surrounded the question of the Privy Council.

* We have retained the trappings of our **British** heritage while discarding the bones and sinews.

* Her Majesty's Judges, Australian as well as **British**, will ever be men of conspicuous ability and integrity, whose impartiality will not be prejudiced by their domicile- are not English Appeals heard in the House of Lords?

* But it was one of the principal arguments put by the delegation to which I have just referred that section 74, which is the present section in our Constitution, should be accepted by the **British** Parliament as it was presented in draft form.

* **British** authority had a contrary view.

* They objected to the prospect that this Commonwealth Parliament could legislate to restrict appeal to the Privy Council, and that was the great area of difference between Barton and Deakin and their colleagues and members in the **British** Parliament.

* The **British** Government went on to make this observation in reply to an assertion by the Australians regarding delay, confusion and uncertainty if the Privy Council were to be regarded as being at all times, for all practical purposes, the ultimate court of appeal: 
All must gladly and gratefully welcome the opportunity of having the final opinion of that illustrious tribunal  .

* ... On all general questions, including even some questions of a constitutional nature having a general import ... it must be recognised how much the tribunal has of late years done, and is daily doing, to stabilise and harmonise the fundamental law of the Empire, to find and enforce the basic principles of jurisprudence on which modern civilisation rests, and to assist the development of free institutions in the constitutional units of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations.

* But, of course, it is true that once the word of Caesar might have stood against the world: now lies he there, and none so poor to do him reverence The **British** Empire has faded from the scene and the **British** Commonwealth of Nations has found for itself a rather strange and a rather unidentifiable role in the history of contemporary world society.

* He was famous for some quotations which illustrated his view of the working peoplecelebrated comments like: 'Not a penny to the **British** bondholders while there is an empty belly in Balmain'.

* There is the hollow opportunism of the present Opposition trying to use the Senate as an instrument with which to strike down a Government, in the same way as Lang's opponents of those days used Governor Game through the **British** Colonial Office to strike down his elected government.

* The people in the South Sea Islands, who are mostly members of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations, feel that the number and the nature of the Australians in their cities and plantations cause more disruption to their society and economy than would the presence in our cities of some  Df  the vigorous English speaking people from their countries who wish to come to our cities.

* It knows that the **British** on a bi-partisan basis agree that they should withdraw their consuls if they are to have full diplomatic representation in China and from China.

* Has his attention been drawn to the motion carried by the Governing Council of the **British** 
Most of the people who came to the Island as adults had little formal education but have acquired useful skills as a result of their employment in the phosphate industry.

* The Commission employs the **British** Phosphate Commissioners to manage the mining and other operations and it is the Commissioners who employ the majority of the Asian workers on Christmas Island.

* Under the Christmas Island Act 1958, adults who were **British** subjects and ordinarily resident on the Island on 1st October 1958 could opt for Australian citizenship within 2 years of that date.

* The **British** scheme was undoubtedly their model, although of course it was adapted to Australian conditions and to Labor Party political prejudices.

* Remember, it was essentially the **British** scheme - it was entirely tax financed - but it was wrapped in tinsel to disguise its socialist origins.

* **British** ships carry Chinese and Russian weapons from Hong Kong and elsewhere to Haiphong.

* Menzies' contempt for the 'Gyppos' turned the Arab world from being a **British** sphere of influence into a Russian sphere of influence.

* The lack of surveillance provisions in the **British** Act largely resulted, I think, in the collapse of vehicle and general companies in Great Britain and this had after effects in Australia also.

* Since the **British** Act was changed in 1973 I have tried to get a similar provision put into both Federal Acts.

* The old **British** saying of export or die has been universally adopted.

* The second measure is that of **British** preferences.

* As the Minister said, Australia no longer has any obligation to preserve preference for **British** goods.

* There are two considerations involved here: Firstly, how abolition would affect **British** industry; and, secondly, how it would affect Australia, especially so far as inflation is concerned.

* He was not aware, when he first came into the country, that an exemption was given to **British** parliamentarians.

* No charge has been laid against him of having committed a crime against **British** law.

* The **British** Government has the right to take action against him under 2 Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament.

* The **British** Government has been told by  Mr Justice  Murphy, as he now is, that the Australian Government will co-operate fully with the **British** Govenment in extradition proceedings, even to the point that contrary to general tradition if a first application for extradition failed the Australian Government would not raise any veto against a subsequent application or applications.

* This is in spite of the fact that only very recently the **British** Government did raise a veto against an Australian application for extradition following a first unsuccessful application.

* Notwithstanding that, the **British** Government has been told that the Australian Government will not raise any veto against any number of applications for extradition.

* I wanted to know whether there was any truth in reports stating that the **British** Government would begin extradition proceedings against  Mr Stonehouse  unless the Australian Government first took action to deport him.

* I then told  Sir Morrice  that the Australian Government would co-operate fully with any request it received from the **British** Government.

* It is also true that the **British** House of Commons has not for many years expelled a member except where the member has committed an offence which attracts a penalty of 6 months imprisonment.

* It would not have eliminated the hijacking of the **British** aircraft on which Tshombe was a passenger.

* The International Federation of Airline pilots and its various branches - the American Airlines Pilots Association, the **British** Airline Pilots Association and our own people here in Australia - have been talking about imposing an embargo on flying aircraft to any country which does not penalise a hijacker.

* I remember one member of the Government of that time, who has since died, relating an incident involving a **British** soldier.

* He testified to the House that this **British** soldier had been charged with desertion.

* The **British** White Papers are weighted heavily towards special areas of defence policy and administration which have been the subject of special studies.

* In keeping tabs on this sort of material and giving precise information about the progress of special studies the **British** statement on the Defence Estimates and its supplementary statements provide excellent models for our Department of Defence.

* I hope we will not find the solution to our problem as the **British** did when they clamped down on everybody.

* The people of Papua New Guinea, the **British** Solomons, Tonga and all the rest - all the people associated with the South Pacific Commission, for instance - are people with whom we have to find a new relationship.

* It was 100 per cent **British** owned by the Villiers Corporation of the United Kingdom until the beginning of 1978.

* Then the **British** interest was bought out by Australian interests.

* The honourable gentleman referred to some criticism by the **British** Prices Commission regarding the pricing policy of the Brooke Bond company.

* I, for one, do not propose to take the view that, because the **British** Prices Commission may have made a criticism of a particular company, that ought to be accepted as holy writ.

* I have always been attracted to the **British** idea of an independent broadcasting authority.

* I believe that a 'single buying agency' should be set up, as was recommended in the 1973 report of the Tariff Board concerning motion picture films and television programs, with the exclusive authority to buy exhibition rights for **British** and foreign films, series and specials for Australian television.

* I believe this is something that Qantas has to consider seriously, because under the reciprocal agreement if Qantas flies from London to Australia via America the **British** Overseas Airways Corporation and other operators are entitled to come down this run.

* Members of the defence forces of **British** Commonwealth countries are now eligible for Service pensions providing that they have been resident in this country for 10 yean.

* Many **British** exservicemen who took their discharge in Australia at the end of World War I or World War II and who have paid taxes in this country for years ask why they cannot receive the benefits of a Service pension in the country of their adoption.

* Persons who have received pensionswhether they are Australian born or exservicemen and women from **British** Commonwealth countries- like other kinds of pensioners in the community will be able to take thenbenefits with them to some other country and retire there if they wish to do so.

* Mr R.  Blackman, a **British** naval expert, has described growing Soviet maritime power in this way 'What the USSR built in the 1960's looks like rising to a flood tide in the 1970s'.

* But prior to the end of  1939  they opposed the creation of the Second AIF, the **British** Empire Air Training Scheme and compulsory military service, and many and emphatic were the Labor speakers who assured the House that war was not imminent.

* The last time in Australia that a vice regal representative- it was a State Governor, a Crown Agent, in other words a **British** officialcancelled the commission of a head of government was in 1932.

* It is obvious that there must soon be a big development of the flow of unnominated **British** immigrants, who will have initial accommodation provided jointly by the Commonwealth and the States.

* An analysis of settler arrivals for the 5 years ended June 1972 shows that 50 per cent of all the settlers who came to Australia during this time were either Commonwealth or State nominees; a further 12 per cent were unsponsored migrants, mainly free flow' unassisted **British** settlers; and only 38 per cent of all those who arrived during the 5 years were privately nominated settlers.

* For my part, I think that we should be watching very carefully what the **British** Government is doing in terms of its throughdeck cruisers, the light aircraft carriers, because it seems to me that with our large coastline the Fleet Air Arm is something that we should preserve.

* I think that when we look at the facts of life as they apply we realise that we can do very little about the Russian presence in the Indian Ocean because the Russians aspire, as the **British** did in their day and as other nations did in .their day, to be a world maritime power.

* This morning on a broadcast of World Round-up by the **British** Broadcasting Corporation' I heard these words: 
What the honourable member for Hunter was saying what that there was a track record, a history and a tradition of double standards in the administration of justice in the New South Wales courts.

* These are the courts to which the people throughout the State go for justice, the courts in which the people have confidence, the courts of **British** justice in which the people have had confidence for thousands of years.

* The police officer will go home and blame **British** justice.

* In other words, we are helping the **British** by putting this money into these canneries and by subsidising canneries generally.

* For those who arc listening and do not understand what devaluation compensation means it means that the **British** devalued their currency - in 1967 to the extent, I think, of 14 per cent, and the Australian Government made up the difference between the price that the export commodity would have brought before devaluation and the price it brought due to this 14 per cent reduction in sterling.

* Both  Sir Douglas  Kendrew, a former Governor of Western Australia, who was the commander of the **British** Forces in Korea in the course of the Korean war, and Field Marshal Montgomery made the same point, that is, that if an outside nation wants to intervene successfully in Asia it must intervene on a peninsula.

* But as they were going through their manoeuvres, they had as their sonar operators greenhorn national servicemen- a thing which the **British** Navy would never have allowed to happen.

* Many years ago, in fact in 1951, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  in regard to a takeover by **British** newspaper interests of Australian newspapers and Australian broadcasting stations, stated that Parliament should establish the principle that organs of public opinion in Australia cannot be permitted to fall into the hands of other than Australians.

* This Bill has been brought before the Parliament before the Lane Committee of Enquiry into the working of the United King dom Abortion Act reports to the **British** Parliament.

* The **British** 'Medical Journal' remarked in an editorial on 20th January this year that many women have been misled toy pro-abortion propaganda to believe that an abortion is as simple and as safe as having a tooth out.

* The only estimate of costs that was available at that time was a report to the **British** Government suggesting that the cost of technical facilities, excluding buildings, would be of the order of $400,000 and the annual running cost would be $200,000.

* Recent reports on the Australian film and television industry indicate that there is probably no other country in which English is the common tongue which is so poorly protected against American and **British** imports of film as is Australia.

* In February I visited the **British** Oxygen Company in England which had developed a welding robot.

* Their consultants have virtually gone on strike and, according to the last reports, general practitioners were in the process of submitting to the **British** Medical Association their undated but signed resignations from the national health service.

* The position in the United Kingdom is so serious that the resident doctors at the royal medical colleges recently joined with the **British** medical faculties in warning that there was a real danger of standards declining to the point where recovery would be impossible within the foreseeable future.

* What provision has been made for reconnaissance aircraft and search and rescue aircraft in the Malaysia-Singapore region after completion of the **British** withdrawal.

* What additional support and communication facilities will be needed in the Malaysia-Singapore region aftercompletion of the **British** withdrawal.

* I had a long discussion with the **British** Foreign Minister about his proposed trip to Southern Rhodesia, and he was good enough to let me know of the proposals that Britain would be making and that they would be within the 5 points.

* From the information supplied to us by the colleges in their submissions for 1973-75, from additional information supplied by the Victoria Institute of Colleges for colleges in Victoria, and from evidence about average cast prices for books and periodicals obtained from colleges, universities and the **British** and American international price indices, it was calculated that a grant  of  the order of $9.25m would be needed, to remedy existing library deficiencies.

* If 1964-65 - admittedly this is a longer period than a triennium - is taken as a base of 100, for **British** adult non-fiction books, by 1970-71 the index was 222.

* We know that the Minister for Trade and Industry says that he made it patently clear to the **British** Government what was required for Australia to protect its interests when Britain goes into the European Economic Community, but we find now that there were no firm proposals from honourable members opposite.

* Are we to include the people of the **British** Isles as aliens?

* That is a departure from the traditional Australian view of our **British** ancestors.

* Most of us have descended from **British** people.

* I have descended from **British** people.

* Fiji - independent (formerly a **British** Colony) 
Tonga - Independent (formerly a' **British** Protected State) 
**British** Solomon Islands and Gilbert and Ellice Islands - **British** Territories 
How much longer can we afford to see these planes gradually drifting behind the performance of other nations' front line fighters?

* These were the army tank, where the choice lay between the German Leopard and the M65, and the Neptune long range reconnaissance aircraft replacement, where the choice lay between the United States Orion and the **British** Nimrod.

* I refer honourable members to the report presented to this House in August 1972 which said that other navies were producing ships of severely limited capability with very particular roles to fulfil, such as the patrol frigate being planned at that time by the United States as a mid-ocean escort with capabilities directly related to that task, and the **British** Type 21.

* Reference has been made to the decision of the **British** Government.

* The honourable member for Newcastle said that the **British** Government did the right thing and made the right decisions in view of the problems of the London (Heathrow) Airport.

* **British** Airways introduced their Jumbo service, their Boeing 747 service, into Brisbane.

* The Louvre, the Prado, the National Gallery in London, the Kunsthistorisches Museum, have never limited themselves to French, Spanish, **British** or Austrian purchases, or even given them any special 'priority'.

* I can only say for the Prime Minister that he is probably more familiar with these works than his appointed chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, who boasted in an interview in the  National Times  that he was familiar with the paintings in the **British** Museum.

* It will be necessary to have discussions with the **British** authorities on the future of the United Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement.

* In the course of those discussions what we will be looking at is the phasing out of the **British** preferences but we will be negotiating for the maximum benefit of Australian exports to that market.

* Whether the duty on **British** exports to this country will go up considerably or whether all other duties will come down correspondingly is not a matter that I want to prejudge at this time.

* The north west shelf encompasses an area of some 140,000 square miles; an area larger than the **British** Isles, or the **British** sector of the North Sea, or the entire concessions in the Gulf of Mexico.

* I have listened and watched with great interest in the last few days as suggestions have been made that the Committee of Privileges, because it was adopted from the **British** system at the beginning of the century, is completely unacceptable.

* Lord Jowitt testified that during the time that he was **British** Attorney-General, 95 per cent of all blackmail cases had a homosexual origin.

* Other instances throughout the world such as the assassination of  Mr Neave,  a member of the **British** Parliament, in the Westminster Palace grounds and the death of Lord Mountbatten more recently in Ireland give us in Australia no reason for complacency in this matter.

* The post-war immigration program means that the average Australian today has an ethnic origin of groups and nations all over the world and not the predominant **British** group as he formerly did.

* We had already been proceeding through the **British** Government and the **British** charge d'affaires in Peking but were unable to get any information whatsoever about him.

* For that matter, the **British** Government had not been able to get very much information about its own missing citizens either.

* To think that some person on the authority of the Minister can go all over another person's land and value it and that that person in the event of not being satisfied with the valuation has no right of appeal is, we believe, intolerable and not consistent with **British** justice.

* It will record that under the Order-in-Council of 1855 Norfolk Island was set aside as a separate and distinct settlement by the **British** Crown.

* It is well known to **British** descendants and well known to the people of Norfolk Island.

* The Australian Council of Trade Unions could learn a great deal from the responsibility exhibited by the **British** Trades Union Congress.

* There is one thing which I think the **British** trade union leaders have had very much in mind: They are concerned not only for their members who have work but also for the unemployed in Britain.

* For example, the former **British** Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Labour Government.

* It is demonstrable in the United Kingdom that under the **British** Labour Government the proportion of households existing at a poverty level, taken from an analysis of the Fabian Society, increased and ended up at a level between 11 per cent and 14 per cent depending on the type of analysis.

* It was A. J. Balfour, a conservative politician in Britain, the man who later led the defeat of the **British** General Strike in 1 926, who said: 
I draw to the particular attention of honourable members that section of the report dealing with the activities of the sub-committee during its visit to Westminster and Ottawa.

* The committee was led by evidence taken in Australia to believe that certain committee systems, in particular the system of the Expenditure Committee of the **British** House of Commons and the Expenditure Committee of the Canadian House of Commons, ought to be instituted in our own Parliament; but the on-site examination of the operations of those expenditure committees showed that in reality their functions and activities were quite different from what our Committee had been led to believe they were by evidence given to it.

* At this stage I would like to express on behalf of our Committee, our thanks to the Presiding Officers, members and staff of the **British** Parliament and the Canadian Parliament for the substantial help, assistance and courtesy extended to the sub-committee during its visit.

* The Australian Constitution was the product of the **British** Parliament, the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in 1 900.

* At such time as we do meet the Australian people we will not have to meet them on the basis of what happened in 1900 when the Australian Constitution was passed by the **British** Parliament.

* The **British** have strong emotional and, of course, economic ties with, especially, white Commonwealth countries.

* We have a tradition of reliability in times of major test which is greatly appreciated by the **British** people.

* I believe with respect to Australia that **British** pro-market politicians are harshly practical and realistic about Britain's entry.

* The fact is that the **British** shipping interests have always enjoyed special advantages from the United Kingdom Government because shipping has always been a major earner from invisible exports.

* A recent **British** committee under the chairmanship of Lord Rothdale which inquired into shipping listed the effect on the balance of payments of the invisible export, shipping, as one of the main considerations.

* To my mind, that report virtually stunned the **British** people when they were informed of the prevalence of homosexuality in their society.

* Because the **British** people were stunned, the legislators were not game to bring own legislation or to debate the matter in the House of Commons until many years after the Wolfenden report was submitted.

* A recent **British** White Paper entitled 'A Policy for Roads', states: 
Another victim of federal financial restraint is trunk road 51 between the Australian Capital Territory and the New South Wales south coast at Bateman 's Bay.

* Less than one percent of the New South Wales distance is edge marked, despite a **British** East Sussex Council trial in 1976 which reduced injury crashes and total crashes by 40 per cent to 60 per cent in the first 12 months.

* Surely it is contrary to one of the basic principles of **British** justice for an accused person not to be given full particulars of the charge.

* This has happened repeatedly in **British** history and in the history of all free nations.

* When the Liberal Government sold out the Commonwealth share in the **British** Petroleum company it sold it on the basis that it did not believe that there should be a government equity in it; but it sold the Commonwealth share to a company that is 50 per cent owned by the United Kingdom Government.

* For instance, no **British** monarch has dismissed a Prime Minister since 1 834.

* Professor Geoffrey Sawer- given the illiteracy of Liberal Party supporters, they may not want me to quote a professorwho is regarded as one of the greatest experts on constitutional matters in this country, said: 
Butler, who is perhaps the most respected **British** commentator on Australian politics, described his action as 'profoundly partisan'.

* In saying this, such spokesmen always forget that within the common law itself, charters of individual rights have played an important part in the development of the common law and the **British** Constitution, which rests on the common law and from which Australia draws so many of its values.

* The Magna Carta, the Petition of Right and the Bill of Rights have all been described at times as the pillars of the **British** Constitution.

* That is the time-honoured custom in all countries where **British** Parliamentary practice obtains.

* This was not received very kindly in Fiji since Fiji has long been an Australian economic colony while it might have been a **British** political colony.

* I make passing reference to the position of other **British** colonies in this area.

* However, I find it rather paradoxical that a Prime Minister and Minister who have been so critical of General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd and Chrysler Australia Ltd for their selection overseas of personnel to run their Australian operations, should now choose as the new permanent head of the Department a person from Canada who, I understand, is of **British** origin.

* I pursued an identical policy in our original negotiations with respect to the **British** trades.

* The decision, of course, was made because of the rebellion of the regime against the **British** Government.

* I am somewhat surprised that the honourable member for Lyne fails to recognise the fact that in Rhodesia there is a regime that is denying the **British** Government.

* We could look at the trials and tribulations of a journalist named Peter Niesewand who is still under detention even though - thank God for **British** justice, we might say - the court of appeal in that regime found him innocent.

* He held a **British** passport and that was what made him technically guilty of the crime of treason.

* But at one time he had held a **British** passport and he was executed for the crime.

* Had he committed it, would that saint-like man have been executed, in view of the fact that he would have held a **British** passport?

* Why not the hovercraft that the **British** bring here and let us see?

* We have come to the stage when it is only the **British**, the Australians and the Americans who are maintaining troops a long way from home.

* I was most interested to see the real accomplishments and achievements which the **British** have managed to bring about, particularly in trade, in their relationships with the People's Republic of China.

* The **British** go about matters unobstrusively, yet perhaps they can claim to be the most successful nation in selling their products to the Chinese!

* Available members of the Cabinet were asked to meet in the **British** Empire Society- he had asked six or seven of us to be there each with a telephone- to discuss the chairmanship with him.

* I recall a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain saying that neither he nor anybody else could predict in April, which is when the **British** Budget is prepared, what the course of the economy might be even 6 months later.

* The immunity from actions for tort that was granted to **British** unions by the House of Commons in 1906, is now extended by this Bill to officials and members of Australian trade unions.

* It is based upon the principles of the **British** Trade Disputes Act of 1906 which granted unions and union officials in that country exemption from tortious actions committed in furtherance of industrial disputes.

* The silence of the **British** Socialist Foreign Minister and the quaint attitudes of the United States Ambassador to the 
But what of the Cuban presence?

* In the  London Times  of 9 August 1 978  Sir Herbert  Marchant, a former **British** Ambassador to Cuba, was authoritatively reported as saying that in the whole of Africa there were 45,000 Cubans, spread over 14 different countries.

* When I was in Simonstown I saw a **British** frigate flying the White Ensign in for repairs and revictualling, yet Britain .

* Since the closing of the Suez Canal in July 1967 a total of 121 **British** warships and 40 **British** fleet auxiliaries have made use of the Simonstown naval harbour.

* In the same period 47 **British** warships and 84 **British** fleet auxiliaries made use of other South African ports.

* Is the section 136 adjustment in **British** Petroleum's accounts for 1975 due to the discovery of a misleading transfer price by taxation officials.

* This assumption was largely based on **British** experience in a variety of loading and speed situations.

* They have a respect for this country because they know that just as **British** integrity- the word of an Englishman- was the binding word of many a deal in Asia in the days before World War II, it is the word of an Australian today that counts.

* I am not aware that the Queensland Minister for Justice had any discussions with **British** officials during his visit.

* The **British** Phosphate Commissioners have advised that of the phosphate rock shipped to Australia from Christmas Island and Nauru/Ocean Island, the following percentages were moved in Australian manned and licensed vessels: 
The emphasis there, as honourable members will see, is not on the anti-inflation effects of this legislation.

* This was well summarised, I think, in a comment in the 'Australian Financial Review' of 22nd March 1971. lt referred to the analogous **British** legislation in this way: 
Two years after the legislation was introduced the **British** pound was devalued, complicating any long-term review of price movements.

* Does he not agree that the people from Ocean Island have been most cruelly and unjustly treated over a long period, beginning with their exclusion from their island over 40 years ago, the fact that most of their superphosphate rock has been taken without any benefit to them and, finally, by the dismissal of their appeal for compensation in a **British** court?

* If he agrees that they have been cruelly and unjustly treated, can he say whether any suggestions or proposals have been put forward by the **British** Government or the New Zealand Government to the Australian Government to assist in compensation?

* The Government, along with the **British** Government, is talking continually of the Indian Ocean because it is still mindful of what  Mr Freeth,  a previous Minister, said on 14th August last year.

* I refer now to the proposed sale of arms to South Africa and the stupidity of the **British** Government in proposing it, because the moment it does that it will force the other African States into an untenable position; they will be getting arms from the Eastern Bloc countries in the time it takes Ilyshun aircraft to fly from Russia down to Africa.

* He saw to it that they remained behind and fulfilled their duty to the **British** Government.

* She receives the **British** age pension.

* In correspondence to me the Department stated: 
I might inform the House that  Colonel Peters  is now a retired former high ranking **British** soldier.

* The resultant interview when reported in the United Kingdom Press and by ihe **British** Broadcasting Commission surprised many people.

* One was laid down by a very great **British** Prime Minister and Foreign 
I will deal with that sentence now because it is grossly in error.

* I have available the flight habits of four international carriers, Boeing 707 aircraft, DC 10 aircraft, Qantas 747 aircraft and **British** Airways 747 aircraft.

* The **British** Airways aircraft, with the same configuration and with no freight, has either to unload passengers or to fly a shorter distance and land at Darwin or Sydney, where no real restrictions are imposed on international movements.

* At the lower temperature the **British** Airways aircraft has a range of 900 nautical miles short of Singapore.

* If we wanted to talk about India we talked to the **British** and if we wanted to talk about Indo-China we talked to the French.

* Is the Minister for Trade and Resources aware of a statement made by  Sir Frederick  Catherwood the  Chairman  of the **British** Overseas Board of Trade, that Australia is one of the very few advanced countries which rely on protection to defend their industries and that that has weakened Australia's international trading position?

* Some of its people want to form their own independent nation and others rather favour the idea of union with the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate.

* pursuant to the American, **British**, Canadian and Australian Armies Standardisation Agreement - have not been included.

* Medical Association Journal, 8 March 1975, wherein Stephen M. Drance, M.D.,  Chairman  of the Department of Opthalmology, University of **British** Columbia, in an article entitled 'Myopia- genes or environment?'

* Nonetheless, I concur with the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  that it is appropriate that we recognise the significance of an occasion when we transfer our allegiance from a monarch who is essentially **British** by name and nature to one who is Australian by identity and by approval of this Parliament.

* Instead of our recognition of a **British** monarch with the one anomaly to which the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  referred, that is her title as Elizabeth II, we are for the first time accrediting the Queen of Australia with recognition of her as such and not because of our inheritance of the monarchy because the Queen is also Queen of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

* In the Northern Territory, of the total area of 286,648 square miles held under pastoral lease, 16.8 per cent is held solely by overseas interest, of which **British** interests hold 9.9 per cent and American 5.7 per cent.

* In the Top End of the Northern Territory (i.e., annual rainfall above 24 in roughly north of 16 latitude) 27.7 per cent of the total area of 45,500 square miles is held solely by overseas interests, of which American interests hold 17.1 per cent, Asian 7.3 per cent and **British** 3.3 per cent.

* At Fairford the French and **British** prototypes 001 and 002 took off and landed within 5 minutes of each other.

* In a newsletter issued by the **British** Aircraft Corporation on the Concorde's South American trip it was stated that the flying time from Toulouse to Cayenne was 5 hours, as against 8 hours for a subsonic flight.

* Honourable members will remember that the voluntary restraints were introduced in 1966 as a temporary measure when the **British** balance of payments was under a very great strain.

* Another important factor which I think must be taken into account when refusing to make predictions is that the United Kingdom has eased the investment conditions for EEC countries and that will enable the **British** investor to examine the relative desirability of his investments in the EEC and the 4 Sterling countries affected which, of course, are Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Ireland.

* He did not recognise that the very Minister who administers that is not even a member of Cabinet and indeed, to the best of my knowledge and recollection, the Minister responsible for development in the **British** Cabinet has his matters handled by the Secretary for Foreign Relations.

* When the Minister took over from the former Minister, who is now  His Excellency  the Governor-General, we had - and I have described this as the Barnes period - a greater acceleration of progress towards democracy and a political tolerance which I regard in a **British** Parliament as being quite remarkable.

* Let us face it; Australia followed the policy adopted by the **British** towards Rhodesia, and we have done nothing about altering that policy.

* I am fortified by the fact that in the **British** House of Commons it is the practice, and May's 'Parliamentary Practice' at chapter 10 so states, that if an honourable member casts against honourable members imputations which are not substantiated the honourable member casting the imputations is guilty of a breach of conduct and a breach of his privilege as an honourable member and can be dealt with and punished by the House.

* The **British** House of Commons has a clear precedent on this subject.

* For instance, the sharing of days or departure times or the pooling of revenues on carefully selected routes, as is done amongst international airlines such as Qantas and **British** Airways, could go some of the way towards enabling more evenly spaced departure times and so providing a more acceptable service to the public.

* If fares drop to the levels indicated by Qantas and **British** Airways, by what factor will the number of Australians travelling out of Australia increase and by what factor will the number of travellers coming into Australia increase?

* The **British** - 
-I am not attacking the draftsman.

* The point I am making is that the **British** had an Act seeking to prevent their citizens engaging in mercenary activities but it was an Act of some age and it would not effectively prevent the difficulties that arose relatively recently in Great Britain, particularly in respect of the Angola situation.

* We have read since of the great tragedy that occurred to a number of young **British** men who were recruited as mercenaries to fight for money.

* More than $3m is spent each year by the **British** government on supplying wigs free on National Health Service to people whose doctors consider they need them.

* The second is that the **British** Government not only supplies medical wigs free but also pays for periodic cleaning.

* A vast movement of trade has taken place from Europe to other parts of the world where the **British** oriented shipping, banking and insurance systems do not work.

* It is not possible to say now, says the Minister, what the final effects of the **British** entry will be but satisfactory alternative markets will be found for some displaced trade.

* The **British** people have again fallen for the trick and they will live to regret it.

* I am just saying that the will of the **British** people to do these things has been sapped.

* But because there happens to be direct billing instead of going via the back door as it is now- the Government contribution is 50 per centthrough the private funds, because the private part has been eliminated from the scheme and the scheme is to be funded completely by the Government the doctors say that they are de facto Commonwealth employees, their independence is taken away, that the **British** health scheme is upon us with all the inherent problems.

* Every member of this House knows that this scheme is entirely different from the **British** health scheme.

* The then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Member for Lowe, confirmed that his Government had received a report that a Chinese official had indicated to a **British** representative that China would not place any further wheat orders with Australia because of the attitude of the then Australian Government to China.

* Allow me to quote from one of the most distinguished **British** economists of this century, the late  Sir Dennis  Robertson, for many years 
Previous replies which have been given to me by the Minister have indicated that there is no alternative site for an airport within 50 or 60 miles of Perth.

* Bearing in mind the fact that in the last few days the **British** Government has accepted a site at Foulness, some 50 miles out of London, as the site of its third airport, it is not impossible that a site some 50 or 60 miles out of Perth could be suitable as the site for a future airport in Perth.

* Though radical in its concept, off-shore airfields were used with success by the **British** and American navies in World War II where no suitable land existed near strategic areas.

* We have looked at the business community in a realistic way and we have proposed legislation which has been modelled very largely on the **British** experience.

* The **British** Act seems to have produced remarkable success.

* These efforts were thwarted by the **British** Government and some State politicians.

* Deakin summed up the situation when he said: 
Because of the wider recognised status and capacity of our courts it is not surprising too that the Privy Council itself has increasingly acknowledged in recent years that there may well be good reasons for not altering the decisions of Australian courts and particularly the decisions of the High Court of Australia even if the approaches of the **British** judges might be different.

* How could the position be otherwise when **British** judges, who have often found it difficult to follow the intricacies of Australian constitutional law, are faced with legal issues based on a system of government which is far from being a mirror of their own?

* I refer to a book by Professor Castles titled Australian Legal History', dealing with the **British** common law in Australia since 1828.

* Manpower assistance to these countries is provided on an ad hoc basis in the form of individual Australian experts carrying out specific aid assignments, of whom there are currently 3 1 serving throughout the region, as follows- Fiji (15); **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate (4); Tonga (2); Gilbert and Ellice Islands (3); Western Samoa (6); and the New Hebrides ( 1 ).

* Thus there is at present a Book-keeping Instructor, seconded from the New South Wales Department of Education, at the Honiara Technical Institute in the **British** Solomon Islands; a Headmaster, also from the New South Wales Department of Education, at Nasinu Teachers College, Fiji; a Head of School of Business Studies and an Electrical Instructor, from the South Australian Institute of Technology, at the Derrick Technical Institute, Fiji, and the Development Authority, GEIC, respectively; and two lecturers, one in Administration and one in Teacher Education, from the Canberra College of Advanced Education, at the University of the South Pacific, Fiji.

* As I understand, we have a tacit gentleman's agreement between the ABC and the **British** Broadcasting 
Management has a great responsibility.

* It is the forum about which my distinguished **British** colleague, Robin Day, has so correctly said that truth and falsehood can grapple in the critical public gaze.

* It has been said quite advisedly that there will be no Australian owned motor industry in the next 100 years because it is now owned by the **British** and the Americans.

* They are mainly **British** but include a large number of others, mainly European.

* Between the two world wars there was an intake of people from Europe and the **British** Isles.

* In the Melbourne 'Herald' in June, the Minister is reported as saying in London that he planned to attract 350,000 **British** settlers over the next 5 years.

* In 1962 a **British** trawler, rejoicing in the name, picturesquely enough, of the 'Red 
Crusader', was alleged to have been within Danish territorial waters.

* A **British** destroyer, the 'Troubridge', came into sight and came between the 2 vessels.

* When the United States had the whip hand in Europe after the Second World War the Marshall Plan of 1945 was far more enlightened than was **British** policy between 1919 and 1921.

* The **British** would never have overthrown a faithful ally like Diem.

* It was said that for the valuation of non-commercial goods the **British** customs had an entirely different system, one carried out by administrative action.

* One is Australian manned, one is **British** manned and the other is Swedish manned.

* Incidentally, the Australian crews do less ship maintenance than either the **British** or Swedish crews.

* We know first of all that there has been a withdrawal of the **British** influence in the Malaysia-Singapore area.

* The Opposition is of the view that there is no necessity for a prospective officer to be a **British** subject, as my colleague the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  has suggested.

* He was admitted to the Order of the **British** Empire in 1961.

* Earlier this year the  Clerk  was made a Commander of the Order of the **British** Empire.

* -Is the Minister for - Transport aware of recent newspaper advertisements by Qantas Airways Limited and **British** Airways Corporation which gave readers the immediate impression that they would be able to save $450 on return flights to Britain from 1 April, when in fact these cheaper fares do not apply until flights in October?

* Will the Minister ensure that in future Qantas and **British** Airways abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the trade practices legislation in relation to their advertising?

* Ships are registered in Australia under the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and are only eligible for registration if they are wholly owned by **British** subjects or by bodies corporate established under the law of and having their principal place of business in a **British** possession.

* The extension of the qualifications, however, will allow persons who are not **British** subjects to be eligible for appointment as judges.

* But it is considered inappropriate for persons who are not **British** subjects but who have been appointed as judges to take such an oath or affirmation.

* Some people connected with the aircraft industry claim that by favouring United States aircraft, including the F111, the Government has contributed materially to the collapse of the **British** aircraft industry and this in turn has added to the pressure on Britain to enter the Common market.

* We should refuse to accept destroyers, aeroplanes or anything else unless those who want to sell them are prepared 
The honourable member for Barton, in quoting the **British** report, pointed out that areas of most need may be those not receiving the service.

* We have heard about the **British** report.

* This is very much in line with the **British** experience of a regional organisation giving overall care to the aged.

* Rationalisation of industry is what the **British** Government has done and is continuing to do.

* (b) The Commonwealth Electoral Act requires all Australian citizens and other **British** subjects to enrol and vote for federal elections.

* The franchise so conferred is only concerned with the question whether a particular person has the legal status of an Australian citizen or a **British** subject and not, per se, with his country of origin.

* He is no longer taken seriously by any **British** government.

* Even at the present time in the replacement of the Macchi trainer there is an excellent opportunity for the Australian aircraft industry to break into the field of design and development and to have a decent throughput of work on the aircraft which was mentioned by the Minister - the HS1182, which is an English aircraft being designed by the **British** Government.

* Until such time as the Government is prepared to establish an institution on the lines of the American Export-Import Bank or the **British** Export Credits Guarantee Department to assist the sale of Project N, we will not get anywhere in Australia.

* We know that the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation missed out on the sale of Macchi trainer jets to the Royal New Zealand Air Force because of one thing only - the Corporation was not in a position to compete, not in relation to the price of the aircraft, but in relation to the financial arrangements that the **British** Government was able to make.

* When the telescope has been completed access to it will be shared equally by **British** and Australian astronomers, although there will be provision for each party to make available a portion of its time to other astronomers.

* The provision of these new facilities should enable us, in co-operation with our **British** partners, to develop that reputation further.

* The **British** Consular Relations Act  1968  establishes a similar system.

* Privileges and Immunities Act 1967 was inserted to enable appropriate immunities in respect of official acts to bc accorded to members of non-diplomatic posts in Australia established by the governments of **British** territories.

* The Prime Minister pointed out that in any event he would not be prepared to agree to a change without first having a discussion with the **British** Prime Minister and Buckingham Palace.

* This number is required because of the fact that approximately half of the immigrants who come to this country are **British**.

* I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that even at that point the **British** Government had already realised the problems of aircraft noise and had taken similar steps long before the Minister and this Government took action.

* When the Select Committee started to investigate aircraft noise it had in front of it the findings of the **British** parliamentary inquiry into aircraft noise.

* The **British** Parliament has already made its decision before this Government got around to the question of aircraft noise.

* Seventy-two years ago this House and the Senate resolved that they are prepared to join in measures for the acceptance of **British** New Guinea as a territory of the Commonwealth'.

* That Bill marked the final step in the process of excluding appeals to the **British** Privy Council from decisions of the High Court of 
The process begun with the Privy Council (Limitations of Appeals) Act 1968 and consummated by the Privy Council (Appeals From The High Court) Act 1975 should be carried to the logical and proper conclusion that no appeal should lie to the **British** Privy Council from or in respect to any decision of any Australian court.

* Michael Young, the **British** sociologist, not the honourable member for Port Adelaide, has argued that part-time domestic service as a career could absorb large numbers of people in work they would like to do, such as gardening, maintenance, cleaning and child minding.

* Honourable members might say that that job would be the labours of Hercules multiplied manyfold How did the **British** Government go about this appointment?

* What did the **British** do?

* If we accept the contention that interest rates should be rigid and completely isolated from what occurs elsewhere in the economy we are going to return to the days when attemps were made to control interest rates under, for example, the **British** Labour governments in the years after the second world war.

* We will return to some of those policies which were utterly disastrous in terms of capital investment in the country, utterly disastrous with respect to the rigidity which they built into the **British** economic system, and utterly disas- trous with respect to the ultimate benefits which could be given to the **British** people under such a policy.

* There is provision for patrials, persons with a close association with Australia, fiance(e)s and **British** Commonwealth citizens resident in New Zealand to come to Australia as migrants without having to meet occupational criteria.

* If the Government still believes in the usefulness of such vessels, and probably there is a continuing usefulness of the aircraft carrier for the pursuit of submarines, it is about time the Government started looking at the purchase of another aircraft carrier, possibly one of those much more modern **British** carriers which may or may not continue in service for the United Kingdom.

* There were utter disasters in Nigeria because the **British** on the whole favoured the Muslim north, which was quiescent and conservative and caused them very much less trouble than the Ibos and Yorubas in other regions and it produced the particularism and distinctiveness that became so disastrous for Nigeria in later time.

* The report, which was presented to the **British** Parliament in March of this year, states: 
Honourable members should not forget that the Murdoch referred to in that report is the Murdoch of Australian fame who owns so many radio, television and newspaper companies in Australia.

* This Committee, which was chaired by Lord Annan and which had great credibility in the United Kingdom, was concerned that the **British** media was not to follow the rackets that exist in Australia today and the one-eyed approach to the presentation of news.

* In February, less than three months ago, **British** researchers reported: 
Since the reports of the Ranger inquiry, it has been confirmed that reactor grade plutonium is a suitable explosive fuel.

* Evidence given to the **British** Windscale inquiry last September by a consultant to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission revealed that the United States has successfully exploded a device using this material.

* If so, are these passports recognised by **British** officials as carrying the same privileges accorded to nationals of all friendly nations having diplomatic status.

* Back in 1963 a Whitehall interdepartmental committee decided on an inland area called Stansted for the site of a third airport The **British** Government confirmed the decision in May 1967, but the citizens of the United Kingdom and private organisations did not like the decision that the Government had made.

* As honourable gentlemen will know, in the last couple of days, the **British** Government made a decision on the siting of a third airport for London.

* Foreign equity in Clutha Development Pty Ltd in 100 per cent, held equally by the **British** Petroleum group and Universal Tankships Incorporated; the **British** Petroleum group is negotiating to acquire 100 per cent interest.

* -Qantas Airways Ltd and **British** Airways have announced a new cheap fare from Australia to the United Kingdom and from the United Kingdom to Australia.

* In respect of the specific matter raised by the honourable member, I have sought information on it and I understand that the advertisement is in no way in breach of the trade practices legislation, the reason being that Qantas and **British** Airways have widely advertised the full fare structure, including peak and off-peak travel.

* I see little satisfaction in being able to buy cheap Japanese, **British** or American cars or products if our own workers are idle because of lack of tariff protection for our secondary industries.

* The Labor Party's policy on this matter is as follows: 
Can he say which American, **British**, Japanese and European companies make Omega receivers.

* The only evidence for this, in my opinion, very over-sanguine assumption seems to be **British** experience.

* I might add that the **British** Parliament's select committee is still investigating the matter and has not yet reported.

* Apart from the **British** precedent which we propose, in principle, to follow, provisions for disclosure of interests are made in the parliamentary practice of a number of other countries, including the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand.

* That it was so was due, in particular, to the attitude of three of the participants: Our host  President  Kaunda;  President  Nyerere of Tanzania; and the **British** Prime Minister,  Mrs Thatcher.

* The **British** Prime Minister, for her part, reaffirmed the unqualified commitment of her Government to the goal of genuine black majority rule in Rhodesia.

* Mrs Thatcher  also accepted the responsibility of the **British** Government to bring the country to legal independence on a basis which the Commonwealth and the international community as a whole will find acceptable.

* Beyond this,  President  Kaunda and  President  Nyerere showed a restraint and patience, and a confidence in the **British** Government which were an essential element in creating the trust necessary for agreement and progress.

* The Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  had separate talks with the **British** and with representatives of the Muzorewa Government and subsequently with leaders of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments.

* Confirmed that they were wholly committed to genuine black majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe; recognised, in this context, that the internal settlement constitution is defective in certain important respects; fully accepted that it is the constitutional responsibility of the **British** Government to grant legal independence to Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule; recognised that the search for a lasting settlement must involve all parties to the conflict; were deeply conscious of the urgent need to achieve such a settlement and bring peace to the people of Zimbabwe and their neighbours; accepted that independence on the basis of majority rule requires the adoption of a democratic constitution including appropriate safeguards for minorities; acknowledged that the government formed under such an independent constitution must be chosen through free and fair elections, properly supervised under **British** Government authority, and with Commonwealth observers; and welcomed the **British** Government's indication that an appropriate procedure for advancing towards these objectives would be for it to call a constitutional conference to which all parties would be invited.

* For example, we consulted, among others, Professor Cross who assisted the **British** with their 1968 Evidence Act.

* When they take Australian citizenship they receive all the entitlements of natural born Australians and they should be designated as Australians of European origin, **British** origin or whatever.

* When traditional **British** and Western European sources of immigration have declined Australia has had to recruit migrants from countries or areas within countries- for example, rural Greece and Yugoslavia- without the background, education and industrialisation necessary to produce well-trained manpower.

* Perhaps it might be said that this does not matter because the **British** market will go anyway.

* As the honourable member for Gellibrand said, we have already seen that the **British** attempt to do this was a disaster and was cancelled.

* In New South Wales **British** Petroleum Australia Ltd has acquired 50 per cent of Clutha Development Pty Ltd.

* We are even leting a **British** Government institution into our coal reserves.

* In Peking the French Ambassador carries out his duties just as any Western ambassador does in Peking, like the **British** and Canadian embassies whose staffs we met.

* I would like to quote from a very excellent book by Wilfred Beckerman, an economist appointed by the **British** Labor Government to many comittees during the years it was in power.

* The **British** Labour Government, for example, which is in a similar bind but rather worse, in trying to reduce cost pressures in that nation is not going to the same length to provide social justice by guaranteeing disposable incomes to its own citizens with varying numbers of dependants and at various levels of income.

* We well remember the fall of Singapore and the fact that we were no longer under the protective aegis of the **British** Navy and that in fact we had to depend on our own strong right arm and the productivity of our secondary industries.

* I wish to draw the attention of the House to a telegram which was sent last week by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  to the former **British** Prime Minister.

* We have seen the result of the **British** elections, and I am sure that we would all want to congratulate  Mrs Thatcher  and wish her well.

* The Leader of the Opposition had the gall to make public to the world at large his telegram to  Mr Callaghan  which, amongst other things, stated: 
It did not seem to go down very well with the **British** people - has shown the people the real dangers they face from the Victorian attitudes of your opponents.

* -Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of the adverse criticism by **British** fruit importers of the quality of 1976 season Tasmanian apples exported to the United Kingdom?

* The idea of hereditary titles was buried forever by Daniel Deniehy; but from time to time Australians, mainly politicians, continued to be honoured by the **British** Government with knighthoods and other decorations.

* Canada, for many years past, has stood aloof and refused to accept **British** honours and titles.

* The law draws no distinction between attacks upon **British** buildings and individuals and attacks on foreign or Commonwealth buildings or individuals.

* The former Attorney-General said that in 1967 the **British** Government had repealed the Riot Act.

* The major trends in world affairs with which I propose to deal are: Communist policies; the reduction of **British** influence east of Suez and in particular the withdrawal of **British** forces from Malaysia and Singapore; the dramatic growth of Japan with the promise this has for greatly increased influence in the world at large and in our own region in particular, and the comprehensive doctrine enunciated by  President  Nixon concerning the world role of the United States.

* From 7 February 1980 eligible veterans will be able to receive a service pension on a similar basis to that applying to **British** Commonwealth veterans.

* In relation to an allied veteran the specific requirements he will have to meet are that he served as a member of a formally raised force; served in a theatre of war; resided in Australia for at least 10 years; satisfies the income test applicable to Australian and **British** Commonwealth veterans; and reached 60 years of age if a male or 55 years if a female or has become permanently unemployable.

* Their signatures were witnessed by officers of the then **British** Medical Association and fourteen of them have been BMA or AMA State Presidents.

* In 1972-73, which is the last information I have, the council consisted of  Mr I.  McLachlin who was the  chairman  and  president  of the Liberal Party of South Australia and director of Colonial Mutual Life Association Society Ltd;  Sir Clarence  Rieger, who was  president  of the Australian Blue Cross Association, former  president  of the **British** Medical Association, former federal  president  of the Australian Medical Association;  Mr P.  Parsons, director of Television Broadcasters Ltd;  Mr A.  Brookman, who is the son of the late Honourable Norman Brookman, Liberal-Country Party member of State Parliament and brother of another Liberal-Country Party member and the  chairman  of the South Australian Seed Growers Co-operative Ltd and  Sir Roland  Jacobs, former  chairman  of the South Australian Brewing Co., Ltd and the present  chairman  of Executor Trustee and Agency Co. of South Australian Ltd. Then there is a barrister and a retired gentleman on the council.

* The **British** Government has said that on accession to the European Economic Community it is prepared to consider a gradual and orderly rundown of official sterling balances.

* The **British** Government no doubt is considering that at present.

* What the **British** Government has said is that it will consult with all holders of sterling.

* Also I will be discussing with him the other portion of the question, namely, the effect this may have upon **British** investment in Australia.

* If you were in Great Britain, or even in Australia, and wanted advice, he would arrange immediate contact with the relevant **British** Minister and usually give you a reply immediately.

* In part of my second reading speech I indicated that those who served in the **British** Commonwealth countries would be eligible for the service pension.

* However, the article in question quite correctly indicated that the Australian Labor Party has given an undertaking to amend the Repatriation Act so that **British** ex-servicemen now living in Australia would be eligible to receive a service pension.

* The question of granting eligibility for service pensions to **British** ex-servicemen resident in Australia is under consideration.

* lt seems extraordinary to me that the **British** and Germans, who 27 years ago were at war, got together 10 years ago on reciprocity without any great difficulty or delay, yet it has taken us twice the time to come up with a less sound proposition.

* It is carrying out a propaganda war by showing to the small nations that its ships are there while the **British** ships are withdrawing.

* That the construction of the naval base at Cockburn Sound should receive high priority on the defence programme and that negotiations should be undertaken with the **British** Government to base 2 aircraft carriers on Cockburn Sound after 1970.

* It is an essential consequence of the equality of status existing among the members of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations that the Governor-General of a dominion is the representative of the Crown, holding in all essential respects the same position in relation to the administration of public affairs in the dominion as is held by His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and that he is not the representative or agent of His Majesty's Government in Great Britain or of any department of that Government.

* But the destruction of **British** parliamentary democracy would have only been postponed.

* We put it under the control of a judge who was trained in the rights and freedoms of the **British** people under **British** law.

* When the present Opposition came into power it put the security organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the freedoms and rights of the **British** people, which applied also to the Australian people.

* I would have appreciated it if he had told the Parliament in his speech, which immediately preceded mine, that, after  Mr Menzies-  he was not then  Sir Robertthe  Prime Minister of Australia had been given the important task by the **British** Government of negotiating with  Colonel Nasser  following the Suez Canal crisis, he came back to this Parliament or he had printed in a book that in Egypt  Colonel Nasser-  the honourable member for Bradfield served as a diplomat in Egypt and would be more aware of this fact than any member of the House, but withheld it from his speech- was virtually in charge of a police state.

* Pty Ltd, G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd and **British** Tobacco (Aust) Ltd, the resulting figure would be about equal to the total assets of the Australian Post Office.

* The **British** report indicates that medical men are deeply concerned that at the age of 15, there are just as many girl smokers as boy smokers and that the intake of alcohol has also shown a tremendous increase at this age.

* Unlike the governments of Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America, the Australian Government, and the **British** colonial administration before it have never recognised the rights of the indigenous people to the land they occupied at the time of European settlement.

* The **British** Crown declared Australian land its own and, except in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, proceeded to expropriate it to European settlers.

* He was made a Commander of the Order of the **British** Empire by  Her  Majesty the Queen in 1965.

* The Australia-United Kingdom fares suggested by  Mr Laker  are significantly below the lowest presently available to the general public, that is, the advance purchase excursion fares known as APEF offered by Qantas Airways Ltd and **British** Airways.

* Are we to follow the **British** example?

* Are we to follow that **British** example?

* The **British** people are great.

* If we had not had those **British** doctors who have come to Australia we would not be able to deliver the health care we are delivering today.

* Britain is short of 24,000 hospital doctors and 60 per cent of the junior doctors in the hospitals and the junior doctors in these socialised practices are not **British** at all; they have come from overseas.

* There are others, such as Pan Am and **British** Airways, which are not without guilt and are proffering to the public a suggestion about cheaper fares without first coming either to me or perhaps even to their own governments.

* The fact is that outside in the market place airlines such as Pan Am and **British** Airways, which have proffered these gimmick fares, do nothing to assist the major question which is before the country.

* The **British** society has become in some sections a permissive society.

* I am reminded of a story of a most famous **British** character who at one stage during a speech in the House of Commons gave a description of a person who was then the Leader of the Opposition.

* Unfortunately in the **British** Labour Party at the moment there are many boneless wonders.

* All Australians would do themselves a lot more credit if they examined the causes of conflict rather than blame **British** migrants.

* If he happened to be a **British** migrant, would he be sought out for special attention?

* The third point he makes is that there should be positive policy initiatives to replace negative **British** and union bashing.

* Mr Sinclair  has not proved his allegations that the **British** disease, whatever that is, has been imported into Australia, nor has he said who imported it.

* He thought that the deportation of a few **British** unionists would solve the problem.

* Migrant workers, in particular **British** migrant workers, are being sought out for special treatment.

* Some of the companies which participated last year were Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd which benefited to the extent of $180,500, **British** Motor Corporation $174,500, Australian Iron and Steel $134,000, General Motors Holden's Pty Ltd $482,000- and so it goes on.

* It would be a good thing if the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly),  instead of quoting from some second rate **British** politician's writing on the institution of the parliament had quoted what is involved in the motion for an allotment of time.

* The Minister or External Affairs had hopes, I infer from his statement, for a continued **British** presence east of Suez.

* The Minister for Defence  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  had no hope, as far as I could infer from his earlier statement, for a continued **British** presence east of Suez.

* I think we should look at the likelihood of a **British** presence east of Suez, not in terms of what we wish but in terms of the fundamental purposes of the United Kingdom.

* **British** authority extended all the way from the coast of Palestine to Malaya.

* This was the reason for the **British** positions east of Suez.

* This fact affects **British** policy in 2 ways.

* Secondly, since Britain has no power base and no 'home' presence in Asia, as she had when she had 3 million loyal Indian troops under her command in the Indian Empire, **British** intervention in Asia is likely to be limited at most to minor actions in peninsulas, never to an endless and undefinable commitment on the broad mainland of Asia.

* If we look back at **British** intervention in Korea and Malaysia, it will be noted that the **British** forces with their allies were in a position to establish a complete defensive line of force right across the peninsula and to screen both ends of the line with naval forces.

* The other factor, in the **British** foreign policy stand, is the new strategic assessment of Europe.

* Historically, **British** strategy was always to form an eastern alliance against a central threat.

* Always the central expanding threat has been countered by a **British** alliance further to the east.

* **British** policy therefore has changed.

* There is no ally further east and therefore **British** policy is to consolidate western Europe economically and militarily as a defensive screen.

* **British** foreign policy is turning exclusively towards Europe.

* The honourable member may make rude remarks about **British** regiments, but let me tell him that they are regiments who fought for his country.

* I think it is appropriate that I should talk about the matter of public importance as it affects migrants, particularly **British** migrants.

* More than one and a half million **British** migrants have come to Australia since 1947 and have made a magnificent contribution to the development of Australia.

* As with many migrants, **British** migrants have played a big part in Australia's postwar progress and in our economic, social, political and cultural development.

* As the largest migrant group, it is not surprising that **British** migrants have risen in prominence m many areas of Australian activity- in the professions, industry and commerce, politics, the academic world, the arts, sport, employer organisations, trade unions and the Public Service.

* These statistics overwhelmingly confirm the significant role that **British** migrants have played in the Australian work force.

* It is a fact that under its administration the numbers of **British** migrants coming to this country were overwhelmingly reduced.

* One of the first actions I took as the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was to go to the United Kingdom in May last year, which was the first visit by a Minister of the Fraser Government to the United Kingdom, to reassure them that Australia did not- I emphasise these words- have an antipathy towards the **British** migrants but that in fact we welcomed them.

* I repeat that it is hypocritical of the honourable member for Melbourne, the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis)  and members of the Opposition generally to claim here, with their hearts on their sleeves, that they are defending the **British** migrants.

* Their actions were significantly against **British** migrants coming to Australia during the time of their administration.

* It is recognised, however, that the receipt of certain privileges and benefits can be dependent upon the fulfilment of legislative provisions which require applicants to be, for example, **British** subjects or to have resided in Australia for a stated period of time.

* With minor exceptions, permanent appointment to the Public Services of the Commonwealth or States requires **British** subject status.

* The **British** have a Defence Council that never meets.

* Let the honourable member table the minutes of the last meeting of the **British** Defence Council.

* I just do not believe that  Sir Alec  DouglasHome was not aware of my criticism of the **British** Government about the transitional arrangements which were made for Australia, particularly in respect of those items which were under quota arrangements with the **British** Government.

* The **British** Government replied that it now had a safeguard clause which could be introduced if there was disruption to certain agricultural commodities going to the European Economic Community.

* I hope to get into discussions with the **British** Government, and I hope that it is in a position to amplify the safeguard clause more when I have these discussions.

* However the **British** Government faces the difficulty of having this safeguard clause defined more fully by the European members.

* I do not think that any accusations that I have not been unequivocal or forthright in my comments about the **British** negotiations would hold water.

* I know from some of the conversations that I have had with some of the international airline operators in Brisbane that it is quite a comedy at the moment with people putting their heads through doorways and asking Qantas or **British** Airways: 'When does Freddie Laker start operating?'

* The representative stated that BBC programmes in 1969 were approximately - 84 per cent **British**, 9 per cent USA, 7 per cent other.

* The proportion of **British** programmes shown on ITV is not as high as that of the BBC, but still considerably more than 50 per cent.

* As far as the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  is concerned, the storm over his remarks about the **British** disease was just what was needed to give a kick along to his party's lagging reputation in the bush.

* Visiting ships no longer will be governed by the Australian legislation because of improvements which the **British** Government has provided.

* The next matter I want to deal with is visiting **British** ships.

* The **British** Government has updated the Merchant Shipping Act and we have kept pace with it.

* Therefore we have excluded **British** ships from the Australian Navigation Act, except when they are on charter here.

* In 1927 Australia and New Zealand joined with Britain in the **British** Phosphate Commission and asked the Banabans for more land to mine for phosphate, but the Banabans refused.

* Amazingly the Banabans loyally donated 512,500 to **British** war funds in 1940.

* This was rewarded by the **British** abandoning them to the Japanese, who deponed the majority as slave labour, and shot the 150 remaining, except for one survivor.

* Only in 1965 did they realise they had been cheated, and they expelled the **British** colonial service officer appointed to Rabi, who was known as the Banaban adviser.

* The Banabans have been offered $A10m by the **British** Government and $A 1.25 m by the **British** Phosphate Commission provided they take no more legal action, but this has been made conditional on the money being tied up in a trust fund, which they do not want.

* This is a golden opportunity for the Government to see that the Australian aircraft industry receives substantial sophisticated off-set work from the **British**.

* These credit terms are being backed by the **British** Export Guarantee Corporation.

* One of the other areas of the Bill which seems to me to have a degree of unreality is that, it could be for instance, that the **British** Government would seek in Australia from **British** migrants who are still **British** citizens recruits for the **British** armed forces.

* By comparison, the **British** scheme is rather cheaper for rather more, lt runs at about  5%.

* Because you have a seemingly free health scheme, in the sense that you pay for it in tax rather than by direct contributions as the **British** do, it does not necessarily mean that therefore it will be more expensive, that there will be runaway expenses and that people will over-use the medical profession.

* Operation rates for tonsillectomy,  appendicectomy,  and hysterectomy for intermediate and private patients in Australia - i.e., those who .irc cared for by doctors remunerated under an insurance supported fee for service system - appear to be much higher than for American and **British** patients who are cared for by physicians who do not receive fees for individual services 
Oddly enough the operation rates for hernias were similar in each category of patient.

* Once again, are **British** children much healthier than Australian children?

* As the Prime Minister has observed, there have not been many **British** Prime Ministers who have been able to visit this country and it is particularly gratifying that  Mrs Thatcher  is able to do so at this early stage after assuming her office.

* I assure the Prime Minister and the **British** High Commission, which will be looking after arrangements in association with  Mrs Thatcher's  visit, that the Opposition will do all it can to make  Mrs Thatcher's  visit a warm and rewarding one.

* Any proposal to extend the War Service Homes Act to extend the benefits to **British** ex-servicemen who took their discharge hi Australia involves a question of future Government policy and it is not the practice to provide an answer to a question of this nature.

* One would have thought that this was a somewhat important relevant fact that was omitted from the second reading speech of the former Attorney-General, who referred to that group as some sort of committee or commission that might have been set up by the **British** Government or it may have been a joint parliamentary committee of some sort.

* Similarly if one reads the second reading speech on the United Kingdom Criminal Law Bill of 1967, which emanated in the 
That is the **British** Criminal Law Revision Committee -  was a review of certain ancient crimes and the whole point was to get rid of this legal deadwood.

* Are book prices charged in Australia to Australian book buyers higher as a result of monopoly pricing characteristics of the price-fixing policies of **British** publishers, 
Can he say whether (a) the bound edition of Elaine Morgan's 'The Descent of Woman' is available in Australia from Australian book-sellers at $8 per copy, (b) a paperback edition of the book published by **British** publishers, complying with Australian copyright laws, is available from booksellers in Noumea and Djakarta for $1 per copy and (c) the paperback edition of this book is currently available in Australia; if it is not available, why not?

* The Minister for Overseas Trade may be interested to know that the **British** Government and the Chinese Government are on the verge of concluding a massive industrial agreement.

* With the approval of the **British** Government, the Rolls Royce Co. in England is preparing to conclude an agreement with the Chinese Government involving the sale of about 800 Spey jet engines and the licence rights for the Chinese to manufacture this engine.

* Not ons honourable member tonight could deny that the people in the United Kingdom have been virtually driven to their knees by inflation and large scale unemployment, to a large extent as a result of the unco-ordinated activities of shop stewards and the anarchy that they have introduced into **British** industry, making it impossible to fulfil orders.

* Other 'on station' works for these squadrons were constructed at **British** expense and Australia paid a rental of 10 per cent of their capital value up to 1963.

* This arrangement was reviewed in 1968 when the rental paid to 1963 was regarded as a capital payment and Australia paid the **British** the balance of the capital cost of the facilities.

* Although no details are held of the actual expenditure incurred by the **British** it is believed that the **British** contribution to the total capital cost of the base was of the order of Stg5.6m.

* In 1968 the **British** Atomic Energy Weapons Research Establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga.

* If a person engaged in hostile activities against the citizens of that foreign country is on the losing side he may be executed, as unfortunately happened to Colonel Callan who was of **British** nationality.

* We might remember that when a **British** administration in 1968-69 intended to withdraw completely from Malaysia and Singapore, 
Australia and New Zealand said they would take responsibilities alone.

* In the event **British** policy was changed to allow retention of a permanent force in the area and the positive attitude of the Australian Government was rewarded.

* I pointed out, and I quote: 'Under the **British** system of cabinet government they have a Cabinet secretariat as well as a staff and a politically disposed and committed staff that is attached to the Prime Minister.

* I went on to say:  'Mr Whitlam  has adopted the **British** system.

* The **British** Army has been reduced from 300,000 to 150,000 personnel since national service was abolished.

* The **British** have now fewer than 20 combat vessels east of Suez, the French only a couple of destroyers and, apart from an unknown number of submarines, the United States naval activity is confined to the Persian Gulf area.

* Urged by his own Party and the Labour Opposition, the unions and the Confederation of **British** Industry, Heath reflated.

* The **British** economy since 1971 speaks volumes on the subject of premature reflation.

* I cite one example: The **British** invented the tank and between the 2 world wars they kept a core force of tanks in operation.

* This was the role of the **British** Army prior to 1 9 1 4 and it is a very proper and effective role for our Army.

* Can the Minister say whether an article published in the RSL magazine 'Mufti' prior to the general elections, indicated an undertaking by the Australian Labor Party that, when elected, it would recognise **British** ex-servicemen under the Repatriation Act.

* If so, does the Government propose to grant **British** ex-servicemen, now resident in Australia, the benefits of the Repatriation service in regard to (a) housing loans, (b) sickness benefits, and (c) pensions.

* When were any washings from **British** service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island (a) transported to Maralinga and (b) buried at Maralinga.

* The position with aviation gasolene is that the **British** Petroleum company will import a large consignment into the country, I think on 17 November.

* Qantas did receive a study, from the **British** Aircraft Corporation concerning the operation of Concorde aircraft on the basis of a one class service at fares higher than prevailing first class levels.

* As Qantas is not expected to complete its detailed economic and technical evaluation of the Concorde aircraft until well into 1973, it is not proposed to table in Parliament economic studies relating to the Concorde prepared by the **British** Aircraft Corporation.

* He produced dictionaries of French and German naval terms which became standard works in the **British** Navy.

* I want you to regard me not as the last Viceroy winding up the **British** raj, but as the first to lead the way to a new independence.

* Uranium hexafluoride standards are being purchased from the United States Depanment of Energy and HIFAR fuel elements are being purchased from **British** Nuclear Fuels Ltd. 
We know, however, that constitutionally the Commonwealth is limited to making laws with respect to its own Territories, its own properties.

* The **British** North America Act gives the Parliament of Canada the exclusive power to make laws with respect to the criminal law, except the constitution of courts of criminal jurisdiction but including the procedure in criminal matters.

* Has his attention been drawn to the proposal in the **British** Budget 1973 that, in respect to the valuation of quoted shares or securities, -where they are sold within 12 months of death, those accounting for duty will be able to claim substitution of total sale price for value at date of death.

* Will he follow the lead shown by the **British** Chancellor of the Exchequer and extend the same relief to persons paying Commonwealth estate duty.

* I remember moving, I think in 1952, in this House a motion regarding the takeover of a large section of the Australian broadcasting network by **British** Press interests.

* The **British** Commonwealth has now become so diluted as to be devoid of its old meaning.

* 'Almost meaningless' would perhaps be too hard a term but the **British** Commonwealth is not what it was.

* But between the 
**British** intervention on our behalf might be surer if we kept this special relationship.

* It may be that **British** power is not so great east of Suez as once it was but at least there is still - let me say the brutal truth again - a **British** nuclear capacity which might be essential at some stage for the survival of Australia.

* By administrative arrangements **British** subjects of European descent may in general come to Australia without prior permission - from New Zealand or elsewhere.

* Since 1920 **British** subjects travelling between New Zealand and Australia have not been required to present passports upon entryto either country.

* Will he now, as part of the reaction to the proposed **British** entry into the European Common Market, undertake realistic examination and discussion with these countries I have mentioned to ensure that the full possibilities of trade with them are carried into effect and that no local political considerations will be allowed to prevent this from happening?

* I lean towards the view expressed by  Sir Peter  Medawar in his Presidential Address to the **British** Association 'On "The Effecting of All things Possible " ', when he said that 'The deterioration of the environment produced by technology is a technological problem for which technology has found, is finding and will continue to find solutions.'

* Sir Peter Medawar, Presidential Address to the **British** Association 'On "The Effecting of all Things Possible" '.

* There are a great many people resident in Australia who, because they do not come from countries which confer **British** nationality or Irish citizenship, have not had the opportunity to register to vote in this country as soon as they might.

* In his second reading speech the Minister referred to the **British** Petroleum Co. **British** Petroleum is a company in which the **British** Government owns a certain proportion of the shares.

* **British** Petroleum is one of the multinationals which this Government condemns.

* It certainly is an arm of **British** Government policy because oil supplies are vital to the fate of Britain.

* So **British** Petroleum explores not only in the North Sea but also off-shore from and onshore in Australia.

* Under current planningaircraft that can be called on in the Malaysia-Singapore integrated air defence system after the **British** withdrawal will be: 
The aircraft complement of each squadron will vary from time to time as a result of wastage and other factors, and in addition.

* **British** and New Zealand aircraft are expected to take opportunities to exercise through the region.

* **British** democracy depends on the 2-party system, and the .

* This is what the present **British** Prime Minister, a Labour Prime Minister, said recently: 
Further quotations along the same line by the **British** Prime Minister were published recently.

* -That was the **British** Labour Prime Minister.

* The fort was part of a Roman line of communications stretching from Rome itself right through the whole of Western Europe and to the **British** Isles.

* As I looked at it - I can see it in my mind's eye - these words came back 'to me: 
The Roman Empire disappeared, and today we are involved in the consideration of the disappearance of yet another empire - the **British** Empire.

* The position of the monarchy in relation to Australia and its position in relation to what I might without offence describe as being the other Crown countries in the **British** Commonwealth of Nations, are by no means identical.

* The fact remains that the **British** Empire, which Field-Marshal Smuts was able to describe in the 1930s as one of the 4 great powers, has gone.

* Nevertheless,  Mr Macmillan  has given no assurance whatsoever regarding the ultimate political consequences of **British** membership of the Common Market.

* No **British** Minister has made the slightest attempt to answer this question.

* If one reads a White Paper prepared by the Lord Chancellor in May 1967 on the legal and constitutional implications of the United Kingdom membership of European communities one is left with an overwhelming impression that **British** membership of Europe transcends completely any consideration of joining some tariff, some economic or some merchant operation.

* He said: 
What I have quoted is in my opinion evidence of one simple but very profound prop osition, namely, that the political consequences of **British** entry into Europe upon the institution of the monarchy are as yet unseen and this even by those who live in the United Kingdom itself.

* How can the citizenship of the **British** citizen be diminished without affecting pro tanto the position of the citizen in relation to the monarchy?

* Could anyone argue seriously that if the price of oil is to move up, substitute energy commodities will not move up to about the same price per **British** thermal unit, or whichever term is used to describe the energy content of any particular commodity.

* The Minister for Trade and Industry negotiated Australia's way into the United States market and negotiated freedom from the earlier **British** agreement to sell as much as we could to the United States.

* The latest figures available show that premiums on marine insurance in Australia paid to companies, most of them overseas owned - most of them **British** owned - was $46m.

* Any profits made by such an authority would go to the Commonwealth of Australia rather than to **British** insurance companies as happens today.

* This Parliament is a direct arm, if we like to call it that, of the **British** House of Commons.

* The **British** Foreign Secretary,  Dr Owen,  has noted that INFCE is scheduled for completion in 1980 and that, since the proposed Windscale plant would take at least ten years to come into operation, this will allow the outcome of INFCE to be taken into account.

* As to Australia's safeguards policy, this is not affected by a **British** decision to proceed with a new reprocessing plant.

* In September 1944, just a year later an attempt was made to repeat this raid in an operation called Rimau which unfortunately resulted in the death of 23 **British** and Australian commandos.

* As we respect them, so we feel our duty of glorifying their last moments as they deserve; and by our doing so the names of these heroes will remain in the hearts of the **British** and Australian people for evermore.

* The extreme parsimony with which awards for bravery were made when Australian forces were not under **British** command has frequently been commented upon.

* True, some export agricultural industries face difficulties through **British** entry to the EEC but the fact is that these arc the same industries which faced this threat in 1962, when we witnessed the last performance of high drama from the Minister on this subject.

* It is crass irresponsibility of the Government therefore to pursue doggedly, as it does, subsidy and price support programmes which encourage people to stay in those primary industries which need restructuring to avoid serious damage in the event of **British** entry to the EEC.

* For example, $45m in various forms of subsidy for the dairy industry to encourage more production and greater dependence on the **British** market is shameful.

* Children have, however, been born in Australia to women- both **British** and alien- who were granted visitor entry for other purposes.

* Did you give any undertaking to Lord Carrington, **British** Secretary of State for Defence, which would be negated by your actions?

* Did you give any undertaking to 'Lord Carrington, **British** Secretary of State for Defence, which would be negated by your actions?

* -This week a **British** Government inquiry recommended that a major nuclear fuel reprocessing plant should be built at Windscale.

* **British** Nuclear Fuels Ltd has acknowledged the decision as 'a complete vindication of our proposals '.

* If the inquiry's recommendation is accepted by the **British** Government, it will undermine current attempts to assert multilateral control of the dangerous aspects of nuclear power.

* Clearly, any **British** decision to go ahead with this part of the nuclear fuel cycle will seriously undermine whatever goodwill and good intentions remain in regard to the strengthening of nuclear safeguards.

* Do these fares also operate from Britain to Australia for **British** and European passengers.

* If so, how many **British** and European citizens have arrived in Australia since the introduction of the Apef fares.

* The **British** Medical Research Council has granted Professor Paton (21,000 for this research project to continue.

* I think the honourable gentleman who is now at the table, the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  had things to say about the admission of **British** migrants to Australia.

* What were the cost sharing arrangements between the Australian and **British** authorities for the capital costs in developing the base?

* How much did the **British** contribute to the capital costs?

* What requests have been made to the **British** Government concerning the screening of migrants.

* Has the **British** Government refused to co-operate on any of these requests.

* Australia has already installed the Ikara in some of its own naval ships and, of course, some **British** naval ships.

* When it was first proposed, the service was designed to provide for better communications within the **British** Commonwealth and Empire.

* recommendations were made for the adoption of certain measures for promoting and coordinating the efficiency and development of the telecommunications services of the **British** Commonwealth and Empire.

* I understand that the **British** Government owns a fair slice of the shares in **British** Petroleum.

* The honourable member spoke about the economic use of industry and for his benefit I commend him to study - if he has done any homework in this matter, although I doubt it - the publication of the **British** Sulphur Corporation Ltd which is a very respectable journal.

* What consideration has been extended to the proposal that a reciprocal agreement should be negotiated between Australia and Malta which would have the effect of extending to migrants from Malta of **British** nationality the same social service benefits which accrue to migrants from Britain and New Zealand.

* In 1982 the eyes of the people of the **British** Commonwealth, particularly Australia, will be focused on the sporting facilities of Brisbane, eminently situated in the Federal electorate of Fadden which is worthily represented in this Parliament.

* In Belgrade, I had discussions on aviation issues; in London I had wide ranging discussions on current **British** Transport policies and matters of common interest including the Concorde and High Speed Train project; while in Moscow and Leningrad, I discussed shipping, urban transport and bilateral air transport matters.

* **British** Phosphate Commission 
According to press reports, certain record manufacturing companies are requiring the payment of royalties by commercial 'broadcasting stations under the Copyright Act for use of recordings manufactured by them.

* As a result stations have discontinued the use of **British** and Australian recordings, the rights of which are held by the manufacturers concerned.

* Does he recall the way the Taiwan issue came into being: How Britain, Labour Britain, trying desperately to establish normal relations with China, opted 21 years ago to support Peking in the matter and how the **British** Labour Party and its Ministers were insulted and rejected by the Chinese Communists?

* Let me quote from a voice which the Leader of the Opposition must have forgotten, a man with one of the most distinguished and knowledgeable backgrounds on China of the wartime and immediate postwar period, a man who went with  Mr Attlee  as interpreter when the **British** Labour Party sent a mission to China in 1954.

* World War II began when the German government was convinced that the **British** would not fight.

* If I may paraphrase him,  Sir Charles  Curran, the Director-General of the **British** Broadcasting Corporation, said: 'Radio exists to serve the community in which it exists'.

* Has his attention been drawn to the **British** Government's decision to abandon plans to sell off state owned North Sea Oil assets in the form of **British** National Oil Corporation (BNOC); if so, is he able to say whether the Thatcher Government will now offer the private investor a share in the Corporation.

* -As I understand the position, the States traditionally have communicated with the Palace through the **British** Government;, that has been their decision and that hitherto has been their wish.

* In the days before television there was a **British** Broadcasting Corporation radio comedy series called Take It From Here*.

* The Government's proposal to require all future **British** migrants to renounce their **British** citizenship if they wish- 
The Minister will know from remarks made by many honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber that there have been many requests from constituents throughout Australia for a clear and definitive statement as to exactly what the Minister's new-found policy in some areas really means in terms of government administration.

* We have had difficulty in recent years - I say 'we' as a nation - in recruiting the number of **British** migrants that we have required for our purpose.

* Perhaps the honourable gentleman does not really care about the welfare of **British** migrants.

* In 1947 the editor of the  Morecombe and Herpham Visitor  published an attack on **British** Jewry for tacit support of outrages against **British** soldiers in Israel.

* It would behove members of the Opposition to agree with that eminent opinion from the top legal brains in the **British** Commonwealth.

* On 5th February the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  repeated the policy promise that the Government had decided to honour the full terms of the Five Power Arrangements and that this had been confirmed to Lord Carrington, **British** Defence Minister, on his visit to Australia.

* The phrase 'honour the full terms' clearly means more to the **British** partners in the Arrangements thanit does to the Labor Party.

* In addition to the abovementioned countries Australian dried vine fruits receive favourable tariff treatment in a number of **British** Commonwealth countries and Ireland.

* It has heard somewhere that the **British** Labor Government set up a statutory corporation to run the Post Office in that country and, as good Socialists, it has decided that Australia should follow suit.

* When one reflects on the economic mess into which the Wilson Government plunged Britain and when one thinks of the way it was swept from office by the **British** voters, I do not think it is an example which the Australian Labor Party should wish to follow.

* Even the **British** Post Office, as a statutory authority, is required by Act of Parliament to show a return of 10 per cent on investment in its telecommunications services, and 2 per cent on expenditure in its postal services.

* It recognises the necessity of strengthening our representation in Brussels following **British** entry and it recognises the need to have technical experts on the staff in order to be able to handle the agricultural problems.

* he ceases to be a person who is an Australian citizen or who otherwise has the status of a **British** subject; 
The Bill before the House relates to seamen's war pensions and allowances.

* The Act which it amends was first passed in 1940 to provide appropriate war pension benefits for Australian seamen and their dependants, having been framed on **British** war pensions legislation but drawn to conform to Australian conditions, chiefly along the lines of the Australian Repatriation Act.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that an examination by Australian and **British** officials of records relating to the burial of radioactive material at Maralinga revealed anomalies in the available information; if so, what were these anomalies.

* Is it a fact that only one burial pit was examined during the visit of **British** and Australian officials to Maralinga.

* There is a good example to follow in the **British** and Indian practices whereby the public accounts committees, after putting their reports to their respective parliaments, have a significant annual debate wherein trends in public finance are discussed in detail.

* Committee System to be cognisant of this fundamental factor and that lessons be learnt from the **British** system and the errors and trauma that Britain has lived through during the past 50 years in trying to establish a competent system of expenditure committees.

* There is a definite link between lack of cereal fibre in people's diets and heart disease, according to a recent **British** survey.

* (a) The **British** Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) made an ex gratia offer to the Banaban people, without admission of liability, of approximately $A10m in May 1977 following the failure of the Banabans to obtain a court order asking that they should receive further back-payments of royalties on phosphate mined by the BPC.

* The **British** Government has also made a substantial offer to the Banabans for establishment and development costs on Rabi Island in Fiji, where the majority of the Banabans live.

* Gilbert Islands) Independence Bill, at present before the **British** Parliament, for the Banabans to retain their freedom of access to Ocean Island.

* It is worth remembering that in recent years both the **British** and the United States governments have sought to restrict much of the capital exported into developing countries like Australia.

* But let us always remember that the United States of America itself was built up on foreign capital, mainly **British**, and expanded into the industrial giant it is today.

* The **British** system of having a political secretary in every Minister's office has been put up as being the ideal system.

* Is this another harebrained scheme of the Labor Party such as that the **British** Labour Government entered into under the leadership of Wilson or such as those seen in other socialist countries where the government has taken the money from the people and wasted it in building schemes it has not thought out?

* Firstly,  Mr Stonehouse  did not openly and freely proclaim himself as John Stonehouse, M.P., member of the **British** House of Commons, when he sought to enter Australia.

* The entry privilege in Australia is not granted by the **British** Government; it is granted by the Australian Government.

* As embarrassing as it might be for the **British** Government, it is not its role to solve our problems for us.

* It must be said and repeated that **British** justice requires a man to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.

* A report in the Melbourne 'Age' of 14 February stated that 2 Government appointed inspectors were preparing to fly to Australia to interview runaway **British** politician John Stonehouse about his business affairs.

* We have, therefore, agreed on a package of new and beneficial initiatives for developing countries which are briefly as follows: The modification of procedures under the Australian system of tariff preferences; the elimination of **British** Preferential Tariffs on items of interest to developing countries; an increased number of regular visits by trade officials for trade consultations; the establishment of a showroom for developing country products in either Sydney or Melbourne; and further expansion of the Australian system of tariff preferences.

* On the matter of **British** preferences the Government has been conscious of the existence of an anomalous situation in which for certain goods **British** suppliers enjoyed a margin of preference over developing countries arising from the continued existence of preferences to Britain in our tariff.

* That time has now come and accordingly it has been decided to remove the **British** preference on some 500 tariff items of interest to developing countries and thereby remove an anomaly which permitted developing country products to be disadvantaged in our market.

* **British** preference will remain on a range of tariff items in which developing countries interest is not significant even though Australia's obligations to give Britain preference ceased in February 1973.

* Had that timetable continued all **British** preferences would have been phased out by now.

* In the last 24 hours, approaches have been made by the **British** Government to this Government.

* Subsequently he brought together under his chairmanship representatives of the **British** political parties.

* ls he able to stale whether the first fast breeder power station is expected to enter the United Kingdom power grid well before 1980 and that a short time thereafter the majority of **British** reactors are expected to be of this type.

* There have been disclosures of Liberal Party fund raising among **British** companies in the 1950s.

* Has the Treasury inquired into the alleged practice of international advertising agencies receiving donations at their American or **British** headquarters for Australian political campaigns and keeping those donations overseas as instalments of the annual dividends due from their Australian subsidiaries?

* Only 3 weeks ago a statutory declaration was produced in this House from a man employed by  Sir Robert  Menzies and  Sir Frank  Packer to raise money, $lm at present values, for the Liberals from **British** companies for the election in 1951.

* The inveterate Liberal spokesman,  Mr David  McNicoll, revealed in 1948 that Lord Casey had gone to England, and I quote  Mr McNicoll,  'to rustle up 100,000 from **British** businessmen'.

* This is what the **British** worker is missing out on.

* The shipyards in the Clyde area were subsidised by the **British** Government because they tried to be competitive with the shipyards in Europe and Japan.

* The **British** Government reached the stage when it said that the subsidy to the Clyde shipyards had gone too high, and therefore the shipyards made the decision that they would have to close down.

* This afternoon, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition sought to say that the **British** Government has not told him what is going on.

* Why is it that he believes something which is written in the book which suits his cause and purpose, yet he will not believe any information supplied to him on the authority of a **British** Labour government?

* Does he intend to say that  Sir Harold  Wilson misled this Government and did not even bother to inform the last Labor Government of the **British** Government's actions?

* In any democratic situation - at any rate, in areas which founded their system of Government on the **British** system - there is another factor to be considered, that is, what we on this side of the House are for the time being, namely,  Her  Majesty's Opposition.

* The **British** have 80 square miles in 2 areas on the southern part of the island, for which they are paying to the Greek Government Stg 18m a year in rent.

* They are situated in the **British** zone.

* The Australian contingent is in the **British** zone.

* In Australia's police contingent there are 3 or 4 men from South 
I ask the Minister for Supply: Have quantities of radioactive waste from **British** nuclear establishments been dumped in Australia?

* One of the interest.ng differences between, say, **British** management and American management in many of these matters is that the **British** enter into a partnership at this level with Australians - I presume they do so in other countries - but with the Americans it is a total takeover.

* In any case, however, the **British** High Commission has advised that a new order made under the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 applies the new International Collision Regulations to all Australian States except Queensland.

* If this applies it means that ships which are engaged only in intrastate trade are still registered and operate under the **British** Act.

* It appears that ships engaged in intrastate trade only are still registered and still operate under the **British** Act - the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, which was amended by the United Kingdom Parliament in 1958.

* But the amendment does not make it clear whether it applies to **British** ships registered in the Australian States.

* Can the State parliaments pass laws concerning these **British** ships?

* Many of these countries require the same qualifications as the United Kingdom requires - that is, a ship must be owned by a **British** subject or subjects or a body corporate having its principal place of business in Her Majesty's Dominions.

* The policy of this Government of permitting **British** ships with Indian crews to carry coastal passengers has destroyed the Australian coastal passenger fleet.

* It was not acceptable to his Prime Minister in Britain or, we must assume, to most of the Prime Ministers with whom the **British** Prime Minister communicated at the time.

* It is important that we take note of what has happened in countries like Britain which have universal pensions and which have found it necessary to apply a means test so that no less than  2VA  has cent of the **British** pensioners receive another pension- a means tested pension.

* I said: 'I am reading about this crowd that built the Hawker Siddeley plane that we came over in having to pay back to the **British** Government 5m in excess profits'.

* This is private enterprise- 5m in profits over and above a company's normal profits in fulfilling a defence contract to the **British** Government.

* That is not exploitation of the **British** taxpayer.

* The **British** Government found out and asked the company to hand back its excess profits.

* But, up to the present, the limitation levels and the system have been those established in the old **British** Merchant Shipping Acts of 1894 and 1900.

* Another of the main alterations which this Bill introduces is in respect of visiting **British** ships.

* Part II of the Act deals with crewing matters and, until recently, was in line with similar provisions in the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act, with both laws applied to a visiting **British** ship whilst in Australia.

* I am advised that the **British** Government requires that, save with express permission, no senior public servant may take up such a position within two years of leaving the **British** Civil Service.

* In the first place, the article refers to an application by **British** Cargo Airlines, formerly IAS Cargo Airlines, which in the last couple of years was given a right by me to bring back split charters from the West on the return voyage for the carriage of Western Australian lamb.

* I have said to **British** Cargo that millions of tonnes of freight come into this country and that it is welcome to develop any freight carriage proposal in respect of that freight.

* The end result is that I have had to say no to **British** Cargo on this issue.

* Australia had a reserve price in 1921 when the **British** Government guaranteed a fixed price of 8c a lb.

* 1 ) and (2) The total number of seats available to Apex passengers on **British** Airways and Qantas services to the UK is on average 4,450 per week.

* We might remember that when a **British** administration in 1968-69 intended to withdraw completely from Malaysia and Singapore, Australia and New Zealand said they would take responsibilities alone.

* In the event **British** policy was changed to allow retention of a permanent force in the area and the positive attitude of the Australian Government was rewarded.

* Nothing conveyed to me during my discussions in Malaysia and Singapore could confirm any view other than a view of the continuing relevance and importance of the Five Power arrangements, and of the significance for those arrangements of the continued presence of Australian, New Zealand and **British** forces in the area.

* The physical presence of those forces is an integral part of the only Five Power defence arrangements that make sense in the present and in foreseeable circumstances - a fact which the present **British** Government immediately recognised upon coming to power, and a matter upon which there seems to be a measure of bipartisan agreement in New Zealand, our close neighbour.

* The **British** Government, of course, has for long been a major shareholder in the **British** Petroleum Company Ltd.

* In 1920, the Hughes Government and the presently-named **British** Petroleum Company agreed to form, with a Government holding of one share more than 50 per cent, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries, for the purposes of constructing a refinery and arranging a suitable supply of crude oil.

* The Committee leant, therefore, towards **British** experience and practice rather than the experience and practice of the United States.

* In the Australian and **British** system the executive is directly responsible to and is part of Parliament.

* For these reasons the Committee believes that **British** practice arid experience is much more applicable to ours than would be the American.

* My visit to the United Kingdom followed immediately after the House of Commons had voted in favour of **British** entry into the European Economic Community.

* In London I had detailed discussions with the Prime Minister,  Mr Heath;  the Foreign Secretary,  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home; the Minister for Defence, Lord Carrington; the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  Mr Barber;  the Minister responsible for the **British** relations with the European Economic Community,  Mr Rippon;  and the Governor of the Bank of England.

* I also addressed the Cook Society, the Confederation of **British** Industries and the Australia-**British** Trade Association.

* Naturally, I spent a great deal of time discussing the **British** entry into the European Economic Community.

* I started from the point that, while we had been disappointed at the terms agreed upon for **British** entry, those terms were now a fact and we should look towards the best arrangements we could make for the future.

* I also pressed strongly for assurances that during the transitional period the **British** would adopt as helpful an attitude as possible to Australian commodities affected by the **British** entry.

* Mr Rippon  also explained fully the inclusion of a clause in the entry agreement that if imports of an agricultural commodity subject to import levies were seriously affected or likely to be affected by **British** entry, either Australia or Britain would have the right to raise the matter before the commission.

* Assurances - the value of which admittedly can only be fully tested in time - that Britain would, during the transitional period, be ready to discuss on a commodity basis those commodities likely to be affected by **British** entry into the Common Market, were reaffirmed to me.

* I urged upon **British** Ministers the need for the EEC to adopt measures to ensure that the exports of tropical produce from Papua New Guinea are in a no less favourable position than those from other developing countries which are to receive special treatment.

* Notwithstanding that Papua New Guinea is still a trust territory, the **British** are hopeful for early progress towards agreement on this matter.

* During my talk with the Chancellor, I raised with him my concern that the voluntary restraint on the movement of **British** capital to Australia should not be maintained, while, at the same time, movements of capital were liberalised in respect of the EEC countries with consequent disadvantage to the traditional flow to Australia.

* These views were generally well received and **British** interests with whom I discussed the matter continue to regard Australia as a country of promise and a suitable place for **British** investment.

* This included strong confirmation of the policy that the **British** and Australian High Commissioners should have, when needed, immediate direct access to the respective Prime Ministers.

* I had useful and wide-ranging discussions on defence matters with the **British** Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Foreign Secretary.

* I am aware that the **British** Government is actively considering, with other Governments in the five power arrangement, further areas of co-operation in the defence field.

* I was left in no doubt about **British** concern for the implications of the Soviet naval influence in the area.

* As a result of my visit, the Australian Government now has a deeper appreciation of American and **British** thinking on a wide range of international issues of importance to us, such as: The **British** entry in the EEC; the future of China and Taiwan; the future for Vietnam and Cambodia; the Soviet presence in the Indian Ocean; overseas trade; President Nixon's forthcoming visits to Moscow and Peking; the international monetary situation; and the Rhodesian situation.

* For our part, I was able to give American and **British** Leaders a clearer picture of our Government's thinking on the role we expect to play in the Asian and Pacific region.

* Comparisons have been made between the Government's proposed health scheme and the **British** national health scheme.

* The **British** scheme, as should be well known, is based on a system of payment to doctors according to the number of patients they have registered on their list or on their panel.

* I ask the' Minister for Immigration: Are all " migrants who are **British** subjects given the same opportunity to apply foi and be granted Australian citizenship?

* If not, what are the reasons for differentiating between **British** subjects?

* The **British** are in much the same position.

* The **British** have some kind of representation in Hanoi.

* The point about the **British** is that they are on the ground in all the places that matter and somehow we ought to be encouraging them to use their good offices.

* It has been taken against the findings, so far as we know - it is in this regard that we want to find out the facts - of the **British** firm of specialist consultants hired to assist the Commonwealth-State committee.

* This **British** firm of R. Travers Morgan and Partners worked with an environmental study group established, so far as I understand, by that committee.

* The Commonwealth-State committee commissioned a cost-benefit study by the **British** firm R. Travers  Morgan  and Partners, the cost of which would be part of the $500,000.

* The committee, as I have said, commissioned at great cost, the study by the **British** consultants, which took the form of a complex and comprehensive cost-benefit study of alternative sites.

* As I understand it, the study by the **British** consultants was supplemented by investigations by an environmental study group established by the committee.

* Rather than the reverse being the case, I see as auguring well for the future links within the Commonwealth the fact that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting took place at Sydney which evoked with such success responses from countries which formerly were members of the **British** Commonwealth.

* There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party in their attitudes towards the **British** Commonwealth traditionally have tended to see it as almost an anachronism in modern days.

* Although the **British** Commonwealth no longer exists, we see the Commonwealth of Nations, which is its successor, as not giving any one country within the Commonwealth paramountcy but rather giving to each of its individual members an equal right to share and participate in discussions.

* by Simon Haxey points out how the munition makers of the world were controlled by private enterprise and were in the hands of many **British** politicians.

* They had shares in German munition works and Germany had shares in **British** munition works including Vickers and the like.

* This was not only the thinking of the honourable member for Hunter, it was also the thinking of very prominent statesmen and leading **British** citizens of the Lord Russell type and others who have a certain following throughout the world.

* , (3) and (4) The Australian Government is being kept aware of the views of the **British**  and  Irish Governments through normal diplomatic channels.

* Of course, we really do not know whether the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission and the **British** Phosphate Commission have not done as well out of Christmas Island phosphate as the 
Finally, a number of sundry issues might properly be included within such an inquiry's terms of reference.

* There have been reports that the **British** Phosphate Commission has continued to bring to Australia phosphate which contains high cadmium contamination and which the Japanese refused to accept some 5 years ago.

* There is agitation to have the financial details of the **British** Phosphate Commission's trade store on Christmas Island investigated and the results of the investigation made available to interested parties.

* Has the Minister been informed that the **British** Trade Union Conference and the **British** Government have in the national interest agreed to limit pay rises to 4.5 per cent next year with a maximum of $A6 a week and a minimum of $A2.50 a week?

* Has the Minister also been informed that the **British** Government's expectation is that this would halve the inflation rate in the United Kingdom in 1977 and would bring the rate down to about 10 per cent?

* Will he inform  Mr Hawke,  the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, of the statesmanlike and strong support by  Mr Len  Murray, the General Secretary of the **British** Trade Union Conference, and ask  Mr Hawke  whether he will, in Australia's interest, take a similar national and statesmanlike approach to that problem too?

* At the time that it was set up the **British** Prime Minister made it abundantly and unequivocally clear that the setting up of this committee was quite satisfactory to him but that he would be in no way inhibited as to the timing of any action he thought he should take in **British** interests.

* We agreed to join with a committee, knowing as all other members of the committee knew, the attitude of the **British** Prime Minister.

* Instead we find the vast majority of programmes typify American or **British** attitudes and institutions, their manners and customs, their traditions and heroes and, of course, their manner of speech and in general their way of life.

* I submit that 'Riptide' tended to fail because it was written not by Australians but by **British** writers who were not familiar with Australian contemporary conditions.

* The programme 'Joan and Leslie' had a similar lack of success with adapted **British** scripts.

* The big men can look after themselves, but Napoleon did not crack the **British** mainly because they were a nation of shopkeepers- a diverse nation of entrepreneurs, a people of skill and ability.

* The Press incorrectly stated that a decision was taken at the meeting to the effect that the **British** Government should be warned that the credibility of the Commonwealth would be endangered if Britain recognised the new administration.

* The meeting determined that an eight-man delegation would meet with the **British** Foreign Secretary.

* In deciding to approach Lord Carrington, the Commonwealth Committee is seeking to do no more than respond in a helpful way to the **British** Government's own expressed desire to consult with the Commonwealth and others.

* The honourable member also stated that because of cut-backs in Australia's production, the industry and producers have lost S8m alone in the **British** market.

* He regretted the passing, the severance- the cutting of the nexus, if one likes to put it that way in an historical sense, with the **British** source of our common law.

* The **British** common law that we inherited did not grow up by means of a system whereby a superior c court, a court of final appeal, existed in, say, Eskimo land or somewhere like that by which **British** litigants could bypass their own High Court of appeal and go to Eskimo land.

* How do honourable members opposite think the common law would have developed if that had been the historical experience of the **British** people.

* But there can be little doubt that the **British** law and its superior courts are undergoing great periods of change as they accommodate themselves to other systems of law in their part of the world.

* The degree of expertise, the degree of judicial competence surely cannot be stretched so far as to say to **British** judges, no matter how good they might be and they are good: 'Look, in addition to your own tasks in the final court of appeal in the United Kingdom you have to look after a significant number of appeals from Australia too'.

* That is true but the twist comes when, as the honourable member for Moreton, I think it was, said that the States are still in one sense colonies of the **British** Crown.

* If I may I will be specific and refer to such programmes as 'Italian Panorama', 'French Panorama', 'Deutschland Spiegel' and, of course, the **British** Commonwealth Office of Information programmes.

* The **British** have been exporting underground coal technology for China's mines.

* The **British** Government made it quite clear that that would not happen.

* The **British** Minister,  Mr Varley,  who has recently been in China, will issue a statement on the nature of Britain's trading agreement with China in view of the fact that Australia has played a leading part in encouraging and in helping the modernisation program in China.

* Is he able to say who is the **British** ConsulGeneral in Hong Kong.

* Has he received any messages from the **British** Consul-General in Hong Kong for transmission to the Prime Minister (Hansard, 7th April 1971, pages 1549 and 1557).

* A week ago, in answer to the honourable member for Murray, the Minister stated that he was aware of only minor newspaper reports of a letter to  Mr Leslie  Huckfield, M.P., in which  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home said there had been no representations from Canberra concerning the protection of Australia's interests during the transitional period of Britain's entry into the Common Market, and the Minister said that he just did not believe that  Sir Alec  was not aware of his criticism of the **British** Government about the transitional arrangements.

* I ask the Minister whether he has since checked that on 12th May  Sir Alec  sent a letter to  Mr Huckfield,  and on 15tb May gave him an answer in Parliament in these terms: 
You ask what representations the **British** Government have received on this subject.

* On 31 December 1971, the **British** Government expressed interest in having one of its nuclear-powered submarines visit Australian ports.

* William McMahon informed the **British** Prime Minister, the Rt Hon.

* Edward Heath, that the Australian Government was reviewing the control arrangements and conditions relating to the entry of nuclear-powered ships to Australian ports, and that the **British** Government would be advised when the review was complete.

* The Minister capped his attitude following the signing when, in the true tradition of the **British** conqueror, he handed out the rewards.

* It certainly will not continue forever but it was designed to fill the gap left after the **British** withdrawal from the area.

* If the 5-power arrangement does fail, and it could well happen if the ALP comes to office, the vacuum caused by this and the **British** withdrawal could be filled by some other power.

* As from 1 December of this year, as a result of the amendments forced upon the Government recently by the Opposition in the Senate to the Australian Citizenship Bill 1973, **British** subjects registering for Australian citizenship will be required to participate in the public citizenship ceremony.

* In my own area - the Newcastle region - there have been reports in the Press and even, I understand, letters to some of the columnists of **British** settlers having complained because they have not had the opportunity previously to participate in these ceremonies.

* But, as I have said, as a result of the amendments forced upon the Government by the Opposition in the Senate, as from 1 December settlers from the United Kingdom and any of the other **British** Commonwealth of Nations countries will be required to renounce their allegiance in the oath sworn at such citizenship ceremonies.

* I am very sure that there are going to be considerable misgivings by settlers who come here from the **British** Commonwealth of Nations at having to renounce allegiance to their country of origin, particularly if it is the United Kingdom.

* It fought very hard to have the renunciation sentence excluded from the oath, but, as I said earlier, as a result of the efforts of the Opposition in the Senate all candidates for naturalisation and for citizenship will be required to renounce allegiance to the country within the **British** Commonwealth of Nations from which they have come.

* High Court and Federal judges hold office for life because of a decision given in 1918 that because at the time our Constitution was drawn up judges in England held office for life, therefore, judges mentioned in our Constitution, which is a **British** Act of Parliament, held office for life.

* At least he will not be a **British** official, as all present State Governors are, bearing a commission signed by the Queen of Britain and countersigned by the **British** Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

* The **British** Steel Corporation, Holland, France, Italy, Western Germany - you name it - are ali making inquiries.

* I regard that decision by the **British** Government as a very bold and courageous break with regulation.

* Australia has always been, as he would know, a favoured place for **British** investment.

* I believe that the consequences of the decision will be beneficial not only in relation to the United Kingdom economy but also, more particularly, in relation to the level of **British** investment in Australia.

* Robin Day of the **British** Broadcasting Corporation has written a fascinating and challenging article which everybody in Australia interested in this field should ponder.

* His  article, which is published in the **British** publication Encounter' is entitled Troubled Reflections of a Television Journalist*.

* Honourable members will recall that the Labor Party was most anxious to nationalise the doctors, to regiment them and subject them to some form of compulsion such as there is in the **British** scheme.

* The **British** scheme is not only a failure; it is a costly failure.

* The **British** scheme is also a failure because it has not been able to develop 1 new hospital over the last 10 years or more.

* These include: optional preferential marking of ballot-paper; printing of party affiliations of candidates on ballot-papers; registration of political parties for purposes of identification and printing of affiliations on ballot-papers; introduction of mobile polling booths at hospitals and similar institutions; drawing for positions of candidates on House of Representatives ballot-papers; closing of the polls at 6 p.m. rather than 8 p.m.; requiring a candidate changing his name within 12 months prior to nominations to declare the change, and providing for the former name to be included on the ballotpaper; prevention of persons enrolling or nominating for election under changed names in certain circumstances; an earlier deadline for the return of postal votes and for the return of postal votes direct to respective returning officers; restricting postal vote application forms to be used at an election or referendum to those specified by notice in the Gazette; prohibiting the listing of names of persons who apply for postal votes, except in certain specified circumstances; providing postal voting facilities for prisoners who have retained their franchise entitlements; increasing the amount of deposit required with nomination and varying the conditions under which deposits may be saved; preservation of the voting entitlement of Australian citizens posted overseas in the service of the Crown, and retention on the roll of the name of an elector temporarily absent from his address; precluding nomination for election to the Australian Parliament of a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory; prevention of a person from nominating as a candidate for more than one Federal election held on the same day; protection of candidates against the issue of misleading how-to-vote cards; change in qualifications for enrolment, voting and candidature from '**British** subject' to 'status of a **British** subject'; eliminating the need to state the address of author in the case of broadcasting or telecasting of political matters; the manner of announcing the name of an author of political matter on radio or television; responsibility for publication of matter or comment of a political nature in the Press between issue of the writ and the close of the poll; removal of the restriction on exhibition of electoral posters within a hall or room being used for political party meetings; provision of support staff for Distribution Commissioners; authority for alterations to the roll when a street is renamed or renumbered; lowering the permissible age of presiding officers or assisting presiding officers to 18 years; appointment of substitute assistant returning officer at places outside Australia in certain circumstances; increases in penalties for failure to enrol; the provision of fines as an alternative to imprisonment where relevant; amounts of monetary penalties to match imprisonment terms; amendment of questions to be put to voters by presiding officers; conversion of distances to metric measurements; use of 'given names' in lieu of 'Christian names'; candidates making gifts, donations, etc., prior to an election; retitling of the Act.

* It is also proposed that the provisions relating to enrolment and nomination be amended so that the wording 'status of a **British** subject' is substituted for the term '**British** subject'.

* Following amendments to that Act in 1969, the term '**British** subject' is obsolete for these purposes, having been replaced by the wording 'the status of a **British** subject'.

* I have in mind a White Paper presented to the **British** Government 2 years ago which stated this theme.

* Earlier I quoted from a paper delivered by the **British** Conservative Government.

* But the conservative elements on the other side of the House are so conservative that it takes them a long time to catch up with the progressive attitudes which are taken by the **British** Conservative Party.

* Therefore, despite withdrawal of America Airlines flights between Australia and the United States from March 1974 and cessation of **British** Airways' Pacific services early in 1975 .

* We put pressure on the Americans to pull their airline out, the same as we put pressure on the **British** Overseas Aircraft Corporation, which is now **British** Airways, to pull its aircraft out of what is called the Southern Cross route.

* There is probably the largest cross section of migrants and ethnic groups in Australia- **British**, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Yugoslav, Croatian, Lebanese and substantial Chinese and Philippines communities.

* Between 1815, when the **British** Army had reached a reasonable stage of active service, and about 1850 when the Crimean War came about, the **British** Army degenerated into a farce because of inability through budgetary problems to continue actively to train.

* Prime Minister Callaghan, in particular,  Mr Wedgwood  Benn and I held lengthy discussions concerning **British** requirements.

* It is only a tragedy that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has tried to involve  Dr Mabon  in domestic politics in Australia when his comments were made from the heart and from a **British** national interest.

* That is a very odd concept indeed for the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition to suggest to a senior and significant **British** Minister.

* At the same time, I said that a separate order for 12 rapid intervention fire tenders from a **British** company had been cancelled because the vehicles delivered had not met the required specifications and were unsuitable for the task required of them.

* One Sydney newspaper interpreted this, in both an article and an editorial, as the cancellation of the **British** order at a cost to the public purse of $450,000, with the United States order replacing the cancelled tenders.

* The original order for the **British** built rapid intervention tenders was placed by the former Government in May 1 975.

* The American built vehicles are not to replace the **British** built tenders but were designed to complement them in the airport rescue and fire fighting plan.

* So in this way you shrink the incentive to invest and set us on the path to the **British** disease of a shrinking productive sector.

* On 29th October 1972 at Butterworth in Malaysia he was allegedly assaulted by a number of **British** servicemen.

* The 
**British** soldier concerned has been charged with assault and will be tried by a **British** court martial.

* Has he designated for this purpose either the **British** Wool Federation or Interline?

* Is it a fact that QBE Insurance Ltd, through a subsidiary known as Equitable Life and General Insurance, was involved in a transaction with the **British** Friends Provident Group?

* In addition to this, I am informed that the wages of **British** seamen have increased by 40 per cent in this period.

* I do not know whether that is fair, but our Department of Foreign Affairs certainly is modelled very closely on the **British** Foreign Office.

* Anyone who doubts the limitations of the intelligence processing ability of the **British** Foreign Office should study the history of its intelligence assessments over the interwar and Second World War years.

* It conforms to a **British** Government Specification DTD406B.

* The reason why it is not the slightest bit strange for us to use the example of Britain is that the Labor alternative health scheme is based on the **British** and Canadian health schemes.

* If honourable members opposite want an authority for that, I refer to a discussion I had with  Dr Deeble  when I put to him the question: 'Would you say that it was a fair characterisation of the Labor scheme to describe it as an amalgam of the **British** and Canadian health schemes?'

* One of the saddest features of the **British** health scheme - this is a great warning to anyone in Australia who talks of a Government takeover or a great extension of Government financing in the health system - is that if the Government becomes deeply involved in this area other people will move out of financing health care.

* What objective assessments have been made regarding the effects of noise and other hazards created by the **British** Concorde supersonic jet aircraft.

* Have **British** and Australian insurance companies refused to cover policy holders against damage caused by the sonic boom.

* If the **British** and Canadian systems are so bad, why have not the governments in those countries repealed the relevant legislation and returned to the voluntary system to which the Opposition wants to hold Australia.

* A conservative government was in office in the United Kingdom for 13 years after the **British** health system was introduced and it saw fit to continue with it and expand upon it.

* Even though the Opposition makes an improper comparison between the **British** system and our program, the Opposition's friends in the United Kingdom saw fit to continue with the **British** health care system.

* The latter is a problem with fish caught off the Japanese coast and in some **British** coastal waters.

* **British** trawlers are forbidden to trawl for fish off certain parts of Scotland because of the nuclear contamination that exists.

* At the same time we were given information by the **British** Phosphate Commission that Christmas Island would have economic deposits to keep it going until at least the latter part of the 1980s.

* Then the **British** troops came back and the Chiang Kai-shek forces in the north came back and they differed from the **British** only in that their pay-off went to their generals and not to big business.

* In general it agrees with the medical findings of the **British** Government report written in 1968.

* It is the **British** Government report entitled 'Cannabis' published in 1968.

* Paragraph 46 states that the **British** Ministry of Health reported 82 cases admitted to hospital in 1966 with a diagnosis of drug addiction where cannabis seemed to be involved.

* The overstrained, manufactured Australianism of 'Agc of Consent' should be enough to convince any adult filmgoer of the total inadequacy, so far as Australian self-interpretation is concerned, of the **British**- or American-based film project which uses Australia as a location.

* The House of Representatives has passed motions of condolence in 1942 on the death of Prince George, who had been designated as GovernorGeneral and whose wife, elder son and daughter have since made memorable visits to Australia; in 1953 on the death of King George VI, who had opened this Parliament House; in 1965 on the death of the Princess Royal, whose elder son contributes so much to the style and fortunes of the Australian Opera; and in 1972 on the death of the eldest member of the family, King Edward VIII, the most charismatic **British** prince since Bonny Prince Charlie.

* He was Chief Liaison Officer with the **British** Expeditionary Force in France until Dunkirk and was mentioned in despatches.

* In 1955 he became the fifteenth and latest member of the **British** Royal Family to be appointed a field-marshal.

* We are also the heirs to the **British** tradition.

* It is worth making a special mention of the fact that it was recognised by the Conference that any Australian sugar displaced from the **British** market after the termination of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement at 31 December 1974 would be added, ton for ton, to Australia's basic export tonnage which was set at 1,650,000 metric tons-H)r some 550,000 tons above the equivalent figure in the present Agreement.

* Accordingly, even if the whole of Australia's negotiated price quota of 361,000 tons was displaced from its traditional **British** market outlet after December 1974, our basic export tonnage would have risen to over 2 million metric tons.

* Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,  Mr Geoffrey  Rippon, in the **British** House of Commons on 15th May 1972, regarding transitional arrangements for Australia on Britain's entry into the European Economic Community.

* Will he indicate how the satisfactory arrangements referred to by the **British** negotiator are satisfactory in regard to the Australian canned fruits industry which was established largely to serve the **British** market within the terms of the Ottawa Agreement and continued under the Anglo-Australian Trade Agreement which will be abrogated by Britain on entry into the European Economic Community on 1st January 1973.

* The **British** have released their records of the  S.S. Duneera  incident, in which they figure much worse than we do, but we have not.

* Portugal threatened to break off a treaty which she had had with Britain for many years under which **British** warships were allowed to use bases in Portugal.

* I made some study of the conflict between India and China over the McMahon line and I believe, as many important world figures who have made greater studies than I have - **British** people - that China was correct over the border dispute with India and the McMahon line.

* Also, China is giving a substantial grant of about $70m to one of the **British** Commonwealth countries, Ceylon.

* The **British** have already planned for two or three airports and the French have constructed three.

* 1 ) Australia, as with Britain and New Zealand provides one of the **British** Phosphate Commissioners, (BPC).

* against the **British** Crown (the 'Royalties' case) for damages in respect of alleged insufficient royalties collected for phosphate rock mined on Ocean Island and unjust apportionment of the royalties collected.

* Particularly of course does this apply to those people who have lived in Australia for a great number of years, whether they be of **British** origin or non-**British** origin.

* If members of the Opposition doubt that I invite them to look at what the former **British** Labour Government was doing to the job creation schemes that were established by the Wilson and Callaghan governments in the 1970s.

* It is not possible to say now what the final effects of **British** entry will be but satisfactory alternative markets will be found for some of the displaced trade.

* The **British** response, through the **British** Prime Minister and the **British** Foreign Secretary, is that they have no proposals before them.

* The **British** Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,  Mr Tom  Prior, said in a letter to  Mr Leslie  Huckfield, the **British** member of Parliament: 
The sad, sick situation is that these people are given the Queen's honours for exploiting.

* The second corporation was largely owned in 1969 by the Royal Bank of Scotland and the **British** Wagon Co. which held 30 per cent of shares and the South Pacific Insurance Group which held 8 per cent of shares.

* In most former **British** dependencies the **British** Government, through the Governor, retained ultimate responsibility for internal security up until the time of independence itself, but whatever arrangements were arrived at prior to that date seem to have been based upon the particular situation in each dependency.

* In fact, the most serious difficulty so far encountered arose last week over Lord Carrington's understandable ruling that the parties had to accept the **British** constitutional proposal before going on to the second stage of the conference, to discuss arrangements for the interim period before independence.

* Although it continued to have reservations- and stated them- about certain aspects of the constitution, it said that it accepted the **British** proposal, also subject to the satisfactory negotiation of interim arrangements, and it then rejoined the constitutional talks.

* Referring now to the discussions on interim arrangements, we have kept in contact with the **British** Government.

* Yesterday the **British** tabled a series of proposals for the transitional period, and the honourable member referred to them in his question.

* The provision to which the honourable member referred and which is part of the **British** proposal does relate to Commonwealth observers.

* The Government believes that the **British** Government and, I think it is fair to say, Lord 
Our fleet numbers will increase and we will have to take an increasing interest in the Indian Ocean as the **British** withdraw.

* The **British** have reversed the decision to withdraw.

* The east of the Suez embargo, which was the product of a previous **British** Labor Government, has now been changed and if we are to think of defence in this new contemporary situation we should probably have regard as to whether there will be utilisation of the Singapore facilities.

* The Prime Minister said: 
and (2) The Soviet Union has never asked the **British** Government to reconvene the Geneva Conference on Vietnam.

* The **British** Government has made a variety of approaches.

* Specific instances since July 1962 are as follows: 
On 20th April 1972 the **British** Ambassador in Moscow reminded  Mr Gromyko  of this suggestion.

* The battle of Jutland was the first occasion on which the **British** and German navies actually came into each other's sight.

* This was so much so that in the sporting terms of Admiral Beatty at the commencement of the battle between the German battle cruiser squadron and the **British** battle cruiser force, when two of Beatty 's battle cruisers were blown up Beatty remarked in a jocular fashion to his flag captain: There seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today'.

* Some damage was done to the enemy, none to the **British**.

* The **British** fleet steamed slowly southwards, the battleships in the van, the destroyers and light forces in the rear.

* For the first and only time in the war the **British** Grand Fleet was between the High Seas Fleet - 
That is the German fleet- and its base.

* When all the signals and movements were later analysed, it was evident that the Germans, between the hours of 10.00 p.m. and midnight, crashed through the light forces following the **British** battleships without the **British** C-in-C appreciating what was happening only 10 miles to the north of him.

* The primary purpose of that agreement was to supply the **British** market, because we were all then part of an imperial system and were a closed shop, so to speak, in trade.

* Did the **British** Government through its High Commission, or in any other way, indicate to the Government or to officials of **British** Airways that the Russian violinist Georgi Ermolenko was not to be carried on United Kingdom aircraft out of Australia from Perth Airport.

* Is there any information available to the Government on the attitude of the **British** Government to the carriage of  Mr Ermolenko  from Australia; if so, what are the details.

* In a case in 1914 concerning a member of the **British** House of Commons who had dealings in bullion with the Government of India the judge felt obliged to award the common informer 13,000.

* Probably this is the one example of why the common informer clause should remain in law, although the **British** Parliament has taken action to remove it completely.

* Under the Common Informers Act 1951 the **British** Parliament abolished common informer procedures for a wide range of statutes, some dating back to the sixteenth century.

* In the House of Commons Disqualification of Members Act 1957 the **British** Parliament abolished provisions relating to the disqualification of members who entered into contracts, agreements or commissions with the Public Service.

* Practice', the **British** Parliament also has passed from time to time special Acts to indemnify parliamentarians against common informer procedures.

* According to an official statement of the position by the **British** Government, BOAC propose to use the subsidiary company, **British** Overseas Air Charters Ltd, in order to enable the Corporation to compete in that part nf the charter market not open to IATA airlines.

* In the **British** Solomons it is 60c per day cash.

* He quoted several African and some Asian countries; be quoted only 1 Pacific country, namely the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate.

* The key address was by former **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Edward  Heath and the Honorary  Chairman  of the Conference was a former Japanese Prime Minister,  Mr Kishi.

* The purpose of each explosion was related to the development of a **British** nuclear deterrent.

* While unemployment remains at the present levels I believe that every **British** newspaper should publish the facts so that there is no response to the Government's recruitment campaign in the United Kingdom for people to come out here and go onto unemployment relief, such as it is.

* Our High Commissioner did make representations to the **British** Government relating to the then provisions of the Immigration Bill as they related to patrials.

* He pointed out to the **British** Government that we felt that in our case where a great number of our people had their ancestors based on the United Kingdom the United Kingdom Government should look particularly at the effects of the then Bill upon Australians who might go to the United Kingdom.

* How colonial can you possibly get to resort to a statute the very purpose of which was to emphasise the legal independence of the then dominion countries of the **British** Commonwealth?

* The purpose of the Statute of Westminster was to make it clear beyond all doubt that the laws of the United Kingdom Parliament would not apply to the dominions of the **British** Commonwealth unless the Parliaments of those countries expressly requested that those laws so apply and consented to their applying.

* Don't give too much of your resources to anyone, the **British** or anyone else.

* Australians today are subsidising the **British** Treasury.

* The **British** Treasury gets a cash surcharge on Australian development.

* They blamed the **British** for applying to join the European Economic Community, they blamed Europe for its trading; they blamed the Opposition.

* It is evident that the crisis in the Australian countryside will be blamed on European Economic Community, blamed on the callous **British** and blamed on the tendency of the world to divide into trading blocs.

* The Gloomy Dean preached the same story, as I said, 10 years ago - perhaps the **British** will not be admitted, but if they are, let us hope that somebody somewhere will look after us.

* In 1969-70 we sold $492m worth of products to Britain but bought 55846m worth, plus preference to **British** goods, **British** shipping, **British** insurance and **British** banks.

* We must use these **British** preferences to negotiate long term agreements covering access to sure markets by people who will take the products we have available in exchange for those that they have to offer.

* Let us renegotiate the basis of our trade with USA, let us renegotiate **British** preferences on a long term binding basis and let us establish a national commodity corporation to promote, facilitate and develop regional trade to replace our ad hoc and casual forays and enable us to meet and beat the government supporting trading of our competitors.

* I understand that on this subject a two page leaflet is available to **British** migrants who claim plumbing qualifications.

* Now if Australia did withdraw these forces here, the **British** and the New Zealanders will be caught in a fairly difficult position .

* The honourable member for St George does not mind if the **British** and the New Zealanders pull out as well as ourselves, leaving the Singaporeans in the lurch.

* The honourable member went on to say: 
The contribution made by the **British** Government is stg 150,000 per annum.

* Taking account of variations in the exchange rate, the actual equivalent of the **British** contribution would be approximately $A6.6 million: 
Any such initiative would be matter for the **British** Government.

* If everything is so clearly understood in Canada, why are negotiations still proceeding between the Provinces and the Federal Government 6 years after the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in a case which only applied, of course, to the Province of **British** Columbia?

* Many members of the House visited the United Kingdom while he was there and knew the warmth of the welcome he gave, his knowledge of the **British** scene and his capacity to put people in touch with those with whom they wanted to talk.

* Is it a fact that the **British** Government has Contributed only $A324,000 each year since 1952, a total of $A5,800,000 towards assisted passages for emigrants from the United Kingdom to Australia.

* If so, will the Government informthe **British** Prime Minister that Australia will offer no objection if the **British** Government decides to save itself from being further embarrassed by the actions of its own Race Relations Board by discontinuing any further assisted passage payments after 30th June next.

* It was said that a **British** diplomat had conveyed information in Hong Kong that the Minister for Trade and Industry had been named as somebody who had upset Mainland China.

* Evidence has now come to hand that the **British** diplomat has' never heard of  Mr Anthony.

* The fact that a **British** diplomat has never heard of  Mr Anthony  might be a reason for members of the Opposition to laugh but it makes its proposal to discuss a mutter of public importance look as silly as they are.

* From inquiries made by the Department of Foreign Affairs it now transpires that the **British** diplomat who conveyed the message had never heard of  Mr Anthony.

* I ask the Prime Minister in his capacity of Acting Treasurer, whether in view of the current rash of takeover bids, such as Ampol Petroleum Ltd v. R. W. Miller (Holdings) Ltd, **British** Tobacco Co.

* Ltd, and reports that the finance for these bids is being derived from the conventional banking system with its swollen liquidity, as in the cases of Ampol and **British** Tobacco, and from overseas sources, he is prepared- 
My question is addressed to the Minister for Labor and Immigration.

* I ask: Will he inform the House why no decision has been made either to deport or to grant residency in Australia for the **British** Member of Parliament,  Mr John  Stonehouse?

* Has the **British** Government requested  Mr Stonehouse  's extradition?

* Honourable members who have done some research in this field and who have looked at the history of the **British** national health scheme and the way in which its costs rose so quickly over the years will have to admit that the figure given by the Leader of the Opposition as the cost of his scheme is only a very nebulous figure and that there can be no guarantee that the cost would be anything like the estimate df the Leader of the Opposition.

* He represented Australia as a hurdler in the 1920 Olympic Games and in the same year ran in the **British** Empire versus United States of America Games and the England versus France athletics.

* He was, of course,  chairman  of the organising committee which staged the highly successful Melbourne Olympics in 1956. 
he is a **British** subject; 
The Commissioner can appoint only a **British** subject -I am not quite sure whether that terminology is not outmoded; I suppose an Australian citizen is a **British** subject.

* But having tied the Commissioner up by providing that he cannot appoint  a  teacher unless the teacher is a **British** subject in sub-clause 3, the Bill states: 
The Commissioner may, with the approval of the Minister, appoint as an officer a person who is not a **British** subject .

* Having forbidden the Commissioner to appoint somebody who is not  a  **British** subject the Bill then provides that he can appoint a non-**British** subject if he has the permission of the Minister.

* If 'Magnet' and 'Gem* were liberal enough to contemplate teaching staff who were non-**British** subjects even in quite conservative schools like Greyfriars and St Jim's, it is quite possible that the Commonwealth should allow the Commissioner to appoint to the Commonwealth Teaching Service people who are not **British** subjects without having to get the special approval of the Minister.

* At present the legal standards for drugs in Australia under the Therapeutic Goods Act (1966) are those of the **British** Pharmacopoeia and the **British** Pharmaceutical Codex.

* 1 would point out that the **British** Pharmacopoeia does not provide criteria lo define relative effectiveness of various preparations.

* The criteria which the standards of the **British** Pharmacopoeia established relate to the identification, purity.

* Standards which have been promulgated under the Therapeutic Goods Act are similar in content and effect to those of the **British** Pharmacopoeia, but include bio-availability where appropriate.

* I thought that at the beginning of his question he might have been referring to a letter which I noted in the  Australian  the other day which stated that there were those in Canberra and elsewhere in Australia who after watching the start of the fourth test on television- perhaps this applies even more to the conclusionbelieved that the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party of Australia was wide of the mark in his attack on **British** immigrant shop stewards.

* In one group there were a few of those who are **British** shop stewards and a few of those who are **British** trade union leaders.

* Obviously, not all **British** trade union leaders are in the category to which I referred.

* If so, why are Aborigines singled out for such taxes contrary to international conventions, **British** custom and Australian precedents.

* 1 ) Has the Government received a request from the Australian Services Council that Australian repatriation and allied rights be made available to **British** and allied exservicemen who are not Australian citizens resident in Australia.

* Section 286 of the Navigation Act 1912-1973 provides that where no licensed ship is available preference is given to an unlicensed **British** ship over an unlicensed foreign ship.

* A **British** ship includes a ship registered in a Commonwealth country or a ship recognised by the law of a Commonwealth country as a ship belonging to that country.

* The Board said that no harm attributable to radiation had been caused to any worker or any member of the public working in **British** reactors since 1955, when I saw the first one in operation.

* A Labour government in Britain secretly, without even telling its own organisation, authorised the explosion of the first **British** atomic bomb.

* Thank goodness the **British** Labour Party had the good, sound sense to understand that following the explosion of the first **British** atomic bomb there would be a peaceful use for uranium and atomic reactors.

* The contribution made by the **British** Government is stgl50,000 p.a.

* Taking account of variations in the exchange rate, the actual equivalent of the **British** contribution would be approximately $A6.6m.

* Any such initiative would be a matter for the **British** Government.

* My attention has been drawn to an excellent address entitled 'Towards a **British** Role in Foreign Affairs' by Humphrey Trevelyan which states: 
An examination of our foreign policy will .

* start from the premise that **British** policy should serve **British** interests.

* It is a **British** interest, for instance, that the peace should be secure, that the strong should not gobble up the weak, that international disputes, even if they cannot be settled, should at least be talked over until the danger point is passed, that atomic weapons should not get into the hands of any country which might be tempted to use them, that the nuclear balance should be firmly maintained, that relations between the capitalist and countries should become gradually easier .

* and (4) No discussions on future Australian education assistance have been held with the **British** or New Zealand Governments.

* We would expect the **British** and French Governments to ensure that existing services, including education are maintained.

* The circumstances in which exemption will be allowable are to be prescribed by regulation, the intention being that they will parallel those in which exemption is currently available to United States and **British** servicemen.

* A similar exemption was subsequently provided in favour of **British** servicemen.

* The Bill proposes to remove the specific exemption of goods for use by **British** Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Ltd (an airline no longer operating) and Qantas Airways Ltd. Other provisions of the sales tax law exempt such items of equipment as aircraft and aircraft parts, servicing equipment and tractors for towing aircraft.

* This is because the present law in Australia on tonnage measurement of ships is that contained in the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and amending Acts, insofar as they apply in Australia.

* Tonnage measurement is part of the whole process for the registration of ships, and not only our tonnage measurement legislation but the whole of our registration legislation exists in the **British** Merchant 
I shall now refer to some of the clauses of the Bill in a little detail.

* Clause 6 provides the regulation-making powers that are necessary to enable Commonwealth tonnage measurement regulations to be made in place of the **British** tonnage measurement provisions.

* Paragraph (d) enables the regulations to have conditional provisions along the lines of the 1967 **British** Tonnage Measurement Regulations, as, for example, where certain spaces may be deducted from the gross tonnage of a ship, this deduction can be made conditional of the spaces conforming to certain requirements.

* That same coal forms a major part of the deal recently negotiated between Clutha Pty Ltd and the **British** Petroleum company interests for one half of Clutha 's total interests.

* The reaction of the Opposition is to emulate those ancient **British** chieftains in the year Anno Domini 446.

* Vortigern and other ancient **British** chieftains made the last fruitless appeals for the legions to return.

* Vortigern's successors in this Parliament might be reminded that he so lacked confidence in his own country's ability to survive outside the Empire he invited in the Saxons to help and they promptly took over and destroyed the ancient **British** kingdoms.

* Italians, Dutch, Germans, Greeks and Lebanese to the right and wait for 3 years; Tongans, Zambians, Canadians, **British** and Indians to the left and wait for one year if you are light enough and 5 years if you are not*.

* The Opposition has talked more about **British** migrants than any other.

* Yet during its long term of office it left many **British** migrants completely in the dark about their citizenship status.

* It failed, indeed, to tell Australians that they had ceased to be **British** citizens when the Imperial legions began to leave our region 24 years ago.

* Even today from the Returned Services League - from a sub-branch in Victoria of **British** exservicemen who have settled here - there has been an enthusiastic welcome for this legislation.

* Although the statement by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  was quite clear, that these air fares would operate between any Australian city and London on **British** Airways and Qantas Airways Ltd services, there are a number of other questions that I think should be asked.

* Referring to those areas in the Maralinga region which I mentioned in an answer to a question yesterday, might I say that the **British** Government spent a very large sum of money making areas as safe as possible by pouring great quantities of concrete to fill in areas that had been dug deep, and in restoring the surface area as much as possible.

* "No request by the **British** to bury, in Australia, waste from their nuclear establishments has been made and certainly no such permission has ever been given.

* No request by the **British** to bury in Australia waste from their nuclear establishments has been made and certainly no such permission has ever been given.

* 1) What steps have been taken to verify the allegations by  Dr John  Coulter and  Mr Avon  Hudson on the radio program  AM  on 2 and 3 December 1976 that the **British** Government had flown radioactive waste including plutonium from nuclear power stations in Britain to Maralinga, where it was secretly buried at night.

* washings from **British** service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh Airfield for cleaning and maintenance.

* We do not know whether the Minister for Defence has been fully informed by his Department- and it seems that he has not yet been properly informed- or whether his Department has been fully informed by the **British** authorities.

* The discussions were extremely useful and, as all honourable gentlemen know,  Dr Mabon  made quite clear the extent to which the **British** working people are depending upon supplies of uranium to produce energy for peaceful purposes.

* What he was saying was completely consistent, as I have indicated to the House before, with the attitudes expressed by  Mr Wedgwood  Benn and also by the **British** Prime Minister, who rightly have not only a concern for matters of proliferation that are of major world concern but also a concern and an obligation in relation to their own people and in relation to the provision of energy to keep their factories operating.

* In view of the long-standing financial ties between Australia and Great Britain, has the **British** undertaking to the 
European Economic Community to consider modifying the role of sterling as a reserve currency after the **British** entry into the European Economic Community caused the Treasurer any concern?

* How will any such move affect the future of Australia's international reserves, a large portion of which are invested in **British** securities?

* Further, will the Treasurer comment upon the effect upon **British** investment within Australia?

* The Government's failure to observe the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-1975 before granting the **British** Airways permission to fly Concorde to Australia.

* I am moved to speak on this subject today by the fact that the **British** Press Council has been in existence for some years and it is time that Australia had something similar.

* The **British** Press Council is a voluntary body and it has these functions: To consider complaints about the conduct of the Press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the Press.

* It works both ways - both to preserve the freedom of the **British** Press and to maintain the character of the **British** Press in accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards.

* This would represent an addition to the charter of the **British** Press Council.

* Honourable members will be aware that she was recently made a Commander of the **British** Empire.

* I read recently in the  Economist  a statement about the **British** taxation system.

* It stated: 
The case for raising the **British** income tax threshhold and reducing the confiscatory top marginal tax rates is now overwhelming.

* The **British** pattern of taxation, with its distortions, its complex jungle of permissible avoidances allowances and reliefs, deadens individual effort and enterprise; it lures the best brains into taking congenial jobs in academic life or the civil service instead of making or selling things; it is complicated and costly to collect; it encourages a mushrooming alternative economy in which honest taxpayers are derided as fools, and the others either get away with it or emigrate.

* A recent visitor to this country was a very great Englishman,  Sir Robert  Thompson, who is a great expert of counterinsurgency, having assisted enormously the **British** in Malaysia-Singapore and now assisting the Americans in Vietnam.

* The Minister, quite rightly, said that it would be a major misfortune if, at this time, the benign **British** influence east of Suez was diminished, when the region is faced with such new and complex problems.

* He said that we therefore strongly hope that the **British** withdrawal may be delayed.

* It is true that, at the present moment, the only hope of reversing the current trend of **British** withdrawal from Malaysia appears to be a Conservative win in the approaching elections.

* Some **British** even ask: Why should we waste money stationing troops thousands of miles from Britain when our vital interests are not immediately in jeopardy?'

* **British** ships continue to carry goods into North Vietnam, though they expect our help in their so far unsuccessful confrontation with Rhodesia.

* I can say that the maximum number of awards under the statute is fewer than the numbers of awards given prior to 1973 under the **British** honours system on the recommendation of earlier Australian governments.

* Some State governments have indicated an intention to continue nominating awards under the **British** system.

* These will be political honours in the sense that they are honours recommended by the Premiers through the **British** Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

* The recommendations, of course, in the case of **British** awards on the recommendation of State governments are made to the Queen not by the State governments or the heads of the State governments but by the **British** Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

* He might allow me the indulgence of quoting from John Maynard Keynes- not exactly a person of my political persuasion- who was a supporter of the **British** Liberal Party when he was alive.

* He had this to say on matters of this sort: 
Another change that I welcome on behalf of the Opposition is the decision to make veterans of other **British** Commonwealth countries who have resided in Australia for a period of 10 years eligible under the repatriation system.

* I know that there has been a great deal of pressure and demand for this eligibility from **British** ex-service men and various other organisations.

* This gentleman certainly took a great deal of interest in having this eligibility extended to **British** servicemen.

* They have in mind, of course, the model of the **British** treatment of Britain's former colonial servants who were given very good treatment indeed.

* As far back as 1 885 this matter was regarded by the **British** authorities in Papua as being unfair.

* Indeed in 1896 the **British** Government in an order in council adopted a new line but it was not put into legislative form because federation took place here.

* I refer the House to the Manufacturers Bulletin' of 16th March 1970 in which is published the equivalents of the **British** to the metric and the metric to the **British** for mass, length and area.

* It will not be quite as easy for the general public to become aware of the equivalents in the case of metrication, as it is called, as it was in the currency conversion I shall refer to the equivalents for **British** to metric rather than the reverse, from metric to **British**.

* The equivalent of the **British** ton is 1.0160469088 tonne.

* I do not want to mention the equivalents for metric to **British** because the position gets even worse.

* The present Navigation Act dating back to 1 912 is largely an adaptation of a series of **British** Acts which culminated in the **British** Merchant Shipping Act of 1894.

* The Summers report commented that in many respects the Navigation Act still reflects **British** attitudes at the end of the nineteenth century.

* All ships registered in Australia are included in the **British** Registry.

* As a result of an appeal from the Western Australian Supreme Court, the Privy Council ruled that an Australian owned and manned crayfishing boat was, in fact, a **British** ship and subject to a **British** Act enacted in 1536 for the punishment of pirates and robbers of the sea.

* Whilst this case is extreme it illustrates the legal reliance of Australian maritime law on ancient **British** Acts of Parliament.

* Provisions relating to visiting **British** ships which were to have been deleted from the Act will remain in operation pending discussion with the Queensland Government.

* In the interim an Order-in-Council exempts visiting **British** ships from Part II of the Act.

* The fact is that this nation was born out of the maritime industry, the **British** maritime industry.

* Did he at any time give an undertaking or commitment of any kind to the **British** Minister for Defence, Lord Carrington, to the effect that Australia would maintain its forces in Singapore under the Five Power Arrangements.

* But a statement issued yesterday by the **British** High Commission said that there were six separate containers of plutonium.

* It therefore appears that the Government had not been fully informed by the **British** authorities when the Cabinet submission was presented.

* Hence the **British** Labour Government set up a separate department in 1964.

* Only last week I listened to  Sir Robert  Thompson, the **British** insurgency expert, who was in Canberra.

* Under the heading 'Vietnam Pull-out Would Threaten Australia' the following article is set out: 
The immediate withdrawal of all allied troops from south Vietnam would post a major threat of Communist aggression to Australia,  Sir Robert  Thompson, the **British** insurgency expert, said yesterday 
In the domestic field the industry is still faced with real problems.

* So with those figures going down and with the implications of the decline in the **British** market we are faced with very real problems.

* There is no doubt that Australian wines on the **British** market were generally low priced wines, many of them not being of as high a quality as those consumed on the domestic market.

* He said: 
Is he able to say whether the **British** Government has decided to abolish the 3 Ministerial posts of Minister for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force on the grounds that decisions would be reached with greater speed and efficiency if this course were followed.

* Is it likely that the Australian Government will act in respect of what it may regard as redundant Ministers in the same way as the **British** Government has done.

* While there are very considerable pressures around the continuity of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and while concern is felt about marketing arrangements after 1974, there is still a measure of cooperation and co-ordination in trying to ensure that negotiations towards possible **British** entry into the European Economic Community take account of the necessity for Australian sugar to be.

* which he went to look at in rather spectacular fashion just before the election; and the **British** vessel 'Sheffield'.

* I point out that 25 years ago the **British** decreed, in relation to warships of this type, that 30 knots was the minimum speed on which designers would be permitted to work.

* We can, to some extent, find out details about the **British** 'Sheffield'.

* If one attends a meeting such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in Malaysia which I recently attended, and if one takes part in a debate for example on a topic such as government and democracy or democratic institutions, and listens to the views of people from Africa, Asia and elsewhere as well as of those from the long established democracies of the **British** Commonwealth, one will come to a viewpoint fairly readily that we have here, however imperfect, a form of democracy which many people in the world would be exceedingly happy to emulate if in fact they could manage to do so.

* They were divided nearly half and half as to whether inflation or unemployment was the more serious matter with which the **British** Government had to grapple.

* Nobody has found the magic answer that the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Gellibrand have found- not the American Administration, be it the Democrats or the alternative, the **British** Administration or any of the Western European administrations.

* I believe that what we should have in Australia in 1975 is what was written into the **British** system in 1911, that is, that an Upper House can do no more than sniff at a money Bill and if it delays it for more than a month it does not matter whether it passes it or not.

* It adopted what was then the convention of the **British** system, the convention that had been accepted as far back as 1861.

* I think the remarks made by an eminent **British** Minister, such as  Dr Mabon,  should be considered seriously.

* This contract, of course, would guarantee to the United Kingdom during that period the supply of uranium so that the **British** Government can help the working people of England to remain employed.

* I give as an illustration something that happened in the United Kingdom where, by reason of the medical benefits scheme which they had there, people from all over Europe used to go to the United Kingdom to have their operations or medical services and they mulcted the **British** taxpayer by so doing.

* Somebody from a **British** Commonwealth country can acquire citizenship here within 12 months, and a citizen of a foreign country can obtain citizenship here within 3 years if he can read and write English.

* After ten years  of  research, both the **British** Medical Association and the Surgeon-General of the United States had supplied indisputable evidence that cigarette smoking was one  of  the main causes of lung cancer.

* Since 1965 there have been no cigarette advertisements on **British** television.

* In the recent 108 page report entitled 'Smoking and Health' by the Royal College of Physicians, **British** doctors called for all-round bans on cigarette advertising and the introduction of legislation to compel cigarette manufacturers to print warnings on their packets about the possible dangers of smoking to health.

* The Imperial Tobacco Co. which dominates 67 per cent of the **British** cigarette market estimates that the overall sale of cigarettes has fallen by 10 per cent since the January report of the Royal Colleges of Physicians on smoking and health was made public.

* The attitude of the Fraser Government as exemplified by the statements of the Minister for Primary Industry regarding **British** migrants.

* An Act of the **British** Parliament did that; and it was one of the great dramatic humanitarian movements of history.

* **British** Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) Christmas Island Phosphate Commission (CIPC).

* It is noteworthy that less than 18 months ago a certain gentleman named Cunningham, who is the V ice-Chairman of the **British** Atomic Energy Commission, came to this country and warned it that there had been a breakthrough by the combined experiments of Britain, West Germany and Holland in the use of the gas centrifuge, which was a much cheaper method of enriching uranium.

* The report implies that the **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Harold  Wilson, on his recent Washington visit, scored a major diplomatic coup by persuading  President  Nixon to change the balance of US policy in favour of the United Kingdom and Europe.

* Mr Wilson  is also believed to have convinced  Mr Nixon  that the Middle East, and not 

 Sir, that report is the most devastating and explosive document received by the Australian Government since the correspondence between the late John Curtin and the **British** Prime Minister of the day in relation to the return of Australian divisions from the Middle East for the defence of this country.

* The **British** Phosphate Commissioners estimate that on programmed tonnages and fleet operations, the withdrawal of the exemption will result in the average cost of shipping all phosphate rock imports into Australia increasing by $1.73 per tonne in 1975-76 and $2.60 per tonne in 1976-77.

* I have received no representations from the **British** Phosphate Commission to reinstate the exemption.

* Based on the experience of the **British** high speed trains, it should be possible to reduce the journey time from the centre of Sydney to Canberra to about three hours.

* Based again on **British** experience, a high speed train would use about 4 litres of fuel per person on the Canberra run.

* Whilst we hear from time to time many comments in respect of the Japanese Shinkansen or bullet trains, little mention is made of the quality and performance of the **British** high speed trains.

* There is a need for the restoration of the healthy **British** convention that Ministers of the Crown sell their shares and resign their company directorships on assuming office.

* Perhaps it is a leak from a **British** Minister to the London Times'.

* Stanley Baldwin, one-time **British** Prime Minister, was the target of a co-ordinated attack by Beaverbrook, Rothermere and Northcliffe, Press magnates who were raised to the peerage as barons, hence the origins of the designation, now traditional in London, 'the Press barons'.

* It could be reasonably interpreted by us who listened in the House and by those who read the Hansard report of his speech that really his only reference and his only justification for considering a statutory corporation for the Australian Post Office was the statutory corporation status of the **British** Post Office, The honourable member went on then to deal with the matters which were in the Bill.

* I commence at the point of argument that the **British** Post Office is the desirable basis on which we should establish a similar operation in Australia.

* Let me remind the House what in fact is within the actual **British** Post Office operation in terms of charges and in terms of provision of interest on the money which is invested in the Post Office there and then apply that principle to the Australian Post Office.

* Recently, in March last approximately, the **British** Post Office decided that it would require a 10 per cent return on capital invested in telecommunications in lieu of the  8i  per cent return which had been the earlier rate.

* If we apply the **British** Post Office basis of 2 per cent on expenses in relation to the postal services, which in Australia totals $173m, the figure is $3.5m.

* So, the figure under the basis laid down by the **British** Post Office is more than twice what we in fact obtained in Australia.

* I ask the question again: Is it the **British** Post Office principle that the Australian Labor Party wants accepted in a statutory corporation sense in relation to the Australian Post Office?

* It was not a **British** custom; it was a colonial custom.

* It was played by a drumfife band at the raising of the **British** flag at Port Jackson by Captain Arthur Phillip.

* It seems to have been adopted by the various **British** colonies in Australia and of course it continues in this role.

* The honourable member for Warringah referred to the States as a group of **British** colonies that could still use it, as **British** colonies, is they wished.

* It is not uniquely **British** or a Commonwealth of Nations song but it has been used extensively by composers in many nations.

* He had a greater international reputation than many **British** contemporaries.

* His 4 years as Treasurer, his membership of the **British** War Cabinet and his war service as Governor of Bengal equipped him with an all-round experience of political and administrative office which was probably unrivalled in this country.

* There were many firsts to his credit- the first Australian overseas diplomat, liaison officer to London, Minister to Washington; the first Australian to serve as Minister in a **British** government; the first Australian to be a colonial governor; the first Commonwealth life peer.

* We have a copy of Magna Carta which is very rightly described as the foundation of our parliamentary liberties and really the foundation of the **British** and Australian democracies.

* We all know and we all admit- I think with some pride- that our origins come from the **British** Constitution, from the **British** people.

* We also have this sword of Macquarie which in some way symbolises the way in which Britain has contributed- we as **British** people are grateful- to the foudation of this Australian nation.

* Commonwealth Service Departments and the Department of Civil Aviation have adopted the **British** instantaneous coupling for their mobile equipment and carry adaptors for local fittings.

* Australia cannot ignore its responsibilities in assisting peace and stability east of Suez - in particular in Malaysia and Singapore - after the proposed **British** withdrawal next year.

* The intended and unfortunate **British** withdrawal from east of Suez emphasises the growing European disinterest in the eastern and Asian scene.

* The **British** withdrawal from east of Suez, apart from Hong Kong, will cause great problems.

* On 28 May- last Friday- the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  announced that approval had been given to **British** Airways to introduce the supersonic aircraft Concorde to the Australian run.

* There is no dispute over whether **British** Airways, through its agents, was prepared to comply with the requirements of that legislation It in fact submitted its draft environmental impact statement to the appropriate Minister late last year.

* Subsequently comments were received by the proponent, **British** Airways, on its initial environmental impact statement.

* **British** Airways then proceeded to prepare a final impact statement- a statement in which it would have attempted to present arguments against the unfavourable comments received.

* The Minister does not even give the courtesy of waiting to see what arguments **British** Airways uses to refute the criticisms made on the environmental aspects of Concorde by concerned Australians.

* It has not been done even though I am informed that the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development had many questions to ask **British** Airways if its final environment impact statement did not satisfactorily dispel many major doubts raised by concerned Australians such as the Society for Social Responsibility in Science.

* Has the Minister recently had discussions with  Sir John  Hill, the  chairman  of the **British** Atomic Energy Agency?

* That is the entourage honourable members will recall, that managed to drink the **British** Trident charter aircraft dry in a 40-minute flight from Paris to Bonn.

* It reads: 
Fifty per cent of the remaining recoverable reserves in Bass Strait of LPG, in terms of **British** thermal unit content, will be sold for export.

* The **British** Royal Commission headed by Lord Donovan dealt specifically with this matter in these terms in its report which was handed down in 1968: 426.

* This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and **British** Columbia.

* I suggest that those words used in the report of the **British** Royal Commission headed by Lord Donovan, handed down in 1968, are appropriate to the proposal of this Government for the question of strike action to be decided by secret ballot.

* The speculation in the **British** Press concerning the appointment of Prince Charles to the office of Governor-General must be grossly embarrassing to this young prince who is held in such high esteem by all Australians.

* The placement of the first in line to the **British** throne in a highly controversial position of responsibility in another country would be a ludicrous action.

* Decisions about future Australian GovernorsGeneral are not the prerogative of the **British** Press.

* Has his attention been drawn to the statement made on the ABC program  This Day Tonight  on 14 October 1978, by a radio operator living in the Monte Bello Islands that he wasn't aware until recently that any radioactivity remained on the island and had often handled materials remaining from the **British** nuclear weapons tests which were conducted on the island.

* The remains of **British** stores and plant used to construct test facilities are still to be found on the islands.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  is now infamous for his remarks about the **British** disease.

* He said: 
While on the subject of industrial disputes I must also decry the fact that so many **British** migrants seem bent on importing the '**British** disease' into the Australian trade union movement.

* Those people have obviously sapped much of the strength of **British** industry, leaving the **British** economy one of the weakest in Europe.

* The honourable member for Maribyrnong quoted extensively from a report to the **British** Government on cannabis by the Advisory Committee on Drug Dependence.

* It is so equivocal that there is enormous doubt even in this equivocal report which was presented to the **British** Government which, I might say, was never implemented.

* The pharmacology professor said his tests tended to corroborate previous experiments which were conducted in the **British** West Indies and Augusta, Georgia.

* **British** consumption has risen just recently to 1,500 tons and a recent survey of 40 of the major food suppliers in the United Kingdom revealed that these suppliers expect a 5 per cent penetration of the meat market by 1977, a 10 per cent penetration by around 1981 and a 25 per cent penetration by 1990.

* He has been negotiating with the **British**.

* The **British** are still dealing with this subject.

* The Government has not been sitting and doing nothing about the **British** entry into the EEC.

* It is only a few years ago that the majority of Australian trade was between Australia, the **British** and the Continent in general.

* **British** Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd. Waterloo, New South Wales.

* How many **British** citizens originating from Malta have enrolled on the electoral rolls in each of the last 10 years.

* lt is high time that **British** and allied exservicemen were allowed to receive War Service homes.

* What action has been taken to renegotiate the Anglo-Australian trade preferences following the **British** Government's action in imposing import levies on a range of Australian primary products?

* The imposition of levies would run counter to the **British** obligation under the United KingdomAustralia Trade Agreement to grant duty-free entry for Australian products.

* The Minister is then reported to have said that there would be an exchange of letters with the **British** High Commissioner in Canberra.

* The newspaper then quotes the Minister as having said: 
The substance of these letters will be that in return for Australia waiving its rights under the Trade Agreement, the **British** Government will be prepared to waive its rights under the Trade Agreement to take measures to restore the balance of advantages under the Trade Agreement as it existed immediately prior to the introduction of the levy schemes.

* by leave - In my recent statement to the House on my overseas visit, I mentioned the representations which 1 made in London on the problems for Papua New Guinea arising from **British** entry to the European Economic Community.

* The **British** Government has accepted an offer from the Six under which exports originating in Papua New Guinea will be able to enter the United Kingdom until 1st January 1978, under the conditions which apply at the time of **British** accession to the Community.

* In accepting the offer by the Six, the **British** Government expressed its confidence that the Community would make reasonable arrangements for Papua New Guinea in the context of any review.

* I refer to an article produced in the **British** PEP publication in February this year by the Oxford economist Santosh Mukherjee.

* Talking of the importance of confidence to recovery, he said: 
The position of Speaker has, since its inception in the **British** Parliament some 600 years ago, attained a dignity and respect which are unique.

* I further ask: Will firms such as **British** Tobacco Co.

* Therefore, I call upon the Government to appoint a royal commission to inquire into 2 matters: Firstly, any possible infringement of Australia's sovereignty which occurred as a result of the alleged actions of the **British** 
Government and, secondly, the health and environmental questions raised by these allegations.

* The then Minister for Supply chose to infer in his answers to questions on 13 and 14 September 1972 that the nuclear wastes in question were radio active debris associated with **British** atomic weapons testing in the 1950s.

* Mr Avon Hudson who worked at Maralinga during the 1960s has claimed that, in the early 1 960s, the **British** Government was secretly using the Maralinga atomic test site as a burial ground for waste from nuclear power stations.

* Why have we not an Australian consumers' council financed by the Commonwealth Government just as the **British** one is financed by the **British** Government?

* The article says: 
That this House considers that the construction of the naval base at Cockburn Sound should receive high priority on the defence programme and that negotiations should be undertaken with the **British** Government to base two aircraft carriers on Cockburn Sound after 1970.

* The question of filling the vacuum that will be left  in  the Indian Ocean by the withdrawal of the **British** fleet east of Suez in 1971 is a matter of great strategic and tactical importance to the whole of the Western world.

* We have had the **British** Labor Government abrogating the Simonstown agreement, and as a result the shopping for hardware and the building up of munitions and defence requirements in South Africa have been considerably handicapped.

* Repatriation: **British** Ex-servicemen  (Question No.

* 362) 
I am reminded of the story so beautifully told by George Orwell during World War II when he was broadcasting on the **British** Broadcasting Commission of his own experience as a child.

* **British** parliamentary and legal precedent.

* To which Australian, **British** and French territories in the Pacific and Indian Ocean territories do the Convention and Protocol apply.

* It consisted of 6 colonies bound separately to the **British** Crown.

* byleave- May I say that the **British** system of parliamentary government which we in Australia inherit depends on a strong 2 -party system.

* I can recall on past occasions having been involvedin negotiations with the **British** Government, having taken great delight when members of the **British** Government talked about Her Majesty's Government, referring to Her Majesty's Australian Government.

* They have spoken towards the change of relativity in the position of **British** migrants.

* But the present Minister for Immigration is changing the emphasis and I am quite concerned that, in the trends towards the reduction of the meaningfulness of the difference between a **British** citizen and an Australian citizen which this Bill reflects, we are denigrating the maintenance of this homogeneity which is such an important part of the Australian nation today.

* So I fail to understand why the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  consistently confuses this proposed health program with the **British** scheme.

* It ought to be noted in passing that ASIO, when it was first set up under the Chifley Government, was set up under significant advice from the **British** domestic security organisation which had a military origin.

* I made no charges against the Australian Government, or the **British** Government or any State department.

* Apparently they have been buried in an area that was used during the testing by the **British** Government.

* Is he able to say whether the weedicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been tested by United States authorities under the Pesticides Act or the Toxic Substances Control Act or by **British** authorities including the Health and Safety Executive.

* It is also obviously essential that we try our utmost to remove the general misconception on the part of many **British** immigrants already here that by long residence they have automatically become citizens.

* The Citizenship Acts of 1949 ended the common citizenship between the colonies of the once **British** Empire, the then **British** Commonwealth and now Commonwealth of Nations.

* Australians have not been nor had the status of **British** citizens since 1949.

* Australian citizens have, however, the additional right and description of possessing the common nationality of the Commonwealth of Nations, called in some 
Commonwealth countries Commonwealth citizenship and in Australia for convenience, because we in Australia use the term 'Commonwealth' ourselves, as **British**.

* At this point let me make it perfectly clear that the Bill does not change the situation whereby citizens of the 31 Commonwealth countries, whether they become Australian citizens or not, continue to have the status of **British** or Commonwealth of Nations subjects and as such have privileges such as the vote and eligibility to be appointed to public services under Acts of Parliament not administered by me.

* Turning from the main provisions concerning grant of citizenship, another change achieved by the Bill is to bring up to date the list of Commonwealth countries whose citizens have the status of **British** subject under the Citizenship Act.

* Otherwise, for example, a person in the Public Service might suddenly find he can no longer lawfully retain his appointment because the Public Service Act allows permanent appointment only of people who have the status of **British** subjects.

* The United Kingdom, with Western Europe, has been the traditional market for the apple and pear industry but **British** entry into the European Economic Community has altered this quite dramatically.

* If the.. Bristol were costed on the same basis, it is unlikely that she would be any cheaper as she is larger than the - **British** Type 42 destroyer.

* That aside, it is important to place on record a special commendation of the role of the **British** Prime Minister,  Mrs Margaret  Thatcher.

* The Australian Government regards the proposed sale of arms as a mailer to be decided by the **British** Government.

* If the **British** Government should conclude that the protection of her sea routes requires the provision of maritime arms to South Africa then the Australian Government has no intention of expressing opposition.

* The Community is in fact declining as a market for Australian products, despite the **British** entry.

* on 4th March, I asked the Minister for Supply whether the Government had given its consent and backing to a joint project between the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the **British** Aircraft Corporation for the development and manufacture of a variable geometry dual purpose supersonic attack trainer.

* Here again, over the past decade the Government has been active and has worked in co-operation with marketing boards and individual traders to reduce substantially our dependence on the **British** market.

* The **British** market now takes only 11 per cent of our exports, compared with 24 per cent 10 years ago.

* The **British** Government imposes no restriction on the amount or type of migrant advertising, unlike some other overseas countries which, for a variety of reasons, do not allow direct advertising.

* Firstly, the paper shows among other things that, when the relevant letters patent were being prepared by the **British** authorities in 1878, a line was drawn on an admiralty chart to show the islands intended to be annexed.

* That is to say, a chart was specifically prepared by the **British** authorities to show the intent of the letters patent, and copies of that chart were duly circulated to the Governor of Queensland and others, together with copies of the letters patent.

* The effect of the letters patent of 8 June 1888 constituting **British** New Guinea was that islands off the south and south-eastern shores of **British** New Guinea 'not forming part of the Colony of Queensland' were included within **British** New Guinea.

* By virtue of the Papua Act 1905, **British** New Guinea was accepted by the Commonwealth as a territory under the authority of the Commonwealth by the name of the Territory of Papua.

* The **British** Government was severely embarrassed in the Angolan situation.

* The **British** Government established the Diplock Commission to find out what it could do about it.

* There is nothing like clause 6 to cover the **British** situation.

* The **British** needed something to prevent recruitment.

* In talking about the Angolan situation we are talking about young **British** men who lost their lives and the **British** Government was embarrassed.

* In the Angolan situation before these people were executed  Mr Jack  Dromey, a former  Chairman  of the National Council for Civil Liberties, said: 
It will do no good for the **British** Government to appeal against the sentences.

* There is no evidence, no logic and certainly no credible hypothesis to support an accusation, so dear to the imagination of the former  Deputy  Leader of the Oppositionthat is, the honourable member for Reid- that the **British** broke the moratorium on atomic explosions in the atmosphere in the period from 1958 to 1961.

* Conference was opened in Westminster Hall by  Her  Majesty the Queen, who was introduced by  Sir Alex  Douglas-Home, the  President  of the Association, who was supported by  Mr Edward  Heath, the then **British** Prime Minister.

* As could be expected, with the European Parliament, the European Economic Commission and the Council of Europe, all represented by observers, there was a full dress debate on matters affecting **British**, Common Market and Commonwealth relationships.

* The most modern interpreter of the working of the **British** Constitutionthe Australian system is modelled on the **British** system- is one called Ivor Jennings.

* In his book, the third edition of  Cabinet Government,  on page 403 he says this about the **British** system: 
I tried to suggest early in my speech that common sense- surely common sense is an essential part of the operation of constitutional governmentwould say in the latter quarter of the twentieth century that Senates cannot reject money Bills either.

* I believe this other question of trying to maintain in Australia to a GovernorGeneral prerogative powers that were discarded in the workings of the **British** system 200 years ago needs serious and critical examination in this country.

* It tried to put into writing what were the conventions of the **British** system at the time the Constitution was written.

* Its terrorism has not been directed merely at the Israeli Army, as the Zionists directed their terrorism against the **British** Army.

* The people of Bougainville had nothing to do with the people of the Highlands, nor did the people of New Ireland, New Britain or Mans, and if that be true of the people of the outlying islands it is equally true of the people on the mainland, lt is disturbing to think that the accidental boundary between Papua and New Guinea, which was drawn due to the fact that once the northern part was a German colony and the southern a **British** COlOny.

* The **British** legislation, our legislation and other Acts throughout the world pay greater regard to the public interest, to the interests of other people and to the creation of a system which is responsible to some democratically responsible body.

* this country has twice the degree of concentration in the commercial and industrial activity fields than the **British** and approximately.

* '.&gt;; 
I do suggest that the real power of this legislation when it is eventually put into proper form - it is not in proper form now - will be along those lines, in order to make us understand in a sort of research sense, much as the **British** have done, just how this secret system that exercises this enormous power in our community does work.

* In one of his books, he puts it this way: 
When the **British** came to grapple with the problem in 1948 a Labour Government enacted the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Inquiry and Control Act.

* The **British** said: 'We must understand it better.

* The **British** set out in their Act in 1948 to gain more understanding.

* The **British** now investigate the professions and all manner of restrictive trade practices, not only resale price maintenance.

* The **British** considered this sort of approach and rejected it.

* The Minister for Veterans' Affairs  (Mr Adermann)  is aware of a case which he has before him of a **British** seaman, whether Service or otherwise, and the establishment of that case is becoming extraordinarily protracted.

* Over-utilisation of services has been a feature of the **British** scheme and would be a feature of the Labor scheme in this country.

* **British** political scientist  Dr David  Butler chided the Commonwealth Public Service last night for being 'spoilt by 23 years of non-change', and for failing to give enough thought to the effects on the bureaucracy of a change of government.

* Dr Butler suggested the **British** practice whereby duplicate files were prepared for the new minister giving all the fact and arguments, but free from any quotations or observations of his predecessor.

* I hope that the suspicions bred by 23 years of opposition will not lead an incoming Labor gov ernment here to act very differently from the **British** precedent',  Dr Butler  said.

* When we talk about participation of a nation in exploration, we can look at the **British** Government and **British** Petroleum, France, Italy, Norway, Canada, the Argentine, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Indonesia and New Zealand, to name but a few.

* This will allow them to search rather than force them into the hands of a foreign partner, as the Woodside company was forced into the hands of the **British** Burmah oil group.

* If so, is he able to say whether (a) education in French language schools will be separately and entirely funded after independence by a special direct grant from the French Government thus relieving the New Hebridean Government of budgetary responsibility and assuring the future of French eucation; (b) education in English language schools will be the direct responsibility of the New Hebridean Government itself, which will not receive any special grant from the **British** Government apart from its continuing responsibility to pay a diminishing budgetary grant each year to cover all services and; (c) the equipment, pupil-teacher ratio, staff salaries and buildings in the English schools are already disadvantaged compared to the French schools in the New Hebrides.

* Has the Australian Government had discussions with the **British** and New Zealand Governments to see what financial assistance could be provided to assist the maintenance of standards in English speaking schools.

* Will he approach the **British** and New Zealand Governments to ascertain what ways assistance can be given to the English schools in the New Hebrides.

* If that butter was given lo the herrings, it might make a mess of the fisheries in that wonderful shallow sea between the **British** Isles and Europe.

* There can be no doubt that the Tasmanian industry has been very hard hit by a great number of factors, not the least of course being the **British** decision to enter the European Economic Community.

* I am informed that the Australian Book Sellers Association recommends that its members sell **British** books at prices listed in a Schedule of Prices.

* The Schedule shows prices invoiced by the **British** publishers and the recommended Australian prices.

* It is not known how the **British** publishers determine the invoiced prices.

* Some **British** publishers have Australian branch offices or wholly-owned subsidiary companies.

* It may be that in these cases the **British** publisher determines the price at which his books are sold in Australia, but I have no definite information to this effect.

* The local agent of the **British** publisher of the hardcover edition has said that no advice has reached him that a paperback edition is available.

* Looking specifically at the new APEX fares, Qantas and **British** Airways together on the Kangaroo route have booked a total of more than 213,000 seats between Australia and United Kingdom.

* **British** Foreign Secretary told the House of Commons on Monday of last week that he had made 2 recent approaches to the Soviet Foreign Minister, the most recent being on 20th April, proposing a reconvening of the Geneva Conference with a view to bringing about an end to the fighting in Vietnam through a negotiated settlement.

* He also should be aware that the official Foreign Office spokesman told the daily Press briefing in London last Friday that on the day before the **British** counsellor in Peking had met Chinese officials and had 'discussed all aspects of the Vietnam situation, including the Geneva Conference, with the Chinese.'

* I ask: Has Australia made any representations to the Soviet Union where, unlike China, we have an embassy, in support of the **British** representations?

* I imagine that the colleagues of the honourable members opposite would have read the speech of the English Prime Minister which was circulated to all honourable members by the **British** High Commission.

* He said: 
The honourable member referred to a publication of the **British** Information Service.

* As a matter of fact, I notice that one article in that publication stated that the **British** Foreign Minister was very strong in his comments about the world recession.

* Despite this period of universal recession spoken about by the **British** Prime Minister in the magazine to which the honourable member for Parramatta referred, this Government has increased its total outlay in education by $237m.

* -Is the Prime Minister aware that the **British** Trades Union Congress recently adopted by a large majority a motion calling for a 12-month interval between pay increases?

* Finally, does he have any grounds for expecting that the Australian Council of Trade Unions will adopt the same responsible attitude as has the **British** Trades Union Congress towards this matter in the interests of all Australians?

* He talked about the **British** Petroleum company buying into the Clutha company.

* What the Australian Government now proposes to do is to act under the Statute of Westminster to request and consent to legislation in the **British** Parliament, to be introduced by the **British** Government, to discontinue appeals to the Privy Council from the State courts, whether directly or through the High Court.

* The provision of the Privy Council to act in those matters is a service which the **British** Parliament permits and the **British** Government provides.

* It is, we believe, appropriate for the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament to ask the **British** Government and the **British** Parliament to end that service.

* It would surely be absurd to ask the **British** Government to introduce legislation to abolish appeals to the Privy Council from the courts of those States whose governments at any one time wanted to abolish those appeals and then to leave the right of appeal to the Privy Council available from the courts of those States whose governments at the time did not want to abolish appeals to the Privy Council.

* They certainly got wide coverage in **British** newspapers, as they did in Australian newspapers.

* Also, my comments were supported by a memo that went from the Prime Minister to the **British** Prime Minister, and there has been a statement in this House on our criticism of the negotiations and what eventuated from them.

* If the **British** Government has not assessed our reaction, then I would be quite happy to tell it again.

* It is common in **British** legislation, and I believe that there are provisions in the United States of America and in Canada to protect the individual in such a circumstance.

* To my mind this reinforces certain comments made about the power of the shop stewards, the usurping of constituted trade union authority, the **British** disease in this country, and articles written by Paul Johnson, that leading Labor Party intellectual in the United Kingdom, who contributed to the  New Statesman  on the new tyranny of the trade unions.

* Australian officers and non-commissioned officers are exchanged on an individual basis with **British** counterparts.

* Approximately 90 Australian Army, and 30 New Zealand Army officers and men, are exchanged annually with their **British** Army counterparts in Exercise 'Long Look'.

* The above arrangements would not release **British** Servicemen for duty in Northern Ireland.

* Are there any cases in which residents of this country were refused employment in the Public Service because the persons were not **British** subjects; if so, how many.

* What are the nations classified as **British** under paragraph 34 (a) of the Act.

* How many **British** subjects who are not Australian citizens are employed by the Public Service.

* If so, is he able to say whether the Bill has now become law and that, as a consequence, the pattern of activities of the **British** insurance brokers is now subject to close scrutiny and control.

* Can he say whether the **British** insurance brokers would have preferred self-regulation but that such a course had been found to be both ineffective and deficient by the United Kingdom Parliament.

* In any case there is a well established constitutional practice under our system, which we inherited from the **British**, for the outgoing government to continue to governperhaps it can get a new commission as a caretaker government; that can happen under certain conditions- until the incoming government is ready to take over.

* I think it is now called **British** Cargo Airlines, having changed its name.

* As to the freight question, what we have allowed **British** Cargo Airlines to do for the Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board simply means that by taking cargo out of the holds of the scheduled carriers and allowing the nonscheduled competitive commercial carriers to carry it at a non-commercial rate we are asking people travelling on those airlines to subsidise lamb exports.

* The appointment of Justices of the High Court to the Privy Council stems from an arrangement between the Australian and **British** Governments entered into in 1962.

* Under these arrangements, the Australian Prime Minister recommends to his **British** counterpart that he tender advice to the Queen that Justices be made Privy Counsellors.

* We have the ridiculous situation whereby the Government is to sell its share in Ranger Uranium Mines Pty Ltd and it could well be that the purchasers of that share will be the **British** Government, through its instrumentalities, which are anxious to buy our uranium.

* In other words, the bidders for the Australian Government's share could be the **British** Government.

* It is important that it be the **British** Government from the point of view of safety control.

* I note that a **British** Government consortium representing **British** Nuclear Fuels Ltd and the Central Electricity Generating Board is reported to be a bidder.

* Its decision - 
Are Yuncken Freeman, Conrad and Gargett and the **British** firm of Llewellyn Davies among these.

* The **British** national health service has received a great deal of criticism in this country from people who evidently are bent on seeing its failure and many of whom do not truly appreciate the significance of the scheme.

* But there is no relationship between the scheme that the Australian Government is presenting to the Australian Parliament at this time and the **British** national health scheme.

* The AMA has represented the **British** scheme to the people of Australia as being a dismal failure.

* It is interesting to see just what the 'Lancet' of 30 June this year said in relation to the **British** scheme.

* It said that the **British** national health service has 'reached full adulthood not without blemishes but is virile and popular and indispensible' and 'that in every country, developed and developing, the growth in the costs of health services threatens to get out of hand'.

* Under **British** law the penalty for an unlawful assembly is lighter than the one in this Bill.

* The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory pointed out that under **British** law persons involved in what was deemed to be an unlawful assembly had the right to have their case determined by a jury.

* Under the **British** system does an assembly become an unlawful assembly after lt has started off as a lawful assembly?

* The persons involved may become subject to a penalty if it is considered that there is a reasonable apprehension of violence but under the **British** system this is determined by a jury.

* Under the **British** system an unlawful assembly is determined by a jury.

* The **British** common law is reasonable.

* He is wrong on two counts - whether it be a State count or whether it be the **British** common law position.

* By these 3 factors, as has been mentioned, we have the right to say, firstly, that this clause is harsh and unreasonable; secondly, it is unnecessary because of the State Jaw; and thirdly, it takes away any rights that the accused might have had under the **British** common law system.

* The **British** had two contacts with Cyprus.

* The second **British** occupation began in 1878 and lasted for 80 years.

* The 'Lancet', probably the most respected medical journal in the world, said recently of the **British** scheme: 
The Australian universal health insurance program will not be a national health service in the same sense as the **British** scheme, since Australian doctors will still collect .a fee for every service they perform and will not work for the Government.

* But, like the **British** national health service and the Canadian insurance scheme, the Australian universal health insurance program will ensure that everybody in the community will receive health care as a basic right rather than as a purchased privilege.

* The Australian community is completely different from the American or **British** community.

* A **British** delegation which was in Australia only a matter of weeks ago visited north Queensland.

* Lord Mansfield in a case in the **British** courts many years ago suggested that it was the right of individuals to so order their affairs as to pay the minimum tax or to minimise their liabilities.

* - Sir John Hill, the  Chairman  of the **British** Atomic Energy Agency, visited me this week to bring me up to date with activities in Britain relating to the nuclear fuel cycle but principally to find out what progress has been made in Australia with the development of uranium and the prospects of future exports of uranium.

* Some 13 per cent of **British** power now is being produced from nuclear operations.

* He made a speech which was remarkably redolent of the great conflict between the **British** Isles and the American colonies over representation.

* The argument was based principally on the fact that the **British** Post Office is now a statutory corporation.

* He was a leading **British** industrialist who, when the **British** Post Office was converted into a statutory corporation, was brought onto the Board to bring from outside some knowledge and experience to help in the running of the organisation.

* Recently he wrote to the Australian Post Office and asked whether we would agree to a visit by 4 senior members of the staff of the **British** Post Office to study the organisation and some aspects of the Australian Post Office, particularly in regard to exchange switching and exchange equipment programming and procurement.

* The **British** authorities keep us informed about constitutional developments in respect of their South Pacific territories, including the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate.

* Australia likewise keeps the **British** authorities informed in respect of the territories for which it is responsible.

* The **British** Government's policy with respect to its territories has been stated on various occasions.

* For example, the communique issued at the 1966 Prime Ministers' Conference in London included the following: 'The **British** Government stands ready to give independence to territories that want it and can sustain it.

* Australia stands in clear danger of drifting into the same kind of economic chaos that overtook the **British** economy.

* Our long term inflationary rate of 3 per cent per annum was admirable by world standards, but we are now inflating at about the same rate as the **British**.

* I suggest that the Prime Minister should despatch  Mr Cameron  with all possible haste to advise  Mr Heath  of his revolutionary anti-inflationary discovery as a contribution to the restoration of the **British** economic fortunes.

* This technique was a major innovation in **British** industrial relations in the 1960s and would inject a fruitful new criterion into the negotiations arena.

* Can he say whether She decision not to televise any of the soccer world cup games caused disappointment to many Australians and to large numbers of **British** and European migrants.

* The background paper titled 'Health and Safety Aspects of Nuclear Power Generation' which was published with the documents outlining the Government's decisions quotes from the **British** Royal Commission on Environmental Pollutionthe Flowers Commission.

* It deals particularly with this issue of nuclear waste disposal and contains the terse sentence: 
What added export income would have been obtained from the **British** market for Australian butter if the average Australian wholesale domestic price had been obtained at the point of unloading.

* After opening this session  Her  Majesty has flown home to Britain to play a part in one of the most crucial elections in **British** history.

* The **British** High Commission releases a Press statement saying the same thing.

* The **British** had no compunction about saying: 'Of course there is a special half a kilo there.

* The **British** know, but we have no access to the information.

* It is wrong, quite wrong, for a Minister to come in here and say: 'Everything will be in order, we are going to get the **British** out to advise us'.

* Accordingly, because of what has happened, I move: 
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:  this House censures the Government for its incompetence and failure to adopt responsible nuclear policies and its misleading and contradictory statements about **British** atomic weapons tests and forthwith calls upon the Government to appoint an independent committee of inquiry to report upon- 
Has the Government given its consent and backing to a joint project between the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the **British** Aircraft Corporation for the development and manufacture of a variable geometry dual-purpose supersonic attack/trainer.

* But what he has lost sight of is that only a small proportion of this integration effort is required for **British** migrants.

* Indeed, the fact that we have been able, largely successfully, to digest a migrant intake in the post-war years that is proportionately greater than that of any other country in history, or modern history anyway, is due to one cardinal feature of every migration program in every year since 1945, that is, that the proportion of **British** migrants has never fallen below 50 per cent of the total and in many years has been considerably above it.

* The Minister has done a pretty good job already in making sure that **British** migrants will be a smaller proportion of future programs.

* However, what the honourable member for Murray did not say is that this specialist has post-graduate qualifications, including fellowship of the **British** and Australian Royal Colleges in the relevant specialty.

* It is true that Peking through the **British** in mid March complained of foolish statements on China by Australian Ministers.

* The **British** and all other colonial powers have taken this point of view from time to time.

* The Americans do not have the background that the **British** have because the **British** fought an infinite number of colonial wars which they sometimes won and sometimes lost.

* When the **British** lost a war they postponed or adjourned that conflict for 20 or 30 years and then tried again.

* This was the way in which the **British** Empire was built up.

* The expression 'Southern Rhodesia' refers to the **British** Colony whose unilateral declaration of independence in 1965 has never been recognised either by the **British** Government or by any member of the United Nations.

* I say that that is not so; the motion was moved for the reasons set out in the Constitution and for the reasons that have motivated 2 other Parliaments, the **British** and the Canadian parliaments, to do something about this matter.

* He asked the following question: Does the Australian Labor Party want to introduce the concept that has been adopted for the **British** Post Office?

* Comparisons have been made and undoubtedly will be made in the future - I think the Postmaster-General made some between the Australian Post Office and the **British** Post Office.

* There is no real similarity between the **British** Post Office and the Australian Post Office except that they are both post offices.

* Therefore it is very dangerous to make comparisons on this basis in order to place figures before us of comparative situations and say: 'This is the situation in the **British** Post Office.

* These officials can no longer receive **British** passports.

* Then the only **British** territory in the South Seas will be the Solomon Islands Protectorate.

* It is all the more urgent, therefore, that Australia make arrangements with the retiring **British** to facilitate postindependence arrangements between the Solomons and New Guinea.

* The Minister for Defence made it quite clear that in his belief the **British** policy of withdrawal from our region was irreversible.

* However, the Minister for Defence plainly accepts the irreversibility of **British** disengagement.

* Yet the Minister for External Affairs makes a last minute plea for a reversal of established **British** policy.

* Even should there be a change of government in Britain between now and 1976 - the election after next - there will be no significant **British** presence in this area after 1971.

* I agree with the Minister that the 3 factors he mentions - **British** withdrawal, the role of Japan and the Nixon doctrine - are 3 of the most significant factors in determining Australian foreign and defence policies.

* Since the terms of reference of the new committee are based essentially on the **British** Parliament's Expenditure Committee, I wish to explain to the House some of the very important work which that Committee has conducted.

* It has been rightly pointed out by a previous  speaker  that there has been merely 'qualified approval' for the work of the **British** Expenditure Committee.

* For example, prior to the period 1973-74 the **British** Committee brought down reports on public expenditure and economic management, the relationships of expenditure to needs, the revision of the form of Supply estimates, public money in the private sector, youth employment services, employment of women, employment services and training, diplomatic staff and overseas accommodation, various aspects of defence expenditure, the **British** Council and further and higher education.

* Whereas the **British** Committee had a number of subcommittees covering trade and industry, employment and social services, defence and external affairs, education and the arts, etc.

* We have no representatives in Peking but we have asked the **British** authorities to do the maximum in their capacity to try to find out whether he is under supervision or what the Chinese authorities are doing with him.

* The **British** have advised us that the Chinese are particularly careful about giving any kind of information at all.

* On several occasions we have asked the **British** representatives in Peking to continue their investigations, and they have done so.

* But that is for the **British**.

* I remember it very well during World War II, when we were being convoyed across the Indian Ocean by the Australian cruiser 'Canberra' when 4 transports were handed over to the 'Ajax' and another **British** ship for convoy purposes.

* The Australian flag is not some badge of infamy to show that we were a colony of the **British** rebelling against Britain.

* We do have a past and we are proud of the fact that most of us have **British** origins.

* Most of us are proud of the fact that we inherited this institution of Parliament and that we inherited a **British** system of law, which is superior to any in the world.

* The **British** and the French governments were involved in considerable litigation when they tried to obtain compensation or part compensation for the damage that resulted from that accident.

* As a result of that accident on the **British** coast, the **British** Parliament set up a parliamentary select committee to investigate the problem.

* The **British** and French governments endeavoured to obtain compensation and were unable to do so.

* One of them, the Prime Minister stated, came from the **British** Consul-General in Hong Kong who, of course, does not exist since Hong Kong is a Crown colony.

* We sat for well under a third of the time of the **British** or the Canadian lower houses and scarcely a quarter of the time of the United States House of Representatives.

* In the **British** Parliament the universal' practice is to answer questions on notice within 2 working days after they are placed on the Notice Paper.

* In the two years following the adoption in 1947 of its first decision on the subject the Assembly tried and failed to create two independent States within the boundaries of the former **British** mandate.

* The question of Palestine became in turn the question of the Middle East, with all the unhappy consequences that still remain with us, until the re-emergence only a few years ago in decisions of the General Assembly of the concept of self-determination for the Palestinians, that is the Arab people of the former **British** mandate of Palestine.

* There is an element of irony in the fact that the General Assembly once again finds itself in its position of twentyseven years ago- considering the possible establishment of two independent states within the area that constituted the former **British** mandate of Palestine.

* But I refer to the reports from some **British** companies.

* Investigation shows thai the **British** Armed Forces have both furnished and unfurnished married quarters.

* As a **British** subject holding an official position, the Prime Minister of Fiji is free to visit Australia without requiring a visa.

* The exception is in relation to **British** Europeans.

* But apart from **British** Europeans, everybody else in the world requires a visa to visit this country.

* Over 2.5 million of them have been **British** subjects.

* Of those not **British** subjects and eligible to aply for Australain citizenship because they have resided in Australia for 5 years, 701,448 had applied for naturalisation up until a little earlier this year.

* At the present time **British** subjects may apply for Australian citizenship by notification after having resided in Australia for one year.

* I can see merit in making a uniform standard but I am not happy with taking away the preference which previously applied to **British** people enabling them to apply for citizenship after 12 months if they wished to do so.

* Their **British** citizenship gives them that right.

* But we are basically a **British** country.

* We were settled by **British** people.

* I believe that we are losing or weakening another link with Britain by taking away the preference' which **British** migrants presently enjoy.

* But it does not fundamentally alter the fact of our **British** heritage.

* The Opposition believes that because of the strong historic and constitutional links between Australia and Britain - and the other factors I have mentioned - the preferment for **British** subjects should be continued.

* For the same reasons the Opposition would like to see a continuation of the preferential treatment afforded to **British** subjects in relation to the proposal that an oath or affirmation of allegiance be taken by all except children under the age of 16 years, regardless of their former nationality.

* We have the right to assume that because of their **British** nationality **British** subjects already are loyal subjects in the terms of the existing legislation and, therefore, swearing a separate oath on arrival in Australia is superfluous.

* -Attention has been drawn to reports dated 10 September that the annual conference of the **British** Trade Union Congress advocated an expanded nuclear program.

* Are we going to legislate without paying regard to the experience that the **British** people have had over four or five years and to the review by a woman of that kind regarding the operations of that Act?

* The Minister might confirm that the vessels are **British** owned, as is stated.

* The question that one must ask is whether these Russian ships have had to face the same difficulties when they called at Australian ports as have **British** ships and other foreign flag ships.

* The article is headed: 'Russia poised to buy **British** ships under big expansion program'.

* The article states: 
The real point is that here are Russian seamen who are paid pitiful rates and whose vessels apparently are not, as far as we know, subject to indemnity payments whereas **British** or any other foreign flag ships are required to make those payments.

* The point 1 want to make is that in **British** law there is a tradition built up over many years, that where a man has an allegation made against him of such a nature that he ought to deny it and fails to take the appropriate action to deny it then there is case law - law which has been established recently in the High Court of Australia in the Woon case.

* The terms 'proof and 'proof spirit' are derived from the **British** system of alcohol measurement.

* it is futile for demands to be made for more Australian drama unless it is able to compete in an artistic sense with the best **British** and American programmes.

* We thought it would be a matter of complete confusion to the people who came from the former **British** Commonwealth countries - now, Commonwealth of Nations countries - who would under our laws take a new citizenship.

* He referred to his concern for **British** migrants so I thought I would quote a letter from the  President  of the **British** Sub-branch of the Victorian Returned Services League.

* I had made a statement prior to receiving this letter in which I said that there had been in the past a neglect of United Kingdom settlers and the  President  wrote a letter to me on 2nd May in which he stated: 
That is the voice of the **British** migrants, not the members of the Opposition and I am grateful for it because that is my dedication.

* Formerly the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act was identical in the respect of crewing matters for visiting **British** ships with the provisions contained in Part II of the Australian Navigation Act 1912-73.

* Since the changes to the **British** Law have been made it would create difficulties if the Australian law was to apply to visiting **British** ships.

* The definition of a visiting **British** ship contained in clause 4 of the Bill makes provision for regulations which stipulate which ships are not visiting **British** ships.

* There is a considerable volume of Australian bulk exports at present being carried in **British** registered vessels under continuous voyage or time charters for a period which may range from 12 months up to 2 years.

* I consider it important that this issue be clarified so that Australian charterers may know whether **British** or Australian law applies to the vessel under charter to them.

* The Bill will raise the low limits on ship owner's liability which are contained in the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and which still apply in Australia.

* The owner of a **British** vessel was excluded from liability for loss or damage which occurred without actual fault or privity on his part, if goods are damaged by fire or theft while on board the ship.

* Similarly, as regards loss of life or personal injury, the liability of an owner of a **British** ship may be limited where the loss or injury is caused by any person being carried on the vessel.

* Furthermore the State powers over shipping and navigation are the powers which the **British** Parliament possessed in 1901.

* The Australian Act, although based in many respects on the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 did not discourage or make incursions into the powers of the **British** Shipping Acts.

* The changes which have occurred in world shipping since the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 have been far-reaching.

* Mr J. T. Corbett, General Manager of South **British** United Life Assurance Co. Ltd.

* He was awarded the Order of the **British** Empire and mentioned in despatches.

* It is not possible to say now what the final effects of **British** entry will be but satisfactory alternative markets will be found for some of the displaced trade.

* In fact, of course, I have been trying to establish just what were these proposals and with whom he talked because  Sir Alex  Douglas-Home, who is the **British** Foreign Secretary, in reply to  Mr Leslie  Huckfield, M.P., in a letter stated: 
That is a very big statement for the **British** Foreign Minister to make - that our Government has expressed satisfaction at the arrangements made for our industries.

* Firstly, it was indicated by the **British** that there had been no negotiations at all.

* On 13 th July in the **British** House of Commons  Mr Redmond,  asked the Prime Minister whether he would make a statement on his recent official discussions with the  Deputy  Prime Minister of Australia.

* Another question on the same subject was asked in the **British** House of Commons by  Mr St  John-Stevas and the Prime Minister of Great Britain replied: 
The **British** Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs is a  Mr Anthony  Royle and his report on the visit of the Minister for Trade and Industry was in these terms: 
I draw attention to the fact that one industry with which I am familiar, namely, the rice industry, faced a problem  10  years ago.

* Of course, the canned fruits industry was in a different situation because it came into being under the umbrella of imperial preference and treaties which were entered into between the Australian Government and the **British** Government.

* I draw attention to these great gaps in the statement of the Minister for Trade and Industry and also to the great differences between what he has said in Australia and what the **British** Prime Minister, the **British** Foreign Secretary and other **British** Ministers who have given replies on this subject have said in their country.

* I was interested, when trying to make some comparison between what applies here and what applies in some other parts to find that in the **British** system of death duties - the method in which duty falls has been restructured to some extent - there has always been a scheme whereby the rate of duty payable on what might be called agricultural or farming units in that country was only 45% of the duty applicable in other cases for estates of the same size.

* in the middle ranges (A50,000-A250,000 and equivalents) the Australian and **British** rates are roughly comparable, as are those of Canada and 
If one had much more time one could argue the ethics of whether or not death duties should be imposed.

* In the **British** Act there is a small business section.

* The Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian aircraft industry have been negotiating with the **British** in an endeavour to come to an arrangement regarding the building of these aircraft in Australia.

* Qantas should have been doing what the **British** Overseas Airways Corporation has done.

* 1 ) What steps have been taken to verify the allegations by  Dr John  Coulter and  Mr Avon  Hudson on the radio program  AM  on 2 and 3 December 1976 that the **British** Government had flown radio-active waste including plutonium from nuclear power stations in Britain to Maralinga, where it was secretly buried at night.

* Washings from **British** Service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh airfield for cleaning and maintenance.

* Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with the **British** in conducting secret atomic 'Trigger' tests at Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at Maralinga?

* In 1968 the **British** Atomic Energy Weapons Research establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga.

* The purpose of each explosion was related to the development of a **British** nuclear deterrent.

* Detailed requirements for the condition in which Maralinga was to be left when **British** activity closed down were laid down in 1967 by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee set up by the Australian Government.

* After the **British** clean-up operation of that year the AWTSC reported to the Australian Prime Minister of the time that they 'were satisfied Maralinga was radio-logically safe.

* debris from **British** experiments 15 to 25 years ago; washings from **British** service aircraft which participated in nuclear tests at Christmas Island (in the Pacific) in 1957-58; and nuclear waste from the University of Adelaide.

* I have explained that the **British** exploded 12 atomic devices in Australia, three at Monte Bello, seven at Maralinga, and two at Emu Field near Maralinga.

* Between 1955 and 1963 the **British** also conducted a series of other scientific experiments with radioactive substances at Maralinga.

* This is one reason why the return of the material to the **British** may be the more desirable option.

* Arrangements have been made for a joint investigation with **British** officials of the situation.

* We are concerned about chaos being caused, but we believe that there is a constitutional process- a Westminster process- that has been accepted through **British** parliaments over the years; that is, once money is cut off, the Government goes to the people and lets the people decide.

* They stood in the House night after night with the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  calling for the bombing of **British** shipping in the harbour of Haiphong.

* Does anybody argue that Pandit Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi stood against the law of the land in **British** India?

* Of course they did, and they finished up in a **British** gaol.

* and (2) The honourable member will be aware that each of the Australian Armed Services currently has its own system of disciplinary legislation, based substantially on **British** legislation which has been modified in its application to the Australian Services.

* When I was in the United Kingdom in November of last year I did take up with the **British** Prime Minister and also with the Chancellor of the Exchequer two separate but related problems.

* Later on at a discussion I had with the Confederation of **British** Industries 1 again raised this question together with the second question that I will mention in a few moment's time, and I again expressed the Australian attitude.

* When one looks at any of the industrial jurisdictions around the world, at the recent **British** legislation, at what happens in New Zealand, the United States of America and practically any other country that comes to mind, it is clear that sanctions are an integral form of industrial jurisdiction.

* Has the **British** Government advised the Australian Government of any orders applied to any State under the Merchant Shipping Act since the answer by the former Minister for Shipping and Transport to me on 22nd September 1965 (Hansard, page 1186).

* Is he aware of any approaches to the **British** Government by or on behalf of the States or any of them for amendments to the Merchant Shipping Act to remove the restrictions imposed by that Act on the legislative powers of the State Parliaments.

* (a) With the possible exception of a very small number of non-European dependent family members of European family heads who have not been recorded statistically as such all the 3,891 assisted settlers who came from unstated **British** Commonwealth countries in 1970 were of European descent.

* We are in many respects the inheritors of the Greek tradition and culture, from the tiny city of Athens of 2,000 years ago, and of the **British** traditions and developments, in politics and so on, of the last few hundred years- the traditions of that tiny off-shore island of Europe.

* I close on this point: Perhaps the best way of summarising a response to the program put down by the Opposition is to quote the words of the **British** Labour Prime Minister when recently he said: 
Like the honourable member for Indi, I am delighted to see the extension of the services provided to people who served in various theatres of war and especially people who were prisoners of war.

* I am equally delighted to see that **British** Commonwealth ex-servicemen who, if they are not of **British** origin are not entitled to a service pension because that country does not provide a pension of this nature, will now become entitled after 10 years residence in Australia to receive a repatriation pension.

* The cash subsidy will also be paid to other rich and affluent companies, such as Elder Smith and Co. Ltd and the **British** Tobacco Co.

* Will anybody say that the Government could not look at the balance sheets of **British** Tobacco Co.

* In the case of the pound sterling, imports are now 21 per cent less, taking into account also the effect of **British** devaluation which has been going on since July 1972.

* The **British** technical assessment team made a joint report with Australian experts on the nuclear material at Maralinga: 
**British** Leyland Motor Corp. of Aust.

* The ABC staff and the ABC programmers- those who decide the content of ABC programs- should realise when they are dealing with issues like this that overseas the ABC is regarded in some ways as the **British** Broadcasting Corporation is regarded; as a semiofficial newsagency.

* The **British** have demonstrated their belief in the doctrine of national self-interest and we would be worse than foolish to expect that the interests of America and Australia's self-interest will always coincide.

* We have only to consider the hatred which exists between many of the African nations - the sufferings of the Arabs in Tanzania; the Ibos in Nigeria; the position of 50,000 Indians in Kenya, all of them with **British** passports - so do not talk to me about **British** colonialism - the untouchables in India; and the Muslims in the Sudan, to name a few examples.

* There are at least 9 **British** or African card carrying Communists on the committee of this organisation which has direct links with such revolutionary and violent organisations as the Pan African organisation and the African National Congress.

* I should like to see our Government encourage the **British** in their negotiations with South Africa on the Simonstown Agreement.

* The ridiculous arms embargo placed on South Africa by the **British** Socialist Government is a serious breach of that Agreement and of direct concern to Australia and other countries dependent on the Cape route for trade and communications.

* I do not think anyone in Britain knows more about **British** politics than does Alf Garnett.

* It is an interesting sight to see parked on the tarmac at the same time one Qantas Airways Ltd Boeing 747, one **British** Airways Boeing 747, one Air New Zealand DC10 and one Air Niugini Boeing 707 which lands at Brisbane airport one day a week.

* The House will be aware that  Mr Smith  was awarded the Order of the **British** Empire for services to music, that he is a tenor of a particular character- I think he is termed a pinto tenor.

* To inform the House and the country of what I think might be done by Australia to safeguard our trade as much as possible, in the event of **British** entry to the European Economic Community, is the purpose of this statement.

* In other words, although we have had considerable success in diversifying our export trade and although, as a consequence, our dependence on the United Kingdom market in balance of payments- terms has declined, the loss of the **British** market for certain major primary commodities would threaten the very existence of major sectors of Australia's primary industry and major sources of foreign exchange earning.

* I did not find in Britain any evidence that the **British** Government was prepared to stipulate conditions of her entry which would give a protection to the interests of her Commonwealth trading partners, except perhaps in relation to sugar and to the very special problem of New Zealand.

* I reminded the **British** that up until 3 years ago Britain was Australia's largest single supplier and also our biggest customer.

* Consequences for Australian Trade of **British** Entry to the European Economic Community - Ministerial Statement, 20th August 1970.

* He drew attention to the investigation by the **British** Committee on the Age of Majority and to the conclusions to which that Committee came.

* It is interesting to look at some of the conclusions to which the **British** Committee came.

* In its report under '.he heading: 'General Conclusions' it was stated firstly: 
They are some of the general conclusions reached by the **British** Committee after taking evidence and investigating the mat ter in great detail and I emphasise compendiously that its conclusions tended towards lowering the age of majority.

* It is interesting and in some respects frightening to see how closely the present political situation in Australia is aligning itself with the Soviet take-over pattern of Czechoslovakia, the details of which were laid out in the Soviet manual circulated by the **British** Labor Leader, Lord Morrison.

* I wish to raise a serious anomaly which exists in relation to Australian citizens who joined **British** forces - in this case I am referring to the **British** Air Force- in the 1930s.

* He elected to take his discharge in Australia for personal reasons with a **British** bride.

* He has suffered a time of trial and tribulation since discharge, primarily because of his fight to obtain recognition for service rendered to the **British** Commonwealth.

* I ask the responsible Minister to look at the probability of giving full recognition to these people who are Australian citizens, who have retained their citizenship right through and who have served the **British** Commonwealth and the **British** Commonwealth only.I can understand some reluctance, to extend this benefit to people who are European migrants.

* But I feel that people who are Australian citizens and who have served with **British** forces should be given recognition.

* It is a fact that informal talks are taking place in London between the Ministers of the **British** Government and Ministers of the Commonwealth developing countries concerned with the export of sugar.

* The informal meeting which is taking place is between the **British** Government and the governments of the Commonwealth developing countries under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of Accession.

* The **British** Government is expected to confirm assurances that secure and continuing markets for sugar will be available to the Commonwealth developing countries in the European Economic Community.

* We will be conducting separate negotiations with the **British** Government through the auspices of the Commission of the European Economic Community in London and in Brussels.

* As honourable members know, the **British** Government has given a firm assurance that Australia's exports of sugar will be safeguarded after 1974 to the degree that phasing out conditions will apply The conference relating to Australian sugar will take place separately.

* While details of facilities provided in Japanese, **British**, Swedish and West German yards are not available, basically these would be similar to facilities provided in Australian yards.

* I am informed that the Agents-General have advised the Australian High Commissioner that they have not gone direct to the **British** Home Office at any time.

* and (3) The High Commissioner and  Mr Maudling,  the previous Home Secretary, have had several talks during the last 2 years about Australians entering the United Kingdom particularly when the **British** Government's immigration legislation was being drawn up.

* On 12th May 1972, on behalf of the 6 Agents-General, the High 
Commissioner wrote to  Mr M audling  about the administration of the **British** Immigration Act in so far as it affects visiting Australians and the treatment they are accorded by immigration officers at ports of entry.

* I ask: Are you aware that whilst several honourable members, including myself, were guests of the  President  of the Senate and yourself as Joint Presidents of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association at a dinner in the private dining room in Parliament House in honour of the distinguished delegates from the **British** Parliament whom we welcomed to the chamber that afternoon, there was being held in another private dining room in Parliament House a party for some Ministers and members of the 'Class of 66 ', at which a birthday cake was produced from which jumped a girl clad in a brief bikini of which the top half was retained only momentarily?

* The honourable member also questioned the figures in relation to **British** migration.

* Although this year we will meet the overall target, I would expect that the **British** migration figures will be down and that we will receive somewhere between 60,000 and 65,000 **British** migrants.

* In a series of speeches, television and radio appearances and newspaper articles the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has vented his prejudice against **British** migrants who engage in trade union affairs by blaming them for the dire economic straits into which this country is steadily sinking.

* He strongly implied that Australian citizens of **British** origin who get themselves mixed up in strikes should be deported.

* He said: 
The spate of attacks on **British** migrants by the Minister for Primary Industry last week cannot, therefore, be viewed in isolation.

* Just over a week ago at the time the Minister for Primary Industry launched his attack on **British** migrants  Mr Barry  Cassell, the Federal Director of the National Country Party, announced he was leaving that job to become National Director of the Cattlemen's Union of Australia, an organisation that has been trenchantly critical of the Government.

* Nor did his rantings about the **British** disease cut any ice with those who understand rural problems and are concerned to see policy initiatives undertaken to solve them.

* It stated: 
The Federal Government should stop bashing the unions and the **British**, a leader of the beef industry said yesterday.

* So there we have the ex-Federal Director of the National Country Party just over a week ago publicly saying that this campaign of denigration of the trade union movement and the **British** should stop.

* Mr Cassell  's comments demonstrate the patheticness of the Minister's campaign against **British** migrants.

* Furthermore, by calling for deportation or discriminatory treatment for **British** migrants because of their participation in trade union affairs, the Minister not only offends the **British** born but all the nonBritish migrants who are made to realise that they are still regarded as different from Australian-born citizens by some people in power and therefore liable to be denounced or discriminated against.

* As we have been talking about the **British** disease, so described by the Minister for Primary Industry, I refer to an article which appeared in a German magazine  Der Spiegel  on 1 August.

* The article goes on to make the point that the German manager in Britain sees poor management, inadequate investment and insensitive industrial relations as the cause of the so-called **British** disease; not the **British** workers or their unions.

* The **British** fleet is no longer here and the **British** power can no longer protect us.

* The honourable member pointed out that the exports credit agency in Britain insures 36 per cent of **British** exports which is more than double the percentage that we insure in Australia.

* This is because the **British** economy is more geared to exporting, is more sophisticated and has had more development.

* The first was that the ship in question was a **British** ship and the second was that the criminal law extended to all **British** ships.

* The ground for deciding that the ship was **British** was that it was owned by Australian citizens, who were considered to be **British** subjects within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act.

* when a new offence in English law is created by a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament it ipso facto becomes an offence if it is created ona **British** ship '.

* What we are asserting is that if you state that you wish to apply State law, you should really be saying that you wish to apply that law exclusive of any application of **British** law as it has been applied by the Privy Council.

* The competitors are the United States P3 type and the **British** Nimrod.

* The **British** built prototype Concorde is to do 50 high speed test runs shortly down the western coast of Britain, laying a swathe of sonic booms 50 miles wide.

* The **British** report says:  131.

* Surely he realises and must assume that there is good reason for the provisions of the Migration Act- that there is a strong case to be made out for having an open door as it were for the people's representatives of the various member countries of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations.

* No criminal charge has been laid against him under **British** laws.

* He is drawing a very long bow and is basing his argument on false premises when he attempts to draw an analogy between allowing a member of a parliament of the **British** Commonwealth having a complete and unrestricted right to come into Australia against the decision of the Australian Government not to grant a visa to representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation or the South African Cricket Association.

* I think that the Minister's actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the immigration laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the rights of members of Parliament of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity.

* The honourable member for Maribyrnong will know that, following the publication of the draft environmental impact study by **British** Airways, submissions were invited to be lodged with my colleague the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development.

* That a section 82 (9A) be inserted to read: 'Where it is proposed to engage for employment under this section a person who is not a **British** subject, or a person who is a **British** subject but is also a national of another country, the Minister may, after a report from the Board and if it appears to him that the employment of that person would not be  prejudical  to the national security, the preservation of official secrecy of any other interest  of the Commonwealth, determine that the last preceding sub-section is not to apply in relation to the engagement of that person'.

* Under the proposed new arrangements for excursion air fares between Australia and London, will tour packagers be able to negotiate with airlines to create package deals not utilising Qantas and **British** Airways services.

* -I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: Is he aware of a **British** Broadcasting Commission interview on the  Panorama  program between Alexander Solzhenitsyn and Michael Charlton?

* Will the Minister have discussions with the ABC and use his very best endeavours, of which we are deeply appreciative, to have this interview shown so that - 
About the middle of the last century a  Mr Moorsen  was instructed by the **British** Government to prepare rules.

* It is a **British** registered ship.

* A report in the 'London Times' of 5 October 1973 dealing with the education debate in the **British** Labour Party is headed: Abolition of privilege but no pledge on "top 25" schools'.

* The **British** Labour Party spokesman on education is quoted in that article as saying: 
That is what the education spokesman for the **British** Labour Party said about independent schools in that country.

* The outcome of the debate to which I have referred was that the policy espoused by the **British** Labour Party at the present time is that government money for private schools is to be phased out and not only are private schools to be stripped of government money but also they are physically going to be closed down in the ultimate.

* Tonight honourable members opposite, by voting against these things, will militate against the chances of a ( **British** subject voting.

* 1 received this letter today from a **British** migrant in the Fairy Meadow Hostel, which is situated within my constituency.

* It reads: 
I am a **British** migrant and my wife and my J children .

* The position at the present time as we know from **British** Government sources is that there are proposals for the EEC itself to buy sugar possibly on the world market, and then within the provisions of the common agricultural policy of the EEC to provide that sugar to the member countries of the EEC.

* I am aware of statements made by the **British** Prime Minister.

* These developments include the effects of **British** entry into the European Economic Community, the increasing competition in this region from European fruit, and the increasing competition from other exporting countries supplying the **British** and European markets.

* It is also to the credit of the United Kingdom that it never backed the United States, although I believe that Harold Wilson could have been stronger in that he did not dissociate the **British** people from the Vietnam war until the Americans started to bomb North Vietnam.

* The **British** Labour Party made great alterations in defence expenditure.

* My family came originally from the **British** Isles, mostly from Scotland.

* Our parents and grandparents who came from the **British** Isles in the last century must have undertaken a pretty rigorous exercise, but at least they were coming to a country in which the society was basically the same as the one they had left, where the language was the same, where the social mores were the same, where the general nuances of society, political, economical, social were the same.

* Schools with 300 or 400 children saw their populations grow to 500 or 600, with 400 of the pupils perhaps coming from anywhere but the **British** Isles or from Anglo-Saxon stock.

* But one step we could and should take straight away is to lower tariffs to the **British** preferential level for products where the **British** preference is the minimum of  Ti  per cent and where there are substantial **British** imports, that is, products in which Britain is competitive.

* The **British** Royal Commission makes an attempt to analyse the problems of pollution control in terms of costs and benefits.

* If Lord Byron was an Australian citizen and not a **British** citizen what would be the requirements of Australia?

* What would happen with respect to **British** soldiers serving overseas if they happened to be Australian soldiers?

* We know that this event has often been characterised historically as one of the greatest victories of the **British** Navy.

* Are we to say, as has been said over and over again tonight, that the legislation would affect some modest action by an Australian overseas such as kicking in a telephone booth or punching a referee at a **British** soccer game?

* I hope also that at some time in the future the Government will give some consideration to the English analogy and to following the decision that was made by the **British** Parliament in 1957 when it was decided to write out of the English law those old statutory provisions which disqualified persons who had entered into contracts and agreements with the public service from entering Parliament.

* With reference to an interview given by the Queensland Minister for Justice on the ABC radio program AM on 22 November 1976, following his return from a visit to London where he apparently had discussions with **British** officials on constitutional matters, has the AttorneyGeneral's attention been drawn to the statement by the Minister for Justice, during the course of that interview, that his visit to London would be most significant to all Queenslanders and possibly to all Australians.

* Have the Queensland and **British** Governments informed the Australian Government of the nature of the discussions that took place.

* Does the Government agree with the Statement made by the **British** Government as long ago as 1908 when it stated that His Majesty's Government are pledged to the view that, so far as the relations of Australia with foreign Nations are concerned, the Government of the Commonwealth alone can speak, and that for everything affecting external communities the Government of the Commonwealth alone are responsible to the Crown.

* The only hope I have - it is a poor hope - for a solution is to recall the words of Nye Bevan, the left wing socialist leader in Britain who was asked one day by a questioner why it was with such a large proportion of the **British** electorate being unionists, the Labour Party did not win every election.

* He said " sourly that at each election the **British** unionist votes in condemnation of his own anarchy.

* Let us take the case of Abrolhos Oil NL, originally a small Australian company and now associated with the **British** Petroleum Company of Australia Ltd and other partners, the names of which I am not certain.

* He mentions the **British** Government as an example.

* The **British** Government is represented on the board of directors but it is understood that the government representative has very limited powers, and they are powers of negation.

* The situation is that New South Wales canning fruit growers are in an industry sponsored by government particularly to service the **British** market.

* I have no doubt that the inspiration for this Film Development Corporation comes from Great Britain from that great **British** Socialist, Harold Wilson, now the Prime Minister of Great Britain but in 1949  President  of the Board of Trade, who established a film corporation with Stg5m at that time, stating when he introduced the appropriate legislation that it would have 'power to lend this money on reasonable commercial terms for film production'.

* When one reads through the second reading speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  in support of this Bill one gathers that he must have been greatly influenced by this great **British** Socialist.

* In the United Kingdom in 1960 entertainment tax on cinemas was abolished and replaced by a 7i% levy on tickets, to be paid into the **British** Film Production Fund.

* The film was released by **British** Empire Films Pty Ltd, which is the distribution side of the Greater Union group of companies which is 50% owned by the Rank Organisation of Great Britain.

* It is obvious from what occurred on this occasion that the people who contributed the creative work, who took the greatest risk - that is, the producers of the film - received only $500,000 out of the S3m grossed by the film and were exploited because of the peculiarly advantageous position which was held by **British** Empire Films with its tie-up through the Greater Union group of companies that are 50% owned by the Rank organisation in the United Kingdom.

* In the Budget debate last year I urged speedier action on tariff review and particularly I urged the cancellation of unused tariffs and the bringing down of all tariffs to the **British** preferential level in all cases where **British** imports were competitive.

* Hansard  plays an extraordinarily important role in the **British** parliamentary system.

* **British** experience with the abolition of resale price maintenance suggests that- not many will fail, but the **British** retail problem is not the same as ours.

* Sixteen million people migrated from the **British** Isles alone in the period 1846 to 1932.

* We find, for example, that in my City of Hobart approximately 11 per cent - a relatively low level - of the population are migrants, roughly half **British** and half other.

* The honourable member for Fremantle has argued that **British** intervention in Asia is unlikely, at least on any substantial scale.

* At the same time, there might conceivably be some small **British** force which might be deployed in a very local situation in an area such as Malaysia.

* Between 1911 and 1914 there was a royal commission into the **British** Foreign Office.

* If over that period it was necessary for the **British** to look into the organisation of their Foreign Office, surely the time has come for us to have a look at our Department of External Affairs.

* The **British** themselves have consolidated the Foreign Office and the Dominions Office.

* Does the journal of the Rhodesian Information Centre support  a  government which is in a state of rebellion against the **British** Crown?

* We are still in the ridiculous situation whereby the **British** Parliament could rescind our Constitution tomorrow and we could do nothing about it.

* If an attempt had been made in Great Britain to exercise powers such as have been exercised here in recent years the **British** Parliament would have passed such further laws as would have even prevented the Monarch from remaining on the throne, or would have interfered with the rights of succession.

* That was referring to the re-opening of the Suez Canal- to move warships since it had been re-opened 6 months ago (although the U.S. and **British** navies had).

* We know that Diego Garcia was used by the **British** in World War II as a fueling base and that the United States Government entered into a long term agreement as far back as 1966 to take over Diego Garcia and to build up its defence forces there.

* I do not know whether we should move into the **British** system whereby departmental heads remain as the responsible auditing officers or whether we should move into the **British** system whereby the Public Accounts Committee uses the full facilities of the Auditor-General's Department.

* I sincerely hope that we move into the **British** habit of having at least one annual full debate on the work of the Public Accounts Committee.

* Firstly, it knows- I would have expected the honourable member for Holt to have mentioned it- the embarrassment that the **British** Government suffered recently when four or five of its nationals were tried and sentenced to death for fighting as mercenaries on the wrong side in Angola.

* I went on to inform the House that Colonel Peters was a retired former high-ranking **British** soldier.

* However, the article was printed in the United Kingdom Press and it was broadcast by the **British** Broadcasting Commission.

* It surprised many **British** people.

* The Australian mercenaries were proud of their achievement and profession and what they were doing on behalf of the Australian Government, the article in the **British** Press said, though they regretted that the ordinary campaign medals associated with normal military adventures were not for them.

* If this article and these allegations of Hungerford 's had been untrue, one would have expected a responsible Minister in  Mr McMahon's  Government at the time to deny in the **British** Press that the Australian Government was subsidising mercenaries to carry out the duties which were alleged by those 2 forthright Australian journalists.

* Has he forgotten the attempts of Hugh Gaitskell the former **British** Labour Party leader; the attempts by Walker of the **British** Labour Party and by Wilson, the Leader of the **British** Labour Party to endeavour to bring about peace negotiations?

* French and the **British** still have their bombs.

* The proper answer to the honourable member for Cowper  (Mr Robinson)  is that 3 weeks ago the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  conceded that 25 per cent of the Northern Territory was controlled by overseas interests; that solely Australian interests held only 43 per cent of the higher rainfall top end of the Territory; and that 29 per cent was held by joint Australian and overseas interests, 17.1 per cent by Americans, 7.3 per cent by Egyptians and 3.3 per cent by **British** interests.

* I should have thought that a more satisfactory situation would have been to provide that foreign country' meant any country outside Australia with the exception of- then we might well include- the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and other dominions of the **British** Commonwealth.

* If honourable members read the predecessors of our Constitution in **British** history- for instance, the Bill of Rightsand if they look at the assertion of supremacy of the Parliament in various ways I think that they will agree with me.

* Procedures differ slightly from country to country but in general all intending unassisted migrants other than **British** Europeans, and all intending assisted migrants are required to complete an application form and a medical examination form.

* The first part of the medical examination form for **British** assisted migrants (which is completed by the applicant) contains the following questions: 
The medical examination form completed by the medical examiner in the course of the medical examination of the applicant contains specific questions relating to 'nervous system' and (for **British** assisted migrant applicants) 'mental state' or (for other applicants) 'mental conditions and intelligence' and medical officers are alert to detect mental health problems.

* For **British** assisted migrants - 
At the same time I have reservations about whether the farmer is receiving the full value of the bounty.

* It may well be that a major effect of the bounty - I do not say the major effect - has been to help the manufacturer, the **British** Phosphate Commission and the Republic of Nauru.

* I think that my colleague the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  has done considerable research into this and I believe he would be able to give the Minister from the voluminous references that he always has on hand, chapter and verse of the breakdown of the $12 as it relates to the farmer, the manufacturer, the **British** Phosphate Commission and the Republic of Nauru.

* But in any event 1 would not be prepared to agree to change or to direct that a change be made until I had discussed it with the **British** Prime Minister and had also obtained the views of Buckingham Palace.

* Having created an acceptable pricing policy, I am quite certain that eventually we will be forced to establish a national oil corporation, similar to the **British** national oil corporation, perhaps partially funded by the resource rent tax on existing producers and with powers to raise its own further finance to participate in exploration, development of new wells and the marketing of its own oil.

* Contrast these opinions, expressed by eminent **British** lawyers, with the criticisms and hesitations voiced by some Australian State politicians.

* The actions of the Queensland Premier in repeatedly asking the **British** Government to seek advisory opinions from the Privy Council indicate only too clearly his desire to avoid the High Court.

* Even if governments had agreed to request the **British** Government to recommend to the Queen of Britain that she seek an advisory opinion from the **British** Privy Council, it would not have precluded litigation before the High Court and an advisory opinion from the Privy Council would not have prevailed against a judgment of the High Court.

* The plain fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister of the day,  Sir Robert  Menzies, decided and told the **British** they could carry out the explosions in Australia.

* We got more information yesterday from a Press release issued by the **British** High Commission than we have ever got from this Government.

* In a statement of one and a half pages the **British** High Commissioner had no trouble at all in telling us that there had been a series of explosions there up to 1 963.

* He was just doing his job as a reporter for the  Australian Financial Review,  and he said that we should look at the notes made by Eisenhower's special adviser, a fellow called Kistiakowsky, who made an entry in his diary in 1960, saying that he had a discussion with Lord Penney, the **British** scientist, about what was happening at Maralinga.

* In the statement yesterday issued by the **British** High Commission there is reference to the fact that 'experimentation', if not nuclear explosions, occurred up to 1963.

* There was a further explosion, which has not been detailed here, at Christmas Island- the **British** Christmas Island, not the Australian Christmas Island- which apparently involved the detonation of a hydrogen bomb.

* Yesterday we learned from the **British** that at least half a kilogram of plutonium was buried in a special segment called a discrete mass.

* But we got yesterday from the **British** High Commission the information that they were experimenting at least in some form with the shattering of plutonium discs into numerous fragments.

* We learned from the **British** High Commission that the existence of half a kilogram of plutonium was not disclosed before.

* The truth has not been told, and we now have to wait for a team of **British** scientists to come here from the United Kingdom to tell us what is there.

* The **British** came out and said: 'That's damn ridiculous.

* We just do not know what to do and the **British** have left us with the problem.

* Why did it not emerge in 1967 and 1968 if the Government had a clearance agreement with the **British**?

* When a journalist does his duty in the interests of the Parliament - 
I feel that the Deputy Prime Minister's statement is one which has been designed for political rhetoric, for local consumption, and in fact that virtually was the comment made by one of the **British** newspapers.

* The reaction of the **British** Government to the Press statement made by the  Deputy  Prime Minister was, to say the least, rather coot.

* The spokesmen for the **British** Government regarded it rather as a prophesy of doom, one might say, and a mild criticism of Britain itself.

* Briefly, on balance, it would seem that we could actually gain in this respect despite the fact that we might have to pay more for **British** products because I should think that the Australian Government would alter the tariff preferences for Britain.

* We can also expect a greater interest from the' Common Market countries when the **British** preferences go.

* **British** migrants 
Notification - See Section 11a of the Act.

* The effect of this is that a **British** subject who was lawfully admitted to Australia as a migrant and has lived here for over 5 years, without becoming liable to deportation by misconduct, has the right to lodge with the Department a simple notice of desire to become a citizen; and he then becomes an Australian citizen without further action on his part.

* The effect of this is that after living in Australia for one year a **British** migrant may apply for a certificate of Australian citizenship; and if he satisfies the Minister that he can meet the requirements of Section 12, as to character, knowledge of English, etc, the Minister may grant a certificate of citizenship to him.

* As a matter of Government policy, the residence requirement is5 years for non-European people (**British** subjects or others) admitted to Australia on the basis of their qualifications under the Government's decision announced in this House on 9th March 1966.

* American foreign policy has always been informed by a tremendous morality, for good or ill- I believe during the early part of the 1950s for ill- but at least the difference between the morality that the Americans espoused and that pursued by conservatives in what used to be the **British** Empire was based upon a principle albeit somewhat perverse.

* Only the other day in this House the  Deputy  Prime Minister, when referring to trade, criticised the Government of Britain, He said in effect 'You know, the **British** let us down.

* I emphasise rapid in view of the recent years of indecision within the industry about the need to adjust to the real market situation following final exclusion from the **British** market, the threat to domestic orderly marketing following the Labor Government's abolition of the bounty and the reliance on a voluntary equalisation scheme without a bounty incentive.

* There is also the changing dairy products consumption pattern domestically with the removal of margarine quotas, once again by the Labor Government, and internationally with the loss of the **British** bulk butter and cheese markets.

* and (g) Group Captains Milton Coffee and Alan Hodges and Wing Commander Roy Roberts seek or receive Air Board approval to accept appointments with (i) Philips Industries Holdings Ltd, (ii) Rolls Royce Australia Ltd, (iii) Northrop Corporation, (iv) Grumman Aerospace Corporation, (v) Westinghouse, (vi) **British** Aircraft Corporation, and (vii) OFEMA respectively.

* I have been informed that the Australian High Commissioner has recently had discussions with both the **British** Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary.

* The High Commissioner reports that the **British** authorities are actively considering what action can be taken.

* This idea flows from the creation in the **British** Parliament of a situation in which committees have very extensive statutory powers.

* It is not possible to calculate the precise number of **British** citizens who have arrived in Australia since the introduction of the APEF fares.

* However, it is estimated that approximately 8000 **British** citizens have arrived in Australia during the months of April and May.

* Recently most honourable members received a document called the 'Backgrounder' which is published by the information service of the **British** High Commission.

* I notice that the **British** paper is a little more conservative than that.

* The **British** paper suggests that teaching in the imperial system is expected to continue for some time as a working knowledge of these units in everyday life will be needed over some years.

* Those forces were under **British** command and eventually, in 1944, he landed back in France with the invasion forces.

* He was offered a commission with the **British** army but, of course, the war ended and he was finally demobbed.

* In 1943 he married a young lady of **British** nationality and lived in Scotland.

* As soon as possible he took **British** citizenship.

* In 1962 he migrated to 
The latest correspondence that I have from the Department of Veterans' Affairs says that Division 5A of the Repatriation Act provides for the grant of service pensions to former members of the forces of Commonwealth countries in the same way as it does to Australian veterans; that veterans of Commonwealth forces, to be eligible for service pension, must have lived in Australia continuously at some time for not less than 10 years and must have had theatre-of-war service in a campaign in which Australian veterans were also engaged and in respect of which Australian veterans qualify for service pensions; that veterans of the Free Polish forces, even though those forces were under **British** command, are not veterans of the **British** forces; therefore, they do not qualify for benefits under Division 5A of the Repatriation Act.

* He is, of course, able to claim an age pension but apparently a man who has served under **British** command, who was with the invasion forces, who received recognition through a particular award, who came back and immediately took out **British** citizenship, who was married to a **British** citizen and then migrated to Australia in 1962, is not entitled, under this particular section of the Repatriation Act, to any benefits whatsoever.

* Those people, who played their part side by side in many cases with Australian troops, do not qualify, even though they were under **British** command, for the full **British** service entitlements, and now they find themselves in a rather difficult position.

* The Committee considered whether the **British** provision could be implemented; that is, that in respect of shareholdings in companies in which the member is a shareholder and in respect of which the member could have knowledge of the interests of his spouse the interests of the spouse should be declared.

* It has been assessed by many in the industry who are charged with selling that there are greater problems for the canning fruits industry than those created by the **British** entry into Europe.

* The Leeton Co-operative Cannery has seen that the problems which it faces - these are the problems that all the canneries in Australia face - are greater than those of the **British** entry into Europe.

* the questions yet unanswered were: Would there be a transitional period for canned fruits, would the external tariff bc reduced after Britain's entry and how long would it take for **British** wages to rise to compensate for higher food hills.

* In other words, he was saying: What has our Government done about the renegotiation of **British** tariffs and **British** preferences to enable us to trade and to help this industry, which was fostered by Government, to remain viable.

* The **British** Government some years ago established a Post Office trust fund on similar lines to what was done by the Postmaster-General recently, but it was found that that did not solve the problem.

* The Government went further and gave the **British** Post Office the power to raise loans.

* The **British** experience showed that this did not solve the problem and legislation was then passed to establish a public corporation.

* A **British** Columbia paper says with regard to pollution: 
What Wilson has done to the **British** economy took talent.

* They make no reference to the decisions of the High Court and they applied some ancient **British** law which deemed this act to be theft on the high seas.

* The point I want to make is this - 
In that case the **British** cannot bring their system into operation as the Minister has said they intend to do.

* The right honourable gentleman says at page 4 of his statement: 
The **British** Government will introduce the new measures when its discussions with overseas suppliers have been completed.

* So, the **British** Government is to break the trade agreement with Australia if what the right honourable gentleman says is true, Slid  noi  a word of protest is heard about ft. What is the use of a trade agreement with a country like Great Britain that is supposed to have been so favourable to Australia if that country is to be allowed to get away with breaking that trade agreement without one word of protest by the responsible Australian Minister.

* That is, **British** arrangements:  .

* The **British** have given us Cocos Island and Christmas Island.

* The Australian Constitution acknowledges a person only as the subject of the Queen - a **British** subject.

* When Papuans were called **British** subjects it was not assumed that the **British** subjects of Papua had rights in Australia any more than the **British** subjects of India but we changed the terminology for the sake of international window dressing and we called them 'Australian citizens'.

* Buka and Bougainville are being pushed towards complete secession -which is what they would probably vote for, union of the **British** Solomons which might be an intelligent settlement, or federation.

* The **British** investigating committee came to the conclusion - I repeat that it reached its conclusion very reluctantly - that the laws against obscenity, while constituting a danger to the innocent private individual, provide no serious benefit to the public and that the relevant Acts should be repealed and should not be replaced.

* The main reasons which led this conservative committee to such radical conclusions - I emphasise that these are the reasons of the **British** committee and not my own reasons - are as follows: 
I must emphasise again that .what I am giving are the conclusions of the **British** committee and not my own.

* , 
I draw the attention of the House to this **British** report because I think it should not be ignored by the House.

* Although some of the committee's reasons have been challenged, I think that that **British** committee may well be right in its conclusions.

* The **British** Embassy was ransacked and damaged by fire.

* In London last month  Sir Edward  Ashmore, the **British** Navy's Commander-in-Chief and a senior commander in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said that the Russian naval build-up in the Indian Ocean was a most disturbing factor.

* Against that background of their statements, the Australian people will be able to judge  for  themselves the value of the remarks and  I  he policies of the Deputy Leader of the 
The decision by the **British** Parliament in favour of entry into the European Economic Community is a momentous one.

* Others will have preferred entry to the **British** market but we who have enjoyed trade preferences in Britain for many years will within 5 years have no preferred position in the **British** market.

* Thus with Britain set on the path to Europe, the time was obviously opportune for the Prime Minister to confer with the **British** Prime Minister, not only about our market interests but also on the wider international implications which spread beyond commercial relationships.

* For its part, the **British** Government has assured the Prime Minister that it will watch our interests, industry by industry, in the transitional period of Britain's entry to the European Economic Community.

* Will the fare be restricted to travel on Qantas Airways Ltd and **British** Airways only?

* Do the Army and some categories of the Air Force accept that being a **British** subject is sufficient to meet citizenship requirements for officer entry.

* Does the 10 year rule discriminate against lads of impeccable **British** origin who have migrated to Australia less than 10 years before applying for officer entry.

* The famous **British** economic journal, The Economist', in its latest edition referred to the unilateral revaluation as 'largely a political gambit'.

* Last week in this very chamber the **British** Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was held.

* The lesson I learned from attending the **British** Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference was this - and I say it with deep regret: There ate some nations that will see only what they want to see in international affairs.

* I draw to the attention of the House, and in particular to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition, the achievements of the **British** Prices and Income Board in the prices field.

* In the prices field the **British** authority has achieved much, although in the incomes field it has achieved very little.

* All the experience, including that of the **British** Prices and Incomes Board, is that if we put the lid on the pressure cooker in an area such as this it may have a temporary effect; but as soon as the lid is blown off, as it will be when there is injustice in the form of low wages, we will have the same rise in prices over a length of time as we would have had if no lid had been put no.

* The present **British** Government is a socialist government.

* The article detailed agreement reached between the **British** Government and the Trades Union Congress for an increase in average wages and salaries of about 4.5 per cent for 12 months.

* A news release which we received from the **British** High Commission stated: 
Evidence of the continuing recovery in **British** manufacturing industry is provided by the latest monthly survey of industrial trends by the Confederation of **British** Industry.

* Germany has agreed to treat **British** and other prisoners of war as victims of war crimes because they were not prisoners of war.

* I am now talking about the **British** ex-servicemen who were in the concentration camps.

* The negotiations with the **British** Government in respect of cheaper air fares in and out of this country have been proceeding very satisfactorily.

* The **British** team returned to the United Kingdom about a week ago to report to the Government there.

* I point out to the House that on a previous occasion when there was an opportunity for KLM to pick up a cheaper air fare which **British** Airways and Qantas had negotiated and agreed to, KLM showed no interest in that particular air fare.

* This conjures up a picture of tens of thousands of **British** migrants seriously disaffected because they do not have the privilege of being naturalised at a naturalisation ceremony and, instead, are seriously discriminated against by being able to acquire citizenship by registration.

* It conjures up a picture of thousands of would-be **British** migrants deterred from coming to Australia because they will face this fearful discrimination.

* Mesmerised by the Minister's words, people are not aware that his actions have seriously reduced the supply of good quality **British** migrants of European origin, that the composition of our immigration program has changed rapidly so that there no longer is a predominance of people from western Europe, Britain and North America of European descent arriving in Australia under the program; that the proportion of people with skills and professional qualifications has fallen and given way to people who have no other qualification than a relative in Australia who is prepared to sponsor them.

* The Government, by proposing to alter the traditional system whereby **British** subjects of European origin are required to be in Australia for only one year before naturalisation, has adopted, whether deliberately or not, a stance Which will be widely interpreted as being unfriendly to **British** migration and as a deterrent in some cases to **British** migration.

* In the United Kingdom to Australia trade, for example, a monthly review of this adjustment factor has been mads since late 1972 by the **British** Shippers' Council and the Conference.

* What sparked the raising of the present matter of public importance by the Opposition was the decision of the Government to cancel the order which it placed with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the **British** Aircraft Corporation to design an advanced trainer-ground attack aircraft to the requirements of the Royal Australian Air Force.

* So this Australian organisation which has been in existence for some 35 years went to work on it as a joint defence project with the **British** Aircraft Corporation.

* This was an excellent opportunity for the Government to develop an aircraft and use the knowledge and know-bow of one of the largest aircraft manufacturers in the world today, the **British** Aircraft Corporation.

* The **British** Government weakened its stand on what it thought was an appropriate Supply of Goods Act and eventually amended its legislation in 1973 to exclude liability in these cases.

* The **British** legislation set out the reasons for exclusion.

* What has happened is that, because an international combine has asked the Government to use the **British** Act as a model to protect it, the **British** Act is becoming the Australian law.

* It said that it was going to have its way and that the legislation should be framed in the way the **British** had framed their legislation.

* The **British** ran away from taking appropriate legislative action.

* The Australian Government has succumbed to international pressure to do just what the **British** have done.

* This would have enabled us at least to start to move towards the **British** example where this aspect of industry is regarded with such importance that the United Kingdom Government has renamed its department the Department of Employment and Productivity.

* Julius Nyerere, Milton Obote, Hastings Banda, Kwame Nkrumah and Jomo Kenyatta were all ostensibly, in the mind of the **British**, given an education in the Westminster system.

* The Administrator and the Governors in the past, choosing their advisers, corresponded very much more closely to an American  president  choosing his cabinet from outside Parliament or Congress than they ever did to a **British** Prime Minister with a parliamentary Cabinet within the Westminster system.

* There the people have gone back much more closely to an approximation of a 19th century governor than to a **British** Prime Minister.

* All I want to say as a warning is that the **British** did this in Nigeria.

* So long as the **British** wanted to rule Nigeria, they fanned the divisions and we have all seen the consequences.

* Clearly, therefore, **British** influence in the South Pacific is going to be very minimal within the next 2 years.

* It is equally certain that as **British** influence is withdrawn the peoples of these islands are going to look elsewhere both for economic and strategic security.

* By refusing the offer at that time we hoped to encourage the **British** to stay in this area for a longer period.

* One result of the departure of the **British** from this part of the world should be to make us realise our greater degree of defence nakedness, and should help to draw the two Anzac nations closer together.

* The first federation in the West Indies was imposed by the **British** Government when it handed over control.

* As I recall, the Banabans were unsuccessful in the royalty case against the **British** Crown but were rewarded unspecified damages in the replanting case against the **British** Phosphate Commission.

* I would need to add, in answer to a question such as this, that the judge criticised the **British** Government for the manner in which it negotiated royalty payments with the Banabans.

* The **British** Government has now stated that its main concern is to reach a settlement that is fanto all concerned, including the Banabans and the Gilbertese.

* A **British** Government special emissary,  Mr Richard  Posnett has been visiting the South Pacific to explore means of achieving such a settlement and to put forward recommendations.

* He told me that his main task at this stage is to gather information on which he could base recommendations to the **British** Government.

* At the same time Australian officials are giving attention, and urgent attention as I have requested it, to any **British** proposals made to us.

* Subsequent events, including the withdrawal of **British** Leyland, proved the report to be absolutely correct.

* My difficulty in the present case is that I have discussed with the **British** Government the amendment I outlined to the House last week.

* I have not discussed with the **British** Government the amendment which he suggests.

* I repeat that it is an approach which does appeal to me and at the first opportunity that 1 have to discuss such matters again with the **British** Government in the way in which I discussed the one that I outlined last week I will raise this matter as well.

* The calculations of the Department of Trade and Industry from sterling to Australian currency of the amount of the levy - in this case it is a straight out duty - which the **British** Government has announced it proposes to impose on Australian mutton and lamb is, I am advised, fractionally more than 3c Australia a lb.

* had heard of these proposals late on Monday, when they were given to me on a confidential basis by the office of the **British** High Commission here and, having been given them on a confidential basis, I could not reveal them.

* When the **British** High Commission furnished me with the text of the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I then, at the very first opportunity, came into the House and stated the attitude of the 
**British** Government on this matter.

* The honourable member for Cook particularly spoke of the **British** insurance industry.

* Figures from a **British** builder show rises from 20 in 1969 to an anticipated 45 in 1971.

* The second relates to the disadvantages to and the downgrading of people of **British** descent contained in the various clauses and sub-clauses.

* The history of **British** civilisation is a proud one.

* The traditions of our basic **British** ancestry imply standards, ideals to be realised, and a continuity of social, religious, civic and intellectual atmospheres.

* Based as we are on a predominantly **British** heritage it is reasonable to expect and to ask that other ethnic groups have to fulfil a longer term of residence to absorb our ethos, to grow accustomed to our customs and to do things in the Australian way while enriching our lives with their own culture.

* In his second reading speech the Minister made the following remarks: 
It is our opinion that whilst we agree with the intended legislation to make citizenship available in 3 years on certain conditions, we submit it is reasonable for **British** descendants to require a shorter period of residence before applying for citizenship.

* I think we may be able to take a lead from the terms of reference of the new Expenditure Committee of the **British** House of Commons - suitably adopted for our Public 
Is it a fact that naturalised Australian citizens require a visa to enter New Zealand whilst **British** born Australians do not.

* Arrangements also have been prepared for the situation arising from the elimination of **British** preferential tariffs.

* Mr Freer and I also reached agreement that specific measures should be taken to take account of the new situation arising between our 2 countries with the elimination of **British** preferential tariffs.

* **British** Preferential Tariff treatment between Australia and New Zealand derives, on a non-contractual basis, from the trade agreements each country had with Britain and, although applying to items of trade not yet covered by Schedule A, is an essential element of the NAFTA relationship.

* With the dismantling of the **British** Preferential Tariffs by both countries which eventually will come, and New Zealand has been more specific about this than has Australia so far, it has therefore been necessary to reach agreement on the extent to which preferences accorded by each country to the other could, and should, be retained in the circumstances of the 2 economies and in terms of the concept of a developing free trade area.

* Both Australia and New Zealand are restructuring their tariffs in a climate where **British** preferences will be disappearing and, in the case of New Zealand, practical reasons made it necessary to finalise important aspects of its proposed new tariff at an early date.

* is quite obnoxious and contrary to **British** justice.

* Will he consider setting statutory criteria comparable, to those of' the-' **British** Pharmacopoeia to define the relative effectiveness of various preparations and the factors .involved in producing such effectiveness 
How many more deaths must there be before the Australian Government feels compelled to use its good offices with the Governments of both the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland to promote, on behalf of the friends of both countries,  a  representative constitutional convention charged with the task of formulating a political settlement.

* The horrific massacre at Derry made only too clear that **British** policy in Ulster is in shambles.

* The **British** Army has not preserved law and order; it is not preventing civil war.

* To the majority of people in Ulster and Eire the **British** Army has become a tool for the unjust status quo in Ulster.

* Only by tying the continued **British** presence to a programme of political and social reform in Ulster will Britain make a contribution to peace.

* This is the only way it will show that it is no longer propping up the **British** settlement of Ireland as finalised in 1922, with all its calamitous aftermath.

* Friends of Britain and Ireland must remind the **British** Government that this is no longer a matter for Britain alone.

* The speeches in the United Nations and the sacking of the **British** Embassy in Dublin have put an end to that notion forever.

* **British** policy is bankrupt and the **British** Government must heed the advice of its friends.

* There are 15,000 **British** troops in Ulster organised into regiments bearing the names of those in Ireland in 1916.

* I again ask the Parliament and the Government to exert every influence on the **British** Government to bring communal peace to one of the world's most tormented lands.

* A former **British** Home Secretary said: 
Before I leave the subject of murder, there are 3 other matters I should like to refer to.

* Such proposals date as far back as the **British** royal commission of 1864, and have often been very attractive to penal reformers.

* The **British** Homicide Act of 1957 tried to, and by the time it had run its 8 years of life, it had come to be regarded by almost everyone concerned with its administration as raising far more problems than it solved.

* These stem from Acts of the **British** Parliament which have been adopted under our various service defence Acts.

* There was tremendous pressure from the **British** Government and from the **British** Army in the First World War to make Australian soldiers subject to the death penalty, which in the **British** and French armies was the recognised preventive of desertion and mutiny and, in extreme cases, insubordination.

* During World War I, 335 **British** troops were sentenced to death.

* Quite frankly, I do not believe that at the present moment Uganda is worthy to be a member of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations, nor should its demented leader,  President  Idi Amin, be permitted to attend the conference of the heads of government of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations due to be held in London later this year.

* I feel that there is a very strong case for Uganda to be suspended from the **British** Commonwealth of Nations because I find it impossible to reconcile in my mind that we, in passing the motion we did earlier, intended to convey to the world that Uganda had the same common heritage that we have, that it represents an institution through which the Commonwealth is a unique forum of discussion and exchange of ideas.

* There will be a dreadful stench over the **British** Commonwealth if this madman, this maniac, is permitted to attend the conference in London.

* He will convey them in the appropriate manner to the Envoy of the **British** Prime Minister.

* Putting it on an equivalent **British** thermal unit basis, it is obvious that every other energy resource had to increase in price.

* I ask the Minister: Whom does he consider the more reliable authority - a **British** Tory Defence Minister or a commercial organ whose objective is to promote sales of warships?

* The other thing to which I draw the attention of the House is that there was a very important report tabled in the **British** Parliament in the latter part of 1977.

* For example, in Japan **British** passport holders have one or two advantages over Australian passport holders.

* I think this is probably due to the earlier initiatives of the **British** Government.

* I hope that the new Australian Government will be able to ensure that we have an equal opportunity with **British** passport holders to come and go in Japan.

* As  Dr Salkind,  former Secretary of the **British** General Practitioners Association, has stated: 'We must have national health.

* In interpreting statements made from time to time in this House by the Minister for Health in reply to questions, it would seem that either the Australian system is twice as deficient as the **British** system or that it is only half as satisfactory as the **British** system.

* But in any case, on the basis of the Minister's claims and the gallup poll findings, it is quite apparent that if the Minister is consistent he will admit that the Australian scheme is twice as bad as the **British** scheme.

* I want to make it quite clear at this point that the **British** scheme is not related to the Australian Labor Party's scheme, contrary to the windmil'l which the Minister for Health likes to joust out from time to time.

* The **British** scheme is based on a system of poll tax; regardless of income level, one pays a fixed amount.

* Again, the Labor Party's scheme is based on a concept of fee for service from general practitioners in private practice; the **British** scheme is based on a per capita remuneration.

* There was a discussion among a number of interested people, this time involving a number of members of the **British** colonial service, which was reported back to the Austraiian Government.

* 1 ) and (2) The implementation of the proposed new fare structure for travel between Australia and the United Kingdom will provide a broad range of air fare choices for the travelling public Passengers wishing to avail themselves of point-to-point travel will be able to accommodate their re- quirements on the services of Qantas or **British** Airways.

* I agree with my good friend from Franklin  (Mr Sherry)  that there are difficulties confronting the member of the Australian Parliament.I agree with him entirely that the **British** concept of the gentleman versus the players has no place in the sophisticated modern society of 1970.

* These developments include increased competition in this field from European fruit and the increasing competition from other exporting countries supplying the **British** and European markets.

* It is worth keeping in mind the fact that the **British** have their Westminster Abbey, the French their Pantheon, and the Americans their Arlington.

* **British** import statistics were examined to determine the value of **British** imports of Australian goods which received no margin of preference in 1970.

* Comparable **British** import data on a tariff item basis were not published for the other years requested.

* This table does not include, however, any goods which might not have received the preferential treatment provided in the **British** Tariff.

* All goods which qualify as **British** produce enter Australia at preferential rates of duty.

* Table 2 below shows Australian import clearances of goods of **British** origin which received no margin of preference in 1965-66 and 1969-70.

* Has the Minister for Northern Development read the Press reports on important sugar conferences being held in London between the **British** Government and the governments of Commonwealth sugar producing countries?

* I have seen the **British** public go for South African Granny Smiths almost to the exclusion of others on the market at a particular time.

* It was feared even then - that was 7 years or 8 years ago - that it might well advance into the Australian sector of the **British** market, which is still our major one, and cut us out in this regard.

* May I suggest that if we move a trade commissioner from London to Singapore the profitability of the market of 2 million people in Singapore will not supplant the **British** market or the European market generally.

* The future of **British** preferences in Australia will be determined at the time by the Australian Government.

* Against this background the answers to the questions are: 
Of course, there must be proper Executive power to any Government, but our **British**, our English idea, in a special sense, has always been a system of balanced rights and divided authority, with many other persons and organised bodies having to be considered besides the Government of the day and the officials they employ .

* As an indication of the confusion, I should like to mention that in an Indonesian school textbook I saw on one occasion it listed the basic structure of the Australian Government as comprising firstly, the **British** High Commissioner, secondly the Governor-General and thirdly the Prime Minister.

* It is an incident in which a distinguished **British** scientist who had secured an Australian appointment called at Australia House to find out something about the town and the area in which he would be working in Australia.

* The Australians have proposed to the ASEAN countries, in order to make sure that there is some control over this matter, that any tickets written to the United Kingdom and to the other European carriers will be on Qantas and **British** Airways paper.

* It is important to note that the telegram implies that the **British** were likely to impose a ban on the meat, too.

* We asked him, as we asked the Minister, whether there was any chance of interceding with the **British** Authorities to try to get the **British** blanket ban taken off, too.

* So we went across to the **British** High Commission yesterday, and what did we find?

* We were told that the **British** authorities will take our meat if it is passed by our inspectors.

* I want to know why this  Mr Potts  did not tell us that; I want to know why the Minister did not tell me this when he sent a telegram down to my Burnie office yesterday; I also want to know why  Senator Lillico  and I were hoodwinked in the Minister's office some months ago when we were told that the **British** had the same standards as the Americans, when the **British** High Commission told us yesterday that they will take this meat if it is passed by our inspectors.

* It has an obligation now to say to the **British** authorities: 'AH right.

* This provision has been taken from old imperial Acts drafted at a time when there was a common citizenship throughout the **British** Empire.

* Members of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations generally hold **British** citizenship.

* Pakistan has withdrawn, but all the Pakistani citizens by a law established in London, not Canberra, are still **British** citizens because before their status can be changed the Citizenship Act of Britain must be changed.

* A man can be recruited from Pakistan as a **British** subject, just so long as he is described as a **British** subject, not by our legislation but by another nation's legislation.

* I suggest that the Minister, who prides himself on his erudition, apply himself ' to that legal tangle so that when we recruit **British** subjects from Pakistan we ask whether they are **British** subjects by virtue of the law of the Commonwealth of Australia or by virtue of the law of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, or just how they measure up in the present situation.

* If it is not recognised as such, I suggest there should be consultation with members of the former imperial government, I am sure that they will be delighted to explain to the honourable member for Mcpherson, who seems a little confused, that the **British** Empire has passed away.

* The role of committees is still not clear - whether they are to be miniature chambers like the **British** standing committees, impartial critics like the **British** select committees or powerful influences on the legislative process like American congressional committees.

* Basically, the department has been defeated 3 times: By the **British** Insurance Association, by the 1967 Companies Act, and by its own senior civil servants.

* The civil servants wanted spcial companies to be set up to handle all **British** consumer insurance.

* What does the word 'vicinity ' mean when we appreciate that the Reef stretches 100 miles from the shore and is not continuous and that other areas are the subject of exploration- I emphasise exploration, not exploitation- in the same way as the oil fields offshore from Great Britain have been explored and are now being exploited to the benefit of the **British** economy.

* But it is to be found in the practice of **British** parliaments.

* A **British** subject - in the classical definition anyhow - is a person who owes allegiance to the monarch because he was born in the monarch's dominions.

* A Papuan is a **British** subject; a New Guinean is not.

* A Papuan is both a **British** subject and an Australian citizen.

* There are many other coloured people who are **British** subjects.

* In point of fact in days of the Empire every person born in India was a **British** subject and a subject of the Emperor.

* The Opposition feels that to say, as the honourable member for Mallee has said, that the only way to ensure that we do not get undesirable teachers is to use the terminology '**British** subject' is to use a very imprecise instrument because, after all, the man who sold all of Britain's submarine secrets was a **British** subject.

* But if the Government is going to persevere with this proviso it will mean that only if a person is not a **British** subject is it a matter on which the Minister is better qualified than the Commissioner.

* The Commissioner is better qualified than the Minister if the person is a **British** subject, but in some mystic way the Commissioner must be left free if the person is not a **British** subject because, according to the honourable member for Mallee, the Commissioner is likely to appoint undesirables.

* The Secretary of the **British** Abortion Law Reform Association, Madeleine Sims, and a co-author Keith Hindell, state in their book, 'Abortion Law Reformed', at p. 243: 
A letter was received from the **British** High Commission which I read to the House in answer to a question yesterday.

* The **British** High Commission again confirmed that the draft impact statement with some minor editorial changes will be the final environmental impact statement on the question of Concorde visits to Australia.

* The impact statement has been available since December and the **British** have said that there are no changes to it apart from minor editorial changes, and an addendum carrying the submissions and their comment on them.

* If account is taken of the environmental issues and the decision can be made that it can come here on its trial run, the sooner we can let the **British** know about it the better.

* The **British** have a lot of work to do to clear the way for Concorde to come to Australia.

* There has to be an agreement between the **British** Government and the Singapore Government, maybe with the Indian Government and perhaps with a number of other governments.

* It seemed to me that as nothing in environmental terms stood in the way it was proper that the **British** be advised as soon as possible of our decision to allow Concorde to come to Australia.

* Before I answer my own rhetorical question, I want to draw the attention of the House to an extremely important essay by  Sir Ieuan  Maddock, CB., O.B.E., D.Sc, F.R.S., who was the chief scientist of the Department of Industry and who is now the Secretary of the **British** Association for the Advancement of Science, which appeared in the  New Scientist  on 23 November 1978.

* He has mounted, for the first time in the United Kingdom, casks as a means of selling wines to **British** people.

* **British** Instantaneous Coupling (BIC) 
Has his attention been drawn to the option expressed by a senior member of the New South Wales Antique Dealers Association and quoted in a report by  Mr Ingram  in the  Financial Review  of 17 November 1978, that, on the basis of the **British** experience with a value-added tax, two levels of dealing would begin to operate, with a lower cash price and a higher, invoiced price, therefore introducing the possibility of dealers evading the tax.

* He is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley and of Oxford University, is a barrister, Foreign Minister of Pakistan from 1963 to 1966, founder of the Pakistan People's Party and a democratic socialist who said that his policies were 'along the lines of the **British** Labour Party and Willy Brandt'.

* The legislation seeks to remove the position of preferment which **British** migrants have enjoyed since the inception of Australia's immigration program.

* It is a particular disincentive to **British** migration, which is already suffering a marked reduction as reflected in the number of inquiries received.

* On the one hand, the Government alleges a desire to remove discrimination in various pieces of legislation, particularly the immigration program; on the other hand, it continues legislation, particularly in the immigration area, which in fact perpetuates a number of those provisions which the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  could well have removed if he was prepared to take upon himself the burden of undoing any sense of preferment "which is currently enjoyed by **British** citizens.

* The Minister might well reflect on the terms of preferment for **British** people.

* He might also reflect on a reference by inference in his second reading speech, as I recall it, to the question of the voting preference which is extended to **British** subjects at a much earlier period than it is to those people who come from other countries.

* Yet it ought not to be forgotten that our early arrivals, with relatively limited exceptions, came almost solely - willingly or unwillingly - from the **British** Isles.

* In the years since, even as the base of our immigration program has broadened as never before, **British** migrants have continued to be the cornerstone, the very real base, of immigration to this country.

* Statistically, people of **British** extraction make up easily the largest single national group to settle in Australia.

* In the 5-year period between 1967-68 and 1971-72, for example, there were 332,987 **British** migrants in the total of 801,011 people who came to make their homes in Australia.

* **British** applications for migration to Australia are lodged at Australia House, London.

* Officials of Australia House say there has been a significant decline in interest among **British** people contemplating coming to this country to make their homes.

* 1 ) Is there an understanding with the **British** and United States Governments that their Forces will be able to use the naval facilities to be established at Cockburn Sound.

* ls he satisfied with the present stopgap procedure outlined in the Constitution under which this House acts on the rules of privilege of the House of Commons of the nineteenth century but actually dating in precedent back to the Middle Ages, a procedure in which the accused person has none of the rights of an accused person in any court of justice anywhere in the **British** Commonwealth?

* **British** Leaders of the Opposition have been to Moscow, but they have always supported the position of the United Kingdom Government.

* I refer to the report of the Houghton Committee to the **British** Parliament.

* The Confederation of **British** Industry came down reluctantly in favour of a limited form of state aid.

* The **British** United Industrialists came down in favour of the present system of private donations.

* A survey, commissioned by the Houghton Committee, of the **British** public without any canvassing at all showed that 45 per cent of those interviewed were opposed to state aid for political parties and that 44 per cent were in favour of it.

* He points out that **British** new towns are now being designed for populations of 250,000', but that 'even this latter figure, unfortunately, must be regarded as a minimum'.

* Members of the Opposition have praised the **British** for making their Post Office a statutory corporation.

* Federalism compounds the problem because a change in zones can mean the change from Commonwealth to State control and vice versa, and around the coast near State borders there is also the problem of change from State law to State law, and indeed **British** law.

* Since internal waters were treated as part of England by both the common law and **British** executive practice - although to different extents - before the establishment of the Australian colonies, it must be presumed that such waters become part of the colonies.

* Despite all this, it can be argued that **British** practice at this time was to enclose indentations with very extensive closing lines, up to 65 miles long as in the case of Shark Bay in Western Australia, across the headlands of the indentation, if there were adequate penetration into the coast.

* If this can be established to be the case, the Commonwealth might be foolish to abandon enclosure of such extensive waters, because under the Geneva Convention, we would not be permitted to firstly enclose as many 'bays' because the 19th century **British** legal definitions of a bay would not appear to have been as demanding as the semi-circle formulation in the Convention; and secondly, to enclose bays up to such widths, because the maximum closing line permitted by the Convention is only 24 miles.

* So, down to the present day we have the position that at least some of the rules relating to maritime matters in Australia have continued to be controlled by the **British** Merchant Shipping Acts which cannot be amended or repealed by our State Parliaments in many cases without the approval of the **British** Parliament.

* The Department of Health quoted the **British** experience which suggests a correlation between patient contribution and prescription volume.

* The relevance of the **British** experience to Australian conditions is suggested by the initial reaction to the increase in the local patient contribution from SO cents to $1.00 in November 1971.

* The situation in Fiji was threatened by the resolve, of locals to close Nadi airport to Qantas and to give its competitors, the **British** Overseas Aircraft Corporation and American Airlines Incorporated, free access to the airport.

* During the course of his speech the honourable member referred to the **British** people in a somewhat similar vein to that in which another member of the Australian Country Party referred to the people of the United Kingdom during the course of  an  earlier speech.

* He said that the **British** people had changed their character and that there was something wrong with them.

* He went on to say that the people of Great Britain had more or less gone around the whole world appealing to the lower elements of the world to support the **British** Labour Party's policy towards Rhodesia.

* These reports show quite clearly that, if there was any liar or scoundrel insofar as the negotiations were concerned, it was Smith, who had gone so far as to advise the then Prime Minister of Australia,  Sir Robert  Menzies, that he had not and could not meet the **British** Prime Minister over the matter of Rhodesia and independence when he had in fact done so.

* I also want to make some reference to the fact that, during the course of his speech, the honourable member for Lyne described Ramsay MacDonald as being the great **British** boneless wonder.

* It seems to me that during the course of the last 2 weeks the Country Party - at least 2 of its most senior members, at any rate - has taken it upon itself to attack the **British** people.

* The honourable member for Lyne went on to say, during the' course of his attack on the **British** people, that he had done a short turn in Rhodesia in an air training corps and it was a wonderful place.

* I think it may have a lot to do with Australia's **British** ancestry.

* he is a **British** subject; 
If honourable members had attended the Heads of Government Conference last year in Jamaica, they would have heard  President  Nyerere of Tanzania and  President  Kaunda of Zambia threaten that there would have to be war with Rhodesia within a matter of weeks because of the injustices done to their brothers in Africa.

* They told the **British** Prime Minister,  Mr Wilson,  that they had discussed this matter for years with leaders like  Mr MacMillan  and  Sir Robert  Menzies but that nothing had ever happened except the passing of pious resolutions.

* They said that they were sick and tired of passing resolutions and that unless the **British** controlled the Rhodesian situation they would do it with guns.

* I suggest that the attitude being put forward in this matter by the Liberal Party is the same as that which was put forward in the **British** Parliament at that time, namely, that people can be governed by a parliament in which they have no say whatever and which can make laws on their behalf but they are not entitled to be represented as citizens of that country.

* There are 36 companies owned by American interests, 30 by **British** interests, 3 1 by European multinationals and only 52 Australian manufacturers are in the trade.

* When the drug thalidomide was produced by a West German manufacturer it was decided to hand over the distribution of the drug to a **British** international whisky combine, Distillers Corporation.

* The firm was investigated by the **British** Monopolies Commission which reported to the Government that the firm was making excessive profits on its products.

* The **British** Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs decided to take action on the report and ordered the firm to reduce the price of librium by 40 per cent and the price of valium by 25 per cent.

* The Australian Minister for Health, that distinguished Minister  Dr Everingham,  has reported to this Parliament that the firm is charging the Australian Government twice the price for these products that it charges the **British** National Health Scheme.

* A leading **British** multinational heavily involved in pharmaceutical, industrial and agricultural chemicals is the firm of Fisons Ltd. Its chairman of directors, Lord Netherthorpe, recently made a world tour to inspect his satellites.

* I now come to the story of the takeover of Drug Houses of Australia by the **British** conglomerate of Slater Walker.

* The **British** conglomerate also suffered from the liquidity crisis and had to realise on its properties around the world.

* We all know that in **British** parliaments the tradition is that if a money Bill is defeated, as the receipts duties legislation was defeated last June, the government goes to the people to seek their endorsement of its policies.

* The kind of information we get indirectly from bodies such as the American Department of Commerce and the body that used to be called the Board of Trade but which I think is now called the Department of Trade and Industry in Great Britain, seems to suggest that **British** investment in Australia, together with American and Canadian investment in Australia, could be as high as $15,00Om.

* To substantiate this criticism, I believe one needs only to look at the second reading speech of the then Secretary of State for the Home Department in the House of Commons when that gentleman introduced the **British** Race Relations Bill in 1968.

* It was 28 times greater than the total of fatalities among members of the **British** and Commonwealth Air Forces in the Second World War.

* Again I want to stress that the mortality was 3 times greater than the combined **British** and American dead in the Second World War or 28 times greater than those killed in the **British** and Commonwealth Air Forces.

* In the Northern Territory, as is common in most Australian States and in fact is common throughout all **British** speaking countries, policemen generally prosecute in courts of petty sessions or magistrates courts.

* In most **British** speaking countries, it is possible for an accused person, if he has pleaded guilty in a magistrates court, or lower court, to change his plea on appeal in a superior court.

* **British**, 
This is a very serious matter for an industry that produces a great deal of employment and provides a sound basis for towns and country cities and is a valuable export industry.

* Only the other day it became pretty obvious that we were not able to fulfil our obligations to the **British** market.

* We did not and could hot supply the **British** market to the full extent that was desired because we did not have the material.

* Does he realise that that action has been defended by every subsequent **British** Labour Prime Minister?

* I ask the Prime Minister: As a latter day supporter of the position of the House of Commons in financial matters, will he confer with the present **British** Prime Minister to see what the Westminster tradition requires and what it dictates in such circumstances?

* This was the experience many years ago of the **British** Conservative Party when they took office.

* It offers cheaper air fares which may or may not be at stated price levels, which may or may not be introduced at some unknown time next year and which only Qantas and **British** Airways will be allowed to operate.

* The **British** Parliament, from which the State parliaments derive, has no constitutional limitation on the term for which it can last.

* There have been many cases in which the **British** Parliament has passed a law extending its own term of office, the most recent being the parliament which was elected in 1935 for 5 years and which was extended until 1945.

* The Senate operates under a Constitution, a **British** Act of Parliament, which does not give the Senate the express power to reject money Bills.

* It would be dishonest or inaccurate to make a naked comparison between the Australian Medibank scheme and the **British** health scheme because they are not similar.

* I would not mind seeing the Corporation get a slice of the $26.5m marine insurance cake when we consider that most of the companies operating in marine insurance in Australia are **British** or companies from other overseas countries.

* As I think he probably realises, at the moment the Bill mentions only **British** vessels.

* For example, the salaries in the Parliamentary Counsel's Office in the United Kingdom are above those of corresponding levels in the general legal service of the United Kingdom Government and are among the highest in the **British** Civil Service: the First Parliamentary Counsel is treated in the United Kingdom as the head of a government department.

* I recall a speech made by Lord Morrison, a distinguished former Minister of the **British** Labour Party, who said that if the Labour Party allowed the Communists to join its ranks, did not oppose them and instead collaborated with them and if members of the Labour Party in the United Kingdom were associated with and supported the Communist Party that would be the day when democracy would finish because from there on there would be a forum in Parliament for the views of those who wished to end the Parliament.

* The **British** Government actually asked the Australian Government to use its best endeavours to increase beef production to provide Britain with a ready supply of meat.

* At the recent Prime Ministers Conference the question of **British** supply of arms to South Africa was raised, and we there took the point of view that this was a matter for the **British** Government itself to decide.

* If one tries to see a pattern in the present Government's conduct of foreign policy, one is struck irresistibly by the marked similarity to the **British** Labor Party in the 1930s.

* There are strong similarities between the foreign policy style and attitudes of the Prime Minister and that of  Mr Ramsay  MacDonald, the **British** Prime Minister in the early 1930s - a man described as the boneless wonder by Winston Churchill.

* We have developed an anti-tank missile which the **British** Army adopted.

* We have had 10 years' notice by the **British** that they intended to try to effect entry into Europe.

* In the statement that we are debating this afternoon the Minister said: 
That means that by the time the **British** decision is implemented and they are in Europe and our trade with Britain is in limbo, we will not have an opportunity of debating in detail the technical information and the Government's recommendations, if any.

* We still have no idea whether the Government has woken up to the fact that the **British** Government and the Common Market countries have come to some sort of agreement.

* The **British** have already made and announced their decision.

* They have had debates in the **British** Parliament lasting days and, in fact, weeks.

* There is no doubt that they have been making statements which have expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the **British** Government to safeguard Australia's interests during the transitional period leading to Britain's entry into Europe.

* It does not give the assurances which the **British** Government said it would contain, and so there has been criticism.

* Apparently there has been criticism here in Canberra and elsewhere in Australia, but this is not the situation as the **British** see it.

* I have a letter over the signature of  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home, the **British** Foreign Secretary, addressed to a member of the **British** Parliament,  Mr Leslie  Huckfield, in which  Sir Alec  says: 
Australian Ministers, including  Mr McMahon  on his visit to London in November last year, have expressed their satisfaction at the steps taken in the EEC negotiations to safeguard Australia's interests over the transitional period.

* No Australian Minister has criticised the UK for joining Europe, and many Australians welcome the prospect of an influential **British** voice, which can.

* They will have left themselves open to the serious charge of duplicity unless they can rebut completely the statement made by the **British** Foreign Secretary.

* The **British** Foreign Secretary expressed his satisfaction with the present position of **British** trade with Australia.

* He said: 
The **British** Foreign Secretary continued: 
This is the most important definitive statement on Australian trade relations with Britain that I have heard in 2 years - in fact, that has been made in relation to this matter in 10 years - and it came from the **British** Foreign Secretary.

* As a matter of fact, I resent the fact that a **British** member of Parliament is able to get this information from his Foreign Secretary.

* In case there is some feeling that this is an abstract matter, I would point out that entire communities - there are a dozen towns involved - are relying on the Gov ernment to re-negotiate tariffs and preferences to ensure their continuation in production - production that was originally designed to serve the **British** market and which was designed within the Imperial fabric which will come to a complete end on 1st January 1973.

* The need for this review arose out of the dismantling of the **British** preferential tariff system by both countries.

* Yesterday the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said in this House, as he has said many times, that he believes in a 2-party system like the **British** system.

* The **British** certainly do not have party designations on their ballot papers.

* On 9 June this year I announced that a negotiating team would leave to hold discussion with **British** Government officials on ways and means of seeking cheap air fares on the Kangaroo route which is our most important international trunk route.

* Both we and the **British** Government recognise that arrangements between each other are interdependent on arrangements each of us has separately with other governments on the route.

* It is gratifying to note that **British** authorities found our proposals attractive in that they provided lower fares and met all consumer demands and maintained regular scheduled services.

* The **British** negotiations are going very well and I still hold confidently to my prediction that I will make an announcement before Christmas on future arrangements on this route.

* At that time they made their own commercial judgment and as a result the present lowest direct fare to London on Qantas Airways Ltd and **British** Airways is subsequently cheaper than present direct fares to other European destinations.

* In this context it is important to note that agreement has been reached more quickly with American authorities than with the **British** for a simple and obvious reason, that is, that the end to end services operate on a much less complex basis between the United States and Australia over an ocean.

* Both Bills seem to give expression to the same obsessions -to break down the long-established system of **British** common law, to lay down a means of prosecution that will ultimately destroy the professed objectives of the legislation and to use oppressive abuse of power against the fundamental rights of the individual.

* But can one control these human weaknessessuch as the desire of some humans to overpower others either materially, intellectually, commercially or spiritually because of the prejudice or passions of man- by an Act of Parliament which defies **British** common law and the civil law practice?

* As the honourable member for Wide Bay says, a lot of **British** migrants as well.

* 1 ) As pan of an agreement concluded in 1902 between the Australian Government and Burns Philp and Co. Ltd of Sydney, of which the greater part concerned the provision by the Company of a mail service between Sydney and the New Hebrides, the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate and the Gilbert and Ellis Islands for a ten year period, the Company transferred the right of disposal of land in the New Hebrides, to which it held claims, to the Australian Minister for External Affairs.

* As no suitable Condominium authority then existed to receive the lands, discussions were held with the **British** authorities who agreed to establish a Land Trust Board in the New Hebrides, which would hold and use the lands in trust 'for the benefit of the people of the New Hebrides'.

* Action in this regard has been delayed for some years pending determination of general policy guidelines by a national authority and while funding was sought from the **British** Government for the Board to buy out the existing lease holders.

* The **British** Government has held no land in the New Hebrides outside government blocks and District Agencies, therefore a question of return of **British** land has not arisen.

* A danger to the States for which the Statute of Westminster does not provide is that the **British** Parliament should come to conceive it to be its duty to pass any enactment affecting only Australia, if it is requested to do so by the Commonwealth Government and Parliament.

* Would the Attorney-General, for example, be attracted to a proposition to ask of the **British** Parliament to pass an Act that the requesting power in the Statute of Westminster should never again be resorted to by a Commonwealth Parliament?

* Two Acts have been passed by the **British** Parliament.

* The Australian States are still **British** colonies.

* If they wanted to abolish appeals from their Supreme Courts to the Privy Council they would have to ask the **British** Parliament to repeal the Judicial Committee Appeals Acts of 1833 and 1844.

* Australian diplomatic passports are recognised by **British** officials as carrying the same privileges accorded to the representatives of all friendly nations.

* I am informed that **British** immigration officers are instructed to extend all assistance and courtesies to the holder of any diplomatic passport.

* The new Government has introduced certain changes which are to the disadvantage of our traditional migrants, that is, the **British**.

* Whether Government supporters agree with it or not, Australia has been built largely on **British** stock.

* I realise that these communities require additional assistance - more so than the **British** or the normal United Kingdom settler - because they have come from a different background.

* The Minister for Immigration should admit that the **British** migrant is different from the Italian, the Greek and the Yugoslav.

* Frankly, as an Australian, I resent a **British** migrant being able to come to this country and, after residing here for only 6 months, having the right to vote on the affairs of this nation, just as I believe as an Australian that I should not have the right to vote in a United Kingdom election after living for only 6 months in that country.

* Instead of sitting there smirking and smiling the Minister should set about considering some of these issues, because I am sure that if he had been given a **British** Government award he would not have half the pride in it as he has- 
Where has that Minister gone again?

* Now that the Minister has crept back to the table, I should like from him a definition of a **British** subject.

* The Government knocks back a 
German professor who could be of some value to Australia because he is not a **British** subject.

* What is his interpretation of a **British** subject?

* We have people in this country taking out Australian citizenship to become **British** subjects.

* For example, in commenting on the gratuitous intervention of the **British** Race Relations Board and the gratuitous advice we go from them on the matter of immigration the right honourable member for Melbourne said this: 
I sympathise wilh the **British** people for the horrible mess which successive **British** governments have created by opening the floodgates to African, Indian and Caribbean migrants.

* The **British** political parties, both Conservative and Labour, have made a hell of a mess of immigration and now they appear to want to pass it on to us.

* The **British** Race Relations Board has no right to interfere with Australia or any other country.

* Reform has come to Britain, to **British** people and to those of us who have inherited the **British** traditions not so much from parliament but from the courts.

* They have ensured the freedoms of which **British** citizenry is justly proud and which it is rightly quick to defend.

* **British** Industrial Biological Research Association 
No specific request has been received on this matter but I am aware that it forms part of the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council's Repatriation and Resettlement policy.

* However, in 1975 eligibility for service pension was extended to former members of the Forces of other **British** Commonwealth countries resident in Australia who had service in wars or war-like conflicts in which Australian Forces were engaged.

* It is difficult to establish reliable estimates of the numbers of **British** Commonwealth and Allied veterans in Australia and the possible compensation and treatment requirements of any such veterans.

* Therefore, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of the cost of either extending Australian Repatriation and associated rights to **British** and allied ex-servicemen or to extend service pension benefits to allied veterans.

* If the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom got an early election some time before his Government's present 5-year term ended because he judged it proper and expedient, and it gave him an advantage over the Conservative Opposition, would the present Leader of the Opposition say that it was improper of the **British** Prime Minister?

* He know quite well that in the total practice of the **British** system an independent initiative is left to Prime Ministers here and in Britain to determine the timing of an election.

* That is a cardinal fact of the **British** system.

* It is understood in the United Kingdom that if a **British** Prime Minister cannot get his Budget through Parliament he must resign.

* If he would not resign what would happen in the **British** constitutional situation?

* This provision will be similar to the provision in the **British** Act and will not be along the lines of the somewhat old-fashioned and cumbrous methods which have been proposed by the Leader of the Opposition and, until recently, by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

* I mention in this respect that the Government of the United Kingdom has incorporated a similar provision in the **British** Act and of a large number of applications for exemption only 2 have been granted by the relevant United Kingdom tribunal.

* We have I sort of testimony in the large number of **British** doctors who are resident in Australia and who are practising alongside our native born medicos because, in many cases, they could no longer stomach the socialised medical scheme of Britain.

* We have pointed out in this House the inconsistencies of the Labor Party's foreign policy - how  it  has insulted the Americans, the **British** and the Singaporeans, and confused the Japanese, the Indonesians and the Filipinos and created apprehension and fear in Papua New Guinea.

* Now as far as Lord Mountbatten goes, he was a member of the **British** aristocracy, also a member of the **British** War Machine in Northern Ireland, a supporter of the **British** War Machine.

* JOHN MURRAY: Yes there should be more deaths amongst the **British** Army of occupation and the **British** aristocracy and if that is going to liberate Ireland well so be it.

* I wouldn't say it is all out war on members of the **British** Royal Family.

* Would you, as Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Ulster Association, support further attacks on members of the **British** Royal Family if that were to happen, if that were announced IRA, Provo, policy?

* This would follow the practice adopted by the **British** Metrication Board.

* The programme was initiated in that year and the **British** Board hoped to have it completed in full by 1977.

* As has been said by the honourable member for Ryan  (Mr Drury),  the **British** Government has made its decision and is practically half way through the conversion and the New Zealand Government has made its decision and hopes to convert very shortly.

* Before us are the experiences of many other countries in making the conversion, particularly the **British** attempt at conversion which was initiated in 1967 and is well on the way to completion.

* I sincerely trust that Australia has had observers in Britain to assess just how the **British** have made their conversion, the effects of it, and what criticism has been levelled at the Government on some of its aspects.

* A quick changeover from the **British** standard to the metric standard can be effected with a lathe.

* Office); and at some of the Conferences of (**British**) Commonwealth Statisticians.

* For nearly 20 years Australians were encouraged to believe that they were still **British** citizens.

* This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and **British** Columbia.

* The Shop Steward's Movement, the Area Committees, and other grassroots movements are a fact of life and they are not disposed of merely by referring to them as being 'commo-led' or as the reaction of dissatisfied **British** migrants.

* How many times have we heard members on the Government side of this chamber defame **British** migrants and accuse them of being the sole cause of all industrial disputes?

* In that case the individual - the employee, the person for whom the Minister spoke most highly this morning and in great indignation because he thought it was his exclusive preserve to speak in favour of individuals who are employees - was fortunate enough to find that the agreement that the union had entered into with the **British** Overseas Airways Corporation contained a nostrike clause.

* In the 30 seconds available to me I must say that one of them was, I think, a **British** citizen with a **British** passport and with a clear record as far as the **British** authorities are concerned.

* Mr Harold  Wilson, the **British** Prime Minister, is quoted as saying that massive reflation in Britain at present would be inflationary and would lead eventually to further unemployment.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  quoted a news release of the **British** High Commission out of context.

* When independent Australian surveys had confirmed that the site was radiologIcally safe, a Termination Agreement ending the arrangements for **British** use of the atomic weapons proving ground at Maralinga was signed in September 1 968.

* I accept the statement of the **British** Government and I quote it for what it is.

* The **British** Government has stated that no atomic devices were exploded during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 19S8 and 1961.

* It is not entirely beyond credibility that the **British** could have detonated an atomic bomb in the atmosphere at the 
Maralinga-Emu area and concealed the explosion from every one of the many Australian scientists, officials and servicemen who were present but how is it then that at every single nuclear test over those years many Australians were present as scientists, servicemen and organisers of the explosion sites?

* Now we are being told that somehow or other the **British** Government may have conducted secret clandestine tests on Australian soil surrounded by Australian scientists and servicemen.

* In 1968 the **British** Atomic Energy Weapons Research Establishment made a report concerning material buried at Maralinga.

* Has that film been shown on television by Swedish, Dutch, West German and East German stations and by the Columbia Broadcasting System and the **British** Broadcasting Corporation?

* But the **British** invented the parliamentary system to look after the interests of the mass of the people.

* I really believe that when the seventh stage is concluded, when television is available to 98 per cent of Australians - which is almost the same percentage as in the **British** Isles - we in Australia will have done a pretty good job in the provision of television.

* John Maynard Keynes wrote this in 1925 on why he then thought he should be a Liberal and not a member of the **British** Labour Party.

* In this respect the Conservative Party - 
He was talking about the **British** Conservative Party but this could be applied to the Liberal Party of Australia because we all know that it is a conservative party.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court, at the instance of the Federation itself in relation to the Province of **British** Columbia.

* Internationally they are still **British** colonies, and it falls to the Commonwealth, as it has ever since the nation was federated- 
The proposal in the Bill is that the period of national service be reduced from 2 years to 18 months, l.do not know that this could not be further reduced.

* I do not know whether they have read just one comment made by Lord Birkenhead in 1928 when he told the **British** Cabinet: 'We have 10 years to prepare for war'.

* Because of that statement the **British** dropped their aggressiveness and their preparedness.

* Is it a fact that the .**British** Government has contributed only $A324,000 each year since 1952, a total of $A5,800,000 towards' assisted passages for emigrants from the United Kingdom to Australia.

* If so, will the : Government inform the **British** Prime Minister that' Australia will offer no objection if the **British** Government decides to save itself from being further embarrassed by the actions of its own Race Relations Board by discontinuing any further assisted passage payments after 30th June next.. 
Let us look at the metropolitan area.

* We can go through every major suburb in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth and we will find that the greatest political and social problem we have is almost totally ignored by this conservative government while so many governments overseasthe **British**, French, Italian, Scandinavian and American- are experimenting with a multiplicity of ideas such as early retirement, a shorter working week, and subsidised work for young people.

* So in a great many companies operating in the metal, textile, electrical and building industries **British** and Australian workers are a small minority-only one in seven or one in eight.

* Although the people of our mother country - Great Britain - are not involved in the Vietnam conflict, they have been demonstrating against it to a greater extent than the people of Australia, but the **British** Government has not seen fit - 1 believe rightly so - to introduce legislation to control those people in Great Britain who are demonstrating against the butchery that is being perpetrated by the Western allies in Vietnam.

* He was told that his Bill would minimise jobs for **British** seamen, both the men building the ships and those who went to sea.

* 1 ) How does the Department of Social Security determine the value of **British** pensions, when making allowance for these pensions in the payment of Australian social security benefits.

* How often does the Department of Social Security make determinations on the value of **British** pensions.

* Are there any means to ensure that the determination by the Department will be equivalent to the amounts actually paid at the banks to those with **British** pensions.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that an examination by Australian and **British** officials of records relating to the burial of radioactive material at Maralinga revealed the existence of 6 relevant documents.

* Which of the documents is classified by (a) the Australian Government and (b) the **British** Government.

* Recently, as is now generally known, an American college student and a **British** newspaper developed ways of constructing nuclear weapons.

* This was an article in the **British** media describing something of the problems that Britain saw in Australia.

* At that time sitting at the table where my friend the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  now sits was the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Kooyong, and he dealt with the subject with a command of industry and understanding and his own impeccable command of interest in the whole of the **British** experience.

* It would not be out of place, in the words of a man who has given great hope to our people, to observe that, as far as the old **British** Empire and Commonwealth is concerned, this is the occasion to acknowledge the fact that it may well be that the gulfs will wash us down.

* What is happening in Queensland is very much like what happened on a smaller scale with the Channel Islands when they became a tax refuge and they profiteered at the expense of the rest of the **British** Isles.

* This is just like the scandal that went on with the Channel Islands and the **British** economy.

* Our lack of investigation is so complete that some city planners are using **British** findings, although it would be difficult to find two countries more dissimilar than Britain and Australia in climate and population densities.

* Faced with legitimate criticism of some of the consequences of the 1967 Abortion Act, the **British** Government has responded not by repealing or amending that Act but by setting up a committee of inquiry under  Mrs Justice  Lane to report upon  those aspects of administration over which abuses have arisen and by upgrading family planning services in order to reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancies.

* Can he say how these facilities compare with those in Japanese, **British**, Swedish and West German shipyards.

* Australian television stations spend huge sums purchasing American and **British** programmes, while the local industry is not encouraged to expand.

* When a United States or a **British** television film or entertainment show is produced, there is a ready market available.

* For instance, a tariff of 5c a foot is charged on imported American film and 1c a foot on **British** film.

* Another important factor in encouraging and expanding our local industry is the drain on our overseas credit balance by the huge annual bill for the purchase of American and **British** films and shows.

* For instance, it is said that in the **British** Parliament the minority point of view presented prior to the Second World War was in fact the correct point of view.

* New South Wales can expect a flood of starry eyed **British** migrants from the beginning of next year.

* That is the concept of New South Wales given by a new Government-sponsored movie designed to seduce **British** migrants.

* It follows a newly-arrived **British** migrant family who drive about in a late model station wagon viewing the better parts of Sydney.

* I would like to emphasise that it would be tragic for any **British** family to migrate to Australia unless the breadwinner could be guaranteed continuity of employment.

* The article states: 
I'll say it would, ls it any wonder that **British** migrant families are returning home when they find that the advertisements for New South Wales which they answer are absolutely false.

* Is it any wonder that **British** migrants are very disturbed when, after being presented with falsehoods, they arrive in Australia only to be disillusioned because they have been conned into coming out here?

* In 1956 when the **British** and the French invaded Egyptian territory- in conjunction with the Israelis- to capture the Suez canal there was an immediate threat of war from the Russians.

* In the United Nations Security Council the power of veto is in the hands of the **British**, the French, the United States, the USSR and China.

* Thirdly, it has allocated substantial amounts of money for industrial research to some of the largest companies in the world including General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd $469,646, the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd $25,000, the **British** Leyland Motors Corporation $25,000, and Chrysler Australia Ltd $161,000 without any report to the Parliament and without any indication that the money would be spent in road accident research.

* What does he say about the spokesmen of the **British** Labour Party, who command the same sense of compassion as the honourable gentleman?

* In Parliament on 9 December 1976 you asked a Question about **British** experiments at Maralinga in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

* This important matter, which is essentially one of longterm environmental management, has become confused and distorted by several unfounded allegations, in particular that an unexploded nuclear weapon is buried at Maralinga; that radioactive waste was brought from **British** nuclear power stations and buried at Maralinga; and that about 800 tonnes of nuclear waste material, including plutonium, is buried at Maralinga, which is what the South Australian Minister for Mines and Energy was reported on 20 December 1976 to have said.

* The radioactive debris at Maralinga is derived from three sources- **British** nuclear tests and experiments carried out in that area some fifteen to twenty-five years ago; washings from **British** service aircraft which participated in the nuclear tests at Christmas Island in 1957-58 and which later flew to Edinburgh airfield for cleaning and maintenance, and nuclear medical waste from the University of Adelaide.

* These arrangements were incorporated in a report by the **British** Government so that residual radioactivity at sites of their tests would be recorded for posterity.

* You referred also to the 'moratorium' during which the **British** Government, along with the U.S. and Soviet Governments, accepted a self-imposed obligation to refrain from the testing of nuclear weapons.

* During this period the then **British** Government conducted various experiments at Maralinga.

* The **British** Government has advised that: 
The following table gives the information requested in (i), (i) and (iii) of question (1) in respect of the total **British** Assisted Passage Program for the first three months of 1973.

* The United Kingdom Government in January 1976 set up the **British** Oil Corporation to participate in the development of North Sea oil resources.

* The **British** National Oil Corporation currently participates in the development of five oil wells in the North Sea and in the Viking natural gas field.

* The official **British** Information Service bulletin entitled '**British** Industry Today- Energy ' states: 
That is, the **British** National Oil Corporation- in existing commercial oil-fields is being achieved by negotiations with the licencees; by late 1977 participation agreements had been concluded with 19 companies and outline agreements with 22 others.

* One method is the course adopted in this legislation- that of requesting the **British** Houses of Parliament to pass an Act preventing appeals from any State court to the Privy Council.

* We are asking the **British** Houses of Parliament to do the job for us.

* If this legislation were passed and if we suppose that the **British** Parliament passed the legislation as requested, it would interfere with the Constitution of the States.

* I ask honourable members to imagine the situation: If we establish the precedent of passing this legislation- request and consent legislationthere is no area into which the **British** House of Commons and House of Lords could not go to pass legislation which affected the States of the Commonwealth of Australia- the 6 constituent States.

* The Australian States are still **British** Colonies.

* If they wanted to abolish appeals from their Supreme Courts to the Privy Council they would have to ask the **British** Parliament to repeal the Judicial Committee Appeals Acts of 1833 and 1844.

* There is then one necessary question to ask: Would the **British** Parliament- the House of 
 I have agreed, in consultations with the **British** Government, to outline today the indicative fare levels I am hopeful of achieving on the United Kingdom-Australia route.

* Let me turn to the United Kingdom  Daily Telegraph  of 9 August, the day after the negotiations took place between senior officers of the **British** Government and officers of the Australian Department of Transport.

* If a proposal does in fact come eventually from **British** Airways it will be accompanied by an environmental impact statement prepared by **British** Airways in conjunction and in co-operation with the Department of Transport.

* Let us not allow anyone to downgrade the flag that symbolises so much of our Christian and **British** way of life.

* I can, however, give the honourable gentleman the assurance that I do not propose in any way to ask the **British** Government to introduce legislation in the **British** Parliament to bring about a unitary system of government in Australia.

* I have not sought the concurrence of the States in approaching the **British** Government on this matter because I accept the principle which my predecessors - certainly going back to  Sir Robert  Menzies - always asserted and which successive **British** governments have always acknowledged, that the proper means of communication between Australia and Britain are through the Australian Government and the **British** Government.

* The State governments are, in constitutional terms, the governments of **British** colonies.

* Perhaps it will be of interest to honourable members who were Ministers in the previous Government if I inform the House of information which I did give to the **British** Government about the Australian Government's attitude to another proposal, for an amendment to the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act.

* It was proposed last year that the Australian Government and the State governments should introduce legislation requesting and consenting to **British** legislation (exempting State shipping - in effect, intrastate shipping - from the operation of the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894).

* I told the **British** Government that as far as I knew none of the State governments had introduced such legislation and the new Australian Government did not propose to introduce such legislation.

* The reason I gave to the **British** Government was that my Government believed that this was a matter appropriate for determination by the Australian people at a referendum.

* Instead of having an Australian merchant shipping code for the Territories and for interstate shipping, and a **British** merchant shipping code for intrastate shipping in each of the 6 States, we could have the absurd situation - the break of gauge syndrome - in which we had different merchant shipping codes, not only from this Parliament in respect of the Territories and of interstate shipping but also from each State parliament in respect of intrastate shipping along its coast.

* I told the **British** Government that in due course my Government would be seeking, through a Bill passed by this Parliament, a referendum to enable this Parliament to pass laws in respect of shipping and navigation as was recommended unanimously by members of the Australian Country Party, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Labor Party on the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which was set up on the motion of  Sir Robert  Menzies back in the 1950s.

* To sum up, my Government will not proceed with the proposal last year for Commonwealth legislation which would have been necessary, and State legislation, which would have been completely superfluous, for a **British** Act amending the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act of 1894.

* This Government will proceed with legislation requesting and consenting to **British** legislation discontinuing the use of the Privy Council by this part of the Queen's dominions.

* (a) Lake Class bulk carriers of the Australian National Line, (b) Three **British** flag bulk carriers have been employed.

* As was once said by a **British** Prime Minister, it is necessary to stop-go when you are driving in busy traffic.

* The normal course of redress in this case, if there is a deadlock, is for the matter to go before the **British** courts where an arbitrator will make a judgment.

* I point out that an interest of the United States of America in Clutha Development Pty Ltd has been taken over by **British** Petroleum.

* Apparently it is all right for the **British** to make some arrangements about Diego Garcia and not consult Australia.

* Finally I draw the attention of the House to an extract from the speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he introduced the last **British** Budget.

* The **British** Consumer Council said in its annual report in 1 970: 
Let me, at this point, explode another illusion if it exists at all.

* He spent his last years devoting his whole time to she **British** Sailors Society.

* This continent, of course, had been discovered many times in the preceding 200 years, but Cook's discovery unearthed, if you like, the continent for the **British** Establishment, which at that time had some problems to solve.

* Italian and **British** have adopted the modular system of training where instead of training a man to become a tradesman capable of doing any one of 200 or 300 complicated operations, of which number he may have to do only 3 or 4, they train him to be very proficient and efficient in perhaps one or two of those operations, adding another module in each year or period when modern technology calls for the additional module of specialised training.

* In the course of my letter of 14th April 1970 to the  Chairman  of the Australian **British** Commonwealth Games Association, I explained that the basis of our long established support for Australian participation in both the Commonwealth Games and the Olympic Games is that the Commonwealth should not be expected to make a grant to meet a major portion of the costs, but to aim only at arousing the interest of the public and other possible subscribers.

* People are concerned about the doubtful position which **British** migrants occupy at present.

* The Procedure Committee of the **British** House of Commons in 1969 recommended a similar committee of eighty, broken into 9 subcommittees.

* The **British** Government eventually accepted, amid considerable criticism, a reduced committee of forty-nine, broken into 6 subcommittees.

* It cannot cover the full range of activities covered by the much larger **British** House of Commons Expenditure Committee.

* That information has not yet been available to the **British** Expenditure Committee.

* As I understand the position, the tonnage measurement and the registration of ships provisions in our legislation existed in the **British** Merchant Shipping Act of previous times.

* It was previously covered by the **British** Merchant Shipping Act of 1894 as it applied to Australia.

* Pending new Commonwealth legislation being introduced to supersede the **British** Acts as they apply to Australia, the Bill now before the House will provide Commonwealth power to make regulations for the measurement of ships.

* In the meantime we are protected under **British** laws as they apply to Australia.

* The duty was the subject of discussion in five rounds of consultations held with EEC and **British** authorities between April 1972 and May 1974 concerning the effects of **British** entry to the Community on Australia's trade.

* The House of Representatives Select Committee was critical of the fact that the number of hours devoted to the teaching of reading in teacher training colleges is nowhere near the minimum recommended by the **British** Bullock report or the International Reading Association.

* At the last minute the organisers of the dinner received a telegram from the **British** War Office saying that the band could not play at a political function.

* Information is not available to indicate with accuracy the movement of **British** assisted migrants to and from Whyalla.

* It is estimated that in the 5 years to the end of June 1970 more than 10,600 **British** assisted migrants indicated upon arrival in Australia their intention to proceed to Whyalla.

* -I take it that this question refers to an Australian citizen, Martin Cohen, who, with 3 other citizens, one a West German and the other 2 **British**, has been detained under the Terrorism Act of 1967 of South Africa.

* The Government has, through the Australian Embassy in Pretoria, approached the South African 
Has BOAC, the **British** international flag carrier, set up a fully-owned charter subsidiary, **British** Overseas Air Charters Ltd (BOAC Ltd) to enter the charter market.

* Is the Minister for External Affairs aware of a report broadcast on the **British** Broadcasting Commission news at 
My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration.

* Is it a fact that his Department is giving consideration to the deportation of Christopher Coles, a 19-year-old **British** citizen who was recently convicted and gaoled in Western Australia for disrupting a church service?

* The **British** Phosphate Commission, which is made up of New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Australia, operates as a corporation for the handling of rock phosphate from Nauru, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

* I would think that it is more a case of speculation that people have said that this action by the **British** Phosphate Commission has been the reason for delays in those negotiations.

* Honourable members will realise that an industrial dispute in the **British** Post Office is now entering its sixth or seventh week.

* I think it is fair to say that the **British** Post Office employees have no regard whatsoever for the public interest in relation to this matter nor, in some respects, have the employees of the Australian Post Office.

* At the moment, I understand, there are some 232 held in post offices in Australia and it is unlikely that these will be delivered to the persons to whom they are addressed until the **British** Post Office industrial troubles are overcome.

* In addition, the most recent **British** royal commission on capital punishment, after hearing evidence from all over the world, concluded: 
The **British** Parliament was told in 1961, in answer to a question, that of the 76 convicted murderers released from life imprisonment in the years 1956 to 1960 only 2 were convicted of subsequent crimes of violence, and they were not murder.

* They comprised the **British** side of the team.

* The Gove deposits were tested in detail, first by New Guinea Resources Prospecting Co., owned 51 per cent by the Commonwealth Government and 49 per cent by **British** Aluminium Co. Ltd and subsequently by various other companies including finally, Nabalco.

* The common sense approach has been and should be to adopt the same attitude that made the **British** policeman famous, that is, the ability to deal with situations without violence.

* The implication seems to be that the majority of the countries in Asia and other members of the **British** Commonwealth are not trading with Communist China and therefore, because we trade with Communist China, we are becoming separated from them; but this of course is a completely false premise.

* In Canada by virtue of a special legislative provision, the question was referred to the Supreme Court at the instance of the Federation itself in relation to the Province of **British** Columbia.

* The fact is that nearly all members of what used to be called the **British** Empire on obtaining independence have chosen to remain in the Commonwealth.

* Features of their Federal systems- amendments of the Constitution in Canada's case and gubernatorial appointments and Privy Council appeals in Austrafia *s - still involve the **British** Government and the **British** Parliament.

* It was the term applied to the **British** State under Oliver and Richard Cromwell.

* Accordingly, I welcome the use of the word 'Commonwealth' in this sense in the way that it is known by most people who belong to what used to be the old **British** Empire and most people whose nations still choose to remain in this Commonwealth of Nations.

* The Commonwealth is composed, with one exception, of nations which used to be ruled by Britain and were part of the **British** Empire.

* There are among them 3 Knights Commander, 1 Commander and 1 Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the **British** Empire.

* When one argues that the French or the **British** are spending more than we are because, via their taxation system, they spend 4.5 per cent or whatever the figure is, and via our taxation system we are spending only 2.5 per cent, one is being dishonest.

* The **British** system includes all the things that our taxation system does not include.

* If we included all the things for which the **British** system pays we would have to pick up all the private payments in the Australian context.

* If one adds those and if one is honest, one finds the equivalent to the **British** figure for the year.

* Not only did he find the rate of surgery in the United States twice that prevailing in England and Wales but he also showed that Americans were three times as likely as their **British** counterparts to have a cholecystectomy and more than four times as likely to have a haemorrhoidectomy.

* However, the writing into the Constitution of reference to political parties is contrary to many traditions and contrary to an established attitude within our traditional **British** system that we do not refer in constitutions to political parties.

* The Department was able to refer the Committee to the **British** experience where on 3 occasions when drug charges have been either introduced or increased drug usage has fallen by approximately 9 per cent to 12 per cent, at least in the short term.

* 1 concede that that is the popular view but unfortunately when you read reports by national inquiries such as the report published in 1968 by the **British** committee into the drug problem, headed by Baroness Wootton, you find fairly convincing and firm statements that most of the claims against marihuana are not substantiated by facts.

* In fact, in some quite unofficial discussions I have had with one of these judges it was revealed that if the judges could be sure and they could send these people to a clinic, such as the **British** are beginning to set up, where they could be treated, that is the only punishment they would inflict.

* In 'Harper's Magazine'  of  this year there is an article headed 'Drugs Without Crime; A report on the **British** success with heroin addiction'.

* Why are the **British** succeeding where the Americans are failing?

* The answer to me is because the **British** are recognising the fact that drug addicts are not criminals; they arsick individuals.

* The writer of this article states:  the **British** never lost sight of the fact that they were talking about medicine.

* lt is interesting to note, when one considers the **British** approach in establishing clinics, the efforts in 1965 of the New York Academy of Medicine which urged that another attempt should be made to establish clinics which were established in America after the First World War to cope with the drug problem and suggested that the earlier efforts were stopped not because they had failed but because they ran against the prevailing philosophy of a punitive approach'.

* There have been some suggestions that we cannot be loo sure that there may not be other differences between the **British** and American approaches to the drug problem - that, after all, there may be something in the **British** character which is different from the American character - to explain this seemingly, odd drug behaviour.

* My statements are based exclusively on scientific reports which have been compiled by governments, such as the **British**, Canadian and American governments.

* Then I suggest that the community would readily accept the same approach which the **British** are adopting and toss out the idiot approach, the punitive approach.

* I have been approached by **British** ex-servicemen concerning repatriation benefits.

* When the Labor Government was in office it introduced a very important reform, that is, it made **British** ex-servicemen eligible for Service pensions.

* Accordingly **British** ex-servicemen are naturally a bit uptight about this matter.

* We have not said the last thing about the Somme when we say that in contrast with the French Army, the **British** Army did nol mutiny when for 30 days, clay after day.

* There was a time when the **British** fought a war that is called the 'War of Jenkin's Ear'.

* But by intervening on the broad mainland of Asia and not merely on the peninsula where there could be an end to the military line, by violating the simple principle of not interfering with a government that was in existence and viable - imagine the **British** in the days of the Raj overthrowing any maharaja who was a loyal ally - and by doing that with Diem, the United States helped to create the crisis for which they have paid a very high price in blood in their efforts to solve.

* He was one of a gang of expert **British** criminals who in August 1963 knocked off Stg2,631,784, of which each received about Stg 120,600.

* **British** safe-breakers move around Europe at the invitation of European criminals.

* I have here a book which refers to the activities of the **British** criminals and safebreakers.

* The **British** criminal is so skilled at breaking into safes that the safe industry in Britain leads the world.

* No request by the **British** to bury in Australia waste from their nuclear establishments has been made and certainly no such permission has ever been given.

* An example is the **British** defence budget as outlined in Lord Carrington's statement on the defence estimates for 1971.

* However, **British** spending on new production and procurement is 30 per cent compared with 14 per cent in this Budget.

* The **British** Budget devotes 36 per cent of spending to civilian pay, administrative services, stores and supplies compared with around SO per cent in the Australian defence vote.

* The 
The Audit Act of 1901 was the fourth piece of legislation enacted by the Commonwealth Par.liament It contained principles and procedures which were derived from the Audit Acts which were then in force in each of the States and which in turn had their origins in the **British** Exchequer and Audit Act of 1866.

* Personally, I am watching with great interest the experiments in the **British** House of Commons relating to selective televising of its proceedings.

* Shortly thereafter, the **British** Government convened a conference in London of the opposing parties.

* Provided that this third phase can be successfully concluded, a **British** Governor will shortly thereafter arrive in Salisbury to assume control of the administration of the country in the transitional period.

* In the hope and expectation that an all-parties package agreement may be achieved in London, the **British** Government has sought Australian assistance in the implementation of that agreement in two respects.

* Firstly, and as the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  announced on 9 November, the **British** Government has requested the Australian Government to contribute a contingent to a Commonwealth military ceasefire monitoring force.

* In the event of any serious breakdown of law and order in Rhodesia in which the lives of Australian personnel could be at risk, they would be immediately withdrawn after appropriate advice to the **British** Government.

* The **British** Government has now invited Australia to send a group of such observers to Rhodesia for the pre-election period and the elections.

* It will also serve as a direct point of contact between the Australian 
Government and the **British** authorities in Salisbury.

* It seems clear to the Government, however, that when all the Rhodesian parties concerned and the **British** Government have freely agreed to an independence Constitution, freely agreed on arrangements for the holding of elections and the implementation of that Constitution, and when **British** authority has been re-established in Rhodesia for the purpose of instituting those arrangements, then the objectives for which sanctions were originally imposed will have been achieved.

* Also, there is no similar provision applying to the State Public Services or to the **British** Civil Service.

* Some of the particular interests identified with  Sir Robert  Menzies and which might therefore be drawn within the purposes of the fund are the law, with particular reference to constitutional matters and Federal-State relationships, studies concerned with Australia 's role within the **British** Commonwealth and with Australia-Britain relations; studies of Australia and the United States; studies of relations between Australia and the Pacific nations.

* Mr Payne, Commonwealth Secretary of the **British** and Foreign Bible Society, went on: Whether you are critical of war, whether you are an out-and-out pacificist or not, I believe there is no question of the debt we owe these people today.

* I might add for the information of the Leader of the Opposition, that I said at the conference in Devonport that at no time had my Press Secretary advised me that directions had been conveyed to htm that he would not be able to attend the briefings which were to take place between me as Minister for Defence and Lord Carrington, the **British** Minister for Defence.

* I direct a question to the Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development I ask: In view of his answer to the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and in accordance with the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection Act, when was the final environmental impact statement prepared by the proponent, which I take it was **British** Airways?

* It has attempted to make some savings in freight by block cargo deliveries, the rationalisation of ports through which exports are made and the virtual end of the sorting of fruit at **British** ports.

* No decision has yet been taken on the question of the best method of adjusting the rate of duty on goods imported into this country following **British** entry to the.

* Among these is the possibility that the existing general rates in our tariff be reduced to the **British** preferential rates.

* Mr Speaker, I informed the House on 1 May of my talks in London, just after Easter, with the **British** Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, 

 Mr Speaker, when I spoke in the House on 1 May I foreshadowed that the Government would follow the course of introducing legislation requesting and consenting to the enactment of **British** legislation abolishing appeals to the Privy Council from State supreme courts in State matters.

* If there were to be no challenge within a reasonable period, or if the validity of the legislation is upheld under challenge, the Australian Government would expect that the **British** Government would introduce into the **British** Parliament the legislation requested and consented to by the Australian Government and Parliament.

* The Schedule to the Bill contains the terms of the legislation which we would expect the **British** Government to introduce in the **British** Parliament.

* In connection with the petition on seabed matters which the States are reported to be contemplating, I should inform the House that I have sent a message to the **British** Prime Minister.

* I made the point to the **British** Prime Minister that the provisions of section 4 of the Judicial Committee Act 1833, under which the States apparently propose to petition  Her  Majesty, will be included among the provisions that will be repealed when the **British** Parliament enacts its legislation on the request and consent of this Parliament.

* Note: These figures do not include an unknown number of nominees of **British** citizenship, mainly from the United Kingdom, who will only be subject to the grant of a visa after 1 January 1975.

* In that period **British** Liberals were trying to get amendments to education legislation in Britain that were invariably thrown out of the House of Lords because of the influence of the Anglican Church at that time.

* I refer to a national television programme last Friday evening on which the Prime Minister, speaking of discussions he had with the **British** Government, said: 
Is he aware that a **British** Government spokesman had previously said that no prearrangement or advance knowledge of the settlement was known?

* Foreign banks - and **British** banks are foreign banks - have always been and still are powerful in Australia.

* Can he say whether **British** and U.S.A. publishers have carved up the English-speaking world between them in a dual copyright monopoly under theterms of what is known as the Traditional Markets Agreement.

* If so, does this course prevent Australians purchasing editions of books produced in the U.S.A. in cases where **British** publishers have taken up a copyright option for those books even though the **British** publishers do not publish the books.

* What action can be taken to ensure the availability to the Australian consumer of books produced in the U.S.A. in cases where **British** publishers holding copyright options have refrained from making such books available to their traditional markets.

* I understand that there is an agreement called the **British** Traditional Markets Agreement.

* Under the terms of this Agreement, **British** publishers have agreed among themselves that they will not publish in the United Kingdom any book originating outside the **British** 'traditional' market (for example in the United States) unless they secure the rights to publish that book in the whole of the 'traditional' market, which includes Australia.

* The 'traditional' market includes virtually any country which was included in the former **British** Empire, except Canada.

* It appears that under the operation of this Agreement, rights acquired from United States publishers by **British** publishers need not necessarily be exercised, i.e., the **British** publisher may not proceed to publication.

* It appears also that many American editions, which are not available on the Australian market, may be cheaper than the corresponding **British** editions.

* This would be the case, for example, when the American edition is in paperback and the **British** edition in hard cover.

* I have been informed that discussions are to take place in London during September between representatives of the Australian Book Publishers Association and the corresponding **British** association, at which the representatives of the Australian Association will raise the matters I have mentioned above.

* Does the provision apply equally to **British** migrants.

* -I did see Press reports to the effect that Qantas Airways Ltd and **British** Airways were under investigation by the **British** Airlines Representatives Board.

* I understand further that some agents whom Qantas has been using have been guilty of some malpractice and that the **British** Airlines Representatives Board is dealing summarily with them.

* This is a matter on which we should have taken lessons long ago from the **British**.

* The feeling engendered in the **British** workers is the type of feeling that the Government is endeavouring to engender in the public mind.

* J have seen the **British** House of Commons sit through the meal periods.

* It embraces the past conflict, the agreement, the **British** being able to re-establish their authority by way of a governor, the difficulties that Kaunda has experienced in Zambia, the use of a monitoring force, a transition period, election observers, sanctions and what is called a final phase.

* The action is welcomed from the **British** point of view but is it the safe attitude for Australia?

* An article states: 
The **British** Government seems to think that a ceasefire runs itself .

* two possible consequences follow: either the Salisbury regime's security forces will stay in barracks and remain ' neutral', and there may or may not be pitched battles between the followers of Muzorewa and those of the Patriotic Front; or else the security forces will attempt to restore 'law and order' and the **British** governor may find himself in charge of a continuation of the war against the guerillas.

* The **British** have been having discussions about why sanctions are being withdrawn in such a hurry.

* People thought that the situation would be all right if a **British** governor were there.

* I put it on record that the **British** failed in the past.

* The **British** Government, of both shades of opinion, seemed to walk away from giving the solution that they want.

* I understand that if difficulties arise we will discuss the matter further with the **British**, but I do not know whether that will get us very far along the track, bearing in mind the tension existing in the region.

* It has been stated that if there is any serious breakdown in law and order Australian troops will be withdrawn after appropriate advice to the **British** Government.

* We would like to see the **British** more directly involved, to guarantee some maintenance of law and order.

* About 30 people demonstrated outside the South African Embassy last night while a small group of university students painted anti-apartheid slogans on the **British** High Commission and the residence of the South African Embassy,  Mr D.  W. Steward, of Garran.

* The words 'No arms for South Africa' were daubed in black paint on a wall of the **British** High Commission.

* It also means the preservation of the opportunity for the expression of ideas; it means the preservation of the opportunity to express dissent, and to express it in a peaceful way; it means something of the **British** traditions that we have inherited, such as the preservation of the rule of law and of democracy and not mobocracy; it means an appreciation that maturity in the individual means the recognition of the right of another to have and to express a point of view that is different from one's own; and it means the preservation of the **British** parliamentary system.

* If the Minister for Northern Development, in Britain in order to help the Labor Government there win its impending election, enters into a contractual arrangement with the **British** Government under which the price of sugar will be less than the Malaysian price- a rumour about which the sugar trade is most concerned- this will not be in Australia's interest.

* The **British** Labor Government went right through the process, as the Labor Government here did between 1972 and 1975, continually spending and creating credit which did not exist.

* In an article entitled 'A Monetary Model of the **British** Economy 1880-1975' the author speaks about the **British** economy.

* The article states: 
Australian industry, and this is the provision that if programmes are produced in **British** Commonwealth countries they will receive credit as if they were Australian programmes for half their actual duration with a maximum credit of 5 per cent in any 28 day period.

* Although I have not seen any actual figures, the number of **British** shows alone being shown on commercial television leads me to believe that the full 5 per cent must be taken up.

* We have been made to believe that he, the Leader of the Opposition, is the repository of the proprietal virtues developed under the **British** system of parliamentary government.

* Opposition leaders in banana republics may speculate about the future of their currency; Opposition leaders in countries brought up under the conventions of **British** parliamentary government should not and, except where one like the honourable gentleman emerges with the political morals of an alley cat, they do not.

* The expression of this opinion set up a disastrous chain reaction which disrupted so many markets for **British** goods that ultimately Britain was left with no real alternative but to float its currency.

* However, I point out to him, and to anybody else who agrees with his point of view in regard to the motor industry, that the only way to achieve rationalisation in this industry is by more solid long term planning to ensure that individual company decisions are not made as they are now likely to be made with the Japanese joining up with **British** Leyland Motor Corporation, with nobody at the Chrysler Company knowing about that amalgamation, and Chrysler joining up with some other Japanese organisation.

* lt has been stated by the vicechairman of the **British** Steel Corporation that there will be a cutout point in the utilisation of coal in steel technology when the price reaches  $20  a ton.

* The Act provides for continuation of former **British** extradition treaties and authorises the Governor-General to apply the Act to any other foreign state by regulation where an extradition treaty is negotiated after the commencement of the Act.

* I shall read the words of  Mr Paul  Johnson, the former editor of the **British** Labour Weekly  The New Statesman  who recently resigned his long-standing membership of the **British** Labour Party.

* I ask the Minister for Supply whether his attention has been drawn to the deplorable circumstances concerning the 12m town of Maralinga in South Australia, established in the 1950s as a joint **British** and Australian testing area.

* Does the **British** Government still retain an interest in Maralinga?

* On the other hand, some employers not in the National Industrial Council- for instance, the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and the **British** Phosphate Commission- recommended greater government involvement in the form of the establishment of a statutory stevedoring corporation to employ waterside workers and regulate the industry.

* This has been exemplified by the Queensland, **British** and Canadian experience.

* In addition, while I understand that committees of the House of Commons do not enjoy the same importance or at least have the same ramifications as those of the American Congress, they are important sections of the functioning of the **British** Parliament.

* by leave - Last night the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the intention of the **British** Government to introduce a system of levies on the imports of a number of agricultural commodities.

* The **British** say that the main objective in imposing a levy system on imports is to reduce the claims on public expenditure caused by their present subsidy system for supporting their agricultural industry.

* Indeed the **British** have said that this is one of the reasons for the introduction of the system of levies.

* The **British** have asked us to join with them in talks on the commodities of interest to Australia.

* The **British** Government will introduce the new measures when their discussions with overseas suppliers have been completed.

* The **British** proposals have very important implications for our future trade and trading relations, so I will briefly describe them as I understand them.

* The **British** Government proposes to impose variable levies on imports of fresh, frozen and chilled beef and veal.

* In the case of mutton and lamb, it is the **British** intention to impose a specific rate of duty.

* The final impact of these new levies on trade will, of course, not be known until the details of the **British** proposals have been worked out and are in operation.

* However, it is also now proposed by the **British** that on 1st July next their cereals system will be brought into line with the variable levy mechanism of the EEC Common Agricultural Policy.

* In the case of the powdered and condensed milks and creams, the **British** intend to set up minimum import prices supported by variable levies.

* Our present trade in these products is small but the **British** proposals represent a further restriction on the already difficult dairy produce market.

* There is one thing which stands out starkly when looking at the **British** proposals.

* The **British** action will cut across the trade agreement that Australia has with Britain.

* Under this agreement, first negotiated in 1932 and reviewed in 1957, the **British** Government undertakes to give free entry to imports from Australia for these and most other products.

* The Australian Government will be carefully studying the implications of the **British** proposals as we now understand them and as they are elaborated during the forthcoming talks in London.

* I could not help noticing an article bz John Helliwell, a lecturer at the University of **British** Columbia who addressed the 43rd conference of the Australia/New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science in May of this year.

* Previously the **British** marine insurance companies picked up all the lucrative profits of marine insurance.

* The **British** have a patrol boat of the 'Gay Bombadier' class which has a speed of 50 knots and which carries missiles that can inflict major damage on an aircraft carrier.

* Only one of these is not an Australian citizen He is a relatively recent appointee as Trade Commissioner, Bangkok, who is a **British** citizen, born in India.

* If honourable gentlemen opposite desire to observe **British** parliamentary practice they must acknowledge the authority of  Mr Speaker,  who is charged with the duty  it  conducting the business of the House.

* Is the present parlous state in which the **British** national health scheme finds itself due to the fact that it is entirely tax financed and thus medical care and standards have become subject to the vagaries of annual budgets?

* I have heard the argument put that one cannot draw a parallel between the House of Representatives in Australia and the House of Commons in Britain because the Parliament of Australia has as its House of review or upper House an elected chamber, whereas the **British** Parliament has an appointed house as its House of review.

* As I said here the other day, what we ought to have in Australia in 1975 is what was written into the **British** system in 191 1- that is, that an Upper House can only sniff at a money Bill and if it did not pass that Bill it would not matter.

* I have been given some figures which show that in the late 1960s the total manpower of the **British** Merchant Navy was about 100 000 men, of whom 13 000 were deck officers.

* That is not the case as far as our **British** counterparts are concerned.

* **British** schools have proved successful with a fraction of the amenities that would be available to such a potential Australian counterpart.

* Finally I ask whether, since the New Hebrides is an Anglo-French condominium, he has asked the Prime Minister, who is still the means of communication with the **British** Government, or the Foreign Minister, who is the means of communication with the French Government, to study this aspect.

* I mention only that in 1968 the **British** Royal Commission into trade unions brought down its report in which it found that the system which had operated from 1906 until 1968 in that regard should continue.

* Advice has been received from the appropriate **British** authorities that in the United Kingdom the list of passengers is to remain closed for fifty years.

* As the information exists in both **British** and Australian records, agreement on policy was desirable and after consultation with the **British** authorities it was agreed that the names of individuals should be withheld.

* Did the Acting Prime Minister, while having no detailed information on the subject to give to the Parliament in answer to a question asked by me on 16th February, subsequently make a detailed statement outside the House on negotiations with the **British** Government?

* Will the Acting Prime Minister give this Parliament as a matter of urgency the opportunity to debate his statement and those of his predecessor on trade, particularly with the United Kingdom, and the implications for this country of the **British** decision to enter the European Economic Community, or does he intend to leave Australia's interests, particularly with the EEC countries, to  Mr Heath  and his Government while denying the opportunity to this Parliament to debate in detail and at length this important matter to this nation?

* It was a mighty good guarantee and a very astute move on the part of the **British** shipping interests to trap the Australian Government in this fasion because even now the question of containerisation and its applicability to the various forms of export trade from Australia has not been fully satisfied or fully examined.

* The Scandinavians, who were responsible for the introduction of that system, have my respect because I think they know far more about shipping than do their **British** rivals.

* HMAS 'Diamantina' is the sort of warship the **British** use for dealing with Icelandic fishermen when the main weapon used in anger by the Icelandic adversary is likely to be a boat hook.

* As a result of the great work that he did and his desire to break this speed record he was honoured by the **British** Government with a knighthood in recognition of his services.

* The five delegates who voted against the resolution were from American Samoa, the **British** Solomon Islands and Protectorate, New Caledonia, New Hebrides and Niue.

* The **British** Solomn Islands and Nieu delegates did not give their reasons for voting against the resolution.

* The New Hebrides, being a Condominium, is represented by two delegates, one from the **British** and one from the French administrations, but has only one vote.

* As the delegate representing the French administration was absent at the time of the vote, the delegate representing the **British** administration at first abstained from voting.

* We have naturally had a very strong leaning towards our **British** friends but today the Minister is leaning away from this position.

* I think I am correct in saying that he has placed an arbitrary date on **British** people residing in Australia to register to receive the full Australian benefits.

* Should these **British** people fail to register by a certain date they will have to go through the normal process of taking out naturalisation papers.

* In other words you are now starting to down grade the **British** people.

* Is this advice at variance with that of the **British** Phosphate Commission which has announced that Christmas Island deposits will be exhausted in 1983?

* Even the **British** Medical Association which is by no means a revolutionary body has said that physical maturity and emotional maturity in fact are going together with the young today.

* When the Dutch had to quit West Irian and when the **British** had to dispose of Borneo and now that the Portuguese have abandoned Timor they have bungled every question of decolonisation in our region.

* In Bougainville, the present sense of separateness might be further diminished if at some later date the people of the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate were to opt for unification with an independent Papua New Guinea.'

* No special consultations have taken place with the **British** authorities regarding the speculation by the Visiting Mission.

* 154 of 20 May 1970 (Hansard ' page 2484) exchanges of views take place from time to time with the **British** authorities on the South Pacific and we keep each other informed on developments in each other's dependent territories.

* I am not aware of any significant trends in the **British** Solomon Islands Protectorate towards unification with Papua New Guinea.

* First of all, there was the colonial era when Australia was utterly dependent on the protection of Britain - the **British** Navy and the broad seas.

* Then came what might be called the dominion era - the era of imperial defence when we made some contribution, together with Britain as the principal partner and other members of the **British** Empire.

* With her great reserves of fighting men Britain was able to send her forces eastward to the Far East, as the **British** called it, or westward to the Middle East, as the **British** called it.

* Then came the era of great and powerful friends when we depended on the **British**, for example, in Malaysia and on the Americans in Vietnam.

* Our foreign service is modelled very much along the lines of the **British** foreign service.

* If one wishes to see the limitations of the Department of Foreign Affairs as an intelligence organisation it is only necessary for one to read the history of the **British** Foreign Office in the Second World War.

* It could operate in the same way as the **British** petroleum rent tax, that is, a flat 60 per cent tax could be imposed on gross profits followed by the 46 per cent Australian company tax.

* I will not go into it again now except to say that the **British** Petroleum Company controls 100 per cent of the Clutha Development Pty Ltd mines in the Burragorang Valley in the southern coalfields of New South Wales and that the Shell group of companies has a 50 per cent interest in such major developments as that at German Creek in Queensland.

* No concern has been registered by Shell or **British** Petroleum on this issue, which vitally affects the local community in which these mines operate.

* The **British** officials were, of course, fully apprised of Australia's policy and expressed their understanding of it.

* May I recall just two statements made not by conservative politicians but by well known **British** unionists.

* If that is not good enough, honourable members should check with Joe Gormley, the **British** miners' leader, who added that an anti-nuclear energy motion would 'send us back to the jungle'.

* Why they cannot show the courage of their **British** counterparts and let Australia meet its international obligations in responding to a world energy problem and developing a major industry will be tested by the Australian people.

* The import levy arrangements operated by the **British** Government in recent years on eggs and egg products, cereals, beef and veal, poultry meat and milk products, other than butter or cheese, were terminated on 31st January 1973.

* Fluctuations in **British** imports of cereal products could be caused by a variety of factors and it is not possible to isolate the effect of the levies.

* Information on the total value of import levies placed on Australian products under the **British** levy arrangements has not been published by **British** authorities in respect of imports either before or after the adoption of the CAP.

* It is my understanding that the previous Australian Government held consultations with the **British** Government concerning the implications of the preCAP levy schemes for Australian trade from the time that they were initially proposed and that no compensating action was taken.

* This led to a greatly increased rate of monetary expansion after 1966 and to a substantial increase in the world inflation rate, an increase which was bound to affect the **British** rate of inflation.

* Labour MPs who oppose **British** Common Market entry are claiming that a weekend speech by the Opposition leader.

* Last weekend  Mr Wilson,  the Labour Parly leader, lift open the option of opposing **British** entry into the Common Market if the terms are judged to be onerous.

* The **British** people as a whole are utterly opposed to Britain's entry.

* So I sincerely hope that my prediction at this stage will come true and that the **British** Opposition will come out in complete opposition to Britain's entry and that there will be enough anti-marketeers amongst the Conservatives to defeat the issue in the House of Commons.

* **British** manufacturing industry is notoriously inefficient.

* He said: 
Secondly, 1 wish to refer to the motor car manufacturing industry and particularly to Leyland Motors Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd formerly the **British** Motor Corporation, which is situated in my electorate.

* Will the Minister give consideration to extending the benefits of the War Service Homes Act to **British** ex-servicemen who took their discharge in Australia.

* There would still be the exceptionally expensive and lengthy process of successive appeals to the Full Court or Court of Appeal of a State, the High Court of Australia and the Judicial Committee of the **British** Privy Council.

* In the great tradition of **British** constitutional monarchy, we march still from precedent to precedent - albeit with a firmer, more selfconfident, more purposeful tread than ever before.

* I present the following paper: 

 Mr WHITLAM (Werriwa- Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs) - There is no necessity for the **British** Government to agree to a course which the Australian Government proposes to take.

* What happened was that there was a full discussion in the morning between the Lord Chancellor, the AttorneyGeneral of Britain and me and, later that afternoon, between the **British** Prime Minister and me.

* The **British** Prime Minister and **British** Ministers earlier understood the course of action that we proposed to take and the courses of action which would be open to us and open to Australian States or to any other persons with an interest to challenge what the Australian Government proposed.

* It is not necessary, as I say, for the **British** Government to agree to what the Australian Government proposes to do, but the **British** Government certainly does not demur in any way to what the Australian Government proposes to do.

* There were discussions between us as to what other courses the Australian Government could take or what other courses the **British** Government could take, but as a result of those discussions each side knew what was proposed.

* The **British** Government could, on its own, abolish appeals from Australian courts.

* The **British** Government believes - and I would agree, as I have stated in the statement - that these are matters which more appropriately would be the subject of Australian initiative.

* If that is not challenged, or if it survives a challenge, we expect that the **British** Government would carry out the corollary under section 4 of the Statute of Westminster and that it would introduce the Bill which the Australian Parliament has requested and to which it has consented.

* Agreement would not be appropriate because I would not believe it appropriate to seek, and I do not think the **British** Government would believe it appropriate to vouchsafe, agreement.

* The discussions which I initiated last December by correspondence with  Mr Heath  and by conversations with the **British** High Commissioner, which in January the Attorney-General pursued with the Lord Chancellor and the **British** Attorney-General and which then were followed by correspondence and telephone calls between  Mr Heath  and me, were consummated in the discussions that I had last Tuesday with the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister of Britian.

* 1 ) and (2) There have been several investigations on the disposal of the debris which resulted from the series of **British** atomic tests and experiments at the Maralinga area.

* After the series had been concluded, the areas involved were cleaned up in 1967 by the **British** to comply with standards set by the Atomic Weapons Test Safety Committee (AWTSC) - an Australian body.

* Britain has the **British** Petroleum organisation which has a majority ownership by the **British** Government.

* As stated in a recent report of the **British** Ministry of Overseas Development: 
I will re d briefly, because my time is limited, a few remarks from the report of  Sir George  Godber, the Chief Medical Officer of the **British** Government.

* This restriction was a legacy of **British** trade mark legislation and initially reflected the relative insignificance of business and industrial services at the date of the transfer to the Commonwealth of the power to legislate in this field.

* The limitation of the concept of registrable trade marks to marks used in relation to goods has been a continuing feature of **British** trade mark legislation which has been reflected in the corresponding Australian legislation.

* The question of the introduction in Great Britain of statutory protection for marks used in relation to services was considered by a departmental committee on **British** trade mark law and practice which was established in 1972 and reported in 1973.

* That committee received evidence from all the main organisations representing industry, trade, commerce and the professions, all of which were uniformly in favour of extending the **British** Trade Marks Act to provide for the registration of marks used for distinguishing services.

* The committee recommended inter alia, that the **British** Trade Marks Act should be amended to permit the registration of marks used, or proposed to be used, for distinguishing services offered in the course of trade or business and that the provisions relating to goods should apply so far as feasible to marks for services.

* Have Australian regulations been instituted to take the place of the **British** Foreign Awards Regulations, as his predecessor recommended to The Queen in April 1970.

* Of course, there are differences in the composition of Australian and **British** exports.

* The Government of Ghana would regard such action by the **British** Government as a racist alignment with South Africa and an  unfortunate  disregard for the susceptibilities of so many African States in Africa whose goodwill and friendship towards Britain have sustained the **British** presence in Africa over many years.

* Whatever the short term advantages the **British** Government might hope to derive from the resumption of sale of arms to South Africa or from any such conciliatory posture in its dealings with the present racist regimes in Southern Africa  could  nol be compared with the long-term benefits which the **British** people might gain in their relations wilh so many other African States.

* Let me quote from a speech made in the House of Commons on 22nd July of this year by the **British** Foreign Secretary,  Sir Alec  Douglas-Home, that great intellect who has been resurrected since the recent election of the Conservative Government.

* No-one has yet been able to explain to me how, short of a world war III this will interfere with **British** or Australian trade.

* Let me conclude by saying that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the **British** Commonwealth of Nations.

* The BTU - **British** thermal unit - content of natural gas ranges from 1050 to 1320 per cubic foot in the major producing areas which will be linked by the pipeline grid.

* Secondly, consequent upon the provisions of the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Act 1970, Part II of the principal Act is amended to redefine visiting **British** ships so as to exclude **British** ships visiting Australia in the course of an international voyage.

* This Act was the result of discussions during the years immediately after federation when At was sought to adapt existing **British** legislation to Australian conditions.

* The base legislation was the **British** Merchant Shipping Act 1894 which, in many ways, reflected attitudes at the end of the 19th century.

* However, it is a poor reflection on our Constitution and our progress as a Federation that, 76 years after attaining nationhood, our shipping industry is regulated in the main by **British** legislation drawn up to meet the needs of a 19th century colonial empire.

* At law they are **British** ships registered in Australia under the U.K.

* Yet through all these changes Australia has held fast to the principles of the 19th century **British** Merchant Shipping Act.

* Describing the argument of the Dominions as to the extent to which they were still bound to observe **British** maritime law within their own waters, he said: 
Indeed, for Australia this question is still not resolved, since ship registrations still have to be referred to the Central **British** office at Cardiff, United Kingdom, for final approval, a remnant of the 1 894 Shipping Act that infuriates some and enchants others.

* Clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill amend the definition of 'visiting **British** ships' to take into account the consequential effects of the UK Merchant Shipping Act 1970.

* The provisions of that Act extend to masters and crews of **British** ships visiting Australia in the course of an international voyage and are different from the provisions of the Australian Navigation Act.

* The amended definitions exclude from the category of visiting **British** ships those ships that have Australian connections, that are chartered or based in Australia and those ships which by regulation are declared not to be visiting **British** ships, such as vessels operated by the **British** Phosphate Commission, which are registered in London but whose operations are based on Australia.

* In the quarter of a century of its existence there has been no review of its operations and certainly no examination of the procedures which we have adopted, mainly from the **British** Foreign Office, and how these could be pertinent to the formulation and implementation of Australia's foreign policy.

* In the last 10 years the **British** Government has held 2 full scale inquiries into overseas representation.

* I understand that the **British** Government is now closing down its operations in Sumatra and it would seem to me that this is an opportune time for the Australian Department of External Affairs to take over the **British** office in Sumatra.

* Only a few days ago the **British** Broadcasting Corporation announced in its world news service that the whole concept of the Vietnamisation policy is under threat.

* The food conversion ratio test under tests conducted at Wonga last year, resulted in 1.9 lb of food to 1 lb of live gain and this reflects very creditably with tests conducted by the **British** Pig Industry Development Authority where the ratio was 3.5 to 1 and with tests in Victoria showing 4.5 to 1.

* The **British** Government also makes very large sums of money available for pig industry research, and the net result is that, there are many institutes equipped with the very best research facilities, each one staffed by experienced research workers supervising postgraduate studies by young graduates seeking their PhDs.

* As  Mr Vin  Fagan has pointed out, it was hoped that information would be available from **British** research centres, and in particular from the combined testing stations, where large scale dissection work is carried out, which would enable a system to be based on sound indices for desirable carcase quality characteristics.

* In Great Britain the **British** National Coal Board produces about 120 million tonnes.

* The basic letter rate for overseas surface mail are being increased by 2c to 7c for **British** Commonwealth, Asian and Oceanic countries and 9c for other countries.

* Britain: 8c (4.5c for **British** Commonwealth countries) 
Canada: 10c (5c for **British** Commonwealth countries) 
The view is held in some quarters that all the financial problems of the Post Office would be solved by converting it to a statutory authority.

* In this regard, I must say that the **British** Post Office which recently changed from Department of State to corporation status has found itself faced with similar problems to those confronting the Austraiian Post Office.

* The United States Post Office deficit now exceeds$A1.16 billion annually, the **British** postal service lost $A37m in 1969-70, and the Canada Post Office lost $A47m last year.

* Even the **British** law insists on 5 years separation where there is not mutual consent and 2 years separation where there is mutual consent.

* If I had stayed there a little longer I would have joined them in their demonstrations criticising the three stupid old judges who reversed the decision and who made clowns of themselves and of the **British** system of criminal justice.

* The famous **British** house of Jardine, Matheson and Co. also had this prospect of a euphoric market in China after the treaty of Nanking.

* Recently, a **British** firm- a famous toy manufacturer- indicated that it had made trade agreements with China.

* But it also means a great deal to Australia, because the export of such technology to China, with results similar to those that occurred in respect of the **British** corporation mentioned, would interrupt and overtake the development of trade between ASEAN countries and Australia.

* will the Government act &gt;'n a similar manner with the object of preventing any more takeovers of Australian companies by foreign companies and investors, whether they be **British**, American, Canadian or Japanese and thereby stop selling a bit of the farm each year to pay the rent', a remark made some years ago by the Deputy Prime Minister.

* I think my favourite quotation about a Budget is one that I came across only recently in the Economist' just after the **British** Budget had been delivered.

* It seems the concept has some elements of the **British** ready reserve and incorporates also some features of an elaborate proposal put forward by the Citizen Military Forces Association.
