## Contexts in which the word "aborigines" was used in the hofreps during the 1960s

* The other example of a committee which operated in the same way, all the members arriving at the same conclusion, was the committee which considered voting rights for **aborigines**.

* The fourth and concluding pocket of poverty which  Dr. Appleyard  mentioned was that among part Aborigines.

* I know that we need to build roads and to care for our Aborigines, but are these reasons why we should turn our eyes away from the people who hunger and die?

* The stagnation of the **aborigines** of Australia is an example of the fate of a truly socialist community.

* It was appointed to inquire into the conditions of the Aborigines at Arnhem Land.

* The Director-General, at some time in secret, made a determination which excluded Aborigines from the payment of tuberculosis allowance.

* Of course, there are Communists who will espouse any issue, such as the treatment of Aborigines, such as Australia's condoning of apartheid in international gatherings, such as Australia's tender treatment of France in respect of her atomic tests and Australia's boycott of China in respect of Chinese atomic tests.

* You have seen legislation which will probably call on Aborigines to go to war, although they are not counted in the census.

* I know there are other speakers to follow me and I do not want to trespass on their time, but before I conclude I would like to direct the attention of the Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Sinclair)  to discrimination against Aborigines in certain areas in the matter of unemployment and social service benefits.

* A similar situation is found with Aborigines who leave a settlement, for instance, in Queensland.

* The Minister for External Affairs  (Mr. Hasluck)  said that I made a personal attack on the honorable member for Moreton  (Mr. Killen),  as he himself did on the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  when the honorable member for Wills was appointed to a committee set up to inquire into the rights of Aborigines at Yirrkala.

* Only one other class of individual in Australia is treated worse than our women by this Government, and that is the **aborigines**, about whom we heard so much in the debate yesterday.

* He was responsible for extending the whole range of social service benefits to **aborigines**.

* I remember,  Sir, that  when I entered the House our Aborigines were not entitled to an age pension.

* All **aborigines** were granted entitlement to social service benefits in 1959.

* It was little surprise to me when I looked at the figures to find that there were actually fewer people in the Northern Territory, apart from the **aborigines**, than there were when New South Wales handed the Territory over to Britain which in turn handed it to the Commonwealth.

* For example, there are two amendments to the Constitution which are important to Australia in regard to the position of **aborigines**.

* I have no doubt that the passing of this bill to give all **aborigines** the right to enrol and vote if they so desire will meet with the approval of practically all those who interested themselves in this matter during the committee's investigations and subsequently.

* Personally I think the **aborigines** should have had this right years ago.

* The position is that in the States where there are the smallest numbers of **aborigines**, the right to enrol and vote has existed for many years, whilst in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, where by far the largest numbers of **aborigines** are domiciled, **aborigines** have no right to enrol except under special conditions or in the light of qualifications of the individual.

* However, quite a few **aborigines** in Western Australia, although they would welcome the right to vote and would undoubtedly qualify for and obtain citizen rights if they applied, are not prepared to apply.

* It does not include the nomadic **aborigines**.

* In addition to the 36,031 full-blood **aborigines**, there are, according to the 1961 Year Book, at least 31,000 of less than full blood.

* If we take the estimate of the Director of Native Welfare in the Northern Territory and also accept the figures given in the 1961 Year Book as to the numbers in the several States, there could be 10,300 **aborigines** eligible to vote in Queensland, 9,000 in Western Australia and 9,500 in tho Northern Territory.

* In addition to the number of **aborigines** recorded in Western Australia, 1 estimate that there would be at least 2,000 more in the nomadic and tribal state.

* Moreover, if the existing compulsory provision in New South Wales and Victoria has been satisfactory and has not caused any suffering or hardship to the **aborigines** or any major difficulties to those conducting the enrolments or the polling, it seems to me that it would be a backward step to delete that provision now and insert a non-compulsory provision in its place.

* The honorable member seemed suddenly to be very concerned whether the parliamentary representatives of the enrolled **aborigines** would pay them proper attention.

* He implied that if the **aborigines** were not properly attended to they would soon be in a position to change their representatives in this Parliament.

* In my capacity as an official of the Australian Workers Union, I have many times conducted cases for **aborigines** in order to obtain for them proper wages, conditions, compensation and other things to which I considered they were justly entitled, even though at times, perhaps, they had no legal entitlement.

* Incidentally, in the electorate of Kalgoorlie, there are some 12,000 or 13,000 **aborigines**.

* In my earlier years, I lived on the fringe of the desert where the **aborigines** were in a semi-wild state.

* I notice that, according to the statistics prepared as a result of the census, there are eight full-blood **aborigines** in the electorate represented by the honorable member for Fawkner.

* In fact, if we give the **aborigines** suitable education and then discard them and leave them to fend for themselves, we shall in many instances have created a greater problem than they would have faced by remaining uneducated.

* But this is one of the big things, Sir: Education teaches the **aborigines** to believe - quite properly - that there is no real difference between them and other people, except for their colour, and they believe - again quite properly - that their colour should not be any bar to them in their future life.

* But they are educated enough to realize before very long that the reason why they cannot get work is largely that they are **aborigines**.

* So it is not sufficient merely to educate the **aborigines**.

* Unless Australian **aborigines** were given greater employment opportunities they would never be assimilated.

* "Unless more thought is given to this matter and definite action taken, we will never assimilate the **aborigines**," he said.

* Several fullblood **aborigines** here have jobs as wharf labourers, municipal workers and truck and bus drivers.

* I think that employers are exhibiting unnecessary resistance to the employment of young **aborigines** in shops, perhaps because of the idea that they could lose custom.

* The Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  referred to possible Communist activity among the **aborigines**.

* I conclude,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  by saying that I heartily congratulate the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines on the work that it did and the report that it presented.

* The first is that this would be embarrassing to the Commonwealth in its relations with the two States that deny **aborigines**- 
Very well.

* His first objection concerns relations with the two States which deny **aborigines** the vote.

* The second ground for refusing the amendment is the fact that a select committee has been unanimously appointed to inquire into the difficulties, if any, of **aborigines** voting.

* I point out that we had resolved to oppose the reenactment of the ban on **aborigines** voting - that is, we had decided to vote against this proposed new sub-section - before the Government decided to seek the appointment of the select committee.

* Our party was faced with this position by the Government: It either had to approve a continuance of the ban on **aborigines** voting in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory or oppose it, and in those circumstances we had no difficulty or hesitation whatever in deciding to oppose a continuance of the ban.

* Western Australia and Queensland should give a vote to **aborigines**, it would be just as improper for the Parliaments of those States to say that we should deny **aborigines** the vote for our Parliament.

* Nobody but an aboriginal has ever been declared a ward and only twenty of the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory have never been declared wards.

* We can do what we like in the Northern Territory and we do not have to wait for Queensland and Western Australia to move in this matter before we can give votes for the Legislative Council of the Territory and for both Houses of the Parliament to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* As the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  said, **aborigines** have a vote for the two Houses of the Parliament only in those States where they have a vote for the lower House of the State Parliament.

* for Kalgoorlie, had brought in the ban on **aborigines**.

* In fact, the ban on **aborigines** was put into the 1918 act when Labour was not in power in either House of the Parliament.

* What the Honorable Victor Johnson sponsored by his amendment was a vote for **aborigines** if they were or had been members of the Defence Forces.

* There are, of course, difficulties in **aborigines** voting.

* I am glad that the Minister did not refer to any of the grounds that are commonly alleged as disentitling or disqualifying **aborigines** from voting.

* The difficulties in **aborigines** voting are exactly the same as the difficulties attending all outback voting.

* It is not a disability to which **aborigines** alone are subject; it is a disability to which all jackeroos and other itinerant workers are subject.

* The difficulties of **aborigines** voting attend all voting at these small, remote polling places on station properties, and that is the problem that this select committee will look into once the Government bestirs itself and appoints its members to it 
As I said before, the Afro-Asian bloc in the United Nations is not hostile to Australia.

* How dare we talk about self-determination and colonialism when we look at our **aborigines**!

* The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that if we were to count the Aborigines in Australia we would not need this amendment to the Representation Act.

* If we were to amend section 127 of the Constitution, the present figures show that the House of Representatives would have 121 seats - Queensland would lose one seat, even if the Aborigines were counted.

* Aborigines were not entitled to pensions under the Labour Government: now they are entitled to them.

* In that part of Australia there are only 18,000 people of our blood, and a growing number of **aborigines**.

* In view of his statement to the effect that section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution prevents the Commonwealth Government from discriminating against Aborigines will he ask the AttorneyGeneral to set in train an investigation of all Commonwealth legislation with a view to removing sections discriminating against Aborigines and so prevent any further embarrassment to himself?

* I shall not debate here some of the aspects of our policy towards **aborigines**, but we are a singularly homogeneous community.

* If so, will the right honorable gentleman give thought, if indeed he has not already done so, to the proposing of a referendum to the people, to be held contemporaneously with the next Senate election, in order to bring the Constitution more into line with modern requirements in regard to monetary powers and in regard to certain uncontroversial matters such as removing the apparent discrimination against **aborigines**, making provision for the appointment of parliamentary secretaries and similar uncontroversial matters of detail?

* The policy objectives then stated by the Government included an immediate firm commitment for an alumina plant in the Northern Territory of not less than 300,000 tons conditional only on the ore body proving to meet certain requirements with regard to quantity and quality of ore; provision for Australian equity participation in the project; a clear demonstration of availability of adequate market outlets and ability to organise and finance the project; a willingness by applicants to establish an aluminium smelter in the Territory when this could be done on a demonstrably economic basis; and a preparedness to respect the rights of the Aborigines in the area.

* The courts of the Northern Territory, where half the population are **aborigines**, and of Papua and New Guinea, where practically the whole permanent population are indigenous inhabitants, are operating in circumstances where Australia is judged by all its neighbours and by the world.

* They did so when considering constitutional review and voting rights for **aborigines**.

* Possibly the only point in the speech of the honorable member for Wills on which 1 can agree is his suggestion that we on this side of the House also are interested in the affairs of the **aborigines**.

* This is true, because during my predecessor's term of office great advances were made in the areas where the **aborigines** are controlled by the Commonwealth.

* The historical fact is that when the Constitution was framed it was no easy matter to take a census in which the **aborigines** were counted.

* I have heard honorable members opposite say in this House - I think the honorable member for Wills has made the statement outside the House - that cattle and sheep are counted for the purposes of annual statistics but not **aborigines**.

* Aborigines are counted, but they are not included in determining the size of the population.

* I do not know whether the community should be asked to bear such an expense simply to remove from the Constitution a section which does not affect the political status of **aborigines**.

* of section 51 the Commonwealth would have power to legislate in affairs concerning **aborigines** in the various States.

* For instance, the report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution, presented in 1929, states, in relation to this section - 
We do not recommend that section SI be amended so as to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to **aborigines**.

* We recognize that the effect of the treatment of **aborigines** on the reputation of Australia furnishes a powerful argument for a transference of control to the Commonwealth.

* But we think that on (he whole the States are better equipped for controlling **aborigines** than the Commonwealth.

* We think that a Commonwealth authority would be at a disadvantage in dealing with the **aborigines**, and that the States are better qualified to do so.

* It would be virtually impossible for the Commonwealth to enact laws which would be fair to the **aborigines** in all the States, because the conditions of **aborigines** in the various States are so different.

* Tasmania has no **aborigines**; Victoria has only about 141; and Queensland and Western Australia are the States with the largest aboriginal populations.

* Quite recently a bill was introduced in the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory for the elimination of all the discriminations against **aborigines** in that Territory, except the provisions in relation to aboriginal reserves.

* The policy of assimilation means that all Aborigines and part-Aborigines will attain the same manner of living as other Australians and live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians.

* Any special measures taken for Aborigines ana Dart-Aborigines are regarded as temporary measures, not based on race, but intended to meet weir need for special care and assistance to protect them from any ill effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will bc favorable to their social, economic and political advancement.

* What facilities are available for Aborigines at (a) Onslow, (b) Roebourne, (c) Broome, (d) Derby, (e) Wyndham, (f) Fitzroy Crossing and (g) Hall's Creek to register for employment or unemployment benefit.

* It was this Government that extended social services to Aborigines.

* We have copper deposits in the centre which were recently discovered and are being worked by Aborigines in the area, strangely enough.

* How many persons, other than Aborigines, living in (a) the Kimberley Division of Western Australia and (b) the Northern Territory were considered to be suffering from active leprosy in each year since 1955?

* Ltd. in respect of the Gove bauxite leases, so that the Parliament may assure itself that the national interest and that of the Aborigines of the Northern Territory are being fully protected?

* It might well be, too, that the Indonesian people will decide that they have rights in our section of New Guinea and might decide even to come here to liberate the **aborigines** of this country.

* Another point that should not be overlooked, because we have heard criticism from honorable members oppo site about this matter, is that **aborigines** now enjoy social service benefits which were denied them by the Labour Government.

* However, at all stages in the negotiations wilh the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. the Aborigines were consulted and the Church Missionary Society as their representative joined in the discussions with the company before the final documents were prepared.

* Copies of the lease documents could be made available to representative Aborigines at Groote Eylandt if they so wish.

* In the schools up there we see whites and **aborigines** playing together naturally.

* We have anything but an excellent record in our treatment of Aborigines.

* If one takes into account population, not merely electors, then at the June census there were the extremes between the division of Mitchell, which had in it 156,732 persons, excluding full-blood **aborigines** as the Constitution requires, and the division of Wentworth, which had in it 62,859 persons.

* If an opportunity could be provided I think the House would welcome the chance to re-state the reasons which we consider are compelling and which we believe would induce a favourable vote for the Yes cases in relation both to the nexus proposal and the proposal concerning Aborigines.

* It is just as well to remind ourselves that the people of Canberra will still be classed with lunatics, criminals, children, **aborigines** and, of course, aliens; as people without an effective voice in the national affairs of this country, and people without a say in their own process of self government.

* But the description he gave, apart from the minor amendment now made to grant voting rights to Aborigines, could still be held to reflect the opinion of the present Government so far as residents of the Northern Territory are concerned.

* I do regard the **aborigines** of the Northern Territory as people, and I think I have worked consistently for their benefit.

* As a parliamentarian with a great deal of regard for the rights of individual members, I point out that the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines, which has just been presented by the  chairman  of that committee, is a record of the activities of people who do not sit on the front benches on the Government side of the House.

* How many of the **aborigines** enrolled for the Electoral Division ofKalgoorlie who were eligible to vote at the 1963 election, and whose address was (a) Leprosarium, Derby, (b) Alice Downs Station, (c) Ord River Station, (d) Go Go Station, (e) Fossil Downs Station, (f) Christmas Creek Station, (g) Lombadina Mission, (h) Beagle Bay, Broome, (i) Table Lands Station, (j) Gibb River Station, (k) Forrest River Mission, (1) Derby, (m) Wyndham, (n) Port Hedland, (o) Roebourne, (p) Broome, and (q) Onslow, were marksmen and therefore unable to record a postal vote?

* rotation of senators, the distribution of States into electoral divisions for this House and the counting of **aborigines** in determining the number of members of this House from each State.

* Another matter which possibly ranks in importance with the New Guinea question is that of the Australian **aborigines**.

* During that discussion it was shown that representatives or members of the Communist party had published certain propaganda which indicated that the primary objection to the tests was that it would endanger Australian **aborigines**, although the real object of that party was the prevention of the project itself.

* One concerns discretionary power for magistrates in relation to the supply of liquor to **aborigines** and the other concerns lotteries and gaming.

* My question to the Minister for Territories arises from the  submission which the Commonwealth has made, presumably with the co-operation of his Department, to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in favour of introducing equal pay for Aborigines in the pastoral industry in the Northern Territory.

* As we found during the sittings of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines, the **aborigines** had a desire to adapt themselves to our way of life.

* Is his department employing **aborigines** under wages and conditions different from those applicable to other Australian workers?

* If so, what are the details of the different rates of wages paid, and where are the **aborigines** employed?

* If **aborigines** are paid at a lower rate, why is this so?

* It has been said that, either by accident or design, the court house was burned down so that the records of Australia concerning convicts and **aborigines** might not be so straight-forward when passed on by word  of  mouth instead of by the written record.

* After all, who started off owning the oil in this country, apart from the **aborigines**, who were the subject of earlier debates in this chamber to-night?

* I appreciate that the officers of the Native Welfare Department do a very good job in obtaining social service benefits for Aborigines, but they also would appreciate the advice and assistance of an officer of the Department of Social Services.

* I shall not delay the House by enumerating them, but there are such things as copyright, fisheries, defence, **aborigines**, and just terms as far as the States are concerned.

* This is the only reference made by  Mr. Khrushchev  in the fifteenth session of the General Assembly to Australian **aborigines**.

* The
              honorable gentleman will have noted that the Australian Workers Union is applying to
              the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the inclusion of full
              blood Aborigines in the provisions of the Pastoral Industry Award.

* I had the privilege of serving on the committee which inquired into the question of the voting rights of Aborigines.

* Aborigines in these and other remote areas are assisted in making application for employment or unemployment benefit by officers of the State Department who maintain close liaison with the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* How many of the **aborigines** enrolled for the Electoral Division of Kalgoorlie who were eligible to vote at the 1963 election and whose address was (a) Leprosarium, Derby, (b) Alice Downs Station, (c) Ord River Station, (d) Go Go Station, (e) Fossil Downs Station, (f) Christmas Creek Station, (g) Lombadina Mission, (h) Beagle Bay Mission, (i) Table Lands Station,(j) Gibb River Station, and (k) Forrest River Mission, did actually vote?

* The allowance is now also payable to members of the select committee consisting of members from both sides of this House on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* On the assumption that  Mrs. Priestley  has, among other things, a welldeveloped sense of feminine curiosity, will the Minister send to her a copy of the report of the all-party committee on the voting rights of **aborigines** and other relevant information so that she may gain some first-hand knowledge of the policies being pursued by the Minister, particularly in the Northern Territory?

* The advancement of Aborigines is a major feature of the Government's policy in the northern Territory and this year's provision of $7.

* I think it was hoped to provide opportunities for the employment of Australian Aborigines.

* I am not aware of any survey carried out by my own Department as to the prospect of using Aborigines for iron ore exploitation in Western Australia.

* How many **aborigines** whose address was (a) Leprosarium, Derby, (b) Alice Downs Station, (c) Ord River Station, (d) Go Go Station, (e) Fossil Downs Station, (f) Christmas Creek Station, (g) Lombadina Mission, (h) Beagle Bay Mission, (i) Table Lands Station, (j) Gibb River Station, and (k) Forrest River Mission, were enrolled and eligible to vote at the general elections of last November?

* The figures arc based on final results of the Census but are exclusive of full-blood Aborigines and of migratory' population.

* Bills to alter the Constitution in respect of Aborigines and the Parliament which were passed last year and, in connection with the latter Bill, to disclose the related distribution proposals ".

* These men have had to work in places where labour was scarce, and by humanitarian methods they have made good stockmen of **aborigines**.

* The Government's position on the reference to Aborigines in Section 51 (xxvi) has already been stated in the Parliament (see " Hansard " of 1 1th November 1965), but it will naturally receive and consider any suggestions on the subject which are made to it before the proposals are again submitted to the Parliament.

* The honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  has been very vocal about certain sections of the community which do not pay award rates to **aborigines**.

* I agree entirely with the point made by the honorable member for Fremantle that, although the intentions of this institute are academic, it will help us to handle the problems, whether they be in regard to assimilation or anything else, of our relations with **aborigines** a little better than they have been handled.

* Understanding of **aborigines** has been lacking in the past.

* For us with the **aborigines** it is now or never.

* These are only the **aborigines**; does it matter if this knowledge is lost? "

* We are not just studying **aborigines** although the **aborigines** are important people in their own right for whom we have a responsibility.

* But now we know that man is more than 1,000,000 years old and " man " includes our ancestors as well as the ancestors of the **aborigines**.

* It is, of course, wrong to think that all people throughout the world lived in the way in which the Australian **aborigines** have lived.

* Climates are different and material culture is different, but I think there is probably very great similarity between the way in which the **aborigines** and other people lived.

* I think the honorable member for Fremantle made a good point when he spoke of the way in which these studies add to the self-respect of the **aborigines** themselves.

* Even in my own limited experience in this field, when **aborigines** have come to understand that what they have is of real value it takes on, in their eyes, a new and better significance.

* Teachers for Commonwealth schools in the Australian Capital Territory and for all Commonwealth schools, other than the special schools provided for **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, are provided by the New South Wales and South Australian education authorities respectively, under arrangements which include reimbursement by the Commonwealth of the salary costs of the teachers.

* But in the first urgent short-term phase I think we must have regard to what the honorable member for Fremantle referred to as the museum activities rather than the anthropological phase of working with the **aborigines**.

* I come, particularly, to a recommendation made by the Select Committee on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserves, of which the Minister was a member.

* That recommendation, in the Committee's report issued at the end of 1 963, reads - 
It is only in recent days that I have been informed of the log of claims lodged
              by the Australian Workers Union for the inclusion of Aborigines in the Pastoral
              Industry Award.

* there is no restriction on the holding of leasehold or freehold land by Aborigines and therefore potential Aboriginal borrowers have the same types of security available to them as any other potential borrower; 
I refer, particularly, to the additional pensions payable for dependent children - not introduced until 1956; to supplement ary assistance designed to improve the circumstances of qualified pensioners who pay rent - introduced in 1958; to the extension of all social service benefits to the **aborigines** of our country - not introduced until 1959; to the merging of the means tests which brought into balance the property and income of pensioners for the first time in our history - introduced in 1960, and to the reduction of the residence qualification from the traditional twenty years to ten years for the new and naturalized citizens of our country who may apply for any of the entire range of social service benefits - not introduced until 1962.

* As a matter of fact, it is worth mentioning before we go further on the matter of the **aborigines** that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations has still not been implemented in South Australia in respect of people who are looked upon as of European origin.

* The seats are so gerrymandered that the people living in the areas of South Australia which normally vote Liberal, the farming communities- 
The tolerance shown in Darwin towards **aborigines** and the process of assimilation is unique.

* Implementation of such recommendations would mean great advancement for the Northern Territory and could possibly bring it into the orbit of the free world so that the Australians living up there - some 27,000 of them - and those very indigenous Australians, the 16,000 **aborigines** in that area, might be able to have democratic rights.

* It is envisaged that the funds available for th'e establishment of Aboriginal business enterprises from the Commonwealth Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises, the Northern Territory Aborigines Benefits Trust 
Some Aboriginal communities are already involved to some extent in the tourist industry in central Australia and elsewhere.

* For example, the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Nixon)  recently approved a loan of $14,000 from the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund to a group of Aboriginals at the Jay Creek settlement to establish a refreshment kiosk at Standley Chasm, a popular tourist venue near Alice Springs.

* The **aborigines** in India, for example, are a problem to the Indian Government, which faces some of the difficulties which we are facing in Australia.

* Going back a little in history, I find that in Africa the races corresponding to our **aborigines** - the Bushmen - met disaster at the hands of the Bantu - the black people who came down from the north.

* So the problem of an aboriginal race is not peculiar to Australia, although I think that our **aborigines** are perhaps now unique and probably one of the most interesting and, in a sense, most important groups of -people in the world.

* This does not absolve us from the responsibility of assimilating our **aborigines**.

* The conference agreed that further research was necessary into the social organization of **aborigines** and the nature of social change.

* The **aborigines** have been living in a complex environment.

* This is an achievement which none of us would like to be asked to emulate and which we probably would not be able to copy successfully with the tools and implements which the **aborigines** "have at their disposal.

* In the very difficult conditions in which the **aborigines** live, they have evolved a very complex tribal organization.

* Where we have tried putting **aborigines** on farms, we have found that they do not take to them.

* We shall handle the problems of the **aborigines** more sympathetically, more successfully and with less hurt to themselves during the period of transition if we are better informed about both the background from which the aboriginal comes and the nature of the psychological forces' which will -be at work in the making of the necessary transition.

* If this ideal is to be fulfilled, we must take steps to remove the legislation which discriminates against **aborigines** and has discriminated against them ever since federation in 1901.

* Previously **aborigines** had been denied benefits such as, for example, the age pension.

* This bill represents another attempt to eliminate discrimination against **aborigines**.

* I believe,  Sir, that  this represents another step in the integration of the **aborigines** with the rest of the Australian community.

* As I said before, the bill, which affects the conditions and wages of the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, is completely within the province of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory.

* The first referenda presented to the people should be those necessary to remove discrimination against the Aborigines.

* It would be very difficult to say under what jurisdiction these particular Aborigines come.

* Ten or fifteen years ago the only State in which there were no restrictions placed on Aborigines was Victoria; and I think it was a conservative government which amended the law and brought about that position.

* I ask the Minister for Territories whether he will arrange to have an appointment made with the honorable member for Wills so that he can point out to the honorable member that it would be much better if he cleaned up Labour's Augean stable - I refer to the apartheid policy pursued by the Australian Workers Union towards Australian **aborigines** - before he starts to criticise others.

* the consumption of alcohol by **aborigines**; 
Has the Minister for Territories considered the report of the select committee which was appointed to inquire into the grievances of **aborigines** at Yirrkala?

* But might I point out that if the Constitutional Review Committee's proposal to count **aborigines** in the census had been put to the people - and it undoubtedly would have been carried - then Western Australia and 
Natural-born and naturalised Australian and New Zealand citizens of European descent may travel freely as intending immigrants or as visitors between Australia and New Zealand without requiring a passport or prior authority to enter the other country.

* Similar facilities are available respectively to Australian Aborigines and Maoris.

* Even the Aborigines are treated less casually: they need not enrol, but once enrolled, they must vote.

* Even the Aborigines are treated less casually: they need not enrol, but once enrolled, they must vote.

* Wage rates for **aborigines** who have been declared to be wards under the Northern Territory Welfare Ordinance 1953-1960 and who are not employed under normal award conditions are determined by the Administrator of the Northern Territory under the power conferred upon him by the Wards' Employment Ordinance 1953-60.

* Wage rates and conditions of employment for **aborigines** who are not wards and for those wards who are employed under award conditions, are determined in the same manner as are those for other workers in the community.

* The Leader of the Opposition said that it is an affront to the **aborigines** that section 127 should be there, but I am quite sure that the honorable gentleman agrees with me that the fact that section 127 is in the Constitution is not in itself discrimination against aboriginal natives.

* So that to remove the words is to give the Commonwealth power to legislate throughout Australia for **aborigines** as a race.

* But by removing these words there is created a constitutional grant of power to the Commonwealth to make special laws for the **aborigines**, so that the purpose sought to be achieved would not be achieved by this means.

* But if you take out these words the essential element of discrimination remains, whether for or against the **aborigines**.

* I now draw attention to the fact that there is no need for an amendment of placitum (xxvi) to provide social service benefits for **aborigines**, as they are in fact provided for them.

* By section 109 of the Constitution the Commonwealth law would prevail, but in any event legislation by the Commonwealth would be discriminatory because it would apply to the **aborigines** as a race and in such a way that it did not apply to other people, lt would therefore constitute disdiscrimination against the aboriginal race where now there is none.

* If it exercises the power, it means that the Commonwealth's power will not only be discriminatory because it separates the **aborigines** as a race, but also by exercising the power the Commonwealth will make the legislation apply in the same way to all **aborigines** throughout the Commonwealth.

* It would defy the wit of this Parliament to contrive a piece of legislation which would serve the interests of the aboriginal natives in the north-west of Western Australia and at the same time, by the same words and through the same provisions, equally serve the interests of the **aborigines** in Victoria.

* One has to know only a little about it to realize that the problems of the Victorian aboriginal natives are vastly different from those of the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory or in north-west Western Australia.

* The section reads - 
When the Committee ceased its deliberations in 1958, it had given some consideration to the very important question as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament should have an express power to make laws with respect to **aborigines**, and representations from various quarters advocated the adoption of a recommendation to this effect.

* Again, we read in the press that the Labour Premier of New South Wales has accepted an invitation to open a swimming pool for **aborigines** at Moree.

* I remind honorable members that this is not a debate on the rights of the people to universal franchise, but on the **aborigines** in particular.

* The second Bill proposes an elimination of section 127 of the Constitution which provides that in reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, Aborigines shall not be counted when the census is taken.

* It could, at the discretion of the Parliament, be raised to 85,000 or even higher, but it could never be lower than 80,000 people - 80,000 men, women and children, natural born, naturalised, unnaturalized and **aborigines**.

* The general principle on which taxation deductions for aid gifts can be made is that the aid must be for Australia's internal purposes and to permit the development of Australian activities, for example, in respect of Aborigines, Australian cultural development, conservation of natural resources and the like.

* When we tackle the problem of the integration of these two races, we must first realise that the responsibility is on not only our shoulders but also the shoulders of the Australian Aborigines.

* We must realise that if  we  are to  bring about  any successful integration of  Aborigines with  Europeans those  in  the  majority -  the Europeans - must take the lead.

* Today we cannot say that we have Queensland Aborigines, New South Wales Aborigines or Western Australian Aborigines.

* All are Australian Aborigines.

* Section 51 of the Constitution,  if  we allow it to stay as it is at the moment, will not permit us to introduce legislation providing for definite assistance at the national level towards the welfare of our Aborigines, apart from those in the Northern Territory, as we know.

* But when we think of the education of Australian Aborigines we must think not only of reading, writing and arithmetic in our primary schools.

* Unless we correct it now, the eyes of the world will soon be turned on us and we will be held to criticism for our treatment of the Aborigines.

* The Aborigines face what is for them the immensely difficult transition from the despised shanty settlements that fringe some of our towns to secure integration and equality within the hearts of our communities.

* This Government has a strong desire to legislate on all matters that will bring about an improvement in the assistance available to our Aborigines so that in time - no one knows how long - our two peoples ultimately will be successfully integrated.

* Did he say in January, 1957, after  Mr. Grayden,  a former Liberal member of the Commonwealth Parliament, had directed attention to the abominable conditions of certain **aborigines** in Western Australia, that the Government was waiting for documentary evidence regarding the sufferings of these natives, before deciding what it should do?

* Has the Minister for Territories seen a Press report suggesting that scenes of drunken depravity have become almost nightly occurrences in Alice Springs since Aborigines have been given the right to drink liquor?

* We intend, at the same time, to present also the proposal relating to Aborigines.

* Of course, it is cheaper for these people to dig the bauxite out from underneath the peasants in Venezuela and the **aborigines** in Australia than from underneath their own farmers in France or America.

* Finally, can the Minister say generally what is the incidence of leprosy among **aborigines** in the Northern Territory compared with the incidence in other countries, and what steps are being taken by the Northern Territory Administration to treat and, if possible, eradicate this disease?

* What numbers of (a) Aborigines and (b) Torres Strait Islanders have (i) enrolled and (ii) to far not exercised their right to enroll in each of the Queensland Federal electoral divisions since voting rights were extended to these people?

* 1084, relating to the rights of Aborigines, which has appeared on the notice paper since 19th May this year?

* it is just as well to remind ourselves that the people of Canberra will still be classed with lunatics, criminals, children, Aborigines and, of course, aliens, as people without an effective voice in the national affairs of this country .

* That is, the rocket test -  was that it would endanger Australian **aborigines**, although the real object of that party was the prevention of the project itself.

* It will give me a great deal of pleasure, if I can discover the address of this very talented lady, to send her a great deal of information about the **aborigines** in Australia.

* Steps are being taken to repeal discriminatory provisions in the Australian Capital Territory legislation relating to Aborigines.

* They exclude some 5,000 Torres Strait Islanders as well as the indigenous Aborigines and part Aborigines.

* Can **aborigines** in the Northern Territory apply for voting rights under the legislation recently enacted by this Parliament?

* Can he say what action has been taken by the State aboriginal authorities to make the new provisions of the Social Services Act known to the **aborigines** under their jurisdiction?

* What **aborigines** in each State are still excluded from benefits?

* As " nomadic " **aborigines** are excluded, what is the working definition of this term?

* What proportion of the **aborigines** will be entitled to receive benefits (a) direct from the Department of Social Services and (b) only through the State aboriginal department?

* What machinery is used by the State department to pay out money received on behalf of the **aborigines** under its jurisdiction?

* What receipts are required, and what supervision is exercised over persons who receive this money on behalf of **aborigines** directly under their control?

* How many institutions, government settlements, missions, &amp;c, are receiving social service money in lump sums on behalf of the **aborigines** living in these institutions?

* A bill relating to **aborigines** is at present before the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory.

* Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration excludes Aborigines from the wage rates and terms of employment fixed for station hands under the Federal Pastoral Award?

* Aborigines in the Northern Territory and thoroughly mixed populations in the island Territories are a challenge to any judge.

* Has the Prime Minister  made his promised inquiries of the Premier of Western Australia concerning the effect on **aborigines** of poisoning waterholes in the Pilbara district, and, if so, with what result?

* Bills to alter the Constitution in respect of Aborigines and the Parliament which were passed last year and, in connection with the latter Bill, to disclose the related distribution proposals ".

* With representatives of all groups of the Yirrkala Aborigines.

* The question of rates of pay for Aborigines in Commonwealth employment is still under consideration in Canberra and Darwin.

* Among these recommendations there is another urgent proposal for the removal of that provision in the Constitution which excludes **aborigines** from the census on which the Commonwealth electoral distributions are based.

* What physical difficulties would there be in the Department of Social Services paying social service benefits directly to the **aborigines** residing in the two South Australian Government reservations of Point McLeay and Point Pearce, where, I believe, there are post offices and which are within 100 miles of Adelaide?

* Prior to the suspension of the sitting it was stated that if Aborigines had been counted as pan of the population there might very well have been no need for this amendment to the Representation Bill because a seat would have been retained in Western Australia, just as one would have been retained in Queensland.

* In addition, there are approximately 6,000 Aborigines in Western Australia, and South Australia has 4,000 to 5,000.

* If the Aborigines had been counted Queensland would have needed a population of only 4,000 more to have retained its 18th seat.

* How many Aborigines are at present employed by his Department in (a) Queensland, (b) Western Australia and (c) South Australia, and on what type of work are they engaged?

* What is the (a) text and (b) date of the Director-General's determination concerning the eligibility of Aborigines for allowances under the Tuberculosis Act?

* (b) Are there still three Aborigines receiving allowances in the Northern Territory (Northern Territory Legislative Council " Hansard ", 5th November 1964, page 2556); if not, how many are now receiving allowances?

* (c) How many Aborigines outside the Northern Territory are receiving allowances?

* (b) How many of them are Aborigines living (i) in the Northern Territory and (ii) elsewhere?

* The Opposition also points out to the Government the shocking lack of adequate finance to meet the housing needs of the nation and the Government's omission to hold a referendum to alter the Constitution to give Aborigines the right to vote and the privileges to which these indigenous people of Australia have been entitled for a long time.

* I ask: Is he aware that many **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, as a result of the under-award payments made to them - 
Are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, other than those leading a tribalised or nomadic life, entitled to repatriation pensions and benefits on the same basis as other Australians?

* Which departments have the responsibility of policing these award conditions, and how many officers from each of these departments are engaged in this function (a) as a full-time duty related to Aborigines and (b) as a part-time duly related to Aborigines and as part of a broader responsibility?

* We have been forced into this position because the governments of Queensland and Western Australia do not give full voting rights to **aborigines**.

* It is very easy to say that we are discriminating against **aborigines** simply because they are **aborigines**.

* There are relatively few problems in the other States because there are relatively few **aborigines** and therefore all these problems of the possible exploitation of natives do not arise.

* The problem of giving the **aborigines** the right to vote, and thereby rendering them liable to a fine if they do not enrol and liable to a fine if they do not vote, does not arise in the States where the **aborigines** are numerically insignificant.

* Surely Opposition members rise to the heights of political hypocrisy when they, within a few days of having conceded that there are problems which should properly be examined by a select committee, say that the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be amended in order to give **aborigines** full rights to vote, regardless of what the select committee may find.

* Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  intimated, a tremendously strong feeling that something should be done to improve the situation of the Australian **aborigines**,  Mr. Chairman,  lt does not mean that we are discriminating against **aborigines** merely because they are **aborigines**.

* In both Queensland and Western Australia, **aborigines** can obtain a vote.

* We give **aborigines** in Western Australia and Queensland the right to vote if they have not a preponderance of aboriginal blood - in other words, if they are half-castes or have less than half aboriginal blood.

* How many **aborigines** were registered for employment with the employment offices at (a) Kalgoorlie and (b) Geraldton at 30th September, 1962?

* - The honorable member for Mackellar  (Mr. Wentworth)  has reminded us that there are differences in State policies in relation to Aborigines.

* I remember that when the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines called at Woodenbong in the north of New South Wales the members of the Committee saw there a number of Aborigines who had come down from the Cherbourg native settlement in Queensland.

* That settlement was a place where, I would say, the material conditions of Aborigines by normal Australian standards for Aborigines were unusually good.

* The Aborigines in that State at that time had no sense of freedom of movement within the State; in that sense they were at that time without some aspects of independence and dignity.

* One of the men who stood for this limitation was  Sir John  Forrest who, as an explorer, had been very dependent on Aborigines to help him locate water and so on.

* When he referred to this section he said - 
I think he conceived a defensive role in relation to Aborigines, and he was not even in favour of the Commonwealth having the Authority to repatriate the Pacific Islands labourers, which was the field of power where the real interest centred in this debate at the Constitutional Convention.

* We are not proud of the Aborigines, although there are many reasons why we should be, and almost no policy exists in either the Commonwealth sphere or the State sphere of encouraging Aborigines to be proud of themselves.

* He sat down and asked them why, and they said: " You teach us about Australian explorers but you never refer to the Aborigines who we know guided them, showed them how to find water in desert places and helped them. "

* As a result this young man, whose name is Harry Venville, conducted researches into this question and was astounded to find the extent to which the statements of the Aboriginal children about the dependence of Australian explorers on Aborigines were true.

* Queensland and South Australia in the 1890s and early in this century respectively took some interest, and Queensland appointed a brilliant ethnologist, Walter Edmund Roth, whose work on Aborigines in the 1890s and early in the 20th century was a vital part of the history of this country and of the Aborigines.

* This is not to say that there were no policies; but all policies envisaged the Aborigines as potential black Europeans.

* We cannot see races, but we can now identify Aborigines as a distinctive group to whom for three years we can pay lower wages.

* We can see Aborigines when it comes to a question of wages, but we cannot see them when it comes to a question of health statistics.

* I have no doubt that in this group of Aborigines in the Northern Territory over whom one blanket definition is now thrown, some individuals are worth full wages now, but we assume that they disqualify as a group.

* But the population of Australia, according to the Constitution, includes, and I do not challenge this, all aliens in the country whether adults or infants, and excludes all **aborigines** whether they have a vote or do not have a vote.

* Again, for this purpose, aliens, infant and adult, are counted, and **aborigines**, voting or not, are excluded from the count.

* It is possible within the law to offset the effect of not counting **aborigines**.

* That is what I mean by taking quite valid legislative action which would) offset this paradoxical situation in which our **aborigines**, who can now vote, cannot be counted for the purpose of fixing electoral boundaries.

* It certainly would like the Constitution to be amended to provide for Australian **aborigines** to be counted for the purpose of determining the composition of this Parliament, but I shall not deal now with the wider aspects of constitutional reform.

* The Country Party would like the Representation Act to be amended either in a way which would have the equivalent result to counting **aborigines** or, alternatively, to provide that if there be any remainder after the divisor has been applied to the population of a State there should be an additional member.

* We need only look at the situation of our Aborigines, for instance, and the way we make decisions without consulting them, whether at Yirrkala, Gove or elsewhere.

* How often has the Committee on the Integration of Aborigines in the Northern Territory met in the last twelve months?

* It is significant that standing committees which have been set up to deal with matters such as the voting and land rights of Aborigines, for example, have produced prompt, well-informed and unanimous reports.

* Australian **aborigines** are no longer described as " natives " in Commonwealth official correspondence or documents.

* It is true that there are in various parts of Australia museum collections of material that cover various aspects of the life of the **aborigines**.

* There are now some indications that, by the turn of this century, there will be living in Australia something like 300,000 **aborigines** or people of aboriginal derivation.

* Not only from the standpoint of the importance of anthropological work to mankind generally, but also from the standpoint of the national selfrespect and cultural integrity of the Australian **aborigines**, the value of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies should be obvious.

* Not only is it necessary to preserve historical material in the interests of all mankind and in our own national interest, but also it is vitally important that anthropological information be made available to the various departments in charge of native affairs and the people responsible for the administration and well-being of the aboriginal people of Australia so that that information can be used in the best interests of the **aborigines**.

* How many **aborigines** in the Northern Territory during the past ten years have received secondary education to (a) Junior (Queensland) equivalent and (b) matriculation standard?

* We have paid attention to the health needs of the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* The **aborigines** now enjoy the best health services that they have ever had.

* A few years ago the generally held belief in Australia was that the **aborigines** belonged to a dying race, but this is not the case in the Northern Territory.

* The honorable member for Fremantle said that of the 5,000 **aborigines** employed in the Northern Territory only about 50 were paid award wages.

* The number of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory receiving award wages will vary according to the definition of aboriginal that is applied.

* This Government has set out to improve the employment opportunities for **aborigines**.

* If these efforts are successful more jobs will be available to **aborigines** and they will have greater opportunities to acquire skills.

* The **aborigines** must be trained.

* I know that in the past the Commonwealth has provided for the ordered employment of **aborigines**.

* If the Government has anything of which to be proud it is its achievements on behalf of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* Furthermore, a census has been held recently, and because of deficiencies in our Constitution we are prevented from counting **aborigines** when determining how many seats in this House should be allotted to each State.

* If we were permitted to count **aborigines**, Western Australia would not now be about to lose one of its seats in this House.

* Are these latter subjects also being taught to Aborigines by State educational authorities?

* The Government of that State does not tell only the **aborigines** that enrolment is voluntary but that, after enrolment, voting is compulsory.

* The problem in South Australia is that in the north of the State there are nomadic **aborigines**.

* Of course, if you were to enact the South Australian law throughout the Commonwealth and say to the whole community, European and aboriginal, "It is not compulsory to enroll, but if you do enroll voting is compulsory ", you would have a uniform system for **aborigines** and Europeans.

* In general, it is true to say that in New South Wales and Victoria there are no nomadic, primitive and tribal **aborigines**.

* One reason for exempting **aborigines** from the compulsion that applies to the rest of the community is that some of them are nomadic, tribal and primitive.

* It would also be absurd to chase tribal **aborigines** through the bush with ballot boxes.

* The Minister for the Interior has said truly that, in the past, members of the Labour Party and Government supporters have deplored the fact that **aborigines** who travel from Western Australia into New South Wales and Victoria receive the vote, but if they go back to Western Australia they are taken off the Commonwealth roll.

* However, there are not many **aborigines** who move interstate.

* At Woodenbong, the **aborigines** were left entirely to their own devices by the Government of New South Wales.

* We think it is vitally important to ensure, as far as possible, that differentiation in the franchise will not be racial but will rest on the practical grounds that some **aborigines** are primitive and nomadic and could not justly be compelled to enroll and to vote.

* I should like to exonerate the Minister from my colleague's charge that he is not known by the **aborigines**.

* Some of the **aborigines** in his electorate spoke to me about him.

* .- I address a question to the Attorney-General  (Sir Garfield Barwick)  in relation to the **aborigines** of Australia and their marriage ceremonies and customs.

* As far as I can determine,  it  has not been the custom for marriages of **aborigines** to be recorded adequately.

* Therefore, doubt sometimes exists as to whether **aborigines** are legally married.

* T understand that, in many instances, there has not been an adequate record of marriages of **aborigines**, even in places where you would expect it, such as remote mission stations.

* Will the Attorney-General explain the position of **aborigines** as a result of this legislation?

* One purpose of the education system in the Northern Territory is to give an adequate education to the **aborigines**.

* The matter we are debating now relates primarily to the wages and conditions of employment of Australian **aborigines** in the military and civil services of the Commonwealth and by private industry.

* It also relates to social service benefits paid to Australian **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* He mentioned the benefits paid to **aborigines** for tuberculosis and the benefits paid by my department for unemployment.

* The qualifying conditions for the payment of the tuberculosis benefit arc exactly the same for **aborigines** as for other persons.

* Aborigines receive the benefit, but naturally if they are maintained in institutions - this includes **aborigines** on welfare settlements - the payment is not made to them.

* The principle is one of nondiscrimination between Australian **aborigines** and other people resident in the Territory.

* Let me go back to the substance of the debate, which is the policy of the Commonwealth insofar as it relates to wages and conditions of employment of **aborigines**.

* The effect of that act was to take away the position of the **aborigines** as wards of the Administration in the Northern Territory and to give to them citizens' rights the equivalent of any person born in any State of the Commonwealth.

* There were so many different characteristics and so many different types of **aborigines** that it was realized that it would be impracticable to attempt to apply the provisions of the Commonwealth 
My colleague, the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes),  has been good enough to allow me to examine the file.

* The document sets out the views of the Government and the Department of Territories on the method of approach and the changes that ought to be made in order to secure wage and salary justice for **aborigines**.

* I can say that if honorable members study the various types of **aborigines** in the Territory they will find that there are some who comply with award conditions and receive award payments, lt is true that they are not great in number, but there are some.

* The great bulk of **aborigines**, who are on the missions and the stations, are not covered by an award.

* The circumstances mentioned by my colleague show that you cannot apply award provisions automatically to Australian **aborigines**.

* However, many **aborigines** may be nomadic and may not want to settle down in a particular place.

* My colleague has therefore suggested that instead of the **aborigines** being compelled to organize, the commission or some person appointed by the commission should have power to initiate applications to the commission either for an award, or for a variation of an award, if one exists.

* Secondly, it has been thought wise in all the circumstances that if we can introduce a system which will permit appeals from the decisions of an inspector or of an individual appointed by the commission to make an award or make a particular award payment to the individuals, that the appeals should be permitted to the commission or to somebody appointed by the commission in order to ensure justice and fairness for the **aborigines**.

* How many **aborigines** are employed by the Northern Territory Administration?

* How many Aborigines are employed by his Department other than as soldiers?

* I thought it had something to do with **aborigines**.

* 3.If so, what is the reason for Australia's refusal to ratify the Convention, particularly now that the Australian Constitution has been amended to give the Australian Government complete powers to make lawsin respect of Aborigines?

* In view of the likely acceptance of that recommendation, and in view of the fact that full political rights in the federal field have recently been granted to all Australian **aborigines**, will the Minister set up an all-party select committee of this Parliament to inquire whether the citizens of the Northern Territory are yet considered responsible and intelligent enough to have their political status raised to the level of the indigenous people of New Guinea, the aboriginal people of the States of Australia, naturalized new Australians and other citizens of the Commonwealth?

* What sum will Queensland lose in the year 1964-65 because Aborigines are not numbered in the census and taxation reimbursement is affected accordingly?

* This is a proposal from a member of the Government benches to rectify what is a very grave blot on this country  - the  lack of real policy towards Aborigines in spite of all the bluffs and facades by any Australian government, State or Federal to this minority of people in Australia.

* Each has a post office and the **aborigines** living on those stations who are entitled to pensions are in all cases educated, civilized and Christians.

* Has his Office carried out a survey to ascertain what number of Aborigines are employed in industries, other than the pastoral industry, in the north and north-west of Western Australia.

* Has his office taken any steps to encourage the employment of Aborigines in the other industries referred to.

* The referendum will also seek the repeal of section 127 of the Constitution which relates to the non-counting of Aborigines in reckoning the number of people in the Commonwealth.

* There are many people who are concerned about section 51 (xxvi) under which the Federal Government is denied the right to make laws governing Aborigines and which, therefore, provides the basis for the various discriminatory law.

* For 50 years, successive governments believed that the **aborigines** could not be provided for.

* The first is a brief response to a statement made about an organisation called the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, of which I am Senior Vice-President, and the news items that have been used in this House about the resignation of one of its vicepresidents.

* I think the honorable member used the expression " digging out bauxite from under the **aborigines**".

* They are not being dug out from under the **aborigines**.

* They are mainly in the forest country- 
In every sphere of its administration this Government makes no distinction against Aborigines.

* I shall look into the suggestion concerning Aborigines throughout Western Australia and the north of Australia who possibly are not receiving their entitlements; but I cao assure the honorable gentleman that every effort has been made by the Department in the past to bring to persons who are eligible an awareness of the benefits to which they are entitled and of the manner in which they should apply for them.

* The other purpose of this Bill is to change the name of the Wards Benefits Trust Fund, which is established by section 21 of the Act, to the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund.

* I might explain here that the only persons in the Territory who were declared to be wards under the legislation of the time were Aborigines.

* It is necessary therefore to change the present name of the Fund, and to direct that payments from the Fund shall be made to or for the benefit of Aborigines.

* The provisions of this Bill, other than those which I have already explained which relate to the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund, give effect to this proposal.

* As these people are educated and fully civilized members of the Australian community, will the Minister give an assurance that **aborigines** such as these will in future be paid their full pension in cash in order that they may spend it in their own way, just as other pensioners may?

* Is it correct that the death-rate of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory rose from 16.7 per 1,000 in 1957 to "19.7 per 1,000 in 1958, the last year for which figures are available, while the infant mortality rate of the **aborigines** increased during the same period from 81 per 1,000 to 138 per 1,000?

* The electoral records do not distinguish between Europeans and **aborigines** but the following is an estimate of the number of **aborigines** enrolled and eligible to vote, viz.

* I must confess to the honorable gentleman that I had forgotten the question he raised regarding a survey of Aborigines to determine whether they could be usefully employed in iron ore mining.

* I have pointed out on several occasions that I think Aborigines will in the future provide a suitable source of supply of labour.

* Another point I want to emphasize - it has been mentioned before - is that when we talk of " **aborigines** " we are using a term which has not a single meaning.

* The trend of this debate has made it clear that we are not thinking of those hundreds of **aborigines** who are already living a normal life, with the full acceptance of the community.

* It is not sufficient to do those things if, having done them, you do not also then provide the **aborigines** with the means to support themselves in the new way of life to which they have advanced.

* I have told trade unionists in the Northern Territory that the way in which they can help these people is to make **aborigines** whom they regard as having the same level of skill, the same training and the same capacity as any other Australian, members of their unions and parties to the awards which the unions have obtained for their members.

* I have told the trade unionists that they should ensure that the **aborigines** get the award rates that have been obtained by the trade union movement through the ordinary Australian industrial arbitration processes.

* Aborigines should share in all the benefits that our Australian industrial system gives to every trade unionist in Australia.

* Administratively, then, our only concern is with those **aborigines** who, because of lack of inclination in some cases, lack of skill or training, or failure to achieve the general way of life that allows them to work alongside other Australians on precisely the same terms, need special conditions to be made for them.

* From time to time in the Northern Territory, progressive increases have been made in award rates to suit the case of particular classes of **aborigines**.

* Finally, I want to refer to one passage in the proposal before the House which makes reference to the armed services, and to inform honorable members that **aborigines** enlisted in the armed services receive pay and conditions identical with those of other 
Australian servicemen.

* Some **aborigines** employed by the armed services in civil capacities in the Northern Territory receive remuneration at rates fixed by the Northern Territory Administration because they work at a level of output and skill lower than that of the general Australian workman.

* The current minimum rates in the armed services for such **aborigines** are approximately 6 10s.

* If **aborigines** have some special skill, such as the capacity to drive a lorry they are paid an extra 1 10s.

* In the last day or so, 1 have received from the Northern Territory a fetter addressed to me in my capacity as Vice  President  of the Federal Council for Advancement of Aborigines.

* The letter is written by Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* The main areas in which payments for Aborigines are affected in these ways are the central and northern parts of Western Australia, the northern paris of Queensland and South Australia, and Northern Territory.

* The Constitutional Review Committee, I understand, has recommended that **aborigines** be counted in the next census.

* Will the right honorable gentleman take steps to ensure that **aborigines** in Australia will be included in the census to be taken in 1961?

* My question, which is addressed to the Prime Mininster, relates to the widespread request for an amendment of the part of section 51 of the Constitution which refers to Aborigines.

* Will the Minister for Social Services explain to the House why he has directed his department, in conjunction with the Department of Health, to refrain from paying tuberculosis allowances to **aborigines** at the same rates as they are paid to other Australians?

* How can the Minister justify that discrimination in view of the fact that only five or six years ago he announced with some pride, if I recall his words correctly, that **aborigines** would receive the same social service benefits as other Australians receive?

* .- I  should like to ask the Attorney-General  (Mr. Snedden):  What is the position in relation to the request for a referendum on section 127 and section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution and in relation to the request for a review of the Aborigines Welfare Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory, which is out of keeping with the provisions of the Northern Territory ordinance on Aborigines?

* How many of the 103 Aborigines registered for employment at Port Hedland during the twelve months to 28th June 1968, were found employment with (a) State and (b) Commonwealth Departments, and what was the number found in each Department.

* Has the Prime Minister seen a report that water tanks and troughs throughout the north of Western Australia have been poisoned with arsenic as part of a water-poisoning campaign against kangaroos, and that there is a great danger to the nomad **aborigines** who roam this area, who cannot read the warnings inserted in the press even if they could obtain newspapers?

* Will the Prime Minister make urgent representations to the Premier of Western Australia to see that every possible action is taken to prevent a tragedy which could occur if the **aborigines** should drink from these tanks and troughs?

* The Labour Party was in office for eight years and did nothing for the Aborigines.

* I read in this morning's newspapers that there are to be two swimming pools, one for white people and one for **aborigines**, in Moree, in the electorate of the honorable member for Gwydir  (Mr. Ian Allan).

* Not long ago - within the past fortnight - the Opposition supported a move to appoint a select committee of this chamber to inquire into the vexed problem of voting rights for **aborigines**.

* To-night, we find that they are trying to remove portion of a section of the act which gives a vote to certain **aborigines**.

* If the Labour Party had had any real intention of doing something for the unfortunate **aborigines**, it would have done so then when it had the opportunity.

* ), and the provision about **aborigines** is now to be altered to section 39, sub-section (6.

* ), but not one word in respect of the **aborigines** is being altered by this Government.

* When it was thought that some move might be made in respect of the **aborigines**, the Government suggested the appointment of a select committee.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  became confused when speaking on this matter to-night, and I do not wonder that the **aborigines** are confused.

* During the morning tea break, I said to those people who were putting forward the case of the **aborigines**, " How far afield have you been on the question affecting these natives?"

* Members of the Labour Party who were on the committee were told by representatives of these people that the Labour Party need not think that it would catch all the votes by pandering to the **aborigines**.

* They have run this way for a moment and have then dashed off at a tangent somewhere else, the whole time thinking that they would capture the vote of the **aborigines**.

* They are trying to create a disturbance in the minds of people who are honestly, though perhaps misguidedly, trying to do something for the **aborigines**.

* Finally, we must remember this: Until the Constitution is altered, the State governments have some responsibility for the **aborigines**.

* I have previously announced the conditions which successful applicants will have to observe, one of which concerns the protection of the interests of Aborigines.

* We expect these conditions to be complied with - in fact, we insist that they be complied with, particularly those relating to the Aborigines.

* Is he aware that in the Northern Territory, Commonwealth departments employ **aborigines** at less than award rates?

* As this is the concern not of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, but of this Parliament, will he say whether he is in favour of the Common  wealth paying full rates to, and observing award conditions for, **aborigines** employed by Commonwealth departments?

* It cannot be denied that certain of our laws discriminate against **aborigines**.

* The **aborigines** feel that we do not want them to become useful citizens.

* However, it is interesting to note that in some parts of this country endeavours are being made to ameliorate discrimination towards **aborigines**.

* New South Wales has decided to permit **aborigines** to consume intoxicating liquor.

* Whether that decision is in the interests of the **aborigines** only time will tell.

* against **aborigines** as human beings.

* Last year, the Minister for the Interior established a committee of seven members of this House to inquire into the voting rights of **aborigines**.

* Acting on the recommendations of that committee the Government has brought down legislation to give **aborigines** full voting rights.

* It proclaims to the world that we do not count **aborigines** as human beings.

* How absurd for this Government to give votes to **aborigines** but not to count them in the census 
Section 24 of the Constitution prescribes the formula for determining the number of members to be elected in each State.

* But if **aborigines** had been counted as members of the population, Western Australia and Queensland would have retained their present number of seats in this House.

* That illustrates how absurd it is to give **aborigines** a vote but not to count them as members of the population.

* Nobody could quarrel with the statement made by the Minister for the Interior when introducing the bill to give voting rights to **aborigines**, but how could anybody making such a statement say that there is no urgency about the abolition of section 127 of the Constitution?

* Aborigines should be counted as human beings.

* Why, we even count our cattle and sheep, but we do not count **aborigines**.

* At a time when we are trying to improve our relations with the world's coloured people how dastardly it is for us to go overseas and say that we do not count our **aborigines** as part of the population!

* He has pointed to the fact that these different forms of usage can be confusing but I think that in the final analysis he would agree with me that what the Aboriginals or the Aborigines will be primarily concerned with will be the action we take in the future to promote their welfare.

* I thank the honorable member for the information he has given regarding the wages paid to **aborigines**.

* These wages at present are determined by the Administration, because in many cases the **aborigines** employed are slow workers.

* Mr. Speaker,  the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  seemed to become very annoyed at my interjection when he made the suggestion that a certain person in England should pay extra wages for Aborigines out of his own capital.

* .- The Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  ignores the fact that **aborigines** in Australia receive a vote for this Parliament, not because of the actions of this Parliament, but despite them.

* The only provision in Commonwealth law enabling **aborigines** to vote for members of this Parliament is that which gives the vote to those who have served in the defence forces.

* In fact, in those States in which **aborigines** have the vote - New South 
I do not believe that this Parliament can, in honour, allow to be perpetuated this discriminatory provision in its legislation.

* The Minister has chosen to bring down an amendment of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in which this provision is specifically included, removing some of the people from its ambit who beforehand could not vote but leaving the **aborigines** under it.

* I did not vote against it, because I regarded the actual stepping up to the table of a Minister of the present Government, and his admission that something ought to be done about the voting rights of **aborigines**, as a major break-through.

* I say that the select committee may well carry on with its duties and find how it may prevent anomalies, and the subversion of secret voting, and so on; but the general principle of the vote for the **aborigines** has been accepted by the Australian people.

* If he gave voting rights to many of the **aborigines** of the Northern Territory, provided they had European ancestry, why will he not give them the same voting rights if they step across the border into Queensland?

* As the law stands, if **aborigines** leave the Territory, which is under the Minister's control, and go to Queensland, they lose the right to vote.

* Why does the honorable member for Barker  (Mr. Forbes),  who comes from South Australia, not wish to give **aborigines** from Western Australia the same right to vote in Commonwealth elections as the **aborigines** in South Australia have?

* Why is not the honorable member for Perth  (Mr. Chaney),  who spoke earlier to-day and charged us with lack of sincerity, prepared to give the **aborigines** of Western Australia the voting rights that **aborigines** in South Australia have?

* Some **aborigines** have it, but thousands have not.

* You can find thousands of **aborigines** all over Australia who are literate, self-possessed, and capable of looking after their own affairs, who are deprived of the vote.

* If this is to be a sovereign parliament, if it is to make its own decisions, if the electoral laws are its responsibility, then we must face up to 0 Lir responsibility, lt is a simple fact that if the Queensland Government or the Western Australian Government to-morrow gave **aborigines** the right to vote they would be entitled to vote also at the next Commonwealth elections.

* How many **aborigines** are receiving age or invalid pensions in the districts of (a) Kalgoorlie,  (bi  Geraldton, (c) Port Hedland, (d) Broome, (e) Derby, (f) Laverton, (g) Wiluna, (h) Meekatharra and (i) Cue?

* Win  the Minister for Territories inform the House of the effect of a decision reported to have been made in Darwin that **aborigines** under the age of fifteen years and over the age of  65  years will not be declared wards of the state?

* Does this decision affect the entitlement of **aborigines** to social service benefits?

* I have read the file relating to the confinement of two **aborigines** in the Fannie Bay gaol that was sent to me by the Department of Territories.

* The **aborigines** were taken from the East Arm Leprosarium and placed in the gaol because they had committed criminal offences within the leprosarium itself.

* Are **aborigines** eligible for appointment to the Australian diplomatic service?

* In the Federal Pastoral Industry Award Aborigines are excluded from the definition of " Station hands" used for the purpose of this Award.

* Twenty-seven Aborigines are employed by the Northern Territory Administration.

* In addition, 1,337 Aborigines on government welfare settlements receive payments in connection with measures for their training or sustenance; some ' of these are employed as staff members.

* One of its recommendations was that **aborigines** be counted in the census, but the Treasurer was not aware of that fact although it is under consideration.

* Why does the Army pay smaller wages to **aborigines** than to its other civilian employees in the Northern Territory, when it gives the same pay and 1 allowances to aboriginal soldiers as to other soldiers without discrimination?

* In speaking against the motion I should like to say that I appreciate the sincerity of the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  in his efforts to advance the Aborigines.

* We believe that it is important they should take an interest and active part in State type activities 
The honorable member for Fremantle is concerned that the local attitude to Aborigines may be a factor and that the Aborigines may not get a fair hearing.

* I point out that the Aborigines in the Northern Territory now have the vote and that the elected members of the committee on integration are subject to the vote of the Aborigines.

* The committee, which is responsible for the wellbeing of Aborigines, should be sensitive to their views.

* I believe that challenge must be accepted by everybody concerned - the Government through its Welfare Branch, our mission as such, the mining company and the Aborigines themselves.

* I recollect a union official from the Northern Territory giving great approbation to what has been done in regard to opportunities for employment of Aborigines in this area.

* My last figures in relation to the employment of Aborigines in the mining of manganese at Groote Eylandt by the Broken Hill Pty.

* Co. Ltd. show that approximately 30 Aborigines are being paid full award wages.

* These are the welfare conditions relating to the Groote Eylandt Aborigines and the mission.

* These conditions were written into the lease - 
to consult with the Administrator and representatives of the Aborigines residing on Groote Eylandt and of the Society before designating an area a restricted area for the purpose of the last preceding paragraph; 
to erect fences that are necessary for safety purposes, including such fences as are deemed by the Administrator, after consultations with representatives of the Aborigines residing on Groote Eylandt and of the Society, to be necessary; 
The lessee will be granted such leases of land and rights tinder the appropriate legislation to take water, timber, stone, sand, lime and other materials, except those which can be readily supplied on reasonable terms and conditions by the Church Missionary Society or the Aborigines, as the Minister or the Administrator is satisfied are reasonably required to be granted to the lessee for its purposes.

* However, it might be of interest to honorable members to have on record the provisions in relation to the welfare of Aborigines and the Church Missionary Society.

* These are-- 
Having regard to the special problems affecting the general welfare of Aborigines and the work of the mission in relation thereto, the lessee will consult with and have regard to the views of the Aborigines, the Church Missionary Society and the Director of Social Welfare before it applies for special mineral leases or any other appropriate lease.

* In determining its employment policy in relation to Aborigines, the lessee will have regard to normal industrial principles and the extension of conciliation and arbitration machinery to Aborigines.

* The lessee, wherever possible, will make use of normal on-the-job training and apprenticeship schemes as a means of training and employing Aborigines to the extent practicable.

* If the lessee employs Aborigines it will accept in principle the preservation as far as practical of the family unit, so that employees will either live on the mission while working for the lessee or be provided by the lessee with suitable housing units of a standard applicable to similar classes of employees.

* In the latter case the mission authorities will continue to have full access to the Aborigines and their families for spiritual, physical and social welfare purposes.

* The lease has not yet been formally signed, but all the measures I have mentioned to safeguard the situation of the mission and the Aborigines will be repeated in that agreement.

* This operation is working splendidly.. 
We are keeping in touch with the Aborigines in this area.

* Information I received some weeks ago is as follows - 
The views of the Aborigines have in the past been sought in relation to decisions which may affect their welfare and this practice will be continued ... the Administrator has personally kept in close touch with the Yirrkala people and has made a number of visits there during which he conferred with the Aboriginal Council.

* The Aborigines expressed their agreement with what had been done to look after their welfare and interests.

* Was the number of 103 Aborigines who registered for employment at Port Hedland during the 12 months to 28th June 1968, the total number of Aborigines who applied.

* I am sure that the honorable member for Fremantle remembers as well as I do how he and I formed the drafting committee for the report that was presented by the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* The report reads - 
Over the past five years the majority of the remaining nomads have, of their own volition, come to the settlements and missions scattered throughout the Commonwealth and your Committee considers that there are now fewer than 2,000 **aborigines** living in their traditional tribal cultures, out of contact with European civilization.

* Your Committee believes that integration does not necessarily mean the loss of aboriginal tribal culture or a division in tribal relationships but, however desirable it may be in theory to endeavour to preserve the tribal form of society, it is abundantly clear to your Committee that the tribes themselves are making continuing voluntary contact with European civilization and that in the course of a few years there will be no **aborigines** living in the completely tribal state.

* The **aborigines** need a considerable capital investment in education, including technical and agricultural education, in industries, land tenure and housing.

* The aim then, in order to set the **aborigines** aside and protect them and prevent their numbers decreasing, was a policy which had advantages because, as we well know, the number of aboriginal people has increased, particularly during the last ten years, and is increasing rapidly.

* Rather we regard **aborigines** as complete Australian citizens.

* It will be of tremendous benefit to the **aborigines** in this area in providing direct employment, training in new skills and in making available new markets for the results of their fishing, agricultural and pastoral activities.

* There has been exploitation of **aborigines** by good union shearers in very direct personal ways with regard to aboriginal women, just as there has been exploitation of natives in New Guinea by the owners of plantations.

* I refer to the provision that a referendum should be held to repeal section 127 of the Constitution which prevents Aborigines from being counted for the purposes of determining the population of the Commonwealth.

* Had the Aborigines of Western Australia and Queensland been included in the census of 1961 Queensland would not have lost a seat and Western Australia would not have lost a seat under the later proposals.

* At paragraph 345 the Committee said - 
The honorable member for the Northern Territory and the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  mentioned the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund.

* I might add that the Administrator of the Northern Territory visited Yirrkala the other day, when this matter was brought up by the local Aborigines.

* Government aid to Christian missions in their work among the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory is provided for in the Budget recently introduced, and the amount of assistance for this financial year will be about 750,000.

* For example, a subsidy of a fixed amount will be given for each trained teacher or trained nurse employed, or for a tradesman or artisan engaged in giving technical or agricultural training to the **aborigines**.

* I know that we would not want to have them discussing at length the status of the **aborigines**, although if they did it might provide quite a stimulus for us to change that status.

* As the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  has said, section 127, which prevents the Aborigines being counted among Australian citizens in census taking, is completely foreign to our concept of right and dignity.

* Even the undoubted difficulties involved in taking a proper census among Aborigines that existed at the beginning of the century did not, 1 think, provide an adequate justification for its adoption then nor would they provide an adequate justification for its retention in 1965.

* In his second reading speech the Prime Minister explained why, in his view, the proposal should not be extended to deal with section 51 (xxvi) which prevents the Commonwealth Parliament from passing special laws for Aborigines.

* As I understood the right honorable gentleman, he believes that to give this Parliament a specific power to legislate for Aborigines would itself be a form of discrimination.

* I do not believe, nor does any other member of this Parliament believe, that one Australian worthy of the name will deliberately vote against this proposal to recognise Aborigines as what they are, and for what they are - Australian citizens who should be counted as Australians.

* To the best of my knowledge, it is not a fact that the Commonwealth makes some payments to South Australia and Western Australia in respect of **aborigines** and does not make similar payments to Queensland.

* We have liberalized payments to **aborigines** over the years under the social services legislation.

* It is possible that payments made currently by the Western Australian Government in respect of **aborigines** as well as other persons are taken into account by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in determining the overall grant which it will recommend for that State.

* It was on the initiative of the Labour Party that select committees were set up to deal with voting rights and land tenure for **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* Some years ago I visited Weipa with other members of the Select Committee on Voting Right's of Aborigines.

* For a long time now we have been trying to get from the Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Roberton)  a clear statement as to the arrangement between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government in relation to the payment of age and invalid pensions to **aborigines** living in mission stations and on Government reserves.

* Each time the question is raised the Minister begins his reply by stating the fact that for 52 years no government did anything about the .**aborigines**.

* Now that something is being done, I hoped that it would be done in a way that would give to the **aborigines** - for whose benefit, one would imagine, the action has been taken - the maximum benefit.

* One would imagine that we were talking about tribalized natives running around with boomerangs and spears on the Nullarbor Plain and the Musgrave Ranges, and not about the **aborigines** who are living on Government reserves and in mission stations throughout Australia.

* I am certain that the Government does not know what is going on in regard to the payment of social service benefits to **aborigines**.

* All that I am asking the Commonwealth Government to do - and as I say, T am glad that the Minister for Labour and National Service, a senior Minister, is here to-night and is listening to my remarks - is simply to request that the money which it is making available for this purpose be paid direct to the **aborigines** concerned, as social service benefits are paid to white pensioners in Australia 
I direct a question to the Minister for Territories.

* Has the attention of the Western Australian Government been drawn to the position of Western Australian Aborigines described by the Minister yesterday as being people amongst whom " malnutrition is a very serious matter ", and suffering from " a severe shortage of food and water ", and with " malnutrition existing amongst their children "?

* In view of the fact that Aborigines in the same drought stricken area constantly move away from Department of Supply patrols, as described by the Minister for Supply in a letter dated 5th August to the honorable member for Fremantle, has the possibility that they also suffer from malnutrition been taken into account?

* May this be taken to presage Commonwealth action to assist Aborigines in the States?

* When the Prime Minister is inquiring of the Western Australian Premier whether there vs a direct danger of the poisoning of waterholes resulting in the poisoning of aboriginal people, will he also inquire about the effect on the aboriginal people in that district, where game and water are scarce, of the destruction of the **aborigines**' only sources of protein - wild turkeys and kangaroos - and of their being deprived of their scarce sources of water?

* I cannot agree, however, that it is to be deduced from this incident that appropriate care can be provided for **aborigines** within the States only if power over, and responsibility for, their welfare is transferred from the States to the Commonwealth.

* When an epidemic of measles breaks out among Aborigines in the Northern Territory adults and children alike die like flies.

* Another dangerous disease among Aborigines is gastro-enteritis.

* So the infant mortality rate among Aborigines in the Northern Territory is not unique, although it may be unfortunate.

* I have not had an opportunity to consider the whole judgment, but I point out to the honorable member that at all times the wellbeing of the Aborigines is of great concern to the Department of Territories.

* It is obvious that all Aborigines will not be employed on cattle stations.

* The Aborigines consider that these provisions are discriminatory.

* The Attorney-General thinks that these provisions were inserted for the benefit of the Aborigines.

* Social service payments are made to qualified aboriginal natives in missions in the States in the way that is considered can best serve the interests of the **aborigines**.

* ls he able to say whether the incidence of leprosy amongst Aborigines in the Kimberley Division of Western Australia is higher than anywhere else in the world?

* The conditions generally are that we require maximum Australian equity in investments, that we receive a commitment for immediate operation and exploitation, that the rights of the Aborigines will be protected and that a plant capable of treating about 300,000 tons of alumina be provided for these operations.

* The first relates to the census, and the other deprives **aborigines** of Commonwealth action on their behalf.

* I ask the Minister whether **aborigines** may register for employment with the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* What particular efforts are made to obtain suitable employment for young **aborigines** who are anxious to take their place in the Australian community?

* As our policy is not to discriminate between **aborigines** and other children in the normal administration schools and as some aboriginal children from the Territory have been transferred to the southern States it is impossible to give complete figures.

* In view of the meritorious record of the Commonwealth in the control of its Territories and the official policy of constantly endeavouring to raise the standard of the aboriginal people for whom, in the eyes of the world, Australia as a nation is responsible, has the Government considered obtaining from the States the full power to determine and administer policy for the care of the **aborigines**?

* The facts are simply these: In the provisions of the federal award relating to the pastoral industry the **aborigines** are expressly excluded.

* Honorable members opposite talk about assimilation of the **aborigines**, about our being one people and all the rest of it - but the rates of pay for **aborigines** is one of their responsibilities.

* Honorable members would find it worth-while to obtain a copy of the Wards Employment Ordinance which shows the rates paid to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* It is a simple fact that about 5,000 **aborigines** in the.

* There can be no raising of the whole standard of the Northern Territory until that half of the population who are **aborigines** are living on the same standards and being paid the same rates as the rest of the population.

* It is a tragic fact that if the **aborigines** went on to full unemployment benefit they would be getting more than they now get from the wages they are paid.

* It is a fact also that in the Northern Territory many people are retiring and going on to the age pension - Australians, old men, **aborigines** and therefore black - and are receiving more in pension than they got for working.

* Cases have been brought to my notice of employers who have received more in child endowment for the children of their aboriginal workers than they paid the **aborigines** in wages.

* Of course, some **aborigines** are not like this, but many of them are much more stable than the honorable member for Ballaarat.

* that the honorable member for Ballaarat is one of them - who think that **aborigines** ought to be discriminated against.

* 387 Aborigines well-fed, generally content'.

* In an editorial on 8th February the Courier-Mail' referred to what it described as the 'Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs' and stated: 
I wish to ask the Minister for Territories whether his recent statement concerning the Government's intentions with regard to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory related also to the payment of award rates to **aborigines** employed by the Commonwealth and the extension of the protection of awards to **aborigines** in private employment.

* How many Aborigines from each State attended the Commonwealth Conference held in Canberra on 15th-16th March 1969?

* By way of preface I remind the Minister of a question I asked concerning the payment of social service benefits to **aborigines** in mission stations and on government reserves.

* Aborigines were not eligible for pensions under the Chifley Labour Government.

* I believe the Government ought to recognize that the Labour Party may be prepared to enact a law now to confer voting rights on **aborigines**, but as the Government is the government of this country and has a very large majority in this chamber, if the tempo of the Government's reform is to be the tempo of the select committee, how foolish we would be not to be represented on the select committee.

* The honorable member for Moreton  (Mr. Killen)  has spoken of primitive **aborigines**.

* There are many people in Western Australia, classified as **aborigines**, who are people of mixed European and aboriginal race, living around towns like Katanning in the Minister's electorate- 
That may be so.

* I know that, as a lawyer, he was a very important friend of the people classified as **aborigines** in Western Australia who were of mixed race and some of whom had rather a tough time from the police under the laws of that State.

* Members know how impossible the position is in areas where it is considered that citizenship rights for **aborigines** - as in Western Australia - have almost come to mean the right to drink rather than the right to vote.

* But 1 do not think that even if we enacted a law and enabled every aboriginal to vote, any Commonwealth authority would be stupid enough to prosecute all those **aborigines** who did not vote.

* There are some very highly educated **aborigines** in Western Australia who have refused to apply for Australian citizenship because to obtain it they must go to the State Government and make application, and they regard that as an insult.

* I am afraid that the Press statement referred to by the honorable member was very unfair to the Aborigines.

* Apparently a certain person with a camera was looking for something that he could photograph and describe as  a  sensational incident concerning Aborigines drinking in Alice Springs.

* The position wim regard to Aborigines drinking in the Northern Terirtory since the introduction of the new legislation has been very satisfactory.

* Then there is another section of our community, the Aborigines, about which the Government proposes to do nothing at all.

* I have a Bill before the House to seek a referendum to alter section 127 and section 51 of the Constitution in order that Aborigines may be regarded as the equals of the other people living in Australia, whether born here or naturalised.

* We want to remove stigmas from the Aborigines.

* But this Government says that what went into the Constitution 64 years ago, even though the Aborigines regard it as insulting and improper, shall remain there.

* The more one knows about **aborigines**, their problems and their way of living, the less chance one has of finding a solution.

* On the agenda paper was a motion, originating from the Tasmanian delegation, to the effect that something should be done about our **aborigines**.

* Most people who tell us what should be done about the **aborigines** invariably claim that the " poor **aborigines** " are expected to live in conditions in which we ourselves would not live.

* Many centuries ago our stone age ancestors were living in conditions similar to those in which the stone age tribal **aborigines** of Australia now live.

* I suppose I should not say this, but the " do-gooders " claim that the **aborigines** should have all the privileges that Europeans enjoy.

* If this is done hurriedly and with a sense of panic which international opinion may instil in us, it will be disastrous for our position in the world as well as for the **aborigines** with whose welfare we are concerned.

* The honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson),  who has a great interest in these matters, has stated that we must reassure our own people that we are doing something about the **aborigines**.

* I know that some of them in at least one State which has a native problem do not understand the problems of the **aborigines**.

* I have heard stories of a native welfare officer in Western Australia, who is not now in the service, who made a practice of going to the creek where **aborigines** were camped and playing poker with them.

* The honorable member for the Northern Territory emphasized the position of the States which have differing laws and policies regarding **aborigines**.

* Australia can no longer say in the forums of the world, "Of course, we have no power to make laws with respect to **aborigines** ".

* He knows more about the tribal customs, traditions and anthropology of the Australian **aborigines** than any previous Minister, and he has taken great interest in this matter.

* Hasluck) assumed office, he found that the expenditure upon **aborigines** in the Northern Territory was 16,000 a year.

* The expenditure on **aborigines** now is more than 1,000,000 a year.

* When the Minister assumed office, there was one school for **aborigines**; there are now 30.

* What is more, he has not only improved the position of the **aborigines** of the Northern Territory by his own exertions, but also by the force of his example and possibly through Commonwealth grants to the States he has caused a very large increase in State expenditure on **aborigines**.

* I feel that that actually constitutes the answer to the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr. Browne),  who appeared to me to be asking the Australian community to take an interest in the Australian **aborigines** while saying at the same time that it would be quite useless if they did so because they would only become do-gooders and their ideas would be brushed aside.

* It is quite clear that the problem that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was talking about and the problem which the Minister has moved a long way towards solving are really different problems, because the honorable member for Kalgoorlie was talking about **aborigines** in the tribal state.

* The problem of the detribalized natives and the problem of the **aborigines** who are living in the tribal state are quite distinct.

* You can always attack any suggestion that is made about Commonwealth expenditure on the **aborigines** by making the kind of estimation that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie has made and applying these things to the most primitive and the most remote **aborigines**.

* But another meaning of assimilation is " to absorb ", and consequently I feel that every time the Minister says his policy is assimilation, there are large numbers of persons in the Australian community who believe that the Minister's policy is to breed the **aborigines** out by absorption by inter-marriage into the Australian community.

* She came and discussed all these problems with me in a mature way, and I find it quite impossible to reconcile that experience with the statement by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie that people question why these **aborigines** should own houses.

* Any one who cares to move among the **aborigines** and part-**aborigines** of the great southern district of Western Australia will find that many of the women do monumental work in holding their families together, and that to own a home is one of their deepest longings.

* I do feel that, as well as this question of the health of the **aborigines** who are detribalized and are living as part of the European community, there is room for the kind of massive attack on the problem of the general health of the nomad which the Minister has already caused to be made in connexion with the specific problems of yaws and leprosy.

* The massive attacks which the Commonwealth has made on these particular problems have been one of the causes of the cessation of the decline in the number of **aborigines**, and the reversal of that trend to the point where now the number of **aborigines** is growing.

* I am thinking in particular of the Forrest River, where the **aborigines** are being educated to a very high standard, where they have a great deal of pride and self-respect and where, in fact, they objected to the teacher's method of teaching Australian history.

* When he asked why they objected, they said he taught about Australian explorers, but never mentioned the **aborigines** who guided them.

* Naturally, he had to go into a whole welter of research to discover the **aborigines** who had led John Forrest, Alexander Forrest, Sturt and some of the early explorers and give them the credit that was their due.

* That story makes me very happy, because it shows growing self-respect in the **aborigines** of the north of Western Australia, who are not prepared to have their people's achievements brushed aside.

* When we speak about the contribution made by **aborigines** to the cattle industry in the north of Western Australia, we always assume that they must occupy positions as wage-earners who work for somebody else who owns or leases the land.

* We also know that in the great southern district there are **aborigines**, and part-**aborigines** who are skilled in agriculture, and we ought to see that they are given some share in land ownership, that their communities are given some capital backing in that respect.

* There is a great deal of Crown land unalienated in States like Western Australia, and it might be a good objective for the Minister to have in future to induce the governments of that State and of Queensland to set aside some of the Crown land, or some of the farming land which comes under their control in other ways, for **aborigines** who have shown that they have the skill and management experience in the industry necessary to make them good settlers.

* Rates for **aborigines** employed by the Department of the Army in the Northern Territory, as with **aborigines** generally throughout the Territory, have been set having regard to the minimum rates and conditions of employment prescribed under the Northern Territory Wards' Employment Ordinance 1953-1964 for persons who were formerly wards within the meaning of the Northern Territory Welfare Ordinance 1953-1963.

* As has been stated on behalf of the Government in the Legislative Council, the Government's general policy objective of non-discrimination applies to the employment of **aborigines** by the Northern Territory Administration and Commonwealth Departments and the Government will be pursuing this general policy objective when the decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is known in respect of the case now before it relating to the employment of **aborigines** in the cattle industry.

* If the department is aware of which **aborigines** are affected, why has the Minister refused to give me that information in reply to a question on notice in relation to certain places in Western Australia?

* If **aborigines** had the right to vote it might have a decided effect on an electorate such as Kalgoorlie.

* In the Northern Territory, there are 200,000 square miles for one man, not counting fullblooded **aborigines**.

* Except where an aboriginal has been declared to be a ward, wage rates and conditions of private employment in the Northern Territory are subject to determination in the same way for **aborigines** as for other employees, i.e., by tha Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* Where **aborigines** or other employees are not covered by an award of that commission, wage rates and conditions of employment are a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee.

* Whether **aborigines** are considered the equal in skill and responsibility of others when employed as cattle station hands or drovers is a matter of opinion.

* In determining the amounts of the grants payable for 1959-60, regard was had to the overall revenue requirements of each State which were, of course, based on levels of expenditure including expenditure on account of Aborigines and Aboriginal welfare.

* The inclusion of the full blood Aborigines in the population figures would be unlikely to make any marked difference to the annual proportionate change in the population of Queensland.

* A great deal has been said about citizenship rights, about voting rights for Aborigines and so on, but the real need in this field is to provide funds for the improvement of the living standards of the Aboriginal people.

* 1 find in my own electorate - and I am sure from my observations that a similar picture may be seen in many other parts of Australia - that the living standards of Aborigines are not being raised rapidly enough.

* In the context of our total annual outlay, to do something really worth while to improve the living standards of our Aborigines, must be regarded as a relatively small problem.

* My colleague, the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant),  will deal with that provision in the Bill relating to the exemption of Aborigines from call-up.

* We on this side of the House are concerned because we consider that this provision may be offensive to some **aborigines** and may also be interpreted overseas in a manner that will cast some adverse reflection on Australia.

* The honorable member for Wills, who, as every honorable member knows, is Senior VicePresident of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, is well fitted to speak on this matter.

* He will place before honorable members the views of some Aborigines whom he knows and of the Opposition.

* How many Aborigines are receiving age and invalid pensions, wives' allowances and widows' pensions on government settlements, church missions and pastoral properties?

* Only a couple of years ago I was a member of a select committee that inquired into matters affecting Arnhem Land Aborigines and so far none of that committee's recommendations has been implemented.

* This happened in the select committee on the Arnhem Land Aborigines.

* The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then talked about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when pleading for a vote for the **aborigines**.

* Everybody should know that there are many difficult problems associated with **aborigines** which have yet to be settled.

* If members of the Labour Party do not understand the problems associated with giving every aboriginal in Australia a vote, then they do not know anything about the life of Australian **aborigines**.

* For instance, I challenge any honorable member to discover the address of many of these **aborigines**.

* This House has already agreed to the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the best methods of dealing with this great problem of giving the Australian **aborigines** the right to vote.

* Now the Opposition comes forward with a carte blanche proposal which it knows is not in the interest of the Australian **aborigines**.

* I ask the Minister for the Interior whether he has arranged for an instruction campaign to be carried out in the Northern Territory for the purpose of educating **aborigines** in the art of voting at federal elections.

* Could the Welfare Branch assess the qualifications of Aborigines and ensure that men who are already highly efficient are not being deprived of just payment?

* Why should these Aborigines have to wait three years?

* Is it correct that the Department of Social Services does not know even approximately how many Aborigines are receiving age or invalid pensions or where such recipients are usually domiciled?

* Could it be correct that some Aborigines, particularly in the north, are entitled to benefits under the Social Services Act but are not aware of their entitlements?

* If so, will the Minister arrange for officers of his Department to go out among the Aborigines to explain to them the provisions of the Social Services Act in a similar way to that in which officers of the Commonwealth Electoral Office went out to explain the system of enrolment and of voting at Commonwealth elections?

* It is our policy, of course, to bring Aborigines into complete equality with white Australians.

* The union put its case for the Aborigines and the pastoralists put their case.

* The Department of Labour and National Service is at present extending its services and facilities to the north and north-west of Western Australia and, as part of its action programme to encourage wider employment opportunities for Aborigines, is investigating the present pattern of employment in that area, and will go on to study wider employment possibilities for Aborigines.

* .- I wish to refer also to slums, not the slums in which **aborigines** live, as has been mentioned by the honorable member for New England  (Mr. Drummond),  but the slums in the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* Before I conclude I want to deal with the reason why  Mr Charles  Perkins resigned from the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.

* He said: 
Generally speaking, federal awards, where operative, have equal application to all workers whether or not they are **aborigines**.

* The first concerns **aborigines** who are declared wards under the provisions of the Northern Territory Welfare Ordinance 1953-1959.

* The second covers the case where a federal award expressly excludes **aborigines**.

* The second instance, the case of federal awards expressly excluding **aborigines** from their operation, has occurred rarely.

* They are the Cattle Station Industry (Northern Territory) award, clause 6 of which states that " this Award shall not apply to station hands, managers, overseers, members of the owner's family, aboriginals or domestic servants", and the Pastoral Industry Award which specifically excludes, inter alia, the employment of **aborigines** as station hands, one of the classifications covered by the awards.

* Likewise, my Office and the Department of Health are seeking to develop a specific line of Commonwealth policy in particular fields of physical wellbeing in which it is believed the Aborigines are at disadvantage or disability.

* Aborigines vote in some States, including New South Wales, but not in Queensland and Western Australia.

* About 14,000 electors and about 20,000 **aborigines** in the Northern Territory are very keen to have full representation in this chamber and in the Senate.

* One great argument used against the refusal to give **aborigines** all over Australia the right to vote was the accident of geography - the accident that a native of New South Wales had a perfect right to vote and that a native in Queensland or the Northern Territory did not have the right to vote.

* Here the Opposition seeks to ignore the same argument which has been used so often in regard to voting rights for **aborigines**.

* Is this a time when we should embark upon the enforcement of an obligation on the **aborigines** of New South Wales and Victoria?

* Surely the candidates could have said to the **aborigines**, "Why do you not enroll, because that will help you, if you vote for me "!

* I do not believe you will arouse anything but resentment in conferring on **aborigines** the right to vote, if a native later finds himself liable to a fine of up to 2 for not enrolling and voting.

* But under the provisions of this measure the **aborigines** will feel that they have had conferred on them something of value.

* How many Aborigines are employed by tha Northern Territory Administration?

* The Department of Air does employ **aborigines** in the Northern Territory on terms different from those upon which other Australians are employed.

* (a) The number of **aborigines** so employed averages 35.

* The Administrator of the Northern Territory determines the rates of pay and conditions of service for the employment of **aborigines** by the Defence Services in the Northern Territory.

* The population of the Territory is 47,000 including Aborigines.

* At this moment I am moved to speak on behalf of the 50,000 or so fullblooded **aborigines** and the 25,000 or so part-**aborigines** in Australia.

* It was the first occasion in many people's memory on which **aborigines** 'had stood up and spoken for themselves.

* In all 'States except Victoria and Tasmania there is legislation that -discriminates against the **aborigines**.

* There are only some 50,000 full blooded **aborigines** in Australia and there are some 25,000 who regard themselves as part aboriginal - making a total of 75,000.

* Perhaps the Department of Social Services or the Repatriation Department may be the hope of the side when it comes to dealing with **aborigines**.

* The discriminatory legislation that I have mentioned refers to **aborigines** by their race and it should be removed from the statute-books of Australia.

* The first referred to the report of the Aborigines' Welfare Board in Victoria, which is the wealthiest State in what is supposed to be the fourth or fifth wealthiest nation in the world.

* We have only a handful of **aborigines**.

* But we might term the discrimination against **aborigines** in Victoria both administrative and social.

* The Victorian Government, through its housing commission, expends approximately 4,000 per house provided for ordinary folk, but only 1,100 or 1,500 per house provided for **aborigines**.

* As far as the ability of the **aborigines** to look after their houses is concerned, I believe that the time has come when we must risk their damaging their homes.

* In the Territory, anybody with any European blood is exempt from these laws and is not considered as an aborigine; the **aborigines** are free citizens the same as anybody else.

* There are only some 16,000 **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* We should remove discriminatory legislation and treat **aborigines** as individual human beings.

* I know some **aborigines** in Victoria who live happily and healthily side by side with white people.

* One was the great difficulty in getting unanimity among the States, which have the primary responsibility in respect of the welfare of **aborigines**.

* There is evidence of a campaign throughout the Communist world on the subject of Australian **aborigines**, aimed at weakening the ideological standing of Australia in the world and especially in Asia and Africa.

* I address my question to the Minister for Social Services, who is probably aware that there is still in the Social Services Act a section that discriminates against Aborigines.

* Would he care to step down to room L58 after question time to explain to the members of the delegation of Aborigines present this afternoon why he leaves this provision in the Act?

* The Prime Minister deplores the fact that we have referred to the position in Australia, with our **aborigines**, and in New Guinea, with its indigenous inhabitants.

* We do not fear such international annual supervision, and we would' have nothing to fear if the question of the **aborigines** was raised in the United Nations.

* There is- no doubt that the Prime Minister made the reference to the **aborigines** and the indigenous inhabitants of New Guinea, not only in reply to a question which was asked by the honorable member tor Perth  (Mr. Chaney),  but also in reply to a supplementary question which was asked by the Leader of the Opposition.

* There is no determination relating specifically to Aborigines.

* 1 can assure the honorable member that there has never been any discrimination against Aborigines in connection with the payment of tuberculosis allowance.

* The only reference to the eligibility of Aborigines for the payment of tuberculosis allowance occurred in paragraphs 52 and 53 of the determination, but those paragraphs were amended on 26th February 1965, to exclude reference to Aborigines in order to avoid any possible misinterpretation of the provisions in question and to make it quite clear that the scheme of tuberculosis allowances is not discriminatory on racial grounds.

* (a) At the end of March 1965, there were 1 , 598 persons in Australia in receipt of tuberculosis allowance, (b) and (c) It is not known how many Aborigines outside the Northern Territory are receiving tuberculosis allowance, as applicants are not required to state their racial origin and no record is therefore maintained in the States of the number of recipients of the allowance who are Aborigines.

* However, in the Northern Territory the Welfare Branch of the Administration is responsible for the welfare of the aboriginal population, and for the information of that Branch a local record is kept of the number of Aborigines in receipt of the allowance.

* I understand that ten of the persons currently receiving tuberculosis allowance in the Northern Territory are Aborigines.

* It is therefore not possible to say how many persons are at present actually suffering from tuberculosis in Australia or how many sufferers are Aborigines.

* it is just as well to remind ourselves that the people of Canberra will still be classed with lunatics, criminals, children, **aborigines**, and of course, aliens, as people without an effective voice in the national affairs of this country, and people without a say in their own process of self-government.

* We now propose to give voting rights to the **aborigines**.

* Australian **aborigines** or Maoris), travelling either as intending immigrants or as visitors.

* Both countries require the naturalborn or naturalised citizens of the other country who is of other than European descent (apart from **aborigines** and Maoris) and who is an applicant for entry a; an immigrant to be in possession of a passport and prior authority for such entry by way of endorsement (in practice New Zealand waives the passport requirement and the authority for entry is inscribed on a special form).

* As has been stated on a number of occasions in Parliament and elsewhere the Government's general policy of nondiscrimination applies to the employment of Aborigines by the Northern Territory Administration and by Commonwealth Departments.

* It is desired to emphasize that if these benefits were paid direct to the **aborigines** who qualify for them the department would not then be in a position to identify them.

* What action is being taken to ensure that Aborigines receive award wages?

* How many Aborigines are at present employed by his Department in (a) Queensland, (b) Western Australia and (c) South Australia, and on what type of work are they engaged?

* The general purpose of the Bill is to provide moneys for the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund from royalties received from Aboriginal reserves, the use of lands on reserves and minerals and timber that might be taken from those reserves.

* In the second reading speech the Minister said: 
International Labour Organization Conventions: Aborigines.

* Mr. Whitlam  asked the Acting Minister for External Affairs, upon notice - 
How much time does he expect to elapse before State and territorial laws and practices concerning **aborigines** will have been sufficiently amended to permit Australia to ratify International Labour Organization Conventions (a) No.

* So far as I know, the rules of the Australian Workers Union allow **aborigines** to become members of the union.

* The fault in discriminating against **aborigines** lies with the judges of the arbitration tribunal in that they will not give to financial members of the union who are **aborigines** the same rights under the pastoral award as are given to white men under that award.

* The union will accept and always has accepted **aborigines** as members.

* Despite applications by the union from time to time, the commission has constantly refused to include provisions in the pastoral award to enable **aborigines** or part **aborigines** to receive the benefits of the award, as it applies to station hands, stockmen, boundary riders and the like.

* The interjection only shows that the action in New Guinea for which I am criticizing the Government is consistent with the general attitude of the Government, and of the judges of the arbitration commission appointed by the Government, towards **aborigines** and coloured people generally.

* I ask the Minister for Territories whether he will point out to the honorable member for Chisholm that the awards of arbitration courts, whether they be for the Australian Workers Union or any other union, cover **aborigines**, partaborigines and white Australians and do not discriminate against persons because of their blood.

* Will he also inform the honorable member that the Australian Workers Union polices its awards as much for the benefit of **aborigines** as for those who do not have aboriginal blood in their veins, and that all persons who work on the Darwin waterfront - most of them are not white Australians - are paid full award rates and enjoy full award conditions?

* Will he advise the honorable member further that, if any **aborigines** are robbed of their social service payments, they are robbed not by the trade union movement but by somebody else?

* How many **aborigines** residing at - 
Another major South Vietnamese failing in communal relations has been that of relations between Saigon and the tribal **aborigines** .

* Apparently, **aborigines** live in the mountains around the borders -   .

* He started off with what might be termed the old approach about coals in the bath, and you cannot put **aborigines** in good houses because they will smash the windows and break the walls, and they would not wash and so on.

* After all, we are talking about some 70,000 people who are defined as **aborigines**, and another 30,000 who are part aboriginal, so there are 100,000 people who can reasonably call themselves **aborigines**.

* How can **aborigines** feel that they are free citizens in a free Commonwealth while there is the following section in the Commonwealth Constitution: - 
There are other provisions in the Constitution which should be attended to also.

* In Victoria - and this is to the credit of the Liberal Party there - I think it was in 1950, all legal disabilities were removed from **aborigines**.

* People from the northern parts of Australia might say, " That is all right for you in Victoria, because there are not many **aborigines** there ".

* The material position of the **aborigines**, of course, gives any person with a sense of humanity a great deal of concern.

* She said, when she saw a picture of some dwellings, " Aborigines live there?"

* That is another step you have to take - a national housing programme which will overcome one of the disabilities under which the **aborigines** suffer.

* The **aborigines** should have citizenship - citizenship in whatever way the Government cares to define it, but they should become Australian citizens.

* But something must be done to give **aborigines** the same rights all over Australia.

* The honorable member for Kalgoorlie referred to people who like to talk about this problem without having lived amongst the **aborigines**.

* It was the annual conference of the Council for Aborigines Advancement and it was attended by 150 people.

* These people come from all walks of life and hold varying political opinions, and a significant proportion of them are **aborigines**.

* The conference was a sign of life amongst the **aborigines** themselves and a sign of the growing consciousness of the Australian people.

* Aborigines were present and they spoke for themselves.

* Sometimes I do not agree with what they say, but I think it is an essential part of building the spirit of the Australian **aborigines** that we provide every possible opportunity for them  to meet  and  to  speak for themselves amongst themselves and amongst their fellow Australians.

* As far as I can see, it is only when **aborigines** start to speak up for themselves and to be proud of their ancestry that they will be accepted as citizens.

* Aborigines can be just as proud of their ancestry as any of us here can be proud of our European ancestry.

* I want to make it clear - I believe that this is the feeling of my fellow citizens in Victoria - that people living in a State which has no great material responsibility for **aborigines** should consider it their duty to share the burden that falls so heavily on the people of the northern part of Australia.

* The **aborigines** of Australia are entitled to equal legal rights.

* Now, moreover, for the first time Aborigines can be enrolled and can vote.

* These happen to be electorates where great numbers of Aborigines reside.

* If the number of Aborigines living in each of these electorates were added to the number of electors in the electorates, the margin for each would be less than 10 per cent.

* The position has improved since the report of the Constitutional Review Committee because Aborigines can now vote.

* .- It is not only members of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines who should have a voice in this debate.

* say something about our own responsibilities in regard to our **aborigines**; and those of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

* The special survey of Aborigines registered for employment which yielded the figure quoted by the honourable member, was possible only because District Officers were notified in advance that for the purpose of the survey they would be required to identify Aboriginal registrants.

* At this point of time it is not possible to provide the detailed information asked for; however, it is estimated that more than 800 Aborigines were found employment in Government departments, Commonwealth and State.

* The people who framed it did not mean that **aborigines** were not people of the Commonwealth, but that is what it clearly implies.

* Now that **aborigines** have voting rights, an indefensible anomaly has arisen.

* Aborigines who may vote and are citizens do not count in a State's quota.

* It is a mention of **aborigines** which has had in the past - unnecessarily it is true - the serious effect of depriving them of social services.

* This was a misconstruction of the section, remedied comparatively recently by the present Government, but there is no reason why **aborigines** should be mentioned.

* If, as the conferences of State and Federal Ministers recently declared, **aborigines** are fully Australian citizens, then their constitutional position should be that they are subject to State and Federal law in the same way as are other citizens.

* It means that the **aborigines** in the States are a body of citizens to whom the Commonwealth is denied access.

* Special laws might be necessary to meet the special needs of **aborigines**, but those special laws are forbidden by the presence of the words we propose to delete from this paragraph.

* At international conferences the Commonwealth bears the odium of any discrimination against **aborigines**.

* Aborigines facing the problems of citizenship are facing senseless anomalies.

* Noone knows what the actual statistics  aTe,  but I suppose that the 100,000 Aborigines would make up 25,000 to 30,000 families and anything up to 20,000 of those families would be living in miserable and degrading conditions.

* I would like to pay a tribute at this time to the people who formed organisations such as the Federal Council lor the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.

* How many full-blood **aborigines** are resident in the Northern Territory?

* Aborigines Employed by Department of the Army.

* Is the whole of the Northern Territory subject to an incidence of leprosy amongst Aborigines?

* How many Aborigines are estimated to be living in the area or areas subject to leprosy?

* How many of those Aborigines were considered to be suffering from active leprosy in each year since 19S5?

* Is the statement in the information handbook " The Australian Aborigines " correct when it says, in answer to question  J.: "  They (the Aborigines) are also entitled to all other social service benefits.

* Is it a fact that some Aborigines do not receive unemployment benefit or tuberculosis allowance at the same rates as other Australians?

* All Australian Aborigines, other than those who are nomadic or primitive, are eligible for social service benefits on the same basis as other members of the community.

* That, for the time being, the enrolment of **aborigines** and Torres Strait islanders be voluntary, but when enrolled, compulsory voting be enforced.

* It is recommended by your committee that a penal provision be inserted in the amending Act In respect of the use of duress or undue influence on **aborigines** in the exercise of their franchise.

* 1 have received a letter from the  chairman  of the Aborigines Welfare Board in Victoria.

* The  chairman  of the board states - 
In order that you may be more reliably informed than you appear to be on this subject, I desire to advise that Lake Tyers has neverceased to be an Aboriginal Reserve, but that a considerable number of Aboriginal inhabitants havevoluntarily accepted the Victorian Aborigines Welfare Board's offer of belter housing in areas where their children may have belter educational and employment opportunities.

* Victorian Aborigines are certainly not treated as " conquered people ".

* They have the same rights as any other citizens of this State and are not in any way subject to direction by the Aborigines Welfare Board or any other body, excepting so far as those who choose to live on the Reserve are expected to comply with the regulations governing this institution.

* If I have misunderstood the position in Victoria and misrepresented the position of the Aborigines Welfare Board, I am very glad to take this opportunity to correct the matter.I also am very glad to learn that the **aborigines** in Victoria have not lost the Lake Tyers reserve.

* I have very great respect for his sincerity and great admiration for the exuberance he displays in seeking to improve the lot of the **aborigines**, but I am afraid that I cannot accept his judgment on the matter under discussion.

* It is very interesting to see this new interest in the welfare of the **aborigines** on the part of the Australian Labour Party.

* But at least on this occasion we have seen a new approach to the advancement of the **aborigines**.

* This Government's record in relation to the welfare of the **aborigines** seems to have aroused an interest on the part of the Labour 
Party.

* Until the present Minister for Defence  (Mr. Hasluck)  became Minister for Territories after Labour had been in office for some time, there had been no advancement of the welfare of the **aborigines**.

* I have heard criticisms from honorable members opposite about the treatment of **aborigines** in Queensland.

* The honorable member for Fremantle seemed to suggest that if we increased wages and gave the **aborigines** improved social service benefits and so forth we would solve the aboriginal problem.

* The honorable member treated the **aborigines** as a whole and did not differentiate between all the different categories into, which **aborigines** fall.

* We cannot place all **aborigines** under the one heading.

* The Opposition suggests that if we pay the **aborigines** full wages everything will be all right.

* It should be noted that there are no full-blood Aborigines in the Australian Capital Territory, or the Commonwealth Territory of Jervis Bay.

* The only people resident in any portion of the Australian Capital Territory or Jervis Bay Territory who have been subject to the Aborigines Welfare Ordinance are, in fact, some half-caste Aborigines and others having lesser admixtures of Aboriginal blood.

* All of these people have been reasonably assimilated into the community, and may not be regarded  as  Aborigines in other parts of Australia.

* In his second reading speech the Treasurer said that the Commonwealth has decided to include full blood Aborigines in arriving at population figures to be used in calculating the grants for each year.

* As both Queensland and Western Australia have several thousand full blood Aborigines in their populations, the Government's proposal should mean additional revenue for those States.

* I will be interested to find out just what this proposal means and just how much extra finance those two States will receive as a result of full blood Aborigines being counted in the population.

* I will be interested also to see how much of the additional financial assistance forthcoming as a result of counting full blood Aborigines is used by those States for the purpose of providing better conditions generally for the Aboriginal people.

* If the inclusion of full blood Aborigines in the population count means that Western Australia and Queensland will receive a substantial increase by way of grants compared with what they would have received otherwise, it is to be hoped that something will be done with the additional finance to provide training facilities for the Aboriginal people so that they may take their place in the work force of this country.

* Nevertheless, the Commonwealth should endeavour to persuade the States to grant some benefit to the Aborigines from the increases forthcoming as a result of this proposal.

* What is to be done about providing the Aborigines with the community services that other Australians enjoy?

* What is to be done about the employment of Aborigines?

* The honorable member for Fremantle has pointed out effectively that the Commonwealth itself is not giving Aborigines equality.

* .- It is a wonderful thing that two years after the report of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines was completed, the House is again discussing the question and keeping the matter under some sort of review.

* The honorable member for Wakefield  (Mr. Kelly)  dealt in some detail with the recommendations of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines.

* He referred to paragraph 76 a) of the report, which reads - 
That the excised portion of Gove Peninsula be declared a protected area in order that people other than Aborigines shall be prevented from hunting there.

* I have no doubt that when the Administrator went to Yirrkala and discussed this matter with the Aborigines concerned they expressed themselves as being happy at that point of time.

* We are not concerned with whether the Aborigines are happy today; we are concerned with the future, because any industry which is set up will operate for decades or generations to come.

* We provided pensions for Aborigines.

* If so, have representative Aborigines at Yirrkala been supplied wilh copies of the lease under which mining operations are to be conducted?

* Have representative Aborigines al Groote Eylandt been supplied with copies of the lease under which mining operations are conducted at Groote?

* They want - and 1 understand their view - to eliminate the words " other than the Aboriginal race in any State ", on the ground that these words amount to discrimination against Aborigines.

* The words are a protection against discrimination by the Commonwealth Parliament in respect of Aborigines.

* We have made laws discriminating against Aborigines and section 51 (xxvi) has not prevented us from doing so.

* As the honorable member for Fremantle pointed out, the laws that have been made by the Commonwealth - and the honorable member for Wills cited a number of them - have always discriminated against the Aborigines.

* I agree that what should be the aim of the Government is the integration of the Aborigines in the community generally.

* There should not be a state of affairs where the Aborigines are treated as being of a race apart.

* Returning to the Bill before the House, the matter can be simply put by saying that section 127 is completely out of harmony with our national attitudes and with the elevation of the Aborigines into the ranks of citizenship which we all wish to see.

* This would give the Commonwealth Parliament power, a plenary power, to make laws, unlimited except by such general provisions as those of section 92, with respect to Aborigines - for example, industrial laws, social services laws and so forth.

* Certainly our overall objective is to treat the Aborigines as on the same footing as the rest of us, with similar duties and similar rights.

* But surely this is not an argument against providing for the Commonwealth a simple power to be able to do something for the Aborigines.

* There are other ways of doing things for the Aborigines.

* The Prime Minister said - 
The third proposal that has been made ... is to add a new provision rendering invalid laws regarding Aborigines by, for example, invalidating any Commonwealth or State discrimination on the grounds of race.

* It is useless for the Commonwealth to say that it has no control or only limited control over all the **aborigines** in Australia and that the States exercise sovereign rights and control nearly 75 per cent, of the native people of the continent.

* I would like to have heard from the States what they are doing about providing homes for **aborigines**.

* I wish now to refer to the consumption of alcohol by **aborigines**.

* As honorable members know, the Parliament recently set up a select committee to inquire into the advisability of granting voting rights to **aborigines**.

* How many Australian **aborigines** are at present in receipt of (a) age, (b) invalid and (c) widows' pensions?

* Is it a fact that many Aborigines in the Northern Territory have died as a result of an epidemic of measles?

* Is the Minister aware that the Government of Western Australia has for some time been carrying out a programme of immunisation of Aborigines against measles?

* There are ten full-blooded **aborigines** employed in Commonwealth departments in Western Australia.

* On the other hand, many of the problems that we are now facing in regard to the **aborigines** in that area would not have arisen.

* We would not have had petitions from the **aborigines** who are apprehensive of their future.

* It would give the Commonwealth adequate power, not necessarily exclusive power, to help the Aborigines and would prevent any discriminatory laws against them.

* It has given Aborigines the right to vote, it has extended the social services accorded to them and it has reduced discrimination.

* There are people, such as the Aborigines, who need special help and support.

* But I do not believe that there is any room for discrimination against Aborigines or anybody else inside Australia on racial grounds.

* The Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines visited Port Hedland.

* To or for how many **aborigines** was each type of pension, allowance, endowment or benefit paid under the Social Services Act during the last financial year?

* In how many cases was payment of the whole or a portion of each type of pension, allowance, endowment or benefit made to persons, institutions or authorities on behalf of the **aborigines**?

* How many applications were (a) received from or on behalf of **aborigines** and (b) granted to or for **aborigines** in respect of each type of pension, allowance, endowment or benefit during the last financial year?

* How are wage rates and conditions of employment for Aborigines determined in the Northern Territory?

* What arrangements are made for employers to employ Aborigines under conditions less favorable than award standards?

* The Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines, which was appointed by this House some years ago and of which both the present Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  and I were members, rested its case for the granting of Commonwealth voting rights to **aborigines** on the ground that they certainly were subjects of the Queen, that they certainly were people of a State and that they certainly were people of the Commonwealth.

* In that State, **aborigines** applying for something that was called " citizenship rights " - they were exclusively Western Austraiian citizenship rights, whatever that means - were said to have conferred upon them the rights, privileges and immunities of a natural-born subject of the Queen.

* No representative of Western Australia could explain to the select committee why that State wanted to put **aborigines** through a process akin to naturalization.

* That is the only procedure that ever appeared to dispute that **aborigines** were subjects of the Queen.

* There never was any dispute that **aborigines** were people of a State; and we members of the select committee, for the sake of our report, also said that they were people of the Commonwealth.

* 1 would say that the reasoning of the select committee was this refinement: Aborigines are people of the Commonwealth, but they are not numbered among the people of the Commonwealth; section 127 is a census provision.

* When I was in India in 1954 a certain Australian Communist lady correctly quoted this section of the Constitution in many parts of India, and interpreted it as meaning that the Australian Constitution declared that **aborigines** were not people.

* At the Constitution conventions, apart from the census question, the section was sustained by other outmoded arguments, such as one advanced by  Mr. Walker  in answering  Dr. Cockburn,  the leader of the South Australian delegation, who feared that it would take Australian **aborigines** off the South Australian roll.

* I cannot see any State government fighting hard against the counting of **aborigines** in a federal census.

* He establishes the conflict on the whole question of the status of **aborigines** between the government in the United Kingdom and the colonial authorities which colonial authorities subsequently became the self-governing authorities of the colony of Western Australia in the 1890's.

* The Secretary of State for the Colonies remonstrated again and again with the Governor of Western Australia pointing out that **aborigines** were subjects of the Queen and must be given equality of treatment with white people.

* Sir John  Forrest spoke for Western Australia, which was moving towards the taking away of voting rights of **aborigines** which had been included originally in the constitution of Western Australia by the United Kingdom.

* The constitutions granted to every State provided, in their original forms, for the voting rights of **aborigines** included as British subjects.

* The **aborigines** lost those voting rights only when the self-governing colonies by deliberate enactment took them away, as Western Australia did around 1903.

* of the Constitution, which provides that the Commonwealth shall have the right to legislate for the people of any race, other than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws,  Sir John  Forrest said - 
Years later, the Commonwealth Government began the move to lift restrictions on the voting rights of **aborigines**, the Western Australian Parliament followed.

* In 1931 when Arthur Blakeley and  Mr. Scullin  granted certain large aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory - the **aborigines** were in the tribal state and the Government did not want the **aborigines** interfered with at that stage - that was discrimination.

* I claim that **aborigines** have special needs.

* If you read the " Medical Journal of Australia" you will find that at a point in the 1950's in our glorious Northern Territory the incidence of leprosy among **aborigines** was the highest in the world - higher in this wealthy country than in the most backward nations of Africa.

* You can sometimes find them if you study the research done by students of the Australian National University; you can see demographic figures if you read F. LancasterJones's " Demographic Survey of Aborigines in the Northern Territory".

* However, this concept is being removed in the Northern Territory where some glorious new liberty is supposed to be descending upon the **aborigines** because a few fringe dwellers among them may legally drink - they are already illegally doing that - and because their women can offer themselves to white men without the white men being prosecuted or having to marry them.

* Tt may be that the technicalities of a referendum are very difficult to argue before the general public, but whatever the difficulties one terrible fact remains: irrespective of who has control over **aborigines** only one government is answerable before the forum of international opinion - the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* That is why we would like to have removed from the Constitution the prohibition against the Commonwealth's legislating for **aborigines** outside the Territories because, irrespective of whether or not we have the power, we will answer before world opinion for whatever goes on in our aboriginal affairs.

* There is also a condition to the general effect that if, within an area covered by a mining lease, there are places of religious significance to **aborigines**, or if there is arable land which is needed by **aborigines** or the mission for cultivation purposes, those areas can be excised from the mining lease and made available to the aboriginal people.

* When the reserves were originally created many years ago the general view then taken throughout Australia was, I think, that the **aborigines** were a dying race - that they were a race which w whom very little future was seen in the way was declining in numbers and a race for of material advancement.

* To-day the agreed policy of all Australian governments is a policy of assimilation, which means that conscious efforts are to be made to advance the **aborigines** to a stage where they may live to the same advantage on the same standards and in the same places as every other Australian and where they may have the same opportunities as all other Australians.

* In the Nortehrn Territory in particular the numbers of **aborigines** are increasing at a rate higher than the 'natural rate of increase for Australia as a whole.

* They said in effect that the reserve was no longer needed, that it was not being used by the **aborigines**, that there was nobody on it and that therefore it should be revoked.

* Referring to the submission made to me I wrote - 
I think I can give the best expression of existing policy by quoting from a minute that I wrote last year in respect of another reserve which, again, had no **aborigines** on it and which was considered by some people to be no longer necessary for the use and benefit of **aborigines**.

* These reserves are being held to-day, not as a refuge to which **aborigines** can retreat and live in a tribal state, but as reserves of land to meet the future needs of these people when they have advanced further towards civilization.

* All these reserves were created for the use and benefit of **aborigines**.

* The only modification of that decision is brought about by a policy of assimilation which discourages arrangements which segregate **aborigines** from the rest of the community for any reason other than their own needs for special care.

* Dealing with Aboriginals our platform reads: 1 The Office of Aboriginal Affairs be upgraded to Ministerial level and the Commonwealth assume the ultimate responsibility for Aborigines and Islanders accorded to it by the referendum of 1967.

* 2 Aborigines to have equal rights and opportunities with all other Australians, and every form of discrimination against Aborigines to be ended.

* 3 Aborigines to receive the standerd rate of wages for the /ob and to receive the same industrial protection as other Australians.

* 5 Housing programmes to give consideration to the personal wishes of the Aborigines as to design and location.

* Efficient mortality statistics to be maintained to measure the effectiveness of these policies among Aborigines.

* 7 Aborigines shall have the right to receive social services in the same way as all other Australians.

* 8 All Aboriginal lands to be vested in a public trust or trusts composed of Aborigines or Islanders as appropriate.

* That exclusive corporate land rights be granted to Aboriginal communities which retain a strong tribal structure or demonstrate a potential for corporate action in regard to land at present reserved for the use of Aborigines, or where traditional occupancy according to tribal custom can be established from anthropological or other evidence.

* The other policies in our platform are:  10 A Parliamentary Committee to be established to study all aspects of policy affecting Aborigines.

* 12 That trained Social Workers be provided in every area where housing of Aborigines has been undertaken.

* I think I should reiterate that it is merely designed to include a special group of people within the scope of the repatriation benefits that come under the Native Members of the Forces Benefits Act - a group of people who were previously classified as Australian Aborigines living on the mainland territory which is still within the State of Queensland.

* Mr. TURNER presented a petition from certain citizens of the Commonwealth praying that the Government remove section 127,  and the words discriminating against **aborigines** in section  51,  of the Commonwealth Constitution, by the holding of a referendum at an early date.

* How many **aborigines** were resident in Australia at the earliest date for which figures are available?

* In what year did the number of resident **aborigines** reach its peak?

* How many Aborigines are employed by the Commonwealth?

* What trust funds does his office administer on behalf of Aborigines.

* Is it a fact that the following industrial awards exclude Aborigines from their provisions - 
What other State and Federal awards exclude Aborigines?

* Members of the Parliamentary Labour Party in this chamber have been disturbed at their inability, since the Parliament first assembled this year, to obtain information on what is taking place in regard to policy on **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* He introduced a battery of legislation, which was summed up by the Melbourne " Age " in these words - 
The sweeping legislation introduced in the Northern Territory Legislative Council by the Director of Welfare  (Mr. Giese)  on Wednesday abolishes the concept of protective wardship for the majority of the Territory's 18,000 full-blood **aborigines** and would end at a stroke social and legal restrictions which have been represented for years as valuable and necessary.

* When we have examined the proposals that have been put before the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, we have been disturbed to see that the question of the wages paid to **aborigines** has been deferred to some undefined date in the future.

* The select committee on the grievances of Yirrkala **aborigines** found that no aboriginal in the Northern Territory receives the unemployment benefit and that tuberculosis allowance at the rate of 1 a week is paid to **aborigines** who, if they were Europeans, would receive the allowance at the rate of some 12 a week.

* The Government, through its officers in the Legislative Council, is sweeping away what might be called paternalistic legislation, but the ability of **aborigines** to dispense with paternal protection depends on their ability to support themselves with adequate wages.

* While **aborigines** receive inadequate wages the final impression given by the policy being pursued in the Northern Territory is that it ends up only with the prospects of ill-health, poverty and degradation.

* Witwaters Rand University, about Austraiian policy relating to **aborigines**.

* Aborigines have not been so employed in many cases and therefore they are not eligible.

* Of something like 5,000 **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, only about 50 receive award rates of a European standard.

* The Commonwealth itself is employing **aborigines** in a civil capacity in the armed forces at much less than award rates.

* It is also employing **aborigines** on settlements at less than award rates.

* There is a long and complicated statement by  Mr. Giese  which I do not propose to pursue, but the dramatic items that have been highlighted in the press are, first, that **aborigines** may drink alcohol and enter hotel bars; secondly, in native settlements drink will be made available under supervision; thirdly, **aborigines** may cohabit with Europeans without marrying them.

* The fourth proposal is a touching little one which provides that **aborigines** may buy methylated spirits provided an unpalatable additive goes into the fluid.

* Aborigines need access to the Arbitration Commission before they need access to the bar and the brothel.

* The press has been full of reports about **aborigines** being paid in cheap wine.

* The assumption underlying these priorities that have been submitted to the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory is that **aborigines** want the dregs of our civilization before they want what belongs to their dignity.

* Is it part of the cure of their underprivileged position that **aborigines** be paid decent wages?

* The Labour Party is concerned at the absence of policies designed to give equality in wages to **aborigines**, first, by the Commonwealth itself and then by private enterprise.

* The Government's latest proposals indicate in essence an intention to give up trying, or even starting to try, to give a real lift in the status of **aborigines**.

* camera team who comes to Australia can only form the final impression that the **aborigines** are grossly under-privileged in a very wealthy country, the Ministers perpetrated this statement from Darwin - 
The Conference noted with satisfaction the considerable progress made since 1961 in the removal of restrictive legislation applying only to **aborigines** and the announced intention of the several governments- to make further changes of this kind.

* It recognizes the need for retaining in the interests of **aborigines** some legislation which confers privileges or benefits on them, although the objective of all governments is to provide assistance or protection to all Australians without distinction of race.

* If the Ministers really believe, as the statement implies that they do, that the task before us is to bring the **aborigines** from a position of privilege and benefit not enjoyed by the community at large down to a position of equality with the rest of the community, then they have really moved past rational discussion.

* We can now, if we wish, interpret the doctrine of assimilation to ensure that the **aborigines** lose everything.

* Therefore, the **aborigines** should not have reserves.

* Therefore, on this reasoning, we can continue not to grant land to **aborigines** under section 112 of the Land Ordinance of the Northern Territory, just we we have not granted land to **aborigines** for the 70- odd years that the provision has been in existence.

* The proposal advanced to-day by the Opposition seeks the concentration of reforms, as a priority, on the economic status of **aborigines**.

* In 1961 members of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines heard evidence from pastoralists which had no strict bearing on voting rights but which has a value for the subject under discussion to-day.

* Those pastoralists were concerned lest voting rights led to equality of pay for **aborigines**.

* This Parliament needs to recognize that **aborigines** are paid desparately low wages but that they pay the same prices as everybody else.

* We ask for the **aborigines** to be provided with adequate housing, for adult training, and for the Commonwealth to end its policy of having no communication with **aborigines** who do not speak English.

* We ask for the **aborigines** to be accorded wages and conditions which are consistent with citizenship and inconsistent with exploitation.

* we have the same trouble that we have with regard to every other exception and qualification stated in section 51 of the Constitution concerning the Commonwealth's powers, for example, bounties, fisheries, State banking, medical services and **aborigines**.

* Another question that needs to be answered is the one raised by the honorable member for Kingston about Aborigines and their service, and I hope to be able to deal with that during the Committee stage.

* In what respects do the laws of the Australian Capital Territory concerning Aborigines fall short of the standards set by the International Labour Organisation Conventions (a) No.

* Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding the broad interpretation to which I have referred, section 16 is considered to be too restrictive in its present form, since it involves discrimination against coloured people, including **aborigines**, in our Australian community.

* For example, the Post Office, subject only to the normal employment provisions of the Public Service Act 1922-1960, employs **aborigines**, in various capacities, at post offices and telephone exchanges, or with line parties.

* The bill seeks, therefore, to remove these unwanted restrictions which, in effect, debar **aborigines** and other coloured people from employment on mail contract work and other employment performed in association with mail contracts.

* The question I raise is that of Australian **aborigines** and the legal difficulties in which they find themselves.

* Recently, a good deal of distress and concern has been caused by the conditions of some **aborigines** in Armidale, New South Wales.

* The Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck),  early in his career as a Minister, took the initiative on several occasions and called a national conference to discuss the problems of **aborigines**.

* **aborigines**.

* The Victorian Aborigines Welfare Board in its latest' report, made clear that housing is the greatest single need of these people.

* Reports from Armidale and Gunnedah, in New South Wales and from Western Australia, Queensland and wherever else **aborigines** reside, whether under the jurisdiction of Liberal-Country Party or Labour Governments establish that State governments cannot adequately handle this matter with the resources at their disposal.

* A national housing advance should be made to the States to help them meet the needs of **aborigines**.

* This has been interpreted, since federation, as placing the right to make laws concerning **aborigines** beyond the province of this Parliament.

* Only last year, the Government decided that it could make provision for **aborigines** in its social services legislation.

* The Victorian Government - it was a Liberal government - removed all restrictive legislation relating to **aborigines** from the statute-book.

* The Tasmanian Government, although it was directly concerned with only a few hundred **aborigines** on some of the islands to the north, removed restrictions in 1952, and this was a Labour government.

* The repatriation legislation has been altered about 40 times in 40 years; the social service legislation is altered every year and occasionally a couple of times ayear, but State legislation concerned with the welfare of **aborigines** remains static year after year, despite the growing concern of the community generally and the growing knowledge of social welfare ' requirements.

* The Queensland Director of Native Welfare may exempt **aborigines** from the provisions of the act, but, unfortunately - some of the 
I have no doubt that the director always has due respect for the duties of his office when exercising that right, but the fact is that he has power to take away from people of aboriginal descent the ordinary civil freedoms.

* The Queensland act gives almost unexampled powers over **aborigines**.

* The director is also the guardian of the **aborigines**' children, for section 18 of the Queensland act provides that the director shall be the legal guardian of every aboriginal child in the State while such child is under the age of 21 years.

* The section provides - 
Therefore, the director has power over freedom, property, children and the right of **aborigines** to marry.

* We must take steps to remove from the States the sole responsibility for the welfare of **aborigines**.

* For instance, the wages of **aborigines** may be taken from them and cared for on their behalf, and they are required to contribute to a welfare fund.

* It was this Government which extended the payment of social services to Aborigines, lt was this Government which eliminated from the means test any income received from property by pensioners.

* The figures for Europeans have been extracted from the relevant Commonwealth " Year Books ", while those for **aborigines** have been compiled by the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration, with the co-operation of the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages.

* For instance, why in the name of heaven, should the  16.000  **aborigines** of the Northern Territory rate much higher expenditure than the  25,000  **aborigines** of Western Australia - especially those of the north of Western Australia?

* How many of these persons (a) were not **aborigines** and (b) requested to be declared?

* How many adult **aborigines** have not been declared to be wards under the ordinance?

* Fifty **aborigines** are employed at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory.

* Because their work skills and output are below the general level of performance of other Australian workers, many **aborigines** are paid lower rates.

* The wage rates and conditions of employment for **aborigines** employed by the Department of the Army in Darwin have been determined by the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the Commander, Northern Territory Command, having regard to the average efficiency and work output of the **aborigines** concerned.

* The welfare of Aborigines in the States is the responsibility of the State Governments.

* This does not preclude Aborigines from receiving Commonwealth social service benefits where they are so qualified.

* The Prime Minister said also that whenever there was a referendum the people would be given an opportunity to repeal section 127 of the Constitution which excludes Aborigines in calculating the number of divisions in each State.

* The Prime Minister mentioned also the words in paragraph (xxvi) of section 51, the only other part of the Constitution in which Aborigines are mentioned.

* I can see the validity of the suggestion that there could be discrimination against Aborigines if this particular section of the Australian community can have laws passed about it by the Commonwealth Parliament whereas no other section can.

* It would be desirable for us to pass direct industrial laws repealing provisions of Commonwealth and State awards which exclude Aborigines from some benefits.

* The other reason I have changed my mind is that the Aborigines at this stage have a want of social capital which cannot be said to afflict any other section of the Australian community.

* There is, as regards Aborigines, the necessity for positive additional housing and social and educational measures, which does not apply to other sections of the community, and where this Parliament has the financial and national competence to apply, all-embracing co-ordinating measures on their behalf.

* The rights of Aborigines in the area have been protected in every way.

* The provisions in the agreement relating to the rights of Aborigines are on all fours with those contained in the agreement relating to the Groote Eylandt operation.

* These have proved very satisfactory and a number of Aborigines are employed in the Groote Eylandt operation at full award rates.

* The agreement relating to the Gove deposits will present employment opportunities for Aborigines in a very remote area where otherwise there would not be adequate employment, which is vital if their standard of living is to be improved.

* As my colleague, the Minister for National Development, has pointed out, development of the Gove bauxite deposits will provide splendid opportunities for advancement of the people of the Northern Territory, particularly the Aborigines.

* No doubt we shall be teaching them how to use it, but it would be foolish for us to decide to whom the grants of land should be made only to find that those people have no knowledge of how to use it, and I would be greatly surprised if at the moment there are any Aborigines who have knowledge of how the land should be used or who have the ability to use properly the land so granted.

* and its subsidiaries require (a) Aborigines, (b) Torres Strait Islanders, (c) other Australians, (d) New Guineans and (e) other persons to produce permits or other travel documents for flights (i) between States, (ii) within any State, (iii) between Territories, (iv) within any Territory and (v) between any State and Territory?

* What references to (a) the extinction of the Tasmanian **aborigines** and (b) Australian treatment of Australian mainland **aborigines** generally were made by  Mr. Khrushchev  at the recent United Nations General Assembly meetings?

* Was the issue of the **aborigines** taken up with the Prime Minister publicly or privately by the spokesman of any other power?

* What has been said, of course, applies in a way to the voting rights of the Australian **aborigines**.

* I desire to refer particularly to the voting rights of **aborigines**.

* The honorable member thought it was mean of the Opposition - that it was quibbling, that it was taking a mere technical point - in the face of the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the voting rights of **aborigines**, to press for the amendment that has been circulated.

* As 1 have said, the appointment of the committee is, psychologically, an admission that something ought to be done in relation to the voting rights of **aborigines**.

* The Labour Party sincerely believes that the **aborigines** of Australia have been done down on their just rights, and that they are entitled to this simple, basic civil right.

* To deny **aborigines** the right to vote is an injustice.

* We have in Australia at the moment a situation in which **aborigines** in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania - if any move to that State - and South Australia have the right to vote.

* Do we apply these tests to **aborigines** because they are nomadic?

* We know full well that many **aborigines** deprived of voting rights under these laws are not nomadic and are capable of handling their own affairs.

* It could well consider how the electoral system should function and how the duties imposed  on  electoral officers should be carried out, if we passed a law to give voting rights to all **aborigines**.

* Do we refrain from giving voting rights to **aborigines** because they are primitive?

* Since 1902, I think, **aborigines** in South Australia have had the right to vote.

* In South Australia, there are some thousand or more fairly primitive **aborigines**.

* The argument that **aborigines** should not have a vote is invalidated on that count.

* We have allowed the dead hand of history to restrain us in these matters, and we have allowed the judgment as to whether **aborigines** may vote to rest with the State parliaments.

* If the Queensland Parliament decided to-morrow that **aborigines** in Queensland could vote, those **aborigines** would be entitled to vote at the next federal election, select committee or no select committee.

* It was a bill to give full citizenship rights to **aborigines** in that State.

* Let us consider the position in Queensland, where a large number of sophisticated **aborigines** still come under the relevant act for various reasons.

* According to the honorable member for Bowman  (Mr. McColm),  there are 1,500 **aborigines** on Palm Island.

* The question of voting rights for **aborigines** is a simple straightforward one, and this Parliament should not hesitate to act.

* The select committee on the voting rights of **aborigines** has been given a date on which to submit its report to Parliament, but we say that may well be after this Parliament is dissolved.

* I do not think any other Minister who has had the responsibility of doing something for the **aborigines** of Australia has succeeded to the extent that the present Minister has.

* Here we have not only native people in differing states of development; these people live in States which have different problems to meet in respect of **aborigines**.

* The honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  has preached that we should give the **aborigines** full citizenship rights.

* 1 realize that he means well when he says that; but, after long experience of **aborigines**, I think that step would be disastrous for them.

* It might work out all right in southern Victoria, or in Tasmania or elsewhere, where the stage of development of the **aborigines** is advanced, but not in north Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia, although I have never been to Western Australia.

* I think such a policy would tend to degrade the **aborigines**.

* The right to vote would be meaningless to most **aborigines**.

* I do not think there are any nomadic **aborigines** in Queensland, although there may be some on Cape York Peninsula who could be classed as semi-nomadic.

* How are we to approach the problem of the **aborigines**?

* That is probably the greatest problem we have to face in raising the standards of living and life of the **aborigines**.

* I know from experience that the treatment of **aborigines** varies considerably from station to station.

* I have seen spectacular successes achieved by some station owners in the development of their **aborigines**.

* On the other hand, I have seen some frightful results of the treatment of **aborigines** on stations.

* Much can be done for **aborigines** on stations.

* When **aborigines** work on a station, in good conditions, some educational facilities should be provided, so that their children may be prepared for some other way of life, should they wish to follow it.

* I have mentioned two ways - and I have no doubt there are many other ways - in which **aborigines** could be enabled to establish themselves gradually in our community.

* Positive steps to ensure awareness in the community that implementation of the policy of assimilation is not possible unless advanced **aborigines** and part **aborigines** are received into the community and accepted without prejudice, and to ensure, as far as possible, that the community plays its full part.

* It is a way in which the people can make the assimilation of **aborigines** easier.

* I think it was the honorable member for Wills who said that the **aborigines** have nothing to be ashamed of.

* While people in other parts of the world continued to develop, the **aborigines**, remained at the Stone Age level, and it is a tremendous task for them to catch up in a comparitively few years.

* It means either, first, making the aboriginal people similar to us while preserving their entity as **aborigines**, or, secondly, absorbing them by intermarriage.

* At least it shows that the **aborigines** could be quickly assimilated.

* I think the honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson)  spoke of the expenditure per head on **aborigines** in the various States and in the Northern Territory.

* I think he said that the Commonwealth spent 45 a head per annum on **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, and that this compared adversely with the expenditure by the various States.

* I defer to his intimate knowledge of conditions in the Territory, but I suggest that in large areas of the Northern Territory, particularly in Arnhem Land, the **aborigines** live in their wild state, and that the comparison which he has made is hardly a fair one.

* This amendment, deleting a discrimination against the Aborigines, is welcomed by the Opposition.

* I take it that this amendment will mean that the Aborigines will be treated exactly the same as anyone else in relation to benefits throughout the Act.

* Whilst the nomadic and primitive type of Aborigines have tribal burials, there are other burials which will be conducted under the responsibility of the native welfare departments of the States.

* I would like the Minister to tell us whether in such circumstances the Aborigines will be paid the full amount of unemployment and sickness benefits as set out in the schedule to the Act, or whether they will receive some lesser amount based on their normal wages.

* Many Aborigines are employed on a seasonal basis.

* That is all I wanted to say in relation to Aborigines.

* I want to get the matters cleared up if I can because I am quite certain that I will receive many queries on these points as there are about 8,000 Aborigines living in my electorate.

* The population of the Northern Territory as at 30th June 1965 was 34,803 plus about 20,000 Aborigines, while the number of electors enrolled for the Territory was 17,565 as at the end of January this year.

* Reports of employment of Aborigines in northern Australia still show some disquieting features.

* To Monash University (Centre for Research into Aboriginal Affairs), for a survey of relations between Aborigines and others in selected towns ($5,000).

* I was a member of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines about 3 or 4 years ago and there were three or four members from each side of the chamber on the Committee.

* Although he had signed a recommendation late in 1963 that there should be a standing committee on **aborigines**, in early 1964 when we approached him as the Minister for Territories regarding the proposed committee he said that we did not need it now as we had a department to handle the matter.

* Proposals regarding mining were not made by the Company to the Aborigines.

* The decision to grant leases is therefore one for the Government which pays full regard to the interests and views of the Aborigines.

* Royalties in respect of all mining and forestry on Aboriginal reserves are to be paid to a Trust Fund which is to be used as directed by the Minister for Territories for the benefit of Aborigines.

* Is it a fact that in the north-west of Western Australia many unemployed Aborigines and also many whose low wages make them eligible for unemployment benefits are denied unemployment benefits because illiteracy prevents them from completing claim forms?

* Has his Department made it clear to the Native Welfare Department of Western Australia that the Aborigines should be advised of their entitlement?

* If the Aborigines are not being assisted in this way, does this lack of assistance by the Government encourage the creation of a pool of cheap Aboriginal labour in the north-west of Western Australia?

* and (2) Yes, insofar as it was possible to identify the particular persons as Aborigines for the purpose of the survey.

* Brown, minister in charge of the Church of England Parish at Casino, New South Wales, that several aboriginal families on the Tabulam **aborigines** reserve approximately 15 miles west of Casino had been forced to beg for food and clothing because of the action of his department in refusing them unemployment benefit payments?

* I refer to the many Aborigines who are at present idle, or practically so, and have little prospect of obtaining employment.

* On the Finucane Island job and associated works, where a large number of men are employed and more were required, I was astonished to hear that only two Aborigines were employed.

* While there would be many who would not be suitable there would also be plenty of Aborigines who could hold down a job if given the opportunity to do so, but there seems to be an inclination not to employ native labour because of their background of instability.

* Because of this it is most necessary that the Aborigines should be trained so that they can take their place in the field of employment.

* If he would take the time to go through the tomes of evidence tendered to the committee by **aborigines** he would find that they insisted on the right to enroll and the right to vote, with the full penalties attached for failure to do so.

* The committee was also told that 60 per cent, of the **aborigines** north of Cooktown were literate.

* For the time being at least let us preserve what we have in New South Wales and Victoria and try step by step and stage by stage, with sound education, to bring the **aborigines** in the rest of Australia into line with those in the advanced States.

* His Excellency then referred to a review of the present state of knowledge of the life, culture and history of the Australian **aborigines**, who are concentrated in northern Australia.

* First is the matter of substituting the word " Aborigines " for " Wards " in the name of the trust fund applicable to those people in the Northern Territory.

* in my own estimation, but it is not terribly easy to work out the exact amount spent on Aborigines, lt is difficult to isolate money spent on education within the general public education system and the sum spent on 'he Aboriginal portion of the population.

* I notice, on looking at another set of figures, that the population, exclusive of full-blood **aborigines**, rose from 10,868 in June, 1947, to 27,095 in June, 1961- the latest census figure.

* So, the Government would not be building up from scratch as it might be doing if it were attempting a similar programme among the Australian **aborigines**.

* The Minister could refer at that time to the fact that he is responsible for legislation which ensures that some royalties from the exploitation of these minerals will be paid into a fund for the benefit of the **aborigines**.

* The Minister can, therefore, rightly claim credit for the fact that, almost for the first time in history, a government in the Commonwealth of Australia has acknowledged that **aborigines** have some kind of entitlement to land in the Commonwealth.

* They have no title to land, but these **aborigines** were given, by legislation of which the Minister is the sponsor, certain rights to benefit from the proceeds of the exploitation of minerals found within the aboriginal reserve.

* Some weeks ago, when it was not thought likely that this debate would be resumed, it was considered on the Opposition side that there should be in the Commonwealth Parliament a revolutionary approach to the question of the position of **aborigines** in relation to reserves, and that an early opportunity should be sought for the Commonwealth Parliament to declare that in its opinion the time has come to create an aboriginal title to the land of the reserves of the Northern Territory, which are within the constitutional power of the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* Accordingly, to the Minister's motion that the paper be printed, on behalf of the Opposition I move - 
A form of selection by **aborigines** of trustees to conduct affairs arising from this title should be devised, and 
Meanwhile the safeguarding of aboriginal rights should be ensured by discussion with spokesmen for the **aborigines** of the Gove Peninsula area ".

* If the people who have been conquered live by a hunting economy, as the Red Indians of North America did, and as the **aborigines** of Australia did and do still to some extent, there is no title in land.

* But they were an agricultural people and the Australian **aborigines** were not.

* Since the first settlement in 1788, wethe European-descended people of the continent of Australia - have never acknowledged that **aborigines** have any entitlement at all to land.

* The proclamation by the Commonwealth of large reserves, some of them with great potential, as land for the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, will, of coures, mean nothing if systematically, when anything of any value is discovered in them, areas become excised from the aboriginal reserves and the **aborigines** have what is left.

* We should now define, so late in our history, what rights in land and property - when so much has been alienated, should be given to the **aborigines** in areas where the Commonwealth has constitutional responsibility.

* Although **aborigines** in the States do not come under the constitutional responsibility of the Commonwealth, **aborigines** of the Northern Territory are fully a Commonwealth responsibility.

* At the same time it was noteworthy that when he spoke of consulting with representatives of the **aborigines** of the Gove Peninsula area he accepted as representatives of the **aborigines** the missions of that area.

* The second part of my motion seeks the establishment of a form of selection by **aborigines** of trustees to conduct affairs arising from the creation of a title to land.

* We felt that in the meantime the safeguarding of aboriginal rights should be ensured by discussion with, spokesmen for the **aborigines** of the Gove Peninsula area.

* We may be doing the Minister a complete injustice in assuming, that he has not consulted spokesmen for the **aborigines** in the Gove Peninsula area.

* Therefore, we may be misunderstanding the Minister in assuming that consultation with **aborigines** did not take place.

* We are admitting that this land has been set aside; that the Government may exclude from it influences that it considers may be undesirable for the **aborigines**.

* Now that the Select Committee of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory has reported on the matters into which it inquired concerning the employment of **aborigines**, the conditions of employment, the wages paid and so on, will the Minister say what the Government's policy is in regard to the report?

* a week is a sufficient wage to pay to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory?

* .- I think it is rather wrong of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Whitlam)  to get up in the committee and assume that he is putting a case for the Opposition because Opposition members alone believe that the **aborigines** should get a vote.

* I wish to point out, first, that the Government has stated that it will appoint a select committee of this Parliament to investigate this matter of a vote for **aborigines**.

* At that time certain **aborigines** were chained in the north-west of Western Australia and within 24 hours Molotov was using that in the United Nations and we were saying, " Our aboriginal policy is a domestic matter ".

* By the Bill recently submitted to the House, we amended the legislation to provide that certain defined classes of Aborigines may be liable for service.

* Nevertheless, I can assure the honorable member that in the meantime any Aborigines wishing to serve can volunteer for registration and service.

* Such Aborigines will be required to pass the same educational and physical tests as other people being taken into the Services.

* Articulate and sophisticated **aborigines** have come to regard these sections as being discriminatory against them.

* Section 51, placitum (xxvi), now reads - 
The main interest of the convention of 1891 was not directed at the prohibition against the Commonwealth to legislate for **aborigines**, and, assuming that New Zealand would join the federation, at any prohibition against the Commonwealth's passing legislation for Maoris.

* The references to **aborigines** and Maoris in the proposed section of the constitution were almost overlooked.

* The power to repatriate the Pacific islands peoples was a temptation to some to suggest the deportation of **aborigines** because at that time it was suggested that we might send all the **aborigines** in Australia to New Guinea.

* Some other delegates, such as  Sir John  Forrest, envisaged the Commonwealth pushing **aborigines** around, and he was opposed to the Commonwealth having any powers resting upon considerations of colour or race.

* As the section was primarily aimed at the scandal of Pacific islands labour recruitment, the references to **aborigines** and Maoris were entirely protective and designed to ensure that they were outside the scope of legislation designed to deal with the presence of an abducted alien group living in depressed labour conditions.

* We have seen how, after nearly 50 years in which the section had been interpreted so as to deprive **aborigines** of age pensions and other more lately introduced social service benefits, the Commonwealth reversed its attitude and decided to grant those benefits.

* These words are regarded by many **aborigines** as an insult, and, as they see the meaning of the words, they are entitled to their views.

* These words have been interpreted so as to deprive **aborigines** of benefits, and these considerations, therefore, in the view of the Opposition, justify the proposal that the words should go from the Constitution.

* Those obligations are borne by the **aborigines**, but the **aborigines** do not share the rights.

* Dr. Cockburn of the South Australian delegation feared that the section would prevent **aborigines** on the South Australian electoral rolls from voting in Commonwealth elections once the Commonwealth was established, but he was assured that the existing rights of **aborigines** would be protected; in other words, that they would not be affected.

* An anomaly was not merely allowed to exist but indeed was emphasized, because whereas aliens are to-day counted when population is determined for the purpose of allocating parliamentary seats to the States, enfranchised **aborigines** are not counted.

* The conventions of 1891 and 1897 were confronted with the fact that in no State was the enumeration of **aborigines** complete.

* They had no data, they had no basis for obtaining data; they just thought that they knew how many **aborigines** there were in Queensland, and that is what they told the convention.

* Western Australia counted only **aborigines** in contact with Europeans, and there were many nomad **aborigines**, many myall **aborigines** in those days, who were never in contact with Europeans.

* Under those circumstances, the **aborigines** were excluded from the census because a census was regarded as impossible.

* Today, a census is possible and the section can only be construed as meaning that **aborigines** do not count as people of the Commonwealth.

* I emphasize that all **aborigines** have voting rights to-day, so the deletion of section 127 is obviously long over-due as it no longer serves a purpose and can only be read as an insult.

* Not only do we inside this country who have done nothing to effect alterations to the Constitution feel guilty and feel that we should apologize to the **aborigines** for the treatment they have received from the Commonwealth over 60 years in the deprivation of their rights, but we cannot divorce ourselves from the international scene to-day.

* Because of the social service benefits which the Commonwealth is now paying to **aborigines**, because of the treatment they are getting at the hands of the Commonwealth and State authorities, the aboriginal population is growing again.

* It was estimated the other day by the distinguished anthropologist,  Dr. Stanner,  that in two generations Australia will have 300,000 **aborigines**, which is about the number that occupied the country when Captain Cook landed at Botany Bay in 1770.

* The **aborigines** are not a dying race; they are not being absorbed, or assimilated, however you like to describe it, and there are many educated and sophisticated **aborigines** who want to see their race preserved intact, who do not want it absorbed by the majority of Australians.

* The honorable member is in order in referring to the select committee appointed to inquire into the granting of a vote to **aborigines** provided he relates his remarks to the clause under discussion.

* It must be remembered that both the Chifley Government and the Curtin Government were in office during a very difficult war period and were not then able to do anything about the **aborigines** because of the many other pressing problems requiring attention.

* Now, the Labour Party is living up to its responsibilities and urging that Australian **aborigines** be given the right to vote at federal elections.

* In the home State of the Minister for the Interior - Western Australia - the Hawke Labour Government sought to give **aborigines** the right to vote in connexion with the election of members to the lower House but the proposal was strenuously opposed by the conservative upper House in which the majority of the members represented the same party as that represented in this chamber by the Minister for the Interior.

* The principle is that the **aborigines** of Australia should have the right to vote, and that is the principle of the amendment moved by the Opposition.

* We believe that all **aborigines** in this country should have the right to vote in elections for both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

* k. - In the answer to a question asked by the honorable member for Werriwa  (Mr. Whitlam)  on 23rd October regarding the number of **aborigines** employed by the Northern Territory Administration and the average wage paid to them, an error was made in certain figures.

* The question was in the following terms: - 
How many **aborigines** are employed by the Northern Territory Administration?

* There are approximately 1,330 **aborigines** employed al present by the Administration of lue Northern Territory.

* Of 29 **aborigines** employed by the Northern Territory Administration (apart from Welfare Branch) eight receive full award rates and conditions in accordance with the classification in which they are employed.

* Three **aborigines** employed by the Welfare Branch are employed on full Public Service or award rales and conditions.

* Other **aborigines** employed by the Welfare Branch on government settlements receive from CI to 13 10$.

* Aborigines on the minimum wage of 1 per week und keep arc slow, aged and infirm.

* A substantial sum of money might have been devoted to the Aborigines of this country.

* When the committee to consider voting rights for **aborigines** was at Roper River, for instance, it appeared - and I am not an expert - that minor damming works on that river could make available an irrigation area there.

* Australians have to get out of their minds the fixed idea that the **aborigines** are dying out.

* They are not dying out, and by the end of this century we might well have 150,000 to 200,000 full-blood **aborigines** at the present rate of increase.

* Marriage is taking place at normal ages and as a result the **aborigines** are having normal families and are no longer a dying race.

* Will he withdraw the Commonwealth Electoral Bill  1961,  which is on the notice-paper, and which is in virtually the same terms as was the bill which he introduced last year, and will he introduce another measure which will in the meantime ensure that Australian **aborigines** will have the same right to enrol and vote at federal elections as is given to all other Australians?

* After all, he was not chosen by the Labour Party to be a member of the select committee which inquired into the question of voting rights for **aborigines**, although I understand he was very anxious to be a member of it.

* During his speech, apparently to show his knowledge of the subject, he referred to the freedom of the **aborigines** in Victoria and Tasmania.

* According to the latest Commonwealth Year Book, there are no **aborigines** in Tasmania now and on the 1954 figures there were only 141 **aborigines** in Victoria.

* The honorable member particularly criticized Queensland for its restrictive laws relating to **aborigines**, but Queensland is the State with the longest history of government by the Labour Party.

* Labour governments in that State never did anything, in all those years, to ease the position of the **aborigines**.

* All the restrictions on **aborigines** which the honorable member for Wills mentioned were devised, to a degree, to protect these people, but the regulations are outmoded to-day, and they are being changed.

* We passed legislation recently to give **aborigines** the right to vote.

* I believe we are going along splendidly in solving the problems of the **aborigines**.

* The committee on aboriginal voting rights gave a considerable amount of publicity to the plight of **aborigines** in Australia.

* That is the road we must tread, so that the **aborigines** eventually will feel they have full equality in the community.

* I know that there are people - some of them in Australia - who constantly foment the idea that this nation has ill-treated its **aborigines**.

* I did not, in my statement, talk about our treatment of **aborigines** in terms of what goes on in some other countries.

* The Labour Government introduced this provision about **aborigines** who had been members of the defence forces.

* It is true that some of these **aborigines** may vote Liberal.

* The point is we either believe or do not believe that **aborigines** are ready now to exercise the right to vote.

* To-day the total population of the Northern Territory, excluding full-blooded **aborigines**, is  27,095.

* The number of persons at present on the electoral roll will be increased very shortly following the passage of an electoral bill, which we shall discuss during this session, to give votes to **aborigines**.

* According to the  1961  census there are  15,448  full-blooded **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* In any case, the aboriginal content of the population will increase more rapidly with the passing of the years than we at first imagined, and particularly so since we first discussed the question of giving **aborigines** a vote.

* The wage rates and conditions of employment for the Aborigines employed in the Northern Territory are not the subject of an industrial award, but are determined by the Administrator of the Northern Territory and the Commander, Northern Territory Command.

* The Electoral Branch does not distinguish between European and Aboriginal electors and the number of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who have enrolled is not known, nor is it possible to say precisely how many have not enrolled.

* In the last few days honorable members opposite have fired a barrage of questions at the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  about the conditions of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* But the tenor of the questions indicates that the Opposition is influenced strongly by left wing ,or Communist thinking because if we turn to the "Tribune" of 12th February this year- 
This apt statement by Paul Robeson, famous Negro rights leader and singer, has been used as a foreword of a Communist draft policy on the Aborigines of Australia.

* Dependable estimates of the number of **aborigines** in Australia are available only for very recent years.

* The latest estimate by the Commonwealth Statistician is that there were 39,319 full-blood **aborigines** in Australia as at 30th June, 1954.

* At the census taken at the same date, 31,359 half-caste **aborigines** were recorded.

* So the Aborigines as well as the other Australians are not missing much in respect of those payments.

* So it would be idle to suggest that there is much benefit for the Aborigines in these allowances, lt is amazing that the Government has not seen fit to increase benefits in this field for a generation when it is a matter of such vital importance to our population.

* But the honorable member stated that I was not available when the select committee on the voting rights of **aborigines** came through my electorate.

* I interrupted the honorable member during his speech and said that these islanders were not **aborigines**, and the Minister for the Interior  (Mr. Freeth)  and the honorable member said that they were regarded as **aborigines** for the purposes of the act.

* These islanders should not be confused with **aborigines**.

* In support of the honorable member for Swan, I shall give an illustration to show that it is very difficult to absorb the **aborigines** into our way of living.

* The lad went to a state school and became a very fine athlete, yet when he became 22 years of age he drifted back to the **aborigines**.

* They were always willing to accept him, but he drifted back to the **aborigines**, although he had had no connexion with them over the years.

* I believe that the Torres Strait Islanders will appreciate the vote that is to be given them under this bill, but I do not think that the **aborigines** will appreciate it quite as much.

* Then I am sure that if that fact is made known to them the **aborigines** will not register as voters.

* I am confident that if we make known to the **aborigines** the fact that they will be liable to the same penalties as the ordinary citizen if they fail to vote after having enrolled as voters, not many of them will enroll.

* We have only to compare the relationship between the Australian Government and the people of Papua and New Guinea with the relationship between the Australian Government and its own Aborigines to realise this.

* In the 1890's when one talked of the **aborigines** there was presented to the people a fairly definite picture of a group of people who were still living in a very primitive condition, who were still living apart and in fact rather detached and even segregated from the main body of the population.

* At that time when you mentioned **aborigines** in the way that section 127 refers to them it was easy to know what you were talking about - you were talking about this detached and even segregated group of people.

* When you talk of **aborigines** to-day, precisely what do you mean?

* My friend, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr. Collard),  will be aware of people in his vast electorate who are still in a nomadic and primitive state, but in other parts of the Commonwealth there are people referred to as **aborigines** who in fact are living exactly the same type of life and enjoying the same material circumstances and citizenship rights as any other Australian.

* The honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  mentioned by name a couple of people to whom he referred as **aborigines** and whom I also happen to know.

* In my view they are not **aborigines** at all; they are citizens of Australia, subject to no restriction of any kind.

* We have to realize that as a result of these historic changes the people who to-day are glibly referred to as **aborigines** in fact are subject to no limitations on the exercise of their citizenship; they are living as other Australians and are not affected by the kind of arguments that honorable members of the Opposition have used.

* I said explicitly that it is regrettable that we have not caught up with the historic changes that have taken place since the 1890's, and I was trying to bring to their understanding the nature of these historic changes which have meant that to-day one cannot use a glib term like " **aborigines** " and believe it refers only to one group of people.

* As 1 see it, the tendency in Australia to-day is not to make special legislation affecting **aborigines** but to reduce as much as we can any special legislation that does apply to them.

* If part of section 51 is repealed in the way suggested by the honorable member by simply deleting the words relating to the aboriginal race it would mean that this Parliament, concurrently with the Parliaments of the States, would have power to pass special legislation affecting **aborigines**.

* My belief is that we do not want special power to make laws affecting **aborigines**.

* I refer to the fact that this bill prevents, as last year's bill prevented, **aborigines** from voting for this Parliament if they live in Queensland, Western Australia or the Northern Territory.

* This bill will repeal that sub-section of the act and insert a new section which will deny the vote to Australian **aborigines** in the same circumstances as the vote was denied to all **aborigines** previously.

* The obnoxious thing about the original enactment and the re-enactment is that the vote is being denied to **aborigines** because they are **aborigines**.

* The vote is not being denied to Australian citizens, as **aborigines** are, because they are nomadic, illiterate, spendthrift, unhygienic or for any of the reasons which are commonly advanced for depriving **aborigines** of the vote.

* If this sub-section is not re-enacted, **aborigines** and other Australians will not be able to vote if they are nomadic because people, can enrol, and therefore vote, only if they have a real place of living.

* So, under the act **aborigines** would not be able to vote if they were nomadic.

* Aborigines should not be denied the vote on the ground that in some cases they may be illiterate, because other Australians are not denied the vote on that ground.

* No Australians other than **aborigines** are denied the vote or are prevented from enrolling because they may be spendthrift, unhygienic and so on.

* Hitherto and, if the Government has its way, in future we shall deny the vote to **aborigines** if they live in Queensland, Western Aus  tralia and the Northern Territory.

* I am indebted to the honorable member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr. J. R. Fraser)  for the information that **aborigines** can cast completely valid votes.

* There is one polling place at Wreck Bay in his electorate where some scores of **aborigines** are enrolled and vote.

* We plead constantly that the Constitution does not permit us to count **aborigines** in the census upon which the distribution of seats is based, and that this Parliament cannot pass laws concerning **aborigines**.

* A couple of years ago the Constitutional Review Committee recommended unanimously that the section precluding **aborigines** from being counted in the census should be repealed.

* Aborigines should be counted in the census, and the distribution for this Parliament should be based on a count of all citizens of Australia, including **aborigines**.

* It is anomalous, as well as unnecessary, for us to deprive **aborigines** of the vote if they do not have the vote for some State parliaments, and to grant them the vote if they have it for other State parliaments.

* At the moment, the **aborigines** who have not been gazetted as wards in the Northern Territory - that is, the only **aborigines** who have a vote for the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory and the House of Representatives in this Parliament - number  71.

* That means that only  19  **aborigines** are en titled to vote on the ground that they were never declared as wards.

* It is highly illustrative of the paternal attitude which has obtained in recent years in the Northern Territory that although **aborigines** can have the right to vote we deny it to them by administrative action.

* It is true that **aborigines** are not the only persons who can be declared to be wards, but has anybody heard of a person other than an aboriginal being declared to be a ward under that ordinance?

* There is no compulsion on the Administration to declare **aborigines** as wards but, as a settled administrative policy, every aboriginal is automatically declared to be a ward in the Northern Territory and is thus deprived of his suffrage.

* Does anybody believe that there are only nineteen **aborigines** in the Northern Territory who live as do the rest of the Australian community?

* Are we to believe that there are only nineteen **aborigines** there who can read, write, earn their livings and conduct themselves in an assimilated or integrated manner?

* There is no question that the world as a whole will think that Australia is falling down on its obligations until it gives **aborigines** a vote for both Houses of this Parliament, in every State and in both Territories.

* I repeat that these recommendations were unanimous as was the recommendation concerning the census of **aborigines**.

* I'n dealing with that subject, the Constitutional Review Committee had this to say - 
What is the infant mortality rate for (a) Europeans and (b) **aborigines** in the Northern Territory?

* Does the Department of the Army employ **aborigines** at any place on terms different from those upon which other Australians are employed?

* If so, (a) how many **aborigines** are employed, &lt;b) at what places are they employed, (c) what wages are they paid, and (d) what are the current rates paid to other Australians?

* If the rates paid to **aborigines** are lower than those paid to Australians, why is this so?

* Does the Department of Air employ **aborigines** at any place on terms different from those upon which other Australians are employed?

* If so, (a) how many **aborigines** are employed, (b) at what places are they employed, (c) what wages are they paid and (d) what are the current rates paid to other Australians?

* If the rates paid to **aborigines** are lower than those paid to other Australians, why is this so?

* How many full-blood **aborigines** are employed in Commonwealth departments in Western Australia?

* In which departments are these **aborigines** employed, and what is the nature of the work on which they are employed?

* He has suggested that we should, not press this amendment because a select committee is to be appointed to consider the- claim that we are making on behalf of the **aborigines** and the proposal that they should have the same electoral rights as other people have.

* Government supporters  aTe  discriminating inexcusably against **aborigines** who are resident outside Commonwealth territories.

* If it is right that the **aborigines** should be qualified for a vote for the National Parliament in one part of Australia, they should be qualified in other parts of this country.

* What is the actual maximum salary for male certificated assistants in (a) Northern Territory schools under the South Australian Education Department and (b) Northern Territory schools for Aborigines?

* Did the Administrator of the Northern Territory visit Yirrkala on Saturday, 9th October 1965, to confer with Aborigines there?

* If so, with what Aborigines did he confer?

* Were the Aborigines represented by their own legal counsel?

* Many of the clauses of the old act which had discriminatory provisions with relation to **aborigines** do not apply under the new act, and the present position is that only so far as liquor is concerned is there any restraint upon **aborigines**.

* It is also provided in the act that training programmes for men and women shall be implemented much more fully than in the past and the Aborigines Department (now to.

* - While there have been no amendments to the Native Welfare Act since 1960, the amendments made in 1960, enabling land to be provided to **aborigines** for industrial, commercial and domestic purposes as well as for agricultural and pastoral purposes, have now been brought into effective operation.

* Administrative action has also been taken to make additional assistance for housing available for **aborigines**, and to finance all forms of education for **aborigines**, including university education.

* Perhaps the Aborigines, with the highest rate of infant mortality, tuberculosis and leprosy of any identifiable ethnic group in the world, thought they were living in some kind of lotus land.

* Aborigines exert no political pressure, so they have been ignored.

* Ninety per cent of the Australian people said emphatically that they believe the Commonwealth should take greater initiatives in securing a fair deal for Aborigines.

* Assuming that we get the co-operation of the Opposition in passing certain legislation which is now before this Parliament, the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory will be as qualified to vote as other adult residents and will, of course, have to be counted as electors.

* The present population of the Northern Territory is something of the order of 27,000 persons who are not wards of the State - normal citizens - and about 17,000 persons who are wards of the State because of their need for special care and assistance as **aborigines**.

* If the bill that is now before the House with respect to voting by **aborigines** is accepted by the Parliament - and we hope it will be - it is our calculation that the number of eligible adult **aborigines**, of all conditions, would be about 9,600.

* If the bill before the House relating to votes for **aborigines** is passed it will apply to the Northern Territory.

* If he maintains that advice, we will remedy the matter in the way he suggests, but it is our intention that the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory should be able to vote.

* If all adult **aborigines** in the Northern Territory become eligible for enrolment, but enrolment is not compulsory and they can choose, it is our guess - and it can be no more than a guess -  that probably about 6,000 names will be added to the roll.

* The salient features of this bill follow the unanimous findings of an all-party select committee of this House which inquired into voting rights for **aborigines**.

* Aboriginal witnesses before the committee which inquired into voting rights for **aborigines** were overwhelming in their insistence that they should be treated as equals.

* Yet these have been the governing conditions for **aborigines** in the Northern Territory up to the present time.

* The **aborigines**' standard of social habit and behaviour is another condition which now exists in the Northern Territory.

* To say that **aborigines** cannot rise to the height of taking degrees is, of course, quite false.

* The committee travelled over 22,000 miles and met nomadic as well as advanced **aborigines**.

* The **aborigines** themselves expressed views which they dearly held.

* They were **aborigines** from all walks of life.

* But I should like to emphasize that it is necessary to ensure that facilities will be provided for **aborigines** throughout Australia to enroll and to vote.

* For some considerable time past it has been the law of this country that those who serve in the armed forces shall be entitled to enroll and to vote, but that right has not been made clear to the **aborigines** who possessed it.

* On Bathurst Island  a  test was made of the capacity of the **aborigines** there to record a vote, after some information had been imparted to them.

* Let me say in reply to the honorable gentleman who interjects that I am sure that, at federal elections, **aborigines** would vote for the honorable member for Macquarie, as undoubtedly they vote for the honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson),  who has represented them so well in this place.

* The committee found that **aborigines** in the Northern Territory knew the name of their federal member.

* We know that voting itself will not solve all their problems; that it is only the beginning of our approach to them, but I am satisfied that once the **aborigines** have been granted the right to vote, a great deal of interest will be shown in them by political parties, who will cultivate them because they possess the right to vote.

* And, because they possess the right to vote, the **aborigines** will be able to obtain relief in many of their difficulties.

* By " pressure " I mean the capacity of white people to induce the **aborigines** on a particular settlement to do just as the white man wants them to do.

* One pastoralist in Western Australia told him that he had some 60 **aborigines** working for him, and that if he liked he could induce them all to vote for the political party which he supported, and he was a man with strong political views.

* The committee found that the **aborigines** sought the right to vote as a badge or symbol of equality.

* We are gaining uniformity for the whole of Australia, but at the same time the **aborigines** of some States will lose certain advantages which they have enjoyed hitherto.

* For instance, when we were at Papunya, one of the outposts of the Northern Territory, we found that certain nomadic **aborigines** had not been included in the list of wards.

* This question of the enrolment of all **aborigines** is a very vexed one that has concerned many governments over several years.

* For instance, in some States the **aborigines** have a vote, whilst in others they have not.

* In Queensland, there are a few hundred full-blooded **aborigines** at most still living, but the aboriginal problem in Queensland', New South Wales and Victoria is a problem of the mixed whites more than one of pure-blood **aborigines**.

* Our federal conference last week laid down a policy in respect of **aborigines**.

* It is important that there should be no discrimination in our Constitution against **aborigines**, in respect of counting them or in any other way, and the Constitutional Review Committee has recommended that that provision be taken out of the Constitution.

* I have made my point about **aborigines**.

* It is completely out of harmony with experience and modern thinking and, indeed, with a great deal of our own legislation in this Parliament relating to Aborigines.

* The retention of the old fashioned provision in section  127  is quite out of harmony with the elevation of the Aborigines into the ranks of citizenship.

* Section  51  states - 
It has been suggested that that provision discriminates against the Aborigines of Australia.

* All we have to do now is to cross out this reference " other than the aboriginal race " and we confer on this Parliament a power to make a special law which relates to the Aborigines and 10 no other people.

* Would this enable the Parliament to set up a separate body of industrial laws relating to Aborigines or some other kind of law - health laws, quarantine laws or laws under any of the other powers of the Parliament?

* Does the Department of Air employ **aborigines** at any place on terms different from those upon which other Australians are employed?

* The Department of Air does employ **aborigines** in the Northern Territory on terms different from those upon which other Australians are employed.

* I ask the Minister for Territories: First, is it a fact that he is not aware that **aborigines** are employed in the Northern Territory on discriminatory wages?

* What are the State and Territory requirements which the Minister had in mind in answering my question on 18th May 1965 ("Hansard", page 1619) and which the airlines check where (a) Aborigines, (b) Torres Strait Islanders, (c) other Australians, (d) NewGuineans and (e) other persons intend to travel (i) between States, (ii) within any State, (iii) between Territories, (iv) within any Territory and (v) between any State and Territory.

* The missions and the Aborigines were consulted and the agreement with the company was made with the full co-operation of all concerned.

* These royalties are paid into a trust fund for the benefit of all the Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* The interests of the Aborigines are fully protected by provisions written into the agreement signed by the company.

* This morning honorable members debated the plight of our **aborigines**.

* In the present instance, although many of us have paid a great deal of attention to legislation on matters associated with Aborigines, including repatriation benefits and so on, most of us did not notice the anomalies that occurred in this field.

* Aborigines often support Communists because Communists say a lot of the things the Aborigines want said.

* But Communists frac- tionalise - and they often manipulate the Aborigines for their own purposes.'

* He- 

 .- Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies),  in discussing one section of the Constitution referring to Aborigines which may be amended, used the word " discrimination ".

* It is of no use for any honorable member to stand in this place and say that there should be no discrimination with respect to Aborigines, when the plain, unvarnished truth is that we now discriminate.

* In the Northern Territory, only 50 out of 5,000 **aborigines** receive award rates of pay.

* Federal arbitration awards specifically deprive fullblood Aborigines of award rates.

* What is the sense of saying that we must not amend section 51 (xxvi) of the Constitution, because that provision protects the Aborigines against discrimination?

* Queensland totally deprives fullblood Aborigines of the right to vote.

* of our Constitution guarantees that we shall not interfere with the policy of any State on Aborigines.

* The policy of any State that likes to reverse our present trend and totally deprive Aborigines of any meaningful citizenship rights, including the right to vote, is beyond the power of this Parliament to deal with.

* I do not suggest that we want this power to safeguard citizenship as a means of fighting the States, but I do suggest that a whole series of discriminatory laws with respect to Aborigines is necessary.

* Aborigines have been occupying land in various parts of Australia since time immemorial.

* At the same time, we content ourselves with this mealy mouthed statement that we do not discriminate against Aborigines.

* I can never join in the righteous denunciations of South Africa that we hear in this House, because, from what I have seen in South Africa, the material conditions of the natives there are immeasurably higher than the material standards of the Aborigines of Australia.

* There is a case for the Commonwealth Parliament to have power in rela tion to Aborigines.

* Those of us who travelled over much of Australia and studied the conditions of Aborigines as members of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines realise that anyone who would say that the States have been doing a marvellous job is either very blind or very complacent.

* of section 51 of the Constitution is amended, Aborigines can have no effective Australian citizenship.

* There is sometimes difficulty in determining the ancestry of these ex-servicemen and it appears that some pensions have been granted to mainland Aborigines who served in the special units in ignorance of the fact that the persons concerned were not covered by definition.

* Aborigines.

* How many of the 5,118 Aborigines who registered for employment during the 12 months to 28th June 1968 were found employment with (a) State and (b) Commonwealth Departments, and what was the number found in each Department.

* No knowledge is held by my Department of the procedure followed by the Western Australian Government in regard to Aborigines discharged from Derby Leprosarium.

* The effect of this amendment taken in conjunction with the definition of " pensioner " in the National Health Act 1953-64 is that Aborigines who are eligible for a social service pension are, in general, enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service, subject to their qualifying under the Pensioner Medical Service means test applicable to all pensioners.

* Many Aborigines are provided with medical services without charge, e.g., at Northern Territory hospitals conducted by the Commonwealth, and in such cases the issue of Pensioner Medical Service entitlement cards is unnecessary.

* This information is not available as no separate figures are kept in relation to the number of Aborigines enrolled in the Pensioner Medical Service.

* The honorable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr. Collard)  went to some lengths to present a very able case for the work that is being done by the Commonwealth Electoral Office to try to educate the Aborigines to take an active part in election campaigns by casting an intelligent and informed vote.

* He mentioned that officers of the Electoral Office had been out in the Aboriginal areas, had spoken to the Aborigines, had carried out mock elections and had tried to educate the Aborigines; but there had been no follow up of this exercise in order to educate them further.

* Officers go around the mission stations and settlements trying to educate the Aborigines in our voting system, so that they can cast an intelligent vote.

* Indeed, at this very moment an officer of my Department is in the eastern division of the Kalgoorlie electorate, educating the Aborigines, encouraging them to participate in elections and helping them to cast an informed vote.

* If so, will he - (a) ask the PostmasterGeneral to request the Australian Broadcasting Commission to cease using this term, which, in the last few days, has been used on five occasions; (b) publicize in the press of Australia and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea the desire to have the term eliminated; and (c) take the necessary action to eliminate the description of Australian **aborigines** as " natives "?

* Is it a fact that pensions paid under the Social Services Act to Aborigines in the Port Hedland district and other parts of Western Australia are paid through District Welfare Officers?

* Do Welfare Officers sometimes retain or withhold pensions or part of pensions due to Aborigines; if so, for what reasons is this done?

* What reasons prevent direct payments being made to Aborigines as is done in the case of nonAboriginal pensioners?

* Is there any provision whereby people of European descent are paid pensions through an intermediatory or is this indirect system of payment confined to Aborigines?

* Does this practice involve discrimination against Aborigines?

* Report from the Select Committee appointed to inquire into Voting Rights of Aborigines, together with the Minutes of Proceedings of the Committee and Minutes of Evidence.

* by leave - In addition to the matters considered under the terms of reference given by the House to this committee, the committee had perforce to look into the whole range of activities of **aborigines** in Australia.

* The minutes of evidence that have been produced contain what we consider to be the most comprehensive survey of **aborigines** conducted by a committee in the Commonwealth of Australia.

* We hope that the thoughts contained in it will be studied and will be put into effect by those people in authority over the **aborigines** in the States and the Commonwealth and by those who have the welfare of the **aborigines** at heart.

* There are approximately 1,330 **aborigines** employed at present by the Administration of tile Northern Territory.

* Of 29 **aborigines** employed by the Northern Territory Administration (apart from Welfare Branch) eight receive full award rates and conditions in accordance with the classification in which they are employed.

* Three **aborigines** employed by the Welfare Branch are employed on full Public Service or award rates and conditions.

* Other **aborigines** employed by the Welfare Branch on government settlements receive from 1 to 3 10s.

* Aborigines on the minimum wage of 1 per week and keep are slow, aged and infirm.

* by leave - I have asked for leave to make this statement because it has come to my knowledge that a good deal of misleading information is being passed around concerning the effect on the life of the **aborigines** of the Gove Peninsula of the granting of mining leases over bauxite deposits, with a requirement for the early commencement of mining and the eventual development of an alumina plant.

* We all deeply respect the motives and the warmth of sympathy of most of those Australians who have the welfare of the **aborigines** at heart, and I do not question for a moment the genuine concern of such persons.

* The Arnhem Land Reserve for **aborigines** totals 35,000 square miles.

* It was created in 1931 at a time when official policy for those **aborigines** who were still tribal nomads was to protect them from contact with other Australians by keeping them apart on inviolable reserves.

* In negotiating the terms of the mining leases in the Gove Peninsula we have kept in mind several different interests of the **aborigines**.

* Basically we have tried to ensure that no social evils will have a harmful effect on the **aborigines** either as individuals or as a community, and that the work of the Yirrkala mission, in sheltering, guiding and inspiring them, can continue undisturbed for the benefit of the community centred on the mission.

* In the negotiations of the leases and agreements for mining development we have relied on the Director of Welfare and his officers in the Northern Territory, who are in close touch with the aboriginal people themselves, to advise us on what conditions should be imposed to serve the interests of the **aborigines**.

* The Methodist Board of Missions has agreed to a statement of measures safeguarding the interests of the **aborigines**.

* It is of public interest to know that the General Secretary of the Methodist Board of Missions, a gentleman who, both personally and with his family, has had a long and compassionate interest in this field of work, in informing me that the board had accepted this statement, wrote as follows: - 
We feel that there are going to be many problems, some of them perhaps grievous ones, arising in our work with the **aborigines** in this area.

* We trust that if difficult situations arise from time to time as the venture proceeds we will be able to reach amicable agreement on the best course to follow for the welfare of the **aborigines**.

* I turn now to describe what has been done to protect the interest of the **aborigines**.

* Excision was regarded as the most practical way of handling the administrative arrangements to be made both in respect of the mining venture and the welfare of the **aborigines**.

* protecting completely the access of **aborigines** at all times to the leased land; 
A collateral letter accompanying the lease contains agreed provisions designed to ensure that the **aborigines** and the mission shall participate in the benefits of employment and the benefits of supplying requirements to the mining operation.

* These provisions include the training of **aborigines** for skilled labour.

* On the request of, and after discussion with the Administrator of the Northern Territory, the lessee will make available to the mission arable areas or areas of religious significance to **aborigines** within the boundaries of the special mineral leases, and if required will surrender such areas from the mineral leases.

* The lessee will, in consultation with the Administrator and the mission, make rules for the conduct of its employees towards the **aborigines**.

* It will be seen that exceptional measures have been taken to protect the welfare of the **aborigines** and to give them a full opportunity to share in the benefits of the development.

* At a conservative estimate, if the full plans for the Gove development are realized, this trust fund might well reach a total of 4,000,000 for the benefit of **aborigines**.

* In the immediate present, as an earnest of the good intentions of the Government and the mining company towards the **aborigines**, our officers are entering into consultation with the leaders in the native community at Yirrkala to provide some tangible form of compensation, probably in the form of a series of cottages to be built for them.

* Reserves were created as an act of policy in years gone by in furthering what was considered to be the welfare of **aborigines** in isolating them from the mass of the population.

* I trust that all Australian citizens will also agree, after considering the statement I have made, that in grasping this prize we have also been not merely considerate but scrupulously careful of the interests of the 450 **aborigines** who will be directly affected by this major national development at Gove.

* Welfare of the Aborigines of Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory - Ministerial Statement,  and move - 
There is one special problem which arises in the Northern Territory and to which I think I ought to make passing reference.

* That is the welfare of the **aborigines**.

* They are not the only **aborigines** who need such a guarantee.

* The discovery of minerals or resources useful to the European usually leads to the shrinking or abolition of the reserves, whether they be reserves for fully tribalized **aborigines** or for de-tribalized **aborigines**.

* In both the Bateman report of 1948 published in Western Australia and the report published in the Brisbane " Courier Mail ", of 3rd May, 1960- twelve years and 2,000 miles apart, the one written by a man commissioned by a State to survey the condition of **aborigines** and the other by a journalist - the conclusion is the same.

* The **aborigines** need protection from the exploitation of low wages and poor rations on stations, and they need a chance for training, a chance for the real education of their children in a social setting where they are accepted and where they can find work and apply their education.

* The vaunted Australian fair play always seems to stop abruptly short of the **aborigines**.

* We often believe that our Prime Minister is our most important spokesman, but in Asia this country is scrutinized for its attitude on colour and its treatment of the **aborigines**.

* I know that the Australian Constitution leaves responsibility for **aborigines** with the State Governments, and that the direct legislative and administrative powers of the Commonwealth in respect of **aborigines** do not extend beyond Commonwealth territories.

* I have no intention of making any partisan statement on this matter, nor will I contend that the Minister has failed in his efforts in the Territories or in the grant of financial assistance to the States to bring about any advance in the conditions of the **aborigines**.

* The leprosarium at Derby which was established by the State Government, has effected total cures in many cases, thus providing some alleviation in the condition of those **aborigines** who will come in and submit themselves for treatment.

* But when all this is conceded, 660,000 is an inadequate annual allocation for a native welfare department which deals with 18,298 persons classified as **aborigines**, only 2,000 of whom are true nomads in the tribal state and 8,625 of whom are of mixed aboriginal and European race living in centres of European settlement, such as the metropolitan area of Perth, and in the Great Southern area.

* It is insignificant, anyhow, even if you regard it as an important subject, in relation to the total number of **aborigines**.

* There have been two recent flare-ups of publicity concerning **aborigines** in Western Australia.

* He alleged starvation of **aborigines** in the Warburton Range area, and reiterated his allegations in his book " Adam and Atoms ".

* I shall read from his report because it shows, in spite of all the sincerity of the great work which he has done in relation to the **aborigines**, the double standard that we unconsciously have of what is adequate for Europeans and what is adequate for **aborigines**.

* Furthermore, if **aborigines** were given a vote in 
Australia, those electorates, which are the three in which most **aborigines** in Australia live, would in fact have smaller areas than they have now.

* We can still give the **aborigines** in those electorates a vote.

* I appreciate the point the Minister has made; the **aborigines** could not be counted in fixing the quota.

* Then, with the inclusion of **aborigines**, the number of electors would equal the quota.

* The cattle industry has always been an employer of Aborigines, but changes in the working of pastoral properties are steadily reducing the need for a large labour force in that industry.

* Where Aborigines live on the fringes of towns, in the cities or in the north, their needs for vocational training are great and the policies of complacency pursued by Australian governments in the past are simply going to generate purposelessness, despair and passivity, or else a socially explosive atmosphere among them.

* It is impossible to make Aborigines who are simply devoid of European background and incentives act as if they had European background and incentives.

* It is part of our gratuitous and unwarranted assumption of authority over Aborigines that these things happen or are suggested.

* Aborigines often live in country which is not suitable for much diversity in land use; hence employment opportunities are limited.

* I am leaving aside the Aborigines who live in regions of minimal contact with Europeans.

* Fay Gale in her study of Aborigines in South Australia suggests that where circumstances lead Aborigines to become independent and selfreliant they are socially more acceptable.

* We also need to beware of imputed educational expenditures relating to Aborigines.

* The Electoral Branch records do not distinguish between **aborigines** and other electors and accordingly, it is impossible to say how many **aborigines** were enrolled.

* I believe that in this matter I speak on behalf of the Federal Council for Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, of which I am Senior VicePresident.

* Mr Fleming  is a person whom the Aborigines respect and if an incident of this nature had taken place he certainly would have heard of it.

* How are wage rates and conditions of employment determined for **aborigines** resident in the Northern Territory?

* What are the conditions of employment, including wage rates, in the case of **aborigines** employed by the Administration?

* It was discussed in 1946, although very briefly, by a Premiers' Conference when the then Premiers of Western Australia and Queensland indicated that they did not think it practicable to give full voting rights to **aborigines**.

* Certainly no one in that Parliament spoke in favour of giving those rights to all **aborigines** regardless of whether they were likely to be able to understand what a vote was.

* That in itself involves the question of discrimination and differentiation between whites and **aborigines**.

* Then there is the problem of identification where **aborigines** cannot sign their names.

* The recording of folklore is a well known example of the first and, in our case, would include that of our dependent peoples the **aborigines** and the native peoples of Papua-New Guinea.

* As to the other question: We propose to introduce bills to amend the Constitution, the first in relation to the existing nexus between the numbers of the Senate and the numbers of the House of Representatives, and the second in connexion with the position of Aborigines.

* In other words the essence of the position is that the power to discriminate may be exercised in relation to these other races but not in relation to the Aborigines, which is what I thought a lot of people wanted.

* As defined by the conference, the policy of assimilation aims at ensuring that " all **aborigines** and part-**aborigines** will attain the same manner of living as other Australians and live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians ".

* Under this policy " any special measures taken for **aborigines** and part-**aborigines** are regarded as temporary measures, not based on race, but intended to meet their need for special care and assistance, to protect them from any ill effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favorable to their social, economic and political advancement ".

* For this reason the widespread public interest which is being taken in the welfare of the **aborigines** is welcomed.

* Ministers at the conference expressed concern, however, that this co-operation is being damaged by a campaign of misrepresentation that is being carried on throughout Australia and overseas on matters affecting **aborigines**.

* I do not wish to appear to cast any reflections on those devoted and sincere people throughout Australia who have done so much to advance the welfare of the **aborigines**; but all of those engaged in advancing the welfare of the **aborigines** have to guard against the activities of those who are trying deliberately to worsen race relationships for political purposes and who are trying to disrupt efforts to bring the **aborigines** to full equality with all other Australians.

* The Darwin conference noted the significant contributions made by voluntary organizations with such objectives as assistance in education, including scholarships, and the development of pre-school and adult educational services; the provision of welfare services; and the sponsoring of holiday camps - and above all in promoting the acceptance by the community of the **aborigines**.

* They can do much to assist the **aborigines** in facing the problems and accepting the responsibilities inseparable from full participation in the Australian community.

* Out of much firsthand knowledge and work on behalf of **aborigines** will come, too, the stimulus of searching and constructive criticism and the close and accurate analysis of policy.

* The conference reviewed action taken to repeal legislation applying only to **aborigines**.

* The trend throughout Australia is now clearly towards ending any special legislative provision for **aborigines**.

* It needs to be recognized, however, that some special legislation confers privileges or benefits which are still of value to **aborigines** in some parts of Australia.

* This clear tendency to dispense with any special laws affecting **aborigines** only is directly relevant to the case that is sometimes urged for the amendment of the Constitution to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to pass special laws for the people of the aboriginal race.

* The train of our thought is that **aborigines** should not be made the subject of special laws and that consequently a power in this Parliament to pass laws concerning **aborigines** only would be largely unnecessary.

* The House will be aware that **aborigines** are now entitled to enrolment for voting at Commonwealth elections and that they receive social service benefits the same as other Australians.

* The question of the supply of alcohol to **aborigines** was considered by the Darwin conference.

* It was noted that in New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania there is no special legislation affecting the consumption of alcoholic liquor by **aborigines**; and that in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory consideration is being given to reducing restrictions.

* It was recognized in regard to the four last-mentioned jurisdictions that there were wide differences in the circumstances under which various groups of **aborigines** lived and that it might be necessary during a transitional period to retain some restraints.

* It was agreed that this was not a question of liquor reform  in  the usual sense of the term; it was essentially a question of removing discrimination against the **aborigines**.

* Another matter discussed at the Darwin conference was the question of assumption by the Commonwealth of additional responsibilities in respect of the **aborigines**.

* It was agreed at the Darwin conference that,  in  view of the widely varying conditions  in  different States of the federation and of the fact that so many aspects of aboriginal welfare come within State governmental responsibility in fields such as health, education, lands and settlement, it would not be  in  the best interests of the **aborigines** to have uniform Commonwealth legislation or uniform administration.

* The conference was informed that a consultative committee of officers of the welfare authorities of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory and of the Department of Supply had met regularly since 1961 to consider the special problems of nomadic and semi-nomadic **aborigines** moving between the two States and the Northern Territory.

* The Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Sinclair)  this afternoon said that he did not know how many Aborigines received pensions.

* The idea is that because we are racially blind we do not classify people as Aborigines or non-Aborigines.

* The Aborigines of the Northern Territory are not paid wages equivalent to European wages.

* By and large the Aborigines of the Northern Territory do not get unemployment benefits and they do not get the full rate of tuberculosis benefit.

* By and large the Aborigines in the Northern Territory do not get unemployment benefit.

* If Aborigines in the Northern Territory were eligible for unemployment benefit none of them would be employed, because in most cases their wages are less than the unemployment benefit.

* The moment the Government enacted eligibility for unemployment benefits generally for Aborigines the benefit rate would become the ground floor of what the wage rates could be, and some of the wage rates paid to Aborigines in the Northern Territory are not a quarter of the unemployment benefit.

* It will be time enough to claim that we are racially blind and that we do not know how many Aborigines are getting the age pension when we can talk about these other sorts of social services, that are just as important.

* I have a letter here from a very important and influential mission organisation which deals with the employment situation of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* The excerpt I wish to read is as follows - 
Under the guidance of the Superintendent at Yuendumu, Aborigines have produced attractive dwellings of the simple type required, using locally quarried stone, for a fraction of the cost of the Kingstrand and other dwellings erected by contract.

* All delegates present at the Mission's Conference expressed grave concern at this move, which debars many Aborigines from a source of employment where the employment problem is acute and has far reaching and demoralising effects.

* I believe that something of the same kind of approach where we are prepared to spend money - which is our approach in Papua and New Guinea - is necessary among the Aborigines of the Northern Territory.

* But the Aborigines who were coast watchers had not been paid.

* The Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes),  who was with me at Yirrkala, knows very well that the officers of the Department he now administers did not realise the things that were on the Aborigines' minds until they heard them through interpreters.

* Not only in many areas does the Commonwealth Government not listen to Aborigines speaking in English, but in many cases it cannot listen because it does not employ interpreters to enable it to hear what they say.

* In registering applicants for employment and referring them to prospective employers for placement, the Commonwealth Employment Service does not discriminate between registrants on the grounds of race, and no statistics are maintained of **aborigines** or those of any other race registered with the employment offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service.

* Aborigines and part **aborigines** would register from time to time with the employment offices at Kalgoorlie and Geraldton and any who could not be placed would be entitled to unemployment benefit in accordance with the provisions of the Social Services Act.

* In common with other members on the Government side, the honorable member for Sturt tried to stress the difficulties attendant upon implementing a plan to give **aborigines** the right  to  vote.

* Great emphasis was placed on the position  of  the tribal **aborigines**.

* He, as were other honorable members who have spoken, was a member of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve.

* That the excised portion of Gove Peninsula be declared a protected area in order that people other than Aborigines shall be prevented from hunting there.

* The next two recommendations were that some building lots within the town site be reserved for Aborigines and that homes for European and Aboriginal Australians be developed simultaneously.

* What treatment and examinations are given to Aborigines after they are discharged from the (a) Derby Leprosarium and (b) Northern Territory Leprosarium?

* In the words of the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes),  this Bill seeks to do two things: One is to grant a further measure of constitutional reform with respect to the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, and the other is to amend the provisions of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act dealing with the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund.

* The latter amendment follows action which was taken recently in the Legislative Council when certain amendments were made to remove restrictions on the rights of Aborigines.

* The provisions of this Bill, other than those which I have already explained which relate to the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund, give effect to this proposal.

* The appointment of a joint select committee to inquire into the problems of the people has been long recognised as a method of approach, and this House itself has appointed select committees to investigate such matters as Aboriginal voting rights, the grievances of Aborigines at Yirrkala and constitutional review.

* The Bill proposes an amendment to change the name of the Wards Benefits Trust Fund to "Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund."

* The fund will be used for the benefit of Aborigines generally in the Northern Territory.

* An argument may develop around the proposition that the fund should be used for the benefit of Aborigines in an area or place in respect of which royalties are payable.

* The Aborigines of Yirrkala are strongly demanding that all of the royalties paid as a result of the winning of minerals at Gove in their tribal area should go to them.

* These figures exclude Loan Fund expenditure, expenditure on unemployment relief works and expenditure on Aborigines.

* My good friend, the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant),  has asked: " What about freedom for the **aborigines**?

* Honorable members will have noted the application to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission last year by the North Australian Workers Union for equal wages for Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* The Aborigines at Wave Hill, along with a number of other Aboriginal workers in the Northern Territory, have become very restive about this in recent months.

* I am not sure what the conditions of the employment of these Aborigines are.

* The irony of it all is that it is reported in this morning's Press that, as the Aborigines have gone on strike, the company will have to employ European stockmen - whatever they may be.

* I have no doubt that European workers will be paid the full legal wage, but the company will not pay the same rates to Aborigines.

* Honorable members opposite need not take my word for the conditions under which these Aborigines work.

* He says that  Aborigines were never allowed on the same (homestead) side of the river.

* If any Aborigines knock the horses about, he is into them with the whip.'

* Even among those who are sincere in their criticism, many spend a good deal of their energy seeking someone to blame - Australians of the past or Governments of the present, employers, townspeople in some particular place - for what is being done or not being done for Aborigines.

* It is necessary that we beware of seeking for the Aborigines objectives that are mutually incompatible.

* There are those who on the one hand want the Aborigines to retain fully their own racial separateness, their own language, customs and characteristics and on the other would have them achieve educational, social and economic standards that are not inferior to those of other Australians.

* As now expressed it states explicitly what has always been implicit in the assimilation policy, that Aborigines must themselves choose to become part of the general Australian community.

* Governments will provide every opportunity they can whether in education and training, in housing and employment, or in any other way for Aborigines to attain full Australian standards.

* They will give every encouragement to Aborigines to avail themselves of these opportunities.

* But the use of the word " choose " is to recognise that an important element is that the Aborigines see the goal and want to reach it and that means must be found for them to participate fully in the shaping of their future.

* It will be noted, also, that the restatement of the policy omits the words in the earlier statement referring to Aborigines observing the same customs and being influenced by the same beliefs.

* Most striking was the progress made in bringing Aborigines within the ambit of the general law and general community services that apply to the rest of the community.

* In the Northern Territory there are now no laws which discriminate against Aborigines; they are equal at law with all other Northern Territory residents though some special benefits have been retained to them such as special rights to reserved lands, including royalties arising from those lands, and the right everywhere to take natural game and to use natural waters.

* An amending act in Victoria has placed the Aborigines Welfare Board under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Housing.

* A person selected from nominations by the Aborigines Advancement League is now included on the new Board.

* In Queensland new legislation has been passed placing Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to the maximum extent possible on the same footing at law as all other members of the Queensland community while continuing essential provision for their special care and assistance.

* In Western Australia amended legislation aims to promote the integration of Aborigines into the general community and to provide special welfare measures during the transitional period.

* One special provision is retained in regard to liquor where prohibition is applied to Aborigines in the area outside the south western land division in that State.

* Difficulties at present facing Aborigines moving into Western Australia and Queensland from the Northern Territory were discussed at the conference.

* As most of these concerned the present restrictions on the supply of liquor to Aborigines in the two States it was noted that the expected commencement of new legislation in Queensland early next year and the possible extension of the area in which Aborigines may consume liquor in Western Australia will ease many of the difficulties.

* The conference agreed that Queensland should join this Committee because of the increasing movement of Aborigines between this area and Queensland.

* Ministers gave some consideration as to the advice they might give to the Commonwealth about requirements for Aborigines to register for national service.

* They considered that though there would be some Aborigines who would be unsuitable for national service these could be excluded from call-up by administrative arrangements in collaboration with the Aboriginal welfare authorities and that they would prefer there be no general exemption.

* The conference asked that consideration be given to paying full repatriation benefits to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders who are called up.

* There was a useful exchange of views on Aboriginal communities and their future in economic opportunities for Aborigines and the economic development of reserves.

* The North Australian Workers Union has applied to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for the removal of the exclusion of Aborigines from the Cattle Station Industry (Northern Territory) Award.

* This application affects the future employment and wages of some 1,500 Aboriginal men and women, who comprise the great bulk of Aborigines employed in the Northern Territory.

* The Commonwealth has stated its view to the Commission that as a result of the proceedings the minimum wages and conditions of the award should apply equally to Aborigines as to other Australian workers.

* Outside the cattle industry, there are about 250 Aborigines employed privately and 300 employed by the Administration and Commonwealth departments.

* Since the speech of  Sir Robert  Menzies on 1st April 1965, has further consideration been given to the proposal to remove the reference to Aborigines in section 51  (xxvi)  of the Constitution?

* Let us not confuse these islanders with **aborigines**.

* They are not as dull as are some of our **aborigines**. '

* That is not to say, of course, that all our **aborigines** are dull.

* Having had considerable experience with local authorities, I can speak with some authority about the **aborigines**.

* The first thing that we have to do for the **aborigines** is to help them to live within the white or European community.

* In my opinion, this can be done only by establishing, not schools, but hostels or villages under an adult education scheme where **aborigines** can be taught hygiene and the reason for it.

* As the honorable member for Bowman pointed out, with his experience of the Northern Territory, there are flies and other things, but the Aborigines will not accept our ideas of hygiene.

* I point out that in our settlement hospitals the Aborigines have the benefit of the 24-hour service of a trained sister and the flying doctor is within easy call if a serious case arises.

* On the settlements the Aborigines have three meals a day and infants are put on diets suitable to their ages.

* But the best illustration is that, whereas in the past the Aborigines were considered to be a dying race, today they are increasing by hundreds every year.

* While I am speaking of the visit of the select committee to the Gove Peninsula and the discussions that we had with the mission authorities and the aboriginal people at Yirrkala, I should like to say that one of the many things that impressed themselves on my mind was the desire of the **aborigines** themselves to take part in the development of the area.

* When we make arrangements for the development of a town for the incoming European Australians, we should allow for the proper development, side by side with the European town, of a town for the accommodation of the **aborigines** of the area.

* I believe that there is a challenge to the mining company itself to see that the development is properly undertaken and that the agreements made adequately safeguard the interests of the **aborigines**.

* There is a challenge to the **aborigines** themselves to ensure that they are able to work alongside those who participate in this development and to take part in it themselves.

* The honorable member for Fremantle, to whom I give full credit for his sincerity and seriousness of purpose in raising this matter, then went on to what was essentially a discussion of the condition of the **aborigines** in Western Australia.

* The House knows very well that the Constitution expressly prohibits the Commonwealth from legislating on the conditions of **aborigines** in the States.

* There is not time for me to develop this theme during this short debate, but it is very clearly explained in a small book, called " Fringe Dwellers ", which was produced last year by the authority of the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  for the Aborigines Day Observance Committee.

* Protective legislation can be applied only to **aborigines** as individuals, if their state of development is such that they cannot get on without it.

* This advance has already meant that all partaboriginal people in the Northern Territory, and quite a number of full-blood **aborigines**, have the status of ordinary members of the community and are subject to its ordinary laws.

* This will become more significant as the number of **aborigines** able to accept the full responsibilities of citizenship grows.

* It would be pointless to go into these arrangements here, except to say that it is not practical for the Commonwealth to make direct grants in aid for the **aborigines**, and I doubt whether such grants would be accepted by the States.

* He has enunciated very clearly and carried into effect the policy of assimilation for the **aborigines**.

* At the opening of the Northern Territory Legislative Council quite recently, he said this - 
The responsibility for the advancement of the **aborigines** lies on all Australians and the conscience of Australia to-day  ha3  been aroused.

* The terms and conditions of employment of Aborigines employed by the PostmasterGeneral's Department in the Northern Territory between 7th August 1959 and 9th February 1966 were determined, by agreement between that Department and the Northern Territory Administration, having regard to the terms and conditions of the Wards' Employment Ordinance and not the Public Service Act and Regulations.

* The current position is that all Aborigines employed by Government departments in the Northern Territory are, with the exceptions of certain forestry workers (whose conditions are still under examination), paid full award rates and receive full award conditions.

* The honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant),  when dealing with the aboriginal vote or lack of aboriginal vote, was inclined to give the impression, to start with, that the **aborigines** have been, to use his own words, done down on their just rights, and that it was the intention of the Government to perpetuate a system which I am sure every honorable member in this House hopes will be rectified in the not far distant future.

* I feel very hopeful that the select committee on the voting rights of **aborigines** will come back to the House with recommendations which will enable us to put our own voting methods, in respect of the **aborigines**, on a proper or better footing than they are now.

* I am grateful to know that, but did Aborigines testify before the judge?

* There were customs among the Aborigines, such as wife lending, which become desperately degrading out of the context of tribal law and safeguards, and yet when we make a reform like the fornicating rights we do not notice this.

* In Western Australia venereal disease has quadrupled in the last two or three years and it is very often among Aborigines.

* We are not thinking in terms of the real welfare of the Aborigines.

* Inadequate income among Aborigines in contact with Europeans leads too often to prostitution and venereal disease.

* Now the Commonwealth and the States avoid any statistics in relation to Aborigines and treat this deliberately cultivated ignorance as a matter for pride.

* The honorable member for Mackellar wants the Commonwealth to have power to discriminate for the Aborigines. "

* The Aborigines are people whom in the past we have not treated as they should have been treated.

* It almost seems that whenever any action is taken about benefits for Aborigines some delay is involved.

* Even though the Government's own proposals for amendment of the Constitution with respect to a provision relating to Aborigines related merely to the census, I regret that for the time being we have brushed aside that referendum proposal and decided to delay it.

* The Aborigines in the Northern Territory who are engaged in the pastoral industry are not to be given equality of wages until further delay has occurred.

* This is because perhaps I in my heart and many others in their own hearts, as they would agree if they were quite honest, in our basic motives feel that Aborigines are a secondary people.

* We shall have many more Aborigines in the future.

* But once there is written into the Commonwealth Constitution a clear statement of the Commonwealth's own responsibilities, this will, I believe, lead to a transformation in the finance available to meet the needs of the Aborigines.

* The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, which was established at the suggestion of the honorable member for Mackellar, has now given us many clues about the way in which we should deal with the Aborigines.

* For that reason, the Opposition wholeheartedly supports this Bill which was presented this morning by the honorable member for Mackellar and which is designed to amend the Constitution as it relates to Aborigines.

* How many of the Aborigines registered for employment at Port Hedland during the 12 months ending 28 June 1968 were in receipt of unemployment benefit.

* The great thing is that the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines was unanimous, and at no time during our journeys throughout the Commonwealth did we really dissent on any matter of great importance.

* As honorable members who have read the report will realize, very few **aborigines** are still in the nomadic state.

* The **aborigines** are realizing that they cannot maintain their aboriginal type of civilization and voluntarily are coming to adopt the European civilization.

* If the **aborigines** live a communal life, it is difficult for them to appreciate the concept of the individual.

* The policy of this Commonwealth Government is that every person, including both **aborigines** and Torres Strait islanders, shall be assimilated and become Australian citizens.

* May I for a moment deal with some of the administrative procedures which come to notice as a result of the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* I do not say that they are **aborigines**.

* It is important to note that by definition they are **aborigines** within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

* We should select specially qualified electoral officers to undertake the voluntary enrolment of the **aborigines** and Torres Strait islanders to whom the franchise is being extended.

* I can illustrate the degree of understanding on the part of many **aborigines** by telling the House of an occasion when  Mr. Pearce,  the  chairman  of the committee, asked an aboriginal, " What do you mean by ' Parliament ' ? "

* We must realize, also, that the **aborigines**' communal concept of life creates difficulties when one aboriginal suddenly gets the right to vote - or any other right - and his relatives and friends do not get a similar right.

* I ask the Minister to consider the preparation of a special film which can be used to demonstrate voting procedures and to bring the **aborigines** to an understanding of the proper concept of voting.

* Such a film could be produced in co-operation with the authorities in charge of native affairs not only in the Northern Territory but also in Queensland and Western Australia, and it would do much to promote cooperation by the **aborigines** with those authorities.

* When the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines visited the Territory there were, I think, only three polling booths in the whole of the Territory.

* Let us hope that more will be provided and that booths will be provided also throughout the Kimberleys and other areas where there are **aborigines**, as well as on every island in Torres Strait.

* The honorable member for Leichhardt, the honorable member for Kennedy  (Mr. Riordan),  the honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson)  and the honorable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr. Collard)  represent in this place the areas in which the greatest numbers of **aborigines** live.

* My question to the Prime Minister arises out of the setting up of a select committee of this House to inquire into the voting rights of Australian **aborigines** in relation to the Commonwealth Parliament.

* In the Federal Pastoral Industry Award, Aborigines are excluded from the definition of "Station hands" used for the purposes of the award.

* The Cattle Station Industry (Northern Territory) Award, 1951 docs not apply  to  Aborigines within the meaning of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Ordinance.

* Apart from the Aircraft Industry Award, 1955, which does not apply to "Aborigines employed in the Northern Territory with the approval of the Native Affairs Branch of the Northern Territory Administration", no Federal awards have been brought to my attention which exclude Aborigines from any of their provisions.

* The operation of State awards in relation to Aborigines is a matter of State administration.

* Part **aborigines** are not regarded as **aborigines** in the legal sense in the Northern Territory.

* If, by his manner of life, he showed that he needed somebody to look after him- 
The position in the Northern Territory is that there are some thousands of people of part aboriginal race who, under a Labour government, were regarded as **aborigines** and had no legal rights but who now have the full exercise of their rights.

* I can remember 25 years ago, as a very ardent young enthusiast and a member of a public body interested in aboriginal affairs, advocating the giving of the vote to all **aborigines**.

* Even in the heart of the body that was composed wholly of what may be called the apostles of greater rights for **aborigines**, 25 years ago this was considered a rather ridiculous notion.

* Although I and one or two others advocated it then, we were told, " Do not be ridiculous; giving the vote to **aborigines** is something that cannot be done ".

* There is a tendency in talking about **aborigines** to say that we should give them citizenship, that we should give them rights, that we should grant them the right to vote.

* In three States there is no limitation on the right of **aborigines** to vote, but in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory there is a limitation.

* We are making up our own minds and making our own law in respect of the right of **aborigines** to vote in Commonwealth elections.

* The passage of this bill will mean that **aborigines** throughout Australia will have the right to enrol.

* Because of the circumstance that some of the **aborigines** are still living in a tribal state, are still illiterate and, in the case of a few of them, are still unaware of the existence of such things as parliaments, we are not making enrolment compulsory.

* Secondly, one more of the many legislative restrictions placed on **aborigines** is being removed.

* I would not like to suggest to any of my aboriginal friends - and I do count many **aborigines** as personal friends - that they should immediately lobby along racial lines; but I would suggest that those who now acquire a vote, by using it responsibly and wisely and by living up to their full political opportunities, can do a great deal to ensure that the needs of their own people are better recognized and are more constantly served by the Parliaments of Australia.

* advisedly, with a good deal of close knowledge of what is going on in this field, that the Communist Party of Australia has selected the topic of **aborigines** as one of the fields in which some of its most strenuous political endeavours are being made.

* You see all over Australia to-day this attempt to perpetuate the **aborigines** as a separate race, not because of concern for the **aborigines** as human beings, but because this is a nice juicy, divisive, controversial problem over which the Communists can cause a great deal of mischief.

* It is a key that rests partly in the spirit of the aboriginal himself and, to a much larger extent, in the attitude of the rest of us Australians - whether we are ready to give the **aborigines** that acceptance and that respect that they ought to have and whether we are ready to extend to them that mateship that helps to unite us all as Australians.

* The section provoked so little debate in the  1891  convention that we scarcely know Griffith's motives in putting in the section, but we do know that at that time in Queensland no attempt was made to count Aborigines, that in Western Australia only Aborigines in contact with civilisation were counted - this was a very few thousand compared with the numbers who then lived in the State - and that Aborigines were not counted in South Australia, which then included the Northern Territory.

* We are conferring nothing tangible on Aborigines by deleting section  127.

* Nevertheless, we should recognise that, strictly speaking, this is not an amendment of the Constitution relating to Aborigines; it is an amendment of the Constitution relating to the census.

* At the time when this section was finally adopted by the Constitutional Convention of  1897  the number of Aborigines in Australia was estimated at  59,603.

* He feared it would debar Aborigines from the right to vote.

* He was assured that it did not affect the voting rights of Aborigines.

* Dr. Cockburn's  instinct to oppose the proposed section  120 -  now  127 -  was sound because the wording of the section has helped to spread the delusion in Australia that Aborigines are not British subjects.

* That section 41 which conferred upon Aborigines the Commonwealth franchise in all those States where they had the State franchise - that is, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia - was somehow or other interpreted to mean that the Commonwealth had to follow the States.

* We gave Aborigines a vote in States that had already conferred the State voting right and denied them a vote in States that had not conferred the State voting right.

* Every reference to Aborigines in the Australian Constitution has been interpreted in some way to deprive them of some right all through the years.

* There had been a visit of some Australian Communist women just previously and they had informed the Indians that in Australia Aborigines were constitutionally declared not to be people.

* It has never been a valid census without the Aborigines.

* Thirdly, it may lead, psychologically though not legally, to an improved status of Aborigines.

* The honorable member for Mackellar  (Mr. Wentworth)  referred to certain of the statements of the Prime Minister in which the Prime Minister explained why he had not extended the referendum proposals to include other sections of the Commonwealth Constitution which relate to Aborigines.

* The section which has been under discussion reads as follows - 
The honorable member for Mackellar has spoken of the actions of the Government with respect to Aborigines.

* The extension of social service benefits to Aborigines had been begun by the previous Labour Government and was continued by this Government, and extended after advocacy by the Opposition.

* There is no doubt that it was misinterpreted to produce adverse discrimination against Aborigines for many years.

* This is just another of the sections of the Constitution where a reference to the word "Aborigines" has had an unfortunate effect on the fate of the Aboriginal people.

* We agree with the honorable member for Mackellar that the Constitution would be improved by his suggestion that there be conferred upon the Commonwealth a positive power to make laws for the benefit of Aborigines.

* There is no doubt that Aborigines are subjects of the Queen.

* This was one of the points that the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines stressed.

* Aborigines, as subjects of the Queen, have an obligation to an allegiance.

* I do not underestimate the psychological importance of deleting from the Constitution a section which appears to declare that Aborigines are not people, but at the same time I think it is regrettable that it is quite possible for the States to continue what are marked discriminations against Aborigines, and that we as a national Parliament, supporting a national Government - which is answerable internationally on race issues - are so powerless to legislate to make a meaningful Australian citizenship not only have force in the Commonwealth in regard to voting rights but also where a State has not enacted voting rights for people who are fully of the Aboriginal race.

* There is no case for not counting Aborigines as Australian people.

* What steps are taken to survey periodically the general health, nutrition and survival rate of **aborigines** on the reserves?

* I subsequently informed the honorable member that I was not aware of any responsible allegation against the Commonwealth's administration in relation to **aborigines**.

* The Commonwealth has always been extremely careful to ensure that its activities in Central and Western Australia do not distress **aborigines** in the area.

* When **aborigines** in northern Australia endeavoured to join that union they were kept out because the union thought that unemployment might be caused to its European members if **aborigines** were permitted to join.

* Among those who have received benefits as Torres Strait islanders are some mainland Aborigines.

* Accordingly, the Act Is now being amended to include mainland Aborigines in the definition of " native members of the forces ".

* There is a lesser number of Aborigines in South Australia, a negligible number in Victoria and New South Wales, and practically none at all in Tasmania.

* The need to protect the interests of Central Australian Aborigines induced to leave their tribal lands for inadequately prepared Government settlements.

* The right honorable gentleman said that he would support an amendment of the Constitution at least to enable **aborigines** to be counted in the population.

* If this is taken in the context of **aborigines** being counted in the population and an electorate being created for each additional 80,000 of the population, there is no question that the rural voice would have been adequately expressed in this place by the persons whom rural constituencies elect and there would be more country seats.

* They are precluded from taking into account area and distance as such, just as they are precluded from taking into account individuals who are not on the rolls - school children, migrants and, until recently when the Australian Labour Party secured an amendment of the law, **aborigines**.

* If, moreover, the Constitution is amended - if a referendum is sought to amend the Constitution - to allow **aborigines** to be counted in the statistics of the Commonwealth - not just " the census ", but the statistics of the Commonwealth - and furthermore to free the numbers in this House from the numbers in the Senate and to permit this House to have more members as the population of the States increases, members on this side of the House will support the bill for the referendum and will support the referendum itself.

* In 1957, Doctors Crotty, Ida Mann and McLean carried out investigations of Australian **aborigines** (including children) at Groote Eylandt, Oenpelli and Goulburn Island affected with trachoma.

* In 1951 Miss Winifred Wilson surveyed the dietary intake of **aborigines** living on missions and cattle stations.

* The servicing organization of the Northern Territory Administration also serves the needs of the officers engaged in aboriginal welfare and of the **aborigines** themselves.

* District welfare officers in Darwin, Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs are responsible to see that the day to day business in aboriginal welfare in their districts is discharged effectively and efficiently and in the spirit of an active social training programme for **aborigines** in the Territory.

* Patrol officers moving through the district and resident staff on government settlements, including school teachers, nurses, farmers, carpenters, &amp;c. maintain close personal contact with **aborigines**.

* In view of his oft-expressed opinions that payment of award rates to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory is a matter for the people concerned - which must mean the white people alone in the Northern Territory - and that the Opposition wishes to impose its will on the people of the Northern Territory, will he say whether he means to imply that **aborigines** are not people and are, therefore, not entitled to the same wages and conditions as all other Australians?

* Is it his view that members of this Parliament are not entitled to raise questions and express opinions about the rights of **aborigines** as Australian citizens?

* There are the **aborigines**, recent arrivals from overseas and more than 96,000 age, invalid, widow and service pensioners who, because of financial reasons, are unable to join a benefit fund.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  in his very thought provoking speech, gave the illustration that the measure proposes discrimination for Aborigines rather than discrimination against them.

* but 1 point out that it would have to be discrimination for the Aborigines sparingly and wisely used, because at no point do the educated Aborigines, or those with any sense of personal pride, want to see an attitude of condescension towards them.

* Many Aborigines are not looking for a hand-out.

* One thousand, two hundred and ninety-nine persons who had previousy been regarded as **aborigines** were not declared as wards.

* 1 now wish to mention some questions associated with **aborigines** - a subject which is very dear to the heart of my colleague, the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant).

* During the last week we have received a printed report of a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers administering **aborigines**, which was held in Darwin in July, 1963.

* One of the matters that the Queensland Government will be bringing forward to the next Premiers' Conference is the special need for the housing of **aborigines**.

* I hope that the Commonwealth Government gives substantial assistance to the Queensland and other State governments in matters associated with the welfare of **aborigines**.

* Recently I spent some time in the north of Queensland where many **aborigines** are not covered by the present legislation.

* In addition, no provision has been made for the astonishing number of 10,000 people of Melanesian and Polynesian descent who were brought to work in the sugar fields in Queensland and northern New South Wales who suffer from the same disabilities in terms of housing employment as do Australian **aborigines**.

* I regret that there was no mention in the Governor-General's Speech of any great step forward to improve the conditions of **aborigines**, although I 'am -heartened by the statement about recent developments in the Northern Territory.

* I hope that if, and when, the Premiers' Conference makes some provision for the housing of **aborigines**, that provision will not be restricted to **aborigines** on government settlements and mission stations but will extend to fringe dwellers and others such as Torres Strait islanders and Melanesians who are caught between two worlds.

* They do not receive the benefits - sometimes the doubtful benefits - incorporated in State acts relating to **aborigines** and they do not receive any benefits from other legislation.

* .- The honorable member for Hume  (Mr. Anderson)  says first that we have appointed a select committee to inquire into the question of granting a vote to **aborigines** in Australia and then he says that if we hurry the natives along to self-determination we shall be sorry for the results that will accrue.

* It is only because the Government knew that the Opposition proposed submitting an amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act which had for its purpose the granting to Australian **aborigines** of the right to vote that it came forward with this gimmick in the shape of a select committee.

* Is it the function of the Welfare Branch to advise Aborigines whether they should or should not accept proposals made by a mining company?

* If not, who, if anyone, advises Aborigines?

* Has the establishment of an independent legal advisory board been considered to assist Aborigines residing in their own traditional areas whose land rights might become the subject of requests from mining companies?

* May royalties payable for minerals taken from reserves be set aside in part as a fund to finance legal advice and trust protection for Aborigines?

* However, it is known that at least fifty of the 103 Aborigines referred to were placed with State Government Departments operating in the area.

* As a matter of fact, tonight it has been a most generous occasion for me, because not only do I find myself in agreement on the mattter he has just referred to, namely the abolition of discrimination against Aborigines, but I also somewhat support the remarks he made before the suspension of the sitting regarding the extension of the runway at Mascot airport.

* I regret that no opportunity has been taken to enable distribution commissioners to take into account the number of voteless persons including **aborigines**, infants and immigrants in electorates.

* The committee then referred to the fact that if the Constitution were altered in the two ways recommended - that **aborigines** be counted in assessing the quota for each seat and that it be permissible for a seat to be created for every 80,000 or more inhabitants - it would be still easier to comply with a one-tenth margin.

* Honorable members will recall that legislation was passed by the Parliament early in 1962 giving Aborigines the right to enrol and vote as electors of the Commonwealth.

* The first Federal general election following the passing of the legislation, in which' many of the Aborigines were able to exercise a vote for the first time, was held at the latter end of 1963.

* Subsequent to the passing of the legislation, but prior to the 1963 election, an officer or officers of the Electoral Branch in Western Australia - this may also have happened in other States but it certainly happened in Western Australia - went out into areas where numbers of Aborigines were domiciled, for the purpose of explaining to them the actual system under which enrolling and voting was carried out.

* I cannot recall any statement being made, nor have I noted any reference, about whether the Department made any detailed investigations, or whether it analysed the voting figures of the 1963 general election and the subsequent Senate election to ascertain whether the movements of these officers amongst the Aborigines was a success or otherwise, or whether some further education of the Aborigines was required along the lines carried out previously, or by other means.

* My only reason for directing attention to this matter is because the name could have remained in the minds of the Aborigines and that might account for the fact that the candidate of that name at the election received a large number of their votes.

* For instance, at one particular polling booth in a place where, judging by the names on the roll, there were some 112 Aborigines entitled to vote, and where 127 votes were cast, the candidate with the same name of the colour used at the mock election received 114 votes.

* Of the .127 votes cast, most of which would have been cast by Aborigines, only seven were informal.

* By extensive inquiries that i have since made, I have been able to establish that practically all of those Aborigines could not even read or write.

* That vote alone seemed to me to be a very interesting one, especially if those Aborigines had received any tuition.

* In another section, where a total of 174 votes were cast and where, according to the roll, the majority of the voters would be Aborigines, 85 votes went to the candidate to whom I have referred and who was third on the ballot paper.

* In yet another section, where it appeared that about 72 Aborigines would be entitled to vote and where a total of 149 votes were cast, the candidate to whom I have referred received 85 votes and only three informal votes were cast.

* I was quite certain that by far the majority of the Aborigines who were entitled to vote would not be able to either read or write.

* So it seemed to me that the people in charge of the booths had taken a great deal of trouble and had shown a considerable amount of patience in order to ensure that the Aborigines did cast valid votes.

* I felt that if the Minister for the Interior were really interested in the Aborigines he would have decided on holding another mock election or on some other way of proving just what the position was.

* I found that in a section in which it seemed that between 475 and 500 Aborigines were entitled to vote, and in which a total of more than 1,600 votes were cast, only 46 of those votes were informal.

* I do not suggest, of course, that all of the Aborigines who were entitled to vote actually voted; but certainly a very large percentage did.

* As I said earlier, I was quite certain that most of the Aborigines concerned could neither read nor write and, despite the tuition that had been given to them, would not have any great knowledge of what was required of them.

* Therefore, at the last State election, in order to satisfy my curiosity and to find out whether I was right or wrong, I decided that it was only right and proper that on polling day I should be at a place where a fairly large number of Aborigines were expected to vote.

* My experience at the booth proved to me beyond any doubt that, with few exceptions, the Aborigines require much more assistance at the booth than I believe is right and proper, if they are to cast a valid vote.

* He obviously wanted to give the Aborigines every assistance and opportunity to cast a valid vote that it was possible to give them.

* But I am afraid that as a result of his enthusiasm the relevant departments, both State and Federal, which surely would be watching the voting results with a great deal of interest in order to learn how the Aborigines are measuring up to their responsibilities, could gain the wrong impression.

* The fact that so very few votes were informal could convey the idea that the Aborigines have gained a good knowledge of voting, when actually they have very little idea of it.

* He wanted to assist the Aborigines as much as he possibly could.

* That being so, surely the Minister, having given this matter considerable thought, should be able to tell us what are his views on the results of Aborigines' voting; whether he intends, before the next election, to pursue a course of further explanation or education by his Department for the Aborigines; or whether he is satisfied that they are now sufficiently acquainted with what is required of them and that there is no need to pursue the matter further.

* It should also be necessary to put officers of the Department, or other government employees with a full knowledge of the procedure, in charge of all booths at which a number of Aborigines are expected to vote, not only to ensure that the legislative provisions in respect of the amount of assistance that can be given to Aborigines are abided by but also to ascertain what progress the Aborigines are making, whether they have or have not a sufficient knowledge of what is required of them in respect of voting and whether further tuition is required.

* Unless knowledgeable officers are in charge of booths, I suggest we will never know how Aborigines are measuring up  to their  responsibilities of voting and it will seem that we are not really interested.

* In conclusion, I ask the Minister, if he has not already done so, to make an examination of the voting by Aborigines since the Act was amended.

* If he is not satisfied - I am sure that he will not be - regarding the ability of many Aborigines to understand the voting system, I ask him to arrange for some further tuition and also to give serious consideration to my suggestion in relation to the presiding officers at booths where so many Aborigines are entitled to vote.

* The honorable member directed his attention particularly to the question of the welfare of the **aborigines** and of the mission on the Gove Peninsula.

* We have taken exceptional care to ensure that the welfare of the **aborigines** is not harmfully affected and that the whole of the interests of the mission are fully protected.

* Broadly, those measures are that, mainly in the in terests of the older generation of the **aborigines**, provision is made that their access to their sacred sites, and their access to hunting grounds, shall not be affected by any of the mining operations or the granting of the lease.

* The whole of the royalty is paid into a trust fund for the benefit of **aborigines** throughout the Northern Territory.

* The need for all Commonwealth instrumentalities, including the armed services, to pay **aborigines** employed by them a wage at least equivalent to the award rate as fixed by the Arbitration Commission for a worker similarly employed who ls covered by awards; the need for the extension of the protection of Arbitration Commission awards to **aborigines** employed privately in the Northern Territory; the need for unemployment, sickness and tuberculosis benefits to be paid to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory at the same rate as for other citizens and to be as readily available to them.

* Will the Government amend the Aborigines Welfare Ordinance of the Australian Capital Terri tory to remove sections which discriminate against Aborigines and part-Aborigines?

* In a general review of the Ordinance will he recognize Aborigines as  a  group labouring under special difficulties resulting from past treatment and from historical differences of background and accord to them special benefits in respect of adult education and job training?

* Will he consider amending the Ordinance to set up machinery whereby Aborigines may be consulted as to planning and policy concerning their welfare?

* Will the Government consider providing lowinterest loans to Aborigines for housing, establishment of businesses and property development?

* Recognizing that there are but few Aborigines within the Australian Capital Territory, will he consider that Commonwealth legislation should set a pattern and an example to the States?

* If my Kalgoorlie friend would go back to his electorate and do some thinking about the problems of the **aborigines** in his electorate, he would be facing up to things and doing a little better than he is doing by shouting out stupid interjections that he does not understand.

* No wonder the Russians are saying, " Look at your record in northwest Australia with the **aborigines** ".

* How many Aborigines (a) reside and (b) are enrolled in each electoral division in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales?

* That in the opinion of this House the recommendations set out in paragraphs 76 and 79 of the Report of the Select Committee on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve, should be implemented.

* Honorable members will recall that when development of the bauxite deposits at Gove Peninsula in Arnhem Land was first begun the Aborigines of the Yirrkala area, believing that their interests were to be adversely affected, petitioned this Parliament.

* I believe that the most important recommendation was the one contained in paragraph 79 of the report of the Select Committee on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve.

* The Administration has had a great deal to say over many years about the citizenship, whatever that means, of Aborigines.

* The fact that the Aborigines exercised their citizenship and petitioned this Parliament was treated as something sinister instead of being treated as something with which the Administration ought to be pleased.

* It was I who advised the Aborigines to petition this Parliament because I took seriously everything that has been said about the citizenship of Australian Aborigines by the Department.

* This was the case notwithstanding that it became very clear during the Committee's inquiry that the Administration did not know what was in the minds of the Aborigines and did not know the fears and concern that was in their hearts.

* But the Aborigines did know of the proposal to develop a town for 3,000 people on land which they regarded as their own.

* So there was a complete failure of communication - I use the expression of one of the Liberal Party members of the Committee - between the Aborigines and the Commonwealth Government.

* The second point that I raise is that Aborigines in this area had been listened to by officers of the Department of Territories without interpreters.

* The Aborigines were not capable of any extensive self-expression in English and the officers were surprised when Aborigines speaking in their own tongue through interpreters revealed themselves as orators and as people having a very mature outlook on the needs of their particular Aboriginal community.

* The Committee said - 
That the excised portion of Gove Penin sula be declared a protected area in order that people other than Aborigines shall be prevented from hunting there.

* What for these hunters is just an accumulation of crocodile skins represents to the Aborigines the destruction of an important item of diet.

* It is quite unthinkable that a concentration of 1,200 Europeans - there are 1,200 Aborigines on Melville Island - would be left without the water supplies that were necessary for them when there were running creeks and so on which could be easily dammed.

* The third recommendation of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines was - 
That some building lots within the town site be reserved for Aborigines.

* But what we were concerned about was that there might develop another quite large town for Europeans, with the Aborigines being reduced to the status of fringe dwellers.

* Nobody who has seen the Aborigines around Tennant Creek or Katherine wants the development of another fringe dwelling Aboriginal population in the Northern Territory.

* However, a fringe dwelling population will certainly develop if positive steps are not taken to lift the status of the Aborigines and to educate aboriginal women who are going to come into a European area in home management and domestic science, if necessary paying them while they are obtaining training in domestic science so that their families may be maintained while they are getting such training.

* It appears from a letter which the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  most graciously sent me, being a copy of a letter that he had sent to one of the Liberal Party members of the Committee, that the Government is satisfied with the idea that a committee of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory can look after the interests of the Aborigines of Yirrkala and that there is, therefore, no need for the committee recommended by the investigatory Committee set up by this Parliament.

* We may have to face the fact that although we are supposed to be a National Parliament we cannot legislate for Aborigines in the States, but there is no need for us to rush to abdicate our responsibilities towards the Aborigines of the Northern Territory and allow those responsibilities to be taken over by what is not yet a State parliament, namely the Northern Territory Legislative Council.

* The second thing I want to say is that this Parliament is independent of the Department of Territories, against the actions of which the Aborigines sometimes appeal, whereas the Northern Territory Legislative Council is not independent of the Department of Territories.

* I do not regard the Northern Territory Legislative Council as being an entirely independent body which can look into the grievances of the Aborigines.

* Secondly, some of them are employers of Aboriginal labour and I am quite certain that when on an earlier occasion they came before the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines as witnesses, the one thing they had in mind all the time as their great concern was that Aborigines should not be paid wages equal to those paid to Europeans.

* We did not hear very often a suggestion that the European missionaries of the area were the ones qualified to speak for the Aborigines.

* By and large there was a tendency on the part of the Administration to treat missioners in any area as spokesmen for the Aborigines, just as there is a tendency to treat them as the housing authorities.

* I want the Aborigines to be treated in exactly the same way as the rest of the community in this respect.

* The Aborigines' citizen relationships with the Administration and with this Parliament should not be considered as proceeding via missionaries.

* A committee of this Parliament should be responsible to hear from the Aborigines direct.

* They necessarily are not objective advisers of the Aborigines when the Administration affects their interests.

* If we were genuinely sensitive to the great disabilities of the Aborigines I am sure that when there were major actions by the Commonwealth Government that might affect their position we would be willing to give them independent legal advice, which is something they might find difficulty in arranging for themselves because they cannot manipulate legal, political and social institutions.

* If this is  true  of Europeans it is much more true of Aborigines.

* There is a tendency on the part of  the  Northern Territory Administration to regard  any  outsiders  who  intrude  into the field  of  Aborigines  as probably 
Communists or ratbags or, at any rate, very irritating people.

* It consisted of responsible people and I ask the Department of Territories to take seriously all the things the Department itself says about citizenship, to stop making these liberal statements as international window dressing and to make them genuine statements, genuinely to welcome citizenship actions by the Aborigines and genuinely to encourage their critical exercise of citizenship rights by establishing a parliamentary committee to which they can speak.

* .- I would like to inform the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  that the legislation to which he referred as being unfair to the **aborigines** in Queensland was Labour Party legislation which was supported and well and truly assented to by John Duggan, the present leader of the Labour Party in Queensland, when Labour was in government in that State.

* I have travelled 21,000 miles through Australia, as has the Minister, and I have seen Aborigines all over Australia.

* I cannot conceive that in many areas of Rhodesia there would be less educational advancement for natives than there is for Aborigines in this country.

* We are a nation of 11 million people, with 70,000 Aborigines.

* I hope that the Minister for Territories will carry through the implications of what he has said tonight and support the proposed constitutional changes in this country which are being, advocated by the honorable member for Mackellar  (Mr. Wentworth),  who asks for certain guaranteed rights for Aborigines.

* The whittling away of the Cape Coloured franchise, which was, as the British Government believed, strongly entrenched in South Africa- 
Report from the Select Committee on grievance  of Yirrkala **aborigines**, Arnhem Hand Reserve, together wilh the Minutes of Proceedings of the Committee and Minutes of Evidence.

* Twentyfive witnesses were called, eleven of whom were **aborigines**.

* That the excised portion of Cove Peninsula be declared a protected area in order that people other than Aborigines shall be prevented from hunting there.

* That some building lots within the town site bc reserved for Aborigines.

* believe that challenge must be accepted by everybody con cerned - the Government through its Welfare Branch, our Mission as such, the mining company - and the Aborigines themselves - must share in grappling with (his challenge.

* The Aborigines were consulted about the choice of the site.

* Did I not say that we have only 70,000 **aborigines** left in Australia?

* Not long ago the Aborigines Department in South Australia was feeding the natives at Ooldea on boiled wheat.

* The department sent up bags of wheat, boiled it and shovelled it out as though the **aborigines** were some low form of animal life.

* We have a very disgraceful record in our treatment of the **aborigines**.

* No one who has been in a position to see what is happening to the **aborigines** can ever say he is happy and satisfied with what we have done for them.

* If you are going to run **aborigines** into gaol every- time they are found drunk, that is all right with me provided you treat white men the same way.

* past 150 years because if anything, could be more gradual than the preparation we have made for the **aborigines** in that time, I would like to know of it.

* In how many cases in each of the last six financial years would additional (a) age or invalid pensions, (b) widows' pensions and (c) maternity allowances have been paid because the Social Services Act 1959 repealed sections 19(2), 47, 76 and 86 (3) of the Principal Act, which relate to Aborigines?

* As the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  has pointed out, that would be a revolution in the way in which the parliaments of Australia approach the problems of the **aborigines**.

* We have inflicted upon the **aborigines** a great complexity of laws.

* Let me make it clear that we want the matter examined thoroughly, with a new look at the right of **aborigines** to be treated as equal citizens.

* Neither I nor the honorable member for Fremantle claim to know the answer, but we do claim that additional steps should be taken to safeguard the rights of the **aborigines** by discussion with the spokesmen for the **aborigines** in the Gove Peninsula area, and that an aboriginal title to the land of aboriginal reserves should be created in the Northern Territory.

* The Minister and the Prime Minister might well give consideration to establishing another committee similar to that which inquired into and reported upon the granting of voting rights to **aborigines**.

* As was pointed out to the committee appointed to inquire into the granting of voting rights to **aborigines**, the granting of land tenure is not simply a question of parcelling out portions of land.

* Although I have strong feelings about the surrender of Australia's mineral resources to overseas companies, that is not the real question here to-night, when we have before us a proposal which can only have the effect of submerging these **aborigines**.

* So if the mining company finds that these **aborigines** just happen to be in the road, if it is in the interests of the mining company that they be moved from land which they have occupied for some 12,000 years, they must move off.

* I say quite frankly that the rights of these **aborigines** are being trespassed upon in this matter.

* We believe it should not be difficult to establish some principle by which the **aborigines** can be given title to the land.

* We believe it should not be difficult to establish some trustee system and, in the interim, at least consult the **aborigines** fully and completely.

* I remind honorable members that this particular spot is a very important aboriginal art centre, as is borne out by the following statement in the book "Art in Arnhem Land" written by Professor Elkin Berndt in con- junction with Catherine and Ronald Berndt - 
The only information collected by the Bureau of Census and Statistics of the number of full-blood Australian Aborigines comes from the Commonwealth censuses.

* The numbers of fullblood **aborigines** so enumerated in Census Divisions in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales at 30th June 1961, are shown in the following table.

* However, there is no national policy so that whatever is the determination of the parliamentary committee and whatever is its recommendation, there is still a situation of doubt and difficulty not conducive to an atmosphere in which we can successfully resolve the needs of the day of the Aborigines.

* Both expressed views on Australian immigration policy in general and one of them also discussed the treatment of Australian **aborigines**.

* Indeed, we have liberalized and extended the rights of all **aborigines**, wherever they may be in Australia.

* We copied to a great degree the principles laid down in that State, but we found that although the principle of voting rights for **aborigines** was accepted, there was no drive to educate and bring the aboriginal people to a stage at which they could fully participate in the political life of that State.

* I feel that the most difficult part of the inquiry related to the question of extending voing rights to nomadic and semi-nomadic **aborigines** such as are found in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and some isolated parts of Queensland.

* The problem was overcome, as I have already stated, by applying the South Australian system under which **aborigines** are given the right to enrol voluntarily and, once they are enrolled, are obliged to accept the full responsibility of voting thereafter.

* I want to emphasize that the right extended to **aborigines** under the terms of this measure will, I think, do much to bring these people right into the Australian community.

* Here am I, as the member for the Northern Territory, making recommendations concerning the rights of **aborigines** to vote, when I do not in fact have those rights myself.

* If the discussion is on Australian **aborigines**, apartheid in Sharpeville, or something like that, clearly there are ideological advantages to' be gained by the Communist- world'.

* He was greeted with statements such as, " You exterminated the **aborigines** in Tasmania ", and " What about the Australian **aborigines**? "

* I know that when the British Commonwealth Parliamentary Association people came here and we saw _them at banquets being received by State Premiers, and at long- and boring length the Premiers dilated on our wealth and development - which they cannot possibly imitate ^ in an equal period of time - what the visitors talked about was **aborigines**.

* Does it answer the heart of any coloured person if we 'get up here and say that .the **aborigines** are a State and not a Federal matter?

* .States, but only two **aborigines** have passed through universities in this country.

* assimilation " we mean we believe that the **aborigines**, as a people, should dis: appear and be absorbed into us - a piece, of spiritual arrogance which leaves apartheid floundering.

* be irrelevant tilings, like "You exterminated the **aborigines** in Tasmania" or "What about.

* your Australian ' **aborigines**? "

* Dr. F.  Lancaster Jones in his work "A Demographic Survey of Aborigines of the Northern Territory " said that in central Australian settlements the infant mortality rate was 208 per 1,000 live births and that this must be one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world.

* We should also try to raise the standards of the Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* Aborigines in Queensland can never be free.

* If you go to Palm Island you will find at least 30 or 40 **aborigines** there.

* The Director of Native Affairs has the right to move **aborigines** to prevent marriages, to see that their mail is censored, and to take over their wages.

* Under the Queensland Act, the wages of **aborigines** in Queensland are actually taken from them and cared for by protectors.

* These **aborigines** have been in that position for a long while, and they are waiting for their members of Parliament to speak for them.

* If members on the opposite side of the chamber are fair dinkum and really mean what they say about freedom for the Chinese, the Formosans and the people in the Congo, they might well turn their hearts and minds to an examination of the legal position of Australian **aborigines**.

* I join with other honorable members in complimenting the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  on his presentation of a report which, generally speaking, puts the position of the **aborigines** reasonably fairly.

* Apart from the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant),  the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley),  the honorable member for Macquarie  (Mr. Luchetti)  and the honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson)  I can think of few on either side of the House who have given much thought to the welfare of **aborigines**.

* I am glad that the Minister has mentioned them because he has given me the opportunity of saying that this is the very first time I have heard the honorable member for Macarthur pay the slightest attention to the plight of the **aborigines**.

* However, it is very nice, after all these years in Parliament, to find the honorable member belatedly, and perhaps reluctantly, coming in on the side of the **aborigines**.

* The Government should take more positive steps than it has taken already to ensure that **aborigines** receive the same award rates of pay as white men receive for the same class of work.

* The **aborigines** join the Australian Workers Union, and the union includes in its applications to the court for a variation of the federal pastoral award a claim for these people to be brought within the provisions of the award, but on each occasion the court rejects that claim.

* According to the decision of the Commonwealth court, the only **aborigines** in the pastoral industry who are entitled to award rates are shearers and that is because the shearing section of the pastoral award obliges the employer and the employee to enter into a personal contract which stipulates that the award rates of pay and other conditions prescribed for the shearing personnel shall apply.

* But the station hands who come within the category of **aborigines** set down by the various State authorities are not entitled to the provisions of the federal pastoral award, even though they are members of the union and even though the union repeatedly has made application to the court that they should be given .the benefit of the award.

* Because the graziers, by whom the **aborigines** are employed, and who now occupy the land which once was theirs, always vigorously oppose the application in the court.

* I should like to hear the views of the honorable member for Wannon  (Mr. Malcolm Fraser),  whose association - the Graziers Association - was responsible for preventing these **aborigines**- 
I looked up the list.

* All these honorable gentlemen who protest in this House that they believe in giving the **aborigines** justice and a fair go, and who are members of the graziers' association are wittingly or unwittingly, directly or indirectly, by their contributions helping to pay the costs of the case that is put forward by the graziers' association each time that the union submits its application to the court to ensure that the union's proposal is defeated.

* The Government belatedly has dealt with the matter of social services for **aborigines**.

* The only way in which I eventually got some common sense out of the Government was by forgetting the Minister for Social Services and by writing to the Prime Minister, reporting to him that the Minister for Social Services was unable to understand the logic of my submission, and reminding him that as well as being our Prime Minister he was also the Prime Minister of the **aborigines**.

* I think this softened his heart because shortly afterwards he directed the Minister for Social Services to ensure that the **aborigines** were given social service benefits.

* I did not notice any evidence that he was a strong campaigner for social services for **aborigines**.

* The conference agreed that the extension of social service benefits to **aborigines**, which has now been in operation for twelve months, has worked very smoothly.

* I do not know how the conference came to that conclusion because the scheme has not worked very smoothly for the **aborigines**.

* I have complained vigorously in Parliament about the fact that the Playford Government in South Australia takes all the social service benefits to which the **aborigines** are entitled and gives them only a small handout which is, in fact, less than what a white man who is an inmate in a hospital receives.

* How disgusting it is for the Minister to sit at the table stroking his forehead with his hand and appearing to take absolutely no notice of the fact that the Playford Government is receiving all of the money that is sent to South Australia for **aborigines** living on government mission stations!

* They went out shooting not kangaroos, but **aborigines**.

* The people who came here at the beginning of our settlement of this country have a disgraceful and wicked record so far as treatment of the **aborigines** is concerned.

* He admits that we have wiped out all but 70,000 of the **aborigines**.

* I have never heard a speech more damaging to Australia and the **aborigines**.

* If the pastoralist employs one stockman it means that he must feed and clothe not only that stockman but fifteen or twenty other **aborigines** in his family.

* Therefore, the whole family of **aborigines** would be penalized, and anybody who knows anything about the **aborigines** of Western Australia will know that what I say is true.

* These people who have worked in the interests of the natives in the past feel that if power is taken from the organizations which they have been helping, it will not be in the best interests of the **aborigines**.

* The honorable member for Wills advocates complete federal control of **aborigines**.

* It is possible to find amongst white people who should know better as much stupidity as is to be found amongst **aborigines** who do not know better.

* Our housing programme has got to be a gradual one, and here I pay tribute to two successive Ministers for Native Welfare in Western Australia, one a member of a 
Labour government and the other a member of a Liberal-Country Party government, who were most sympathetic towards the **aborigines**.

* The honorable member for Wills also said that a State like Western Australia, with a great number of **aborigines**, should not be asked to carry the responsibility of ministering to them.

* I believe that the care of **aborigines** should remain the responsibility of the States, and special provision is made by the Commonwealth Grants Commission for those States which suffer in carrying out this work.

* In reply to the references made, by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie to the people whom he calls the do-gooders, let me quote, from a statement made by the superintendent of a desert mission station where some dedicated people are working in the interests of the **aborigines**.

* One of the greatest problems of the **aborigines**, I believe, concerns those who have been made ready to move into a civilized community, who have been able to absorb the education of the white people and tolive in the environment of the white people.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Whitlam)  has directed the attention of the Parliament on a number of occasions to the comparative neglect of tuberculosis among Aborigines.

* What is the (a) text and (b) the date of policy decisions concerning the eligibility of Aborigines for enrolment in the pensioner medical service?

* How many Aborigines have been enrolled in the pensioner medical service?

* Mr. Deputy Speaker,  the attention of the House and Australia generally was fixed on the problems of the **aborigines** in the Northern Territory particularly in 1961 when this Government set up a select committee to inquire into the voting rights of **aborigines** throughout Australia.

* I want to mention at the outset that the Minister for the Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  made a very provocative point when he said that the present Government appointed the committee out of the goodness of its heart and with an earnest desire to promote the advancement of the **aborigines** of Australia.

* As a result of the work of the committee on voting rights for **aborigines**, a unanimous report was presented by members representative of all shades of political opinion in this House.

* The committee recommended that voting rights in Commonwealth elections be given to all **aborigines**.

* The Australian Labour Party has no cause for shame in its efforts to bring about the advancement of the **aborigines**.

* However, we know that if a system of paying the basic wage to **aborigines** was introduced overnight, there would be dislocation not only to the **aborigines** themselves but also to industry.

* The problem of the welfare and employment of **aborigines** is not the sole responsibility of the employers; it is the responsibility of the Australian community.

* If this is done, the whole economic evolution of the **aborigines** will take place without a great deal of dislocation.

* The advancement of the **aborigines** must be planned.

* The machinery he created has remained and we believe that some improvement is now necessary to take account of the advanced state of the **aborigines** at present and to ensure that their further social, political and economic advancement proceeds as quickly as possible.

* We of the Labour Party, who have raised this matter to-day, do not regard the plight of the **aborigines** as a problem into which politics should intrude.

* We all would commend the work done for the **aborigines** by the former Minister for Territories, the present Minister for Defence  (Mr. Hasluck),  and we hope that the new Minister for Territories will follow in his predecessor's footsteps and do all in his power for the benefit not only of the aboriginal population of the Northern Territory but of all the people of all of the Territories administered by the Commonwealth.

* Without in any way detracting from the value of measures recently introduced into the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory, we say that they are not sufficient and that living standards of the **aborigines** must be raised so that they may take advantage of the removal of restrictions that have for so long been placed upon them.

* Only a comparatively few Australians whose employment or tourist activities take them into the backblocks of this country see **aborigines** in the circumstances in which many of them exist in Australia.

* Most of the **aborigines** whom the majority of Australians see are fringe dwellers around small country towns.

* The circumstances in which **aborigines** live as fringe dwellers are entirely different from the traditional pattern of aboriginal life as it was prior to settlement of this country by the white man.

* No matter how much we may see the **aborigines** to-day as a dependent people, prior to European settlement of Australia the aboriginal was basically an individualist.

* It is true that there are defects in the legislation which applies to **aborigines** in Queensland, but it is also true that the present Queensland Government has caused to be set up a committee which is investigating these matters, and those interested in aboriginal problems are hoping for great improvements in Queensland in the near future.

* The number of **aborigines** in Australia who are out of contact with our form of civilization and culture is very small indeed to-day, so we need to introduce a new dimension into the problem of helping these people.

* The Labour Party wishes the Government would see to it that those **aborigines** working on pastoral properties and in other places are paid full award wages.

* Many **aborigines** are quite capable of working, as stockmen, equally as well as and in some cases better than Europeans, but some **aborigines** are not capable of meeting this standard and it may be that, as was suggested by the honorable member for Fremantle, the Government will have to find some way in which to subsidize the employers of these aboriginal people or the industries in which they work.

* It was never intended that the wording of the Social Services Act should deny to **aborigines** social service payments because of the technicality that few of them earn more than the normal amounts paid in social service benefits.

* Immediately the restrictions are removed and the **aborigines** are brought, in many cases, face to face, somewhat ruthlessly, with the conditions applying in our culture, with competition for work and with other aspects of living in our form of society, a great increase in expenditure on social work and measures of that kind among the aboriginal people will be required.

* The declaration has been quoted from this side of the House on two occasions in the last year - in respect of the question of South Africa and in relation to the question of voting rights for **aborigines**.

* I am not suggesting that the sense of grievance among our **aborigines** is in any way similar in degree to the sense of grievance which has caused so many people in eastern Europe to go to the West.

* It is his reason why no questions should be asked abroad about what we do to the **aborigines** or what we do in our administration of Papua.

* Yet this Parliament sits complacent while the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission makes an award in the pastoral industry applying to all employees except Aborigines.

* The Minister for Territories refused to answer a question, put to him on Tuesday last by the honorable member for Fremantle, relating to award rates paid to **aborigines**, on the ground that a bill relating to this subject is at present before the council.

* The **aborigines** are scattered over vast areas and some are primitive.

* He referred to the relevant portion of Section 51 of the Constitution, which reads - 
My honorable friend adduced that the reason for the insertion of that provision was that the States, in their jealousy, feared that if unrestricted power were given to the Commonwealth it would be used by the Commonwealth to set aside vast reserves for the **aborigines**, to the detriment of the people of the States.

* I congratulate the Minister upon his effort to clarify the position in relation to the **aborigines** and to introduce a workable provision.

* A lot of **aborigines** are concerned about their legal position in this matter.

* In the fields of music and linguistics the need was particularly urgent because a great deal of information was to be found only in the minds and memories of **aborigines** who were nearing the end of their life span.

* The Parliament has before it a bill to grant voting rights to Australian **aborigines**.

* Whether it will do so or not I cannot say, because enrolment will not be compulsory, and many **aborigines** may not avail themselves of their right.

* .- As the result of the bill which the House is about to pass unanimously, it will be permissible for **aborigines** to enroll for federal elections in every State of the Commonwealth.

* I quote paragraph 87 of the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* It reads - 
Your Committee draws attention to the evidence of the Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth concerning the counting of **aborigines**  for  determining the quota for electorates, which reads as follows: - "They would not be counted for the purposes of Section 127."

* I wish to direct attention to the consequences of the permissible enrolment of **aborigines**.

* One can only speculate how many **aborigines** will enroll by the time of the next elections, but we do know with fair precision at this stage how many **aborigines** can enroll when this bill is passed.

* It so happens that the greatest number of eligible **aborigines** will be in the largest electorates in Australia.

* According to figures which the Commonwealth Statistician gave me a month later, it appears that the greatest number of **aborigines** in any electorate, as far as they can be ascertained, were in Kalgoorlie, the number being 7,559.

* It is clear that if all the adult full-blood **aborigines** in Kalgoorlie were to enroll, Kalgoorlie's electoral population would increase considerably, and therefore it would not be so likely that the area of the electorate would have to be enlarged; it would be quite likely that the number in the electorate, including the eligible **aborigines**, would be within the permissible margin.

* But in that electorate, there is the second greatest number of **aborigines** of all ages - 2,004.

* There again, if the adult **aborigines** were to enroll, Kennedy would no longer have the smallest enrolment in Queensland.

* A distribution is taking place at the moment, and I ask the Minister whether, in making that distribution, it will be assumed that all eligible **aborigines** will, in fact, enroll.

* If it is not so assumed, what proportion of eligible **aborigines** is it assumed will enroll?

* In the field of education we find broken promises, in the field of defence we find complacent self-delusion, and on the question of the **aborigines** we find that these people have been completely ignored.

* Then there are the question of votes for **aborigines**, the hours of polling, the position of the names of candidates on the ballot-paper and the expenditure of individual candidates on election campaigns.

* The honorable member for Fremantle went on to deal with the voting rights of **aborigines**, and on this matter also, I thought, he spoke with great moderation and great good sense.

* I commend the Minister for the Interior  (Mr. Freeth)  on his motion for the appointment of a select committee to consider the voting rights of **aborigines**, and I find it very hard to understand the reasoning of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Whitlam),  who, I believe, intends to propose an amendment to this bill designed to give the right to vote to **aborigines** straight away.

* I find it extraordinary that he appears to want **aborigines** to get the right to vote immediately and apparently wants the select committee subsequently to decide whether the **aborigines** should still have voting rights.

* How can the Opposition expect to propose an amendment to this bill to give **aborigines** a vote immediately and later subscribe to what we hope will be a sound report recommending which **aborigines** should have the right to vote and how they should get it?

* There are many difficulties in the way of giving votes to **aborigines**.

* One difficulty is where to find the nomad **aborigines** to enrol them.

* Many **aborigines** certainly would not know for whom they were voting.

* We cannot simply decide, "Well, we are going to give the **aborigines** a vote " and leave it at that.

* I agree with my colleague, the honorable member for Perth  (Mr. Chaney),  that undoubtedly practically all the **aborigines** in Australia will soon be given a vote.

* There may be some who, because of illiteracy or for some other reason, will not be able to vote, but I think that very soon the bulk of the **aborigines** will be granted the right to vote.

* If you recognize that as a fact, you recognize that we have two standards in our minds; one of what we think should be done for Europeans and one of what we think should be done for **aborigines**.

* In some places, water has been put in for the animals upon which the **aborigines** live.

* In dealing with **aborigines**, we are dealing with the most difficult problem in this respect.

* You cannot just go in and take their land; but wherever they have lived in a hunting economy, as did the Red 
Indians in North America, or the **aborigines** of northern Australia, it has been possible for conquest to take the land upon which they hunted, and to destroy the people.

* What  Dr. Davidson  is really asking for is a total attack, and it is also a request for a revolution of attitude on our part - somehow to get Australians to take a pride in the **aborigines** and in their traditions, as the Filipinos take a pride in the **aborigines** of their country.

* There is no section of the community more depressed than the 18,000 **aborigines** in Western Australia.

* But there would have been no diminution in numbers of members in this House from Queensland and Western Australia if the Government had put the Constitutional Review Committee's proposals to the people concerning the counting of Aborigines in the population and had had them accepted.

* Section 127 of the Constitution reads - 
Aborigines in all the States now have votes for the House of Representatives, although they are still denied a vote in State elections in Queensland and until recently were denied it in Western Australia.

* If Aborigines could be counted in working out the number of divisions in each State, then Queensland and Western Australia would retain their present numbers.

* The principal Act precludes Aborigines being counted in working out the number of divisions for a State.

* The three matters then, that I have raised, relate to the counting of Aborigines; the standard quota of electors for each division in this house and the number of members in this House, irrespective of the number of senators.

* The Aborigines in Queensland and Western Australia would have been counted and the present number of electoral divisions in those States would have been preserved.

* Furthermore, as a result of Aborigines being counted the most northerly electorates in Australia would have been smaller in area than they are now, just as they all are smaller now than they were before the 1949 enlargement of this House.

* Queensland- Three (3) Aborigines are at present employed aboard M.V.

* Western Australia - Ten (10) Aborigines are normally employed at Cape Don Lightstation, during the unloading of the Lighthouse vessel, and six (6) were employed over a tenday period in February 1965, on maintenance of the landing at Cape Don.

* South Australia - No Aborigines are employed by the Department in South Australia.

* Queensland - No Aborigines are employed by the Commonwealth Railways in Queensland.

* Western Australia - Three (3) Aborigines are at present employed in workshop, goods shed and stores labouring, and on maintenance of the permanent way.

* South Australia - Fifty-six (56) Aborigines at present employed in workshop, goods shed and stores labouring and on maintenance of the permanent way.

* Other Authorities - No other authority under the control of the Minister for Shipping and Transport has a requirement for the employment of Aborigines.

* If so, has an excision from the reserve been made, and were the local Aborigines consulted about the choice of the site?

* If the Aborigines were consulted, were they represented by legal counsel?

* The bills which this Parliament has said must be reserved for the GovernorGeneral's pleasure are those dealing with the grant or disposal of Crown lands, the grant  ing  of any benefit to the Administrator of the Territory himself, and laws relating to **aborigines** or aboriginal labour - section 4v.

* It is an ordinance which seeks to amend the present provisions of the law regarding penalties to be imposed on persons convicted of supplying intoxicating liquor to **aborigines**.

* The meaning of " **aborigines** " in this context is people who have been committed as wards to  the  care of the State.

* I hope I can assume that there is no member of this House who will question the  Tightness  of the law of the Territory which prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to those **aborigines** who are still under the care and protection of the State.

* There are still, however,  in  the Northern Territory, as in some other parts of Australia, some thousands of **aborigines** who are living close to their ancient form of life and who still require special care and assistance.

* It is not simply a matter of having a few convivial drinks, for the traffic in drink among these primitive **aborigines** is usually associated with other evils and attended by other consequences than getting under the influence of liquor.

* As I understand the position, the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory does not join issue on this main point, but joins issue only on the question of the severity of penalties to be imposed on persons who are convicted of supplying liquor to **aborigines**, and the manner in which those penalties should be imposed.

* Penalties against the supply of liquor are recognized as being only one means, and perhaps the least satisfactory means, of dealing with this grave threat to the welfare of **aborigines**, but we feel that we would be lacking in responsibility and would be impeding the work of the advancement of native welfare if we did not maintain this deterrent in its full force.

* bv **aborigines**.

* and has exercised it only on these two social questions of drinking among **aborigines** and the legalizing of betting shops.

* The need for this greater acceptance of responsibility for the Aborigines by the Commonwealth has been before this Parliament continually, for my part, for eight years.

* I recognise, I believe that my colleagues on this side recognise and I am sure that most honorable members in this House recognise that no political party and no social group - not even the Churches - has any great record of successful amelioration of the lot of the Aborigines in the past.

* of the Constitution the words " other than the Aboriginal race in any State" on the ground that these words amount to discrimination against Aborigines.

* It is not true that the Commonwealth has not discriminated against Aborigines because of the existence of this provision in the Constitution.

* In other words, it is not a fact that the existence of this provision in the Constitution prevents the Commonwealth from discriminating against Aborigines.

* So if that argument is discarded there is a strong case for placing on the statute book a measure that will prevent future governments of the Commonwealth from discriminating against Aborigines.

* This provision was written into the Social Services Act some years ago when the Act was amended in an attempt to extend the availability of social services to Aborigines.

* They want to eliminate the words "other than the Aboriginal race in any State", on the ground that these words amount to discrimination against Aborigines.

* The Prime Minister said that if we removed section 127 we would allow the Commonwealth to discriminate, but I am pointing out that at the present moment there are discriminatory clauses in acts of the Commonwealth, despite this provision and that therefore the existence of this section, as it stands at present, is no protection for the Aborigines of Australia.

* As I said earlier, it is not a question of the Aborigines just being counted - they must also count.

* If I may refer to other things mentioned by the right honorable gentleman, he said - 
I believe that if we are going to take the step of removing section 127, a step which will give Aborigines a place in the census and on the electoral rolls in such a way that they are counted, it is important that we also take the positive step of enabling the Commonwealth to accept full responsibility.

* In fact, only a week after I raised that matter for discussion the former member for Parkes,  Mr. Haylen,  presented a petition from certain electors of the State of New South Wales praying that the Government would, at the earliest practicable date, take legislative action to effect the amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of removing social and political disabilities on **aborigines**.

* I cannot see how it can possibly take up the challenge in respect of Aborigines unless it takes to itself the power to do so.

* The counting of Aborigines is particularly relevant on the question of housing.

* The States of Australia have been able to ignore their proper duty to the Aborigines.

* Speaking to this point, may I say that of the 100,000 Aborigines in Australia, 50,000 or so are in Queensland.

* When engaging employees under the normal entry standards for the Commonwealth Public Service the Commonwealth is concerned only with qualifications and makes no distinction between Aborigines' and other applicants.

* There are no statistics readily available which would show the total employment of Aborigines or part Aborigines by the Commonwealth.

* The main area of employment for Aborigines is the Northern Territory and the majority of those employed there come under the terms of the Northern Territory Wards' Employment Ordinance.

* It has already been announced that the Commonwealth Government's general policy of nondiscrimination applies to the employment of Aborigines by the Northern Territory Administration and by Commonwealth Departments.

* This was made clear during hearings, before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, of the case concerning employment of Aborigines in the cattle industry in the Northern Territory.

* I compliment the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  on his desire to do something for the **aborigines** of Australia.

* We cannot have the **aborigines** as a separate people.

* I think we all agree, particularly those who have had experience of Australian **aborigines**, that they are probably the kindliest and gentlest people in the world.

* I agree with the suggestion of the honorable member for Wills about assimilating the **aborigines**.

* He illustrated his suggestion by referring to conditions under which **aborigines** live on the outskirts of Melbourne.

* Naturally we cannot take the black children away from their parents, because the **aborigines** have very strong family attachments.

* That is most important, because we shattered the dignity and the self-respect of the **aborigines** when we destroyed their tribal laws.

* I should like to suggest several avenues for the useful employment of **aborigines**.

* When we consider the expertness and the value of the gaucho horseman on the pampas we can realize that there are great possibilities in our northern areas for giving the **aborigines** opportunities to earn their living, take their part in community life and develop our community.

* Its purpose is the protection of the pensioner and it does not involve discrimination against Aborigines.

* I have seen and have spoken to people who have lived with groups of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory and in Arnhem Land - one of the better parts of the Northern Territory - and they have gone out with groups who have spent the whole day getting perhaps three yams.

* I would remind honorable members that the two States that have the largest number of **aborigines** have been under Labour governments for the greater part of their history.

* What have those governments done for the **aborigines**?

* Just look at the position of **aborigines** in New South Wales.

* Let me remind the House that the amendment introduced by the Opposition at that time provided for the compulsory enrolment of **aborigines**.

* I pay tribute to him for the tremendous amount of work he did as a member of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* He was of great assistance in gathering all possible information on the history of the **aborigines** and our constitutional attitude towards them.

* I agree with his contention that the vote itself will not mean very much to the **aborigines** for the time being.

* In all the evidence taken by the committee it appeared that the desire for a vote was not the main consideration in the minds of the **aborigines**.

* I think most of the members of the committee would agree that the **aborigines** appear to be seeking a symbol of equality with the white man.

* We saw some remarkable efforts by the States to endeavour to improve the status of the **aborigines**.

* There again they are under the disadvantage that white people judge the standards of the **aborigines** against those of the best and not the worst of the whites.

* However, the **aborigines** as a whole cannot be isolated in the future.

* Over the last five years there have been several occasions on which the House has debated various matters concerning the Aborigines.

* On two occasions committees of this House have been appointed to investigate certain matters concerning the Aborigines and to report on them.

* That matter on which there is dispute between the honorable member for Fremantle and the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  as well as the honorable member for Higinbotham  (Mr. Chipp)  concerns the means by which Aborigines in a nomadic state came to live in Government settlements.

* Now, however, Australian Aborigines in the nomadic state have come to live rather more frequently and in larger numbers in recent years on Government settlements in the Northern Territory, and it is not sufficient to say that because losses have occurred in other places they will, therefore, occur here too.

* The objective, as the honorable member for Mackellar has said and as the honorable member for Fremantle has said today and on many other occasions, is to give the Aborigines a sense of purpose in their lives.

* The diseases to which Aborigines in the Northern Territory are more prone than are Aborigines living in the States or other Australians anywhere in Australia are diseases which were introduced to this country last century.

* There was no tuberculosis and no leprosy among Aborigines before Europeans settled in Australia.

* My impression was that leprosy was introduced amongst the Australian Aborigines by indentured workers who were brought in from South East Asia and from China.

* It seems to be agreed on ail hands that there was no tuberculosis among the Aborigines before the Europeans settled in this country.

* I do not think that anybody has asserted that there was leprosy amongst the Aborigines before the Europeans settled here.

* It seems to be fairly plain that the circumstances in which Aborigines are infected with tuberculosis and leprosy are associated with the conditions in which they are living in crowded Government settlements.

* Aborigines are particularly prone to these two diseases, the spread of which is being promoted by living conditions in Government settlements.

* Furthermore, vigilant and urgent attention should be given to carrying out individual medical inspections of Aborigines living in these settlements.

* The Opposition makes no apology for raising this matter in the House, as it has raised the matters of social services, voting rights, mineral rights and constitutional rights for Aborigines.

* The question of constitutional Fights for Aborigines has not been settled and is still on the notice paper.

* The rights of **aborigines** in the Northern Territory is a subject that is being dealt with by the Northern Territory Legislative Council at present.

* The Legislative Council for the Northern Territory has appointed a select committee to inquire into all matters relating to the rights of **aborigines**, including whether they should be paid award rates, and many other factors.

* As a consequence of the referendum result, Aboriginal affairs should now be seen as having been expanded into a joint Commonwealth-State responsibility; the problems of the Aboriginal and part-Aboriginal people from State to State and within each State are, however, so diverse that for so long as can be seen the interests of Aborigines and part-Aborigines will be best served by programmes administered by State authorities within the context of overall policies as agreed between the States and Commonwealth.

* Each State to formulate an overall programme of priority measures related to specific advancement targets, with each State undertaking consultation with representative Aborigines to the fullest extent appropriate.

* Such programmes should be prepared as soon as possible and then discussed at a special meeting of the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council with a view to the formulation of a jointCommonwealthState programme for advancing the welfare of Australian Aborigines and part-Aborigines.

* Legislative changes to remove discriminatory and protective provisions applicable to Aborigines by reasons of their race are virtually complete.

* When another $5,000,000 or $6,000,000 is added to allow for the costs incurred by Education, Health, Housing and Social Service Departments in relation to Aborigines, it appears that some $21,000,000 annually is being expended on Aboriginal advancement 
Efforts are continuing to expand and train welfare staffs.

* Throughout Australia there is now 1 full-time member of Government and mission staffs to every 70 Aborigines and part-Aborigines.

* Acceptance of Aborigines and part-Aborigines on the part of the community and personal encouragement to them are needed.

* Training and Employment: Conference recognised the key importance of adequate training and employment opportunities for the advancement of Aborigines and supported special programmes to these ends where existing programmes had not been fully effective.

* Ministers considered that advancement in other fields needs to be matched by the economic advancement of Aborigines.

* In remote areas real problems are being encountered in providing suitable or enough employment opportunities for Aborigines and it is not easy for the Aborigines to move or adjust to areas of greater opportunity.

* Conference supported equality under awards and equality of wages and employment conditions for Aborigines and would regard it as proper for welfare administrations where necessary to take an active role in assisting Aborigines to obtain those conditions.

* It was agreed that employment conditions appropriate to normal industry should not necessarily apply to areas where Aborigines are in a training or relief situation.

* Business Undertakings: Conference recognised that the advancement of Aborigines should be considered not only in terms of their becoming wage and salary earners in the community but also in their taking up avenues of self-employment or business undertakings.

* Conference drew attention to the value of the continuing development of individual business and corporate enterprises conducted by Aborigines and affirmed that the further development of such projects would continue to be encouraged by advice and financial assistance where appropriate.

* Land Matters: Ministers noted that considerable attention had been devoted to the question of land rights' for Aborigines during the referendum campaign.

* A major concern appeared to be that Aborigines should have the opportunity to own or lease land on reserves and they should be given assistance to establish themselves on the land.

* Aborigines in the Northern Territory can already obtain leases on Reserves or elsewhere by the normal processes or leases outside Reserves of up to 160 acres.

* Conference recognised that in some States and the Northern Territory Aboriginal reserve land constitutes a resource for advancing Aborigines and supported measures to make effective use of this resource.

* Such proposals should not, however, restrict other developments, e.g., by mining, forestry or other industries which could be of considerable direct and indirect benefit to the Aborigines by providing them with employment opportunities, the opportunity to benefit from improved community facilities and to participate in wider community affairs.

* Conference recognised the value to Aborigines and to the enrichment of Australian cultural life of encouraging pride and participation in elements of traditional Aboriginal culture in such forms as legend, music, dance and art.

* It is not the policy of welfare administrations to seek to destroy such cultural elements, but to encourage them, in promoting the advancement of Aborigines in the general community.

* Consultation with Aborigines: Ministers noted that there appeared to be some misconception that Aboriginal affairs administrations tend to act without consulting Aborigines and part-Aborigines or without regard for their views.

* Conference re-affirmed that Aborigines and part- Aborigines should be consulted at all levels in formulating and carrying out policies for their advancement.

* The need for and value of such consultation has been recognised for some time past and a number of measures taken to obtain it For example in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia,  Aborigines are members  of the welfare boards.

* The Aboriginal Lands Trust in South Australia is wholly composed of Aborigines.

* In all States and the Northern Territory Aborigines participate in councils and committees concerned with advising on and managing Aboriginal affairs at various levels.

* Entry on to Reserves: Conference agreed that in the interests of the Aboriginal people in those States and the Northern Territory where there are still congregations of Aborigines on reserves a form of permit system should be retained until such time as their communities through their own Councils can handle this matter or until 'such time as permits are no longer necessary.

* Conference noted the increasing burden being placed on Aboriginal communities in remote areas by research work and by the demands of commercial 
Education: Greatly intensified efforts have been made in recent years to provide full educational opportunities for Aborigines.

* Special note was made of the increasing number of Aborigines and part-Aborigines progressing to secondary education and staying at school longer.

* Where necessary special schools have been established to ensure that Aborigines have equal opportunities.

* These include the capacity of the Aborigines themselves to manage a new housing situation and the acceptance of Aboriginal housing by the community.

* Precipitate action to locate Aborigines in houses for which they are not suited or in areas where undue social stresses can occur might do damage to long-term programmes.

* Many part-Aborigines and Aborigines can be provided for by normal Housing Commission programmes, or by normal home-financing schemes.

* In both cases it is necessary to provide suitable housing adapted to the Aborigines' stage of development and capacity to pay.

* For both Aborigines and part-Aborigines special assistance from welfare authorities and agencies is frequently necessary to enable them to adjust satisfactorily to a new environment.

* Conference noted that considerable expenditure on housing for Aborigines and part- Aborigines by Aboriginal welfare authorities totalling S6,294,000 in the last 5 years and that in addition, houses allotted to Aborigines by the various State and Territory housing authorities were in excess of 1,000.

* Social Services: Conference noted the considerable advance made in recent years in paying pensions direct to Aborigines rather than through some other person or authority on behalf of the pensioner.

* Publicity: Conference noted the considerable amount of publicity material including films prepared and distributed by the Commonwealth and in particular the new publication 'The Australian Aborigines' which gives a concise account of the efforts of governments and progress achieved in Aboriginal advancement throughout Australia.

* It looked forward to continued co-operation from such organisations in the advancement of Aborigines and part-Aborigines and in adding to the community's understanding of these matters.

* They noted that the Committee considered there was a need for research into the migratory trends of Aborigines in the Central Reserves area.

* The legislation applied to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory is race legislation.

* Although the words " aboriginal " and " native " have been removed from the books, all full-blood **aborigines** were declared to be wards.

* Some twelve or fifteen of them achieved citizenship, but an appeal tribunal was supposed to be set up so that **aborigines** could appeal to the Government.

* The facts are that the administrative organization has not been set up so that the **aborigines** can exercise their right of appeal.

* The **aborigines** were not regarded as citizens and the merits of each case were not judged individually.

* The **aborigines** were declared to be wards because they were full-blood **aborigines**.

* What we ask is that every one of those 16,000 be regarded as individual human beings - as people and not as **aborigines**.

* Aborigines do not get the full wages paid to other employees.

* At this station, the **aborigines** live out of sight around the corner, on the banks of the river, in humpies.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  raised this subject so that the status of **aborigines** could be raised by a national attack, and a national attack that started forthwith.

* A recommendation was made some years ago that a national committee be set up to inquire into the health of **aborigines**, but nothing has been done.

* I know, personally, of examples in various parts of Australia where **aborigines**, either by good fortune, or as the result of good planning, have been brought into the circle of our way of life.

* In Victoria, the wealthiest State, and one which ought to have the most resources at its disposal, the aboriginal question is of smaller proportions than anywhere else because the number of **aborigines** there is the lowest in any State.

* In the last report of the Aborigines Welfare Board of Victoria for the year ended 30th June, 1959, this statement appears with regard to housing - 
Unfortunately, the double standard of which my friend, the honorable member for Fremantle, has spoken is in evidence in Victoria.

* The 22 houses built for the **aborigines** are not of the same standard as those for white people.

* Some people might say that the **aborigines** are not trained to appreciate the better type of housing and might knock them about, but the time has come for us to recognize that it is better to mend broken windows than attempt to salvage broken lives and broken hearts.

* One has only to consider the question in Queensland where the **aborigines** have no rights, or if any are conferred upon them they are of a tentative and tenuous nature.

* Aborigines should not be deprived of the rights of ordinary citizens.

* Judging from the way in which they have spoken, they have tried to give the impression that, in some way or other, opinion in this chamber is divided along party lines as to whether **aborigines** should have the vote.

* On both sides of the chamber wilt be found members who would speak with equal enthusiasm to the proposition that all **aborigines** in Australia should have the vote if they are capable of exercising it.

* House has already taken in appointing a select committee is that the giving of a vote to **aborigines**, without any restriction at all, will be attended by some problems which need careful examination.

* The method which the House itself has already chosen, with the support of both sides, is to appoint a select committee so that these problems can be examined and so that we can see all the implications of extending the franchise to all **aborigines**.

* If members of the Opposition are trying to create the impression that they want votes for all **aborigines** and that the Government does not want votes for all **aborigines**, they are trying to create a totally false impression.

* There are members on both sides of the chamber who would speak with enthusiasm on the question of giving votes to **aborigines**.

* There are members on both sides of the chamber who would speak with caution about giving votes to **aborigines**.

* The attempt to turn this issue into a party issue, I think, does no service to this committee and is not likely to do much service to the **aborigines** themselves.

* Another point that I would make is this: We often overlook the fact that a very large number of **aborigines** in Australia already do vote.

* Do not let us deceive ourselves or give a false impression to other people by suggesting that, for the first time, we are giving the vote to **aborigines**.

* Thousands of **aborigines** already have a vote.

* They exercise it intelligently and are not differentiated from any other voters because they are **aborigines**.

* The whole assumption the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition made about excluding people solely because they are **aborigines** falls down because there are thousands of people who, being **aborigines**, do vote and are not excluded on that ground.

* The exclusion of some people of aboriginal blood is on grounds other than that they are **aborigines**.

* I feel confident that, for the **aborigines** themselves and for Australian political democracy, a far happier result is likely to ensue by allowing the select committee to go ahead with its work, to examine all facets of this problem and present, without party division, what I hope will be a unanimous report regarding the extension of the franchise to more of the aboriginal population than enjoy it at present.

* I wish to inform the House of the following appointments of honorable members as members of the Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve: -  Mr. Barnes, Mr. Chipp, Mr. Dean  and  Mr. Kelly  have been appointed by the Prime Minister;  Mr. Beazley, Mr. Bryant  and  Mr. Nelson  have been appointed by the Leader of the Opposition.

* I said also that the Constitution would not then protect Aborigines against discrimination; indeed, the States would retain their present power of discrimination.

* The council has held conference after conference attended by members of the aboriginal race and people of all classes and creeds in Australia, at which the delegates have advocated alteration of the Constitution to remove from it any provision under which discrimination against the **aborigines** may flow from the terminology used.

* I know lots of sophisticated **aborigines**.

* He feels that these provisions of the Constitution are an affront to all **aborigines**.

* Until we remove these provisions from the Constitution **aborigines** cannot feel that they are free, or equal with Australians.

* Section 8a of the Aborigines Protection Act of New South Wales states - 
Section 17 of the Aborigines Act of South Australia provides for the removal of **aborigines** to reserves.

* There is power to exercise complete control over the children of **aborigines** and over the property of **aborigines**, and to inflict taxes.

* A question that the Attorney-General  (Sir Garfield Barwick)  might well consider is whether the imposition of a State income tax on **aborigines**, in the form of a levy, as has been done in Queensland, is valid.

* It is a system which has grown up from  a  desire to protect the **aborigines**.

* If we could devote the resources of the Commonwealth to solving the problems of the Australian **aborigines** we would get results much more quickly in, for instance, housing and education.

* The only way in which we can mobilize the resources of the nation to solve the social problem of the **aborigines** is by first taking the step of removing from the Constitution the words which prevent this Parliament from legislating with complete confidence in this sphere.

* When all is said and done, we have not done so well, even in Australia, in relation to the assimilation of the **aborigines**, even though we have been in this land for 172 years.

* At the end of his first 15 minutes, when he was criticising the Government for having these unhappy people at Papunya I tried, at the last moment, to find out what the honorable member for Fremantle would do with these Aborigines.

* It reads - 
The need to protect the interests of Central Australian Aborigines induced-  " Induced " seems to be the key word here -  to leave their tribal lands for inadequately- ;  "Inadequately" is the other key word - :  prepared Government settlements.

* Many of the Aborigines were diseased.

* But is it not time that he, at least, had clear in his own mind what he want done with the Aborigines who are placed in this hapless position in which they find themselves?

* He wants the Aborigines to be given further and higher education.

* It is, of course, desirable that Aborigines should leave the nomadic state.

* As for the reason being given for contacting the Aborigines concerned, I find it hard to accept that the Commonwealth would wait for a drought to last three years before it would send an expedition to these Aboriginal people.

* One of them was to get the Aborigines out of the wa'y of missiles that might be fired from the Woomera rocket range.

* There are 17,000 Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* Of course, I do not want Aborigines sent back now.

* In answer to the question of the honorable member for Higinbotham, I say I would prefer in drought conditions to go to the expense of sending out expeditions to feed Aborigines rather than to bring them into a settlement which was not adequately prepared.

* Why is it that in a community such as the Northern Territory, where half of the population is made up of **aborigines**, the Minister has been unable to exercise the power that lies with him to nominate an aboriginal to the Legislative Council?

* There will be no future for the **aborigines** of these Territories until we raise their living standards by paying them adequate wages.

* If we set out in this country to follow a policy, initiated by the lawfully elected government, to massacre our **aborigines**, would not other nations have the right to intervene?

* I remember that a Western Australian Minister used to go to conferences and say: "All Aborigines are citizens within the meaning of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948-1960".

* But Western Australia is still putting Aborigines through a process of applying for citizenship rights.

* If assimilation is that Aborigines should come to share the ideals, convictions, rights and interests of the general Australian community it is an objective that does not put the Administration under discipline.

* Can an administrator say: "Today I have done so-and-so to help the **aborigines** share the rights, ideals and so forth of the Australian community "?

* I honestly think that if as much time were spent on debating the liquor rights of Aborigines as seems to be indicated in the Minister's statement, then this is an example of the pathetic level of our thinking on this subject.

* I realise all the problems associated with denying liquor and so forth to Aborigines, but must we be like a gramophone needle stuck in a crack on the record still on this question of liquor rights, liquor rights, liquor rights?

* If this happens every time we discuss Aborigines then we are not getting very far.

* We have sometimes asked questions about the Commonwealth level of wages paid to Aborigines employed by the Services, but on a number of occasions Ministers have turned the question into wages paid to Aborigines serving in the Services.

* I know that an Aboriginal corporal or an Aboriginal sergeant gets the same pay as a non-Aboriginal corporal or a non-Aboriginal sergeant, but the thing is that when we were in Darwin we saw the Services, which are instruments of the Commonwealth, employing Aborigines in a civil capacity as labourers at wages that were about one third or one quarter of the European rate.

* Finally, he criticises the Government for its failure to submit to referendum the two bills to alter the Constitution in respect of Aborigines and the Parliament which were passed last year and, in connection with the latter Bill, to disclose the related distribution proposals.

* Like most of us, I came to this Parliament not very well informed on the Aborigines.

* While anything inhibits Commonwealth action in the field of Aboriginal advancement, the Aborigines cannot receive the full benefits of Commonwealth resources.

* But the Commonwealth Government has no constitutional authority to establish such a system for the Aborigines of Northern Queensland or Western Australia although I do not suppose its authority to do so would be challenged.

* I refer to the Federal Council for Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.

* The  President  of the Council is  Mr. Joe 
Granting that the House is agreed that the Aboriginal question is one of conscience which we can clear only by Commonwealth action; that in the political field we can get the majority of people in the majority of States on side; that there are adequate resources to campaign with; that those who campaign will have the co-operation of large bodies of significant organisations; and that, therefore, the only barrier to the successful passage into the Constitution of Commonwealth responsibility for Aborigines lies in our own hearts and our own morale, I believe that this afternoon we are setting our feet upon a path which will change the whole structure and nature of the Aboriginal situation in Australia.

* I move on to say that the Government desires above all things that all people concerned with the care and the training of the **aborigines** in the north should have a clear understanding of current policies.

* His  report on the Gove bauxite project and the **aborigines** of 9th July last refutes most of the irresponsible statements of the honorable member for Wills.

* I  replied that mining companies have been prospecting in this area since 19S6 and the Aborigines have been helping them as paid labour.

* I share his concern for the interests of the Aborigines.

* A hundred miles journey on foot may concern the honorable member but it would not concern the Aborigines.

* I admit that at the present time Papunya is overcrowded, but that apart, a lot of the Aborigines will not accept the conditions of housing there, excellent though they are.

* Further, the Aborigines will not make use of the normal hygiene facilities on the stations.

* Are we to increase the facilities available in the settlements in order to keep the Aborigines away from the areas where they have no future whatsoever?

* The area is extremely arid and there is no opportunity to establish industry through which the Aborigines may support their ambitions.

* To my way of thinking the best course is gradually to induce the younger groups to go to the northern areas of the Northern Territory where we are embarking on very large forestry schemes, to which the Aborigines are particularly adapted.

* The work force, we hope, will be supplied by the Aborigines.

* We are to consider an amendment to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to the Northern Territory (Administration) Act by which the Aborigines will come within the award system of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* I believe that the settlements are places where the Aborigines acquire skills.

* To this end, we are initiating a programme under which the Aborigines will build their own houses instead of them being built by the Department of Works.

* If we do not provide opportunities for the Aborigines to acquire skills they will remain at the settlements and we will have established a type of apartheid in the Northern Territory.

* That is a total of 700 Aborigines who have contracted leprosy out of 19,000.

* This figure includes those Aborigines who have been cured.

* The Minister has said that the incidence of tuberculosis among the Australian Aborigines is probably lower than among any other non-European native people in any part of the world.

* Not only is it a waste of the taxpayers' money but it is not being very fair to the Aborigines themselves.

* Great efforts were made to see that no Aborigines existed in those areas in which a missile fired from Woomera might possibly land.

* When the committee ceased its deliberations in 1958 it had given some consideration to the very important question of making laws with respect to **aborigines**.

* Let me start with the honorable member for Barker  (Mr. Forbes)  who is concerned, as is the honorable member for Sturt  (Mr. Wilson),  with the position of the **aborigines** who may well be primitives, but who nevertheless have had votes in South Australian State elections since 1902.

* Why can the Commonwealth Government not enable **aborigines** in other States to vote at Commonwealth general elections?

* There are about 6,000 **aborigines** in South Australia.

* Many of whom live in such a primitive state that the Aborigines Welfare Board does not even count them, yet this has not inhibited in any way the granting of a vote to **aborigines** in that State.

* Why cannot South Australian members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party agree to give to the **aborigines** of Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory the same right that is enjoyed by the **aborigines** of their own State?

* The honorable member for Moreton  (Mr. Killen)  spoke about primitive **aborigines** in remote spots.

* Why does he not visit Palm Island where there have been schools since 1919 and where there are 600 or 700 adult **aborigines**, most of them literate and capable of handling their own affairs although the Queensland department concerned will not admit it and they have not had a vote?

* In the next federal elections some 70 white people on the island will vote and some 700 **aborigines** will not.

* He has given the vote to **aborigines** in the Northern Territory with any European blood in their veins.

* Why is it that honorable members from New South Wales, where **aborigines** have had the vote for years, will not support the right of their aboriginal constituents to vote if they move to Queensland?

* The honorable member for Perth  (Mr. Chaney),  in January or February, at a meeting in Perth, made, I understand, a rousing speech in which he talked about full equality for the **aborigines** of Australia.

* The **aborigines** of Western Australia could well be given the vote by the Government there, as I have pointed out before, but apparently it has not got through to honorable members opposite.

* Aborigines are citizens, but we allow the State parliaments to remove from them the rights which we ourselves have conferred.

* I personally know many **aborigines** well.

* The present position is that **aborigines** have the right to vote in Victoria and New South Wales, but the Queensland Parliament takes that right from them if they go there, because we allow this law to remain on our statutebooks.

* Let "honorable members opposite make a simple examination of the electoral laws as they apply to **aborigines**, and give to the **aborigines** in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory the rights which are freely conferred, and which nobody thinks of taking away, on **aborigines** in "New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

* Let me make it clear that everybody hopes that it will be practicable to give **aborigines** the vote if they want it.

* But the difficulties involved in giving **aborigines** the vote, if they want it, in accordance with our particular electoral laws are many.

* It is rather significant that the only places in the Commonwealth where there are considerable numbers of **aborigines** most nearly in their original state are the places which recognize those practical difficulties.

* Where there are relatively few **aborigines**, the State Governments concerned have decided that there may be odd difficulties but that that does not matter.

* Where there are large numbers of **aborigines**, the difficulties are recognized.

* The question of Aborigines in the Northern Territory being paid award wages is being considered by the Government and in one respect is before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The provision was used to deprive **aborigines** of social service benefits.

* Until the present AttorneyGeneral  (Sir Garfield Barwick)  was given this portfolio, it was held that if the Commonwealth made social services available to **aborigines** it was somehow passing a special law.

* However, there was a very late reversal of this interpretation - the reversal vindicated the role of  Sir John  Forrest in the framing of the Constitution - when the present Attorney-General directed attention to the fact that if **aborigines** were deprived of something, that was making a special law, but if they were included in social services legislation designed for the community as a whole, that was not making a special law but was merely passing a social services law.

* Sir John  Forrest, who was grateful to the **aborigines** for helping him as an explorer and who was not very happy about any sweeping Commonwealth power anyhow, directed attention to the position of the **aborigines** and the qualification safeguarding **aborigines** was included.

* Forrest intended to protect the **aborigines**, and it has been since 1955 only that that section of the Constitution has been interpreted protectively to ensure aboriginal rights.

* I do not think  1  can speak for all the members of the Select Committee on the Voting Rights of Aborigines, but certainly if there was one word that most of us did not want to hear at the end of our 21.000 miles of travel it was this word " citizenship " as applied to **aborigines**.

* We are only confusing people when we speak about a status for the **aborigines** known as " citizenship ".

* You have the odd situation that although the Ministers have declared that the **aborigines** are born Australian citizens, and the strange statement is made that that started with the Citizenship Act of 1948, the fact is that in three or four States they had been voting at Commonwealth elections for nearly 48 years before that.

* Although all Ministers subscribed to that statement implying that some rights have been conferred on **aborigines**, they still may not vote at State elections in the State of Queensland.

* What the **aborigines** are born with is nothing more or less than the obligation of allegiance, and any rights that they are given have to be deliberately given to them. "

* Its meaning was also misunderstood by many **aborigines**, some of whom thought it meant what biological assimilation would mean - the process of breeding out.

* We on this side are not quite so sure as the Minister that there is not a need for special laws for the **aborigines**.

* The only thing that worries me about this word " assimilation " - and here I am more concerned about the Northern Territory than anywhere else - is what the **aborigines** are to be assimilated to.

* If you look at the actual distribution of population in the Northern Territory you will find that only the minority of **aborigines** have any contact at all with any Europeans other than missionaries, welfare officers, officials and, sometimes, station owners.

* What disturbs me about assimilation is this: Assimilation always seems to be interpreted as taking something away from **aborigines** around the Commonwealth.

* Later, we Europeans got a new idea of what should be done with the **aborigines** and we changed the previous policy without consultation with them.

* The **aborigines** are a very young people.

* The Merredin Shire Council in Western Australia, if the matter is justly reported in the press - I put a qualification to that because I do not know - appears to object to the presence of **aborigines** who are coming into houses on the grounds that they would not know how to look after houses.

* But if resources are found in aboriginal reserves - although greatly to the Minister's credit he has moved to the position that there are now special royalties from which **aborigines** benefit - we do not acknowledge any aboriginal title to them and we do not acknowledge the need to help them over the disability that when they are moved from the tribal or primitive state to live in European communities they come without a background of capital or experience in home-making.

* The armed services of the Commonwealth are employing **aborigines** in the Northern Territory at less than half the wages of Europeans.

* It is important in drafting any legislation related to the Aboriginal people to realise and recognise that Torres Strait Islanders do not regard themselves as Aborigines.

* In Queensland  28,436  Aborigines are covered by the administration of the Department of Native Affairs;  21,100  are exempt from the Act and there are also  5,207  Torres Strait Islanders.

* I have already pointed out that  21,100  Aborigines are exempt from the provisions of the present Act.

* New legislation, which will be proclaimed early this year, will enable the State to give assistance to Aborigines not covered by the present legislation.

* At a time when the State is already struggling with its financial resources to meet the needs of the reserves, it seems extraordinarily difficult for any State government to do the right thing by the Aborigines in the outside communities.

* At Cape York the settlement contains  1,015  Aborigines; at Cherbourg  1,088;  and at Palm Island  1,550.

* A special housing scheme is needed to provide in Queensland for  21,100  Aborigines living outside reserves.

* A low deposit housing scheme is necessary to enable these Aborigines to be settled properly in our community; not on reserves, but in the townships.

* Northern Australia; and the welfare and advancement of the **aborigines** will receive full attention.

* Having considered the report of a parliamentary select committee, my advisers propose to extend the franchise to all **aborigines** and Torres Strait Islanders who wish to take advantage of it and exercise this primary right of citizenship.

* There were no doubt real difficulties then in ensuring that a census of Aborigines could be effectively taken.

* Moreover, section 127 is not related to the qualification of Aborigines as voters in Commonwealth elections.

* The Commonwealth Parliament itself has removed all disabilities in respect of voting at Commonwealth elections so far as Aborigines are concerned.

* Consequently, Aborigines are now entitled to enrol and to vote and they should, in the view of the Government, be recognised as forming part of the population of their State for any purpose.

* They want - and I understand their view - to eliminate the words "other than the Aboriginal race in any State", on the ground that these words amount to discrimination against Aborigines.

* The words are a protection against discrimination by the Commonwealth Parliament in respect of Aborigines.

* If the Parliament had, as one of its heads of power, the power to make special laws with respect to the Aboriginal race, that power would very likely extend to enable the Parliament to set up, for example, a separate body of industrial, social, criminal and other laws relating exclusively to Aborigines.

* In relation to the question that I have just been discussing, namely, conferring a power on the Commonwealth to make laws with respect to Aborigines, the Committee, at the time, it ceased its deliberations in 1958  -  and I mention this as an historic fact - had, paragraph 397 of the report states, given some consideration to the very important question as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament should have an express power to make laws with respect to Aborigines, and representations from various quarters advocated the adoption of a recommendation to this effect.

* Returning to the Bill before the House, the matter can be simply put by saying that section 127 is completely out of harmony with our national attitudes and with the elevation of the Aborigines into the ranks of citizenship which we all wish to see.

* This would give the Commonwealth Parliament power, a plenary power, to make laws, unlimited except by such general provisions as those of section 92, with respect to Aborigines - for example, industrial laws, social services laws, health laws and so forth.

* The third proposal that has been made - and I say this with great deference to some of my friends and supporters who have mentioned it - is to add a new provision rendering invalid laws regarding Aborigines by, for example, invalidating any Commonwealth or State discrimination on the grounds of race.

* It could readily invalidate laws which, while designed to protect the special interests of Aborigines, could be held technically to discriminate either for or against them.

* Sir, I  repeat that the best protection for Aborigines is to treat them, for all purposes, as Australian citizens.

* Wage rates and conditions of employment for Aborigines in the Northern Territory are basically determined in the same way as for other employees; i.e.

* Special minimum wages and conditions of employment are prescribed under the Northern Territory Wards' Employment Ordinance for Aborigines who need protection and assistance in their employment.

* Neither the special minimum wage rales and conditions nor the special legislation prevent Aborigines from becoming members of trade unions or obtaining employment at award conditions.

* No arrangements are made for the purpose of employing Aborigines under conditions less favorable than award conditions; as was indicated in the answer to 1, Aborigines seek and obtain the employment they are able to, having regard to their job background and experience, and in appropriate cases, subject to the minimum wages and conditions prescribed by law.

* Whether Aborigines are at least the equal of others for work on stations is a matter on which opinions often differ widely.

* Government policy on this question is that all Aborigines who can competently do a job should receive the normal award rates or ruling rates for that job, and the Government is currently examining measures to ensure that this policy is put into practice.

* It will be spread over the whole of the Northern Territory, in which there are 17,000 or 18,000 Aborigines.

* So let people disabuse their minds of the idea that this trust fund will bring a new look in the administration of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* These companies are rich enough to be able to rebuild the areas where Aborigines live.

* At 1st June of this year we had in Australia more than 37,000 nonEuropeans not including the Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous **aborigines** or part-**aborigines** of this country, nor the thousands of naturalised people in Papua and New Guinea.

* This bill is to provide that royalties on timber cut on reserves for wards in the Northern Territory, that is, those reserves set aside for **aborigines**, shall be paid into a trust fund which is applied for the benefit of the wards, including the.

* This bill provides that the title of the trust fund shall be altered to the Wards Benefits Trust Fund, and that, in addition to mining royalties, royaltieson timber from **aborigines**' reserves will also be paid into the trust fund and used for the benefit of the **aborigines**.

* The theory behind this is, of course, that the reserves were established for the benefit of **aborigines**, and that if there are any minerals or timber on the reserves of commercial value, some part of the benefit derived from them should go to the **aborigines**.

* .- I would like to join with the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  in congratulating the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck),  not only for the concern he has shown for our friends the **aborigines**, but because he is bringing Australia out in a particularly good light in a world atmosphere conditioned by apartheid in South Africa, segregation in America, half-naked **aborigines** in Malaya, deplorable conditions in South America, the caste system in India, and the other racial and tribal barriers which exist.

* I think the Minister clearly demonstrated his policy when he said - 
The policy of assimilation means that all **aborigines** and part **aborigines** are expected eventually to attain the same manner of living as other Australians and to live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibility, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes, and loyalties as other Australians.

* There must be understanding by us, by the people in control, and by the **aborigines** themselves.

* Those of us who know what has happened, in many cases, when good houses have been built for **aborigines** will understand the difficulty.

* Those of us who know the **aborigines** well know them to be easy-going, lovable, kindly and generous.

* Some people say that you are wasting your time if you build houses for **aborigines**, because they do not know how to live in them properly.

* This means that the women have to learn elementary sanitation and elementary hygiene if the **aborigines** are to be brought out of their primitive conditions.

* 5 am thinking now of the places in western New South Wales where **aborigines** live near swamps and drains and in the dumps that we hear about from time to time.

* We who have come in between must accept the idea of the assimilation of our **aborigines**.

* Those who know **aborigines** well know how terribly sensitive they are and how important is the keeping up of their morale.

* Sometimes, Europeans who are not very splendid characters make remarks about **aborigines** in their hearing, and this sort of thing destroys the morale of the **aborigines**, perhaps for ever.

* People with traditions like those of our **aborigines** cannot be taken completely away from their own home territory and their tribal conditions unless they are taken at a very early age, as were the children at the Mulgoa hostel whom I have mentioned, and trained in very special conditions.

* In August, 1960, the honorable member for Werriwa  (Mr. Whitlam),  who is the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, asked questions about the voting rights of **aborigines**, a matter on which the Labour Party had had strong principles for a long time.

* That all Australian **aborigines** and descendants of Australian **aborigines** must be full citizens of this country and should have all the rights that this statement implies, including the right to vote.

* I hope that those honorable members on the other side of the chamber who have spoken so proudly about this measure will use every resource at their disposal to ensure that the non-Labour governments of Queensland and Western Australia immediately take action to do likewise, because it is idle to claim that something is being done for the **aborigines** of Australia if, in effect, over a great mass of the country they are still deprived of this fundamental right.

* Those honorable members who have spoken so far in the debate have, of course, referred to the general disabilities to which the **aborigines** of Australia are still heir.

* There are many **aborigines**, as the honorable member for Fawkner has pointed out, who are practically confined in settlements during a government's pleasure, without trial.

* Among the 100,000 **aborigines** of Australia there would not be many hundreds of families living in conditions comparable to those enjoyed by the average white Australian.

* Of about, I suppose, 250 families of **aborigines** in Victoria, I suggest that not more than ten or twelve would be enjoying reasonable housing conditions, but the expenditure of 1,000,000 in Victoria would probably correct the position.

* I and my colleagues propose to continue saying them until all the disabilities of the **aborigines** are removed.

* There is also the disability arising from the restriction on the counting of **aborigines** for census and electoral purposes.

* The **aborigines** I know who are conscious of these matters are affronted at being discriminated against in this way.

* As the honorable member for Fremantle says, neither of those sections was intended to bc an affront to the **aborigines**.

* While those sections remain the State governments have power to pass laws taking away from the **aborigines** ordinary civil rights.

* I express the hope that those honorable members who have acquired thousands more electors as a result of the legislation granting **aborigines** the right to vote will pay the same attention to them as they do to Australian constituents.

* There are some State electorates in which the **aborigines** will be in a majority.

* 1 am still hoping that some day the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  will appoint one or two **aborigines** to the Northern Territory Legislative Council to represent their people in that body.

* The policy of assimilation, in the view of all Australian governments, means that all **aborigines** and part **aborigines** are expected eventually to attain the same manner of living as other Australians and to live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs, hopes and loyalties as other Australians.

* Thus, any special measures taken for **aborigines** and part **aborigines** are regarded as temporary measures not based on colour but intended to meet their need for specal care and assistance, to protect them from any ill effects of sudden change, and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favorable to their future social, economic and political advancement.

* In making this statement attention should be drawn to the rather loose use of the term " citizenship " when **aborigines** are said to have achieved citizenship by being exempted from the provisions of special State and Territory statutes which apply only to **aborigines**.

* In our view, Australian **aborigines** are Australian citizens by virtue of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948-1960.

* Vocational training, including apprenticeship and employment, particularly in ways which will assist **aborigines** and part **aborigines** to make a contribution to the advancement of their own people by employment - teaching assistants, nursing and medical assistants, patrol officers, welfare officers and so on.

* Encouragement of social and sporting activity both among **aborigines** and part **aborigines** and participation by them in general community activity, 
Welfare services provided for other members of the community to be available to **aborigines** and part **aborigines**, for example, child, family and social welfare services.

* Positive steps to ensure awareness in the general Australian community that implementation of the policy of assimilation is not possible unless advanced **aborigines** and part **aborigines** are received into the community and accepted without prejudice, and to ensure, as far as possible, that the Australian community plays its full part in this programme.

* Housing: Notwithstanding the considerable progress that has been made, shortage of sufficient houses for **aborigines** and part **aborigines** ready to accept employment opportunities which would enable them to take their place in the community is a major factor militating against assimilation.

* Transitional Housing: It is believed that in some States there is a need for transitional housing for **aborigines** and part-**aborigines** who are able to accept award employment but require further guidance in home management before they can manage a normal home Such houses may be simple in construction and established quite cheaply but should conform with local government minimum building standards.

* Welfare Work: Aborigines who are deemed fit to take their place in the community must be provided with the opportunity by way of employment placement and housing to do so.

* Attention was given to the problem of **aborigines** who, by moving from one State to another, may come under restrictive legislation.

* The conference agreed that the extension of social service benefits to **aborigines**, which has now been in operation for twelve months, has worked very smoothly, There should continue to be close co-operation on the administration of social service benefits.

* This is a problem affecting a comparatively small number of **aborigines** who are still in a nomadic or semi-nomadic condition and roam freely across the borders of those two States and the Northern Territory.

* The Ministers paid a tribute to the valuable work the Christian Missions have done and are doing in education for **aborigines**.

* The conference considered the laws of those States and the Northern Territory which limit the supply to or consumption of alcohol by **aborigines**.

* It was agreed that, while further research into health problems is necessary, the most urgent need in this field is to educate **aborigines** and part **aborigines** in an understanding of the basic requirements of health - personal hygiene, preparation of meals, feeding of infants, and pre-natal and post-natal care.

* Employment, particularly the types of jobs in which **aborigines** are at present engaged and the extent and diversity of jobs available now and in the future, was discussed.

* The conference agreed that further research was necessary into the social organization of **aborigines** and the nature of social change.

* It is estimated that there are already - apart from those 70,000  -  approximately 30,000 **aborigines** or people of aboriginal ancestry who do not come under any form of restrictive or protective legislation but live like other Australian citizens.

* There are 30,000 persons who, in ancestry, may be regarded as of the aboriginal race but who are not regarded as **aborigines** but just as much Australian in every privilege and manner of living as is the honorable member for Parkes  (Mr. Haylen)  or myself.

* I would not give an exact figure for the full-bloods, but my estimate is that of the 70,000 who are still, for the purposes of the law, regarded as **aborigines** or part-**aborigines**, and under special care, possibly from one-half to twothirds would be full-bloods - possibly twothirds.

* Where special legislation applies to **aborigines** only, it is solely because of a clear and temporary - I accentuate the word " temporary " - need for this in their own interests.

* In conclusion, we should emphasize, however, that although the Governments can do a great deal towards helping the aboriginal people towards assimilation, ultimately the success of assimilation will depend on acceptance of **aborigines** by the whole Australian community and assistance to them in this difficult period of transition.

* I lay on the table the following paper: - 
Most of the settlements and missions are on aboriginal reserves and a continuous check on the general health and nutrition of the **aborigines** on the reserves is maintained by the Commonwealth Department of Health and officers of the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration.

* On any reasonable assumption the infant mortality rate among Aborigines remains extremely high.

* These registered infant mortality rates are considerably higher than those quoted by the Minister for Territories in reply to a question in the House of Representatives, where it was stated that according to figures compiled by the Welfare Branch of the Northern Territory Administration with the co-operation of the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages, the infant mortality rates among Aborigines in 1957, 1958 and 1959 were 117, 114 and 102 respectively ... As well as being lower than those derived in the present study, these latter rates might be taken to suggest declining infant mortality among Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* This indicates that the causes of infant mortality among Aborigines in the Northern Territory are not yet under control and that no immediate decline in its incidence can be anticipated.

* The rapid increase in the number of Aborigines at many Government Settlements and Mission Stations has tended to foster conditions conducive to the rapid spread of diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery and pneumonia, all of which have caused excessive mortality among Aboriginal infants and children.

* It seems almost unnecessary to emphasise that the causes and the extent of infant mortality among Aborigines in the Northern Territory need closer and much more extensive examination; for although the above statistics may well be imperfect, the general picture of a disturbingly high mortality among infants is undoubtedly accurate.

* When the Select Committee on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines went to Yirrkala, in Arnhem Land, it had the services of Aboriginal and European interpreters.

* If should confer wilh the States and with the Aborigines themselves on policies, and it should survey Aboriginal needs throughout the Commonwealth.

* The Aborigines are increasing in numbers.

* I want to stress the fact that most of the sufferers from tuberculosis today are Aborigines and most of those are in the 
Northern Territory.

* Similarly, technicalities deprive the Aborigines in the Northern Territory of unemployment benefits.

* For example, if we asked whether it would be a good idea to give Aborigines land, the answer would be: 'Ob, no, they are Australian citizens and we do not give other Australian citizens land*.

* Aborigines to have rights and opportunities equal with other Australians.

* Aborigines to receive the standard  Tate  of wages for the job and to receive the same industrial protection as other Australians.

* Some commanding officers complained about the poor quality of the work done by the Aborigines.

* The next platform points are: 
Detribalised Aborigines to have free and compulsory education, and tribal and nomadic Aborigines to have special provision for education.

* Special provision for Aborigines to secure houses wherever they choose to live.

* Efficient mortality statistics to be maintained to measure the effectiveness of these policies among Aborigines.

* Aborigines to have the right to receive social services in the same way as all other Australians.

* Special provision for Aborigines to reside in reservations wherever they prefer.

* Every form of discrimination against Aborigines to be ended.

* A Parliamentary Committee to be established to study all aspects of policy affecting Aborigines.

* It was a recommendation of the Select Committee on the Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve, that there should be a parliamentary standing committee.

* The Opposition cannot endorse this reenactment of a provision denying to Australian **aborigines** the right enjoyed by all other citizens of enrolling and voting for candidates for election to this Parliament.

* Until now, **aborigines** have had a vote for this Parliament if they have had a vote for the parliament of the particular State in which they live.

* In other words, **aborigines** on the Queensland, Northern Territory or Western Australian sides of borders are not considered fit to vote, or at least are not permitted to vote.

* In the Northern Territory, by administrative act, we virtually exclude all **aborigines** from voting, just because they are **aborigines**, although in that Territory we can give any person a vote for the Legislative Council of the Territory, for this House of Representatives or for the Australian Senate if we wish to.

* We are told from time to time of cases of **aborigines** who have emerged and they deserve more praise for having emerged in that they have had to overcome handicaps that other Australians have not had to overcome.

* The first is that the **aborigines** are very often nomadic.

* If **aborigines** were enrolled - as they would have to be in normal circumstances if our amendment is carried - then they could still not vote unless their real place of living at some time within three months immediately preceding polling day was within the division in respect of which they were enrolled.

* The other reason which is most commonly given is that **aborigines** are illiterate, but under section 120 of the act, other persons who are illiterate are entitled1 to vote.

* During the secondreading debate on this bill, I went in some detail into the international reasons why **aborigines** should have the vote now.

* I believe that we are in breach of articles 55 and 56 of the United Nations Charter so long as we deprive **aborigines** of the vote on the basis that they are **aborigines**.

* I make passing reference to the fact that now that the decision has been made to postpone the referendum in which was embodied proposals that would enable Aborigines to be counted in the next census, the position is that Queensland will be denied in the future the increase in taxation reimbursement which will accrue to it when Aborigines are counted in the census figures.

* We recognise, of course that there are great difficulties, because of the census position, in estimating the number of Aborigines in Australia.

* The matter that I wish to place before the House is this: The Queensland Government in its wisdom has brought down new bills which, when assented to, will replace the present Aborigines Protection and Preservation Act and also the Torres Strait Islanders Act.

* A number of the restrictions previously placed on Aborigines and Islanders will be removed by this legislation.

* Because the proposed referendum is not being submitted now and because Aborigines will not be counted in the next census, Queensland will be denied funds which would otherwise have come to it.

* For example, the Aborigines in these settlements are now provided with accommodation and with a ration hand out, and those who are able work for 32 hours a week for no payment, in return for the accommodation and ration provided for them.

* I ask the Government which has stated that there is no discrimination against Aborigines in Australia and which has taken 'the view that the present disability contained in paragraph (xxvi) of section 51 of the Constitution does not prevent the Commonwealth from helping to promote the welfare and advancement of Aboriginal people to look now at the question whether under section 96 or elsewhere, it can assist Queensland with funds from Consolidated Revenue or loan moneys to enable that State to carry out improvements in Aboriginal welfare which I feel would have the support of every member of the House.

* I mention at this point that the action to be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to Aborigines, following the approval by referendum of an amendment of Section 51 (26) of the Constitution, is now under detailed and careful consideration by the Government.

* Recently in National Aborigines Week a very fine book was presented by the Department of Territories, in co-operation with the departments of Aboriginal welfare or native affairs in the various States.

* I want to pay a tribute to what the Queensland Government has done in recent times for the improvement it has effected insofar as Aborigines are concerned.

* Where else in Australia would one find a settlement of 1,000 people, whether they be Aborigines or others, unconnected by a road, unless it were on an island?

* The Act provided originally for the establishment and operation of the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

* The Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund was established in 1952.

* The Minister said in his second reading speech that there could be occasions when it would be appropriate for assistance to be granted from both the Capital Fund for Aboriginal Enterprises and the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund.

* In conclusion, I say that the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund will be a real step towards advancing the social and economic position of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and, for that matter, all over Australia.

* Are Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, other than those leading a tribalised or nomadic life, entitled to pensions and social service payments on the same basis as other Australians?

* Thousands of years ago the first Tasmanian **aborigines** walked into Tasmania.

* Of course the truth about that is that the United Kingdom Parliament made the enactment in the basic constitutions of the States, and the United Kingdom Parliament originally gave to all British subjects, including **aborigines**, the vote.

* At this moment in New South Wales and Victoria, in theory at least, voting for **aborigines** is compulsory.

* We found that at Woodenbong, for instance, out of50 **aborigines** only two were enrolled.

* It is true that in Australia only **aborigines** are nomadic and tribal.

* A provision for voluntary enrolment of **aborigines** was recommended by the committee as a device to cope with two situations - that some **aborigines** wanted the vote, and that to the nomadic and tribal **aborigines** compulsory enrolment would be an unjust burden.

* The second reason for the amendment is that **aborigines** in New South Wales and Victoria have suffered because they have not been enrolled.

* New South Wales and Victorian **aborigines** would have reached candidates and spoken to them.

* The third reason for the amendment is that **aborigines** are easily bluffed out of their rights.

* Compulsion should therefore be applied in the interests of the **aborigines** where no other injustice arises as a result of compulsion.

* There is no convincing evidence that the States with large numbers of **aborigines** want them to have any influence at all in the State parliaments.

* They accept people whose appearance is totally European as being **aborigines**.

* I realize that the Commonwealth is arguing for a uniformity of law throughout the Commonwealth; but for 60 years we have followed section 41 of the Constitution in such a way that the Commonwealth franchise has attached itself to the State franchise, and where the States enfranchise the **aborigines** or, rather, where they did not interfere with the fact that the United Kingdom originally enfranchised the **aborigines**, the Commonwealth franchise followed.

* If we could, over those years, follow a principle that was one of differentiation without any real principle on the part of this Parliament being involved, we can now make a principle - that is, that we are not drawing the line of race in the franchise but that the **aborigines** in New South Wales and Victoria, having no tribal and nomadic people, no people to whom Parliament is irrelevant, can be treated on the same footing as the rest of the community.

* May I say at the outset that many honorable members deprecate the efforts of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Whitlam),  the honorable member for Wills  (Mr. Bryant)  and other Opposition members who have attempted to make a party political issue of this problem concerning the Australian **aborigines**.

* They recognized that there were many problems associated with the conferring of voting rights on **aborigines**.

* It is true that the Labour Government extended the right to vote to an increased number of Australian **aborigines**, and this move was approved by the present Government parties, which were then in opposition, and acclaimed by the Australian people.

* However, the Chifley Government, in its wisdom - I do not decry or criticize it for so doing - retained a degree of restriction on the number of **aborigines** deemed as qualified to vote at federal elections.

* Or are we to believe that the remarks of these honorable members this evening indicate that those honorable members believe that since Labour went out of office in  1949  the Australian **aborigines** have had an opportunity to develop under the administration of this Government to a point at which to-day they all are qualified to vote in federal elections?

* No member of this Parliament who is sincere will deny that very profound problems are involved in the subject of voting rights for Australian **aborigines**.

* in section  39  of the principal act and at the same time moving for the appointment of a select committee representative of both sides of this chamber to study the problem of voting rights for **aborigines**.

* That select committee will be able to inform itself on the matter and bring back proposals which can be considered by honorable members with a view to ensuring that justice is done to the Australian **aborigines** in the matter of the right to vote in elections of members to this Parliament.

* If the Opposition does call for a division, I can conclude only that Opposition members now insinuate that the Labour caucus and the Chifley Cabinet in  1949  were incompetent and that none of the brains of the Labour Party resided in those bodies; or, alternatively, that the present Government has done so much for the Australian **aborigines**, and has enabled them to develop their capacities so much since  1949,  that they all are now qualified for full voting rights in federal elections.

* There are certain aspects of this matter which I think should be dealt with not in the light of party considerations but out of humane consideration for the descendants of the **aborigines** who are still in New South Wales.

* A great deal has been said about the position of **aborigines** among the white population in New South Wales.

* People of other denominations who have worked amongst the **aborigines** have tried again and again without success to have the official policy applied in an intelligent way in the hope of cleaning up what is a disgraceful state of affairs.

* We must face up to one difficulty associated with **aborigines**.

* According to a statement which was issued by the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck),  we spend 4,000,000 a year in the Northern Territory on about 70,000 **aborigines**, quite apart from other advantages which **aborigines** can share with the rest of the community.

* .- Mr. Speaker, so far as I can gather, this is the first time that any Australian parliament has discussed a bill to confer voting rights on aboriginal people according a total entitlement for all **aborigines** to vote.

* I am aware,  of  course, that for many years **aborigines** in certain States have had full voting rights but that has not been because of the act of any Australian parliament.

* That  section tied to the State franchise in every State the entitlement of **aborigines** to the Commonwealth franchise.

* Secondly, the repeal of the same section deletes references to **aborigines** in the entitlement section of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.

* Thirdly, the measure has the effect of establishing voluntary enrolment for all **aborigines** in the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania.

* Fourthly, it sets up penal provisions directed against any who seek to bribe or intimidate **aborigines** to enrol or to refrain from enrolling.

* Up to the present in Victoria and New South Wales **aborigines** have been subject to the same compulsory provisions of the law as other persons.

* The Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines recommended the retention of compulsory enrolment provisions in Victoria and New South Wales.

* Aborigines of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia may vote in Commonwealth elections.

* Although homo Tas.maniensis no longer exists there are scores of mainland **aborigines** in Tasmania and they may vote in State and Commonwealth elections.

* I would be giving the House a false impression if I were to convey the idea that some States or Territories have granted the vote to **aborigines**.

* The real position is that Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory have taken the vote away from **aborigines**.

* When Victoria and New South Wales had constitutions conferred upon them by the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1855, manhood suffrage was conferred on all subjects of the Queen; that is, on all British subjects, including **aborigines**.

* Queensland and Western Australia took the franchise away from **aborigines**, but the other States did not.

* It should be remembered that at the time of federation South Australia included what is now the Northern Territory, and hence the **aborigines** of the Northern Territory were affected by South Australian electoral law.

* Kingdom Government remonstrated with the early Governors of Western Australia that **aborigines** were fully British subjects and that their rights were the same as those of the colonists.

* After self government, when the Parliament of Western Australia set out to alter the status of **aborigines** established under the legislation of 1905, the Governor of the day reserved the legislation for the Crown and the Government of the United Kingdom to consider.

* The only people who have to apply for that citizenship and be given a citizenship rights certificate are **aborigines** or natives within the definition of the State law.

* This concept of a citizen in Western Australia is inconsistent with the rightful status of the **aborigines** as subjects of the Queen.

* The legislation now before this Parliament means that in extending the franchise to **aborigines** in Queensland and Western Australia, the Commonwealth is no longer violating the spirit of its own Constitution and is no longer violating the spirit of the original constitutions of Queensland and Western Australia.

* Those States at the moment of the inception of their constitutions had equality of electoral status for **aborigines** but removed their rights.

* The issue of the presence of **aborigines** on State rolls was fully discussed at the Constitution Convention which framed the Constitution of the Commonwealth.

* Those discussions established that nothing in the proposed Constitution of the Commonwealth suggested the removal of the rights of British subjects from **aborigines**.

* Section 127 states that - 
The census among the **aborigines** was physically impossible to carry out considering the transport and communications conditions in 1 897.

* Those of us who travelled to remote areas by air in connexion with the work of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines know how impossible enumeration of **aborigines** would have been until very recently.

* Most States before federation could not, in fact, have carried out a count of the **aborigines**.

* The legislation now before us, like the report of the Select Committee on the Voting Rights of Aborigines founds the franchise on the basic concept that **aborigines** are subjects of the Queen.

* When voting rights were extended to British subjects in the Australian colonies, it was intended by the United Kingdom Parliament that they be given to all born in the sovereign's Australian domain and hence to the **aborigines**.

* The Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines recommended in paragraph 41 section (1) - 
This is actually the law now, but it is not being enforced.

* For all other **aborigines**, the committee recommended in paragraph 77- 
That, for the time being, the enrolment  of  **aborigines** and Torres Strait Islanders be voluntary, but when enrolled, compulsory voting be enforced.

* The reason for this differentiation between **aborigines** and Europeans was practical, not racial.

* In paragraph 78, the committee report states - 
In making these recommendations your  Committee  is concerned that the extension  of the  compulsory provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to many **aborigines** still in  the  tribal state, or recently emerged from the tribal state, or not completely integrated into the Australian community, could result in grave injustice.

* The committee felt that these reasons do not apply in Victoria and New South Wales where **aborigines** are not in the tribal state.

* It is difficult to see insuperable difficulties in applying all compulsions to **aborigines** in Victoria and New South Wales and not in other States.

* For years, the Electoral Act has differentiated between States in that it has followed the differing State franchises for **aborigines**.

* We expect that in time all **aborigines** can accept the compulsion applied to the rest of the community and could already do so in New South Wales and Victoria.

* Clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the bill which deal with bribery and duress, define bribery as including certain acts, and undue influence, such as threatening, offering or suggesting violence, injury, punishment, damage or disadvantage in connexion with enrolment of **aborigines** seem to me to meet the recommendations of the select committee.

* Your Committee recommends that the matter of enrolment should not be left to welfare officers, private persons, organizations or political parties and recommends that the administrative procedures of the Commonwealth Electoral Office be altered to provide for specially qualified electoral officers to receive personal applications for enrolment at places accessible to **aborigines**.

* It is recommended by your Committee that a penal provision be inserted in the amending Act in respect of the use of duress or undue influence on **aborigines** in the exercise of their franchise.

* It is recommended that the procedures of voting and the structure of the Parliament be explained to **aborigines** on government settlements and on missions and other convenient locations.

* To the common objection that some **aborigines** are not ready to be enfranchised the report replies with paragraph 89, which is in these terms - 
Let me say that all the evidence presented to us relating to polling places where the voters were almost exclusively **aborigines** indicated that their rate of informal voting was very much better than that of the general European community in the Commonwealth.

* Aborigines ".

* In paragraph 4 the committee pointed out - 
Less satisfactory are the conditions on some stations and near towns, where **aborigines** have the worst of both worlds - their own marriage customs leading to old men monopolizing groups of young women and, in conjunction with the loss of hunting land, tending thereby to race extinction; or neglect as an under-privileged group in contact with the worst Europeans.

* The publicity this measure is receiving, and new activity by the Commonwealth electoral officers to enrol **aborigines** which will result from this measure, will cause thousands of these people to enrol.

* But **aborigines** do not know their rights.

* Aborigines change their names.

* Most **aborigines** live in a warm climate and the sharpest effects of poor housing are not felt.

* But for decades we have managed to administer differing electoral laws concerning **aborigines**, in that we have followed the differing State laws in each State.

* If all **aborigines** in Australia were placed as those in Victoria and New South Wales are placed, the select committee would never have recommended voluntary enrolment.

* Its recommendation for differentiation in the enrolment provisions was not to establish differentiation between **aborigines** and Europeans.

* In Victoria and New South Wales there are no nomads, tribal people, or very primitive people, so there was no ground for putting the **aborigines** in those States on any other footing than that of the rest of the electorate.

* 1, of the official publication, " Australian Territories ", the issue for January, 1962, refers on page 24 to " Australia's 100,000 **aborigines**".

* Earlier publications have given the estimate as 70,000 persons called **aborigines** or natives by the States, the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, with another 30,000 who have, as it were, been fully absorbed into the community of the Commonwealth and have no dealings with any authorities on the basis of being considered **aborigines** or part-**aborigines**.

* I was impressed at these places with the difference in demeanour of these **aborigines**, as compared with the demeanour of **aborigines** on some cattle stations or near towns.

* Aborigines near towns or cattle stations reflected the care or the neglect that they experienced.

* There were marked differences in the coastal towns of the north-west of Western Australia, according to whether or not the communities accepted responsibility towards the **aborigines**.

* It may be a very chastening thought for some of those communities that we, as outsiders, thought that the **aborigines** who were either praised or denounced by those communities were extremely faithful reflections of the communities with which they were associated.

* Some 90 per cent, of **aborigines** south of Cairns and 60 per cent, of those to the north - the select committee members were told - are literate, and the State conscientiously aims to protect them.

* The **aborigines** are harmed by policies which alienate land as if they did not exist, by policies which leave them housed under conditions destroying their family life and dignity, and by policies which relegate them to the position of fringe dwellers.

* It is the wish of the Opposition that the franchise which is now to be extended will be used by **aborigines** as a means of advancing themselves within the community of the Commonwealth.

* Every subject of the Queen, of voting age in the 
One other matter I would like to refer to is that of voting rights for **aborigines**, which was mentioned by the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  during a debate on another matter.

* In the course of his statement he said - 
Tt is estimated that there are already approximately 30,000 **aborigines** or people of aboriginal ancestry who do not come under any form of restrictive or protective legislation but live like other Australian citizens.

* Where special legislation applies to **aborigines** only, it is solely because of a clear and temporary need .

* The Minister was clearly indicating that there are differences in the various States in the laws relating to **aborigines**.

* This aspect of the laws governing **aborigines** is related to our electoral laws in a number of ways.

* The Commonwealth Parliament has two restrictions on its power with regard to **aborigines**.

* Almost certainly, however, they did not have in mind anything to do with the **aborigines** as such.

* The debates on the section and placitum were very short, but apparently what was in mind was not **aborigines** but land.

* If the Commonwealth had power to make laws for **aborigines** it would, incidentally, have the power to acquire land for the purposes of **aborigines**, since it has the power to acquire land for any purpose for which it has the power to make laws.

* The fear appears to have been that if it could legislate for **aborigines** it would have power to acquire land for aboriginal purposes, which might have involved the taking from the States of enormous tracts of lands for use as aboriginal reserves.

* What was in mind, apparently, was not some disqualification of the Federal Parliament for legislating for **aborigines**, but a fear that the States would lose their authority over land.

* When I was in India some six or seven years ago I found that there had been a number of Communist ladies going through the country, who had suggested to the Indian people that these sections of the Australian Constitution showed that the Australian people had never regarded the **aborigines** as human beings.

* Section 127, which forbids the Commonwealth to enumerate **aborigines** in the census, appears to have been based on a State-righter's fear that if **aborigines** were enumerated they would become a component of the quota for the fixing and determining of seats.

* Although the **aborigines** were very much more nomadic in those days and were not an important political or electoral element, it was feared that a disproportionate number of seats would be allotted to States having large aboriginal populations, and that the Australian political system would be distorted accordingly.

* The Committee should point out that section 127 has no direct bearing on the question of the eligibility of **aborigines** to vote at Federal elections.

* If **aborigines** are to become qualified as electors then, as a matter of principle, they should be recognized as forming part of the population of the State in which they live.

* The repeal of section 127 is consistent wish the idea that there should not be fundamental barriers to **aborigines** becoming qualified as Federal electors.

* Using his own kind of argument, I point out that while there is a potential enrolment of a certain number of **aborigines** in an electorate, the commissioners must also take into account the possible movement in or out of that electorate.

* Mr. Speaker,  I agree .with the honorable member for Mackellar  (Mr. Wentworth)  that many .constructive speeches have been made in this debate and that many honorable members have looked impartially at the problems which confrant the various governments in Australia and the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Hasluck)  with respect to the **aborigines**.

* The honorable member for Hindmarsh attacked the Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Roberton)  when, amongst other things, he belittled the great advance that had been made by giving **aborigines** the full social service and pension rights that are applicable to other Australians.

* There have been Commonwealth governments in Australia for 60 years, but it has only been during the term of office of this Government and of the present Minister for Social Services that this advantage has been given to the Australian **aborigines** That is something for which credit must be given.

* The .honorable member for Hindmarsh said that our progress in dealing with the problems, of **aborigines** over a period of 150 years has been much too slow.

* Surely it means that ultimately the **aborigines** will have the same privileges, responsibilities and rights that other Australians now have.

* In other words, **aborigines** will live in the same street as other Australians and will be treated as their equal, as indeed they are in certain areas already.

* It is our hope that at some stage in the future all **aborigines** will achieve that status.

* More health services and education services must be made available to **aborigines** in all States.

* Already there are special schools for **aborigines**.

* The provision of vocational training so that **aborigines** may get different kinds of jobs and not have to rely upon the pastoral industry for most of their employment is certainly important.

* The honorable member for Perth has directed attention to the part that **aborigines** have been able to play in this sphere and to the increasing part that they will probably play in the future.

* Of course, in Australia the problem is a small one, because of the smallness of the number of **aborigines**.

* Attention was directed also to certain special problems brought about by the nomadic or semi-nomadic state of many **aborigines**, and to the fact that the settlement and assimilation of these people will involve the co-operation of several States and the Commonwealth, for reasons that have already been brought to the notice of the House.

* Attention is also directed in the report of the conference to the fact that this problem involves approximately 70,000 **aborigines** throughout Australia, and that 30,000 or more **aborigines** and part **aborigines** have full citizenship rights.

* Few people in the world are living in a more primitive state than are the Australian **aborigines**.

* The **aborigines** here were, and some still are, in a nomadic state.

* About 16,000 **aborigines** in the Northern Territory receive benefit from the welfare ordinances.

* At the settlements, the growing of food, animal husbandry, fishing, forestry and trades are taught, and the **aborigines** show a readiness to learn these skills, which will be useful to them.

* I have already mentioned that, in the field of education, the object is ultimately to have one system of schools for black and white children where **aborigines** are living.

* However, at present this is not always possible, simply because of language and environment differences which make it impossible for the **aborigines** to take their place in the white schools.

* One of the most important factors in the assimilation of **aborigines** is housing - and the acceptance by white people df **aborigines** living in houses in the same street.

* The report of the Aborigines Welfare Board1 for 1959 draws attention to this question of housing and points to the success that has been achieved in Victoria.

* It is worth noting that, as the honorable member for Wills said, **aborigines** in Victoria, whether of full or part blood, have full citizenship and voting rights.

* Referring to housing, the board reported - 
The report refers to the Mooroopna Housing Settlement, which is the first special housing project for **aborigines**.

* The report also directs attention to the fact that **aborigines** quickly adapted themselves to their new homes and set about improving the surroundings with gardens.

* That is a most important feature, because  in  this debate some doubt has been cast on the ability of **aborigines** to look after a house when given one for the first time.

* The general experience in Victoria is that the **aborigines** have looked after their houses very well and have taken a pride in them, and good care of them.

* The report of the Aborigines Welfare Board refers to the fact that several **aborigines** are living in town districts in areas not by any means set aside for **aborigines**, but in ordinary houses in a street just as any one else would have a house in a street.

* The Commonwealth has shown a very real sympathy for the problems of the **aborigines**, especially in the last few years under the administration of the present Minister.

* Further evidence of this is shown in the fact that the Minister for the Interior  (Mr. Freeth)  has announced in the House that a select committee has been appointed to examine the subject of full voting rightsfor **aborigines**.

* Surely enough has- been said in this Parliament to make honorable members doubt the wisdom of giving full voting rights to **aborigines** immediately.

* But it is worth noting that the present policies are directed most to helping the children of the **aborigines**.

* It is my belief that if this assistance is given we will see the assimilation of **aborigines**.

* The Legislative Council is concerned only with Territory affairs, whereas the condition of the Yirrkala Aborigines is a matter of national and international concern.

* There are not too many parts of the world in which people have not now heard of the Aborigines of Australia.

* Would anybody say that the Aborigines of the Northern Territory or any other part of Australia have equality of opportunity, freedom and all the other things of which we have spoken so freely in the past?

* I believe that only by constant scrutiny by the members of this Parliament acting, with others, in the role of propagators of the national conscience will the task of protecting the interests of the Aborigines be carried forward.

* I make no claim to moral standing for my recognition of the plight of the Australian Aborigines.

* Speaking on his behalf, I can give the honorable member an assurance that in the prevention and treatment of disease in the Northern Territory, the **aborigines** share in exactly the same services and have available to them the same staff as have all members of the Northern Territory community, no matter to which race they belong.

* One determination was made which had the effect of excluding practically all Aborigines from receiving allowances.

* We do not have this opportunity under the Tuberculosis Act, and consequently, for the space of some 15 years, thousands of Aborigines were deprived of the allowances which other tuberculosis sufferers in Australia had been receiving.

* After that period came a period of complete compassion - rather mistaken and perhaps ignorant compassion - when people with kindly hearts said: "Pity the poor **aborigines**.

* Up to the close of the last century there was a period when a great number of people, out of a sense of pity, were ministering to the **aborigines**; but they were ministering to them without hope and without any intention that they could do any lasting good for the **aborigines**, who they thought were bound to die out.

* It was that idea that animated many of the social reformers, I believe that it was that idea which was the mainspring of modern ameliorative efforts on behalf of the **aborigines**.

* Australia has  70,000  **aborigines** in a population of  10,000,000.

* The ancient Britons were **aborigines**.

* I will enlarge on that a little by pointing out that the **aborigines** had a very complex and highly involved social organization of their own, but in that social organization the relationships between one member of the society and every other member of it were clearly defined and clearly understood by everyone, and the obligations which one member bore to every one else were clearly understood.

* The easiest adjustment that the **aborigines** of this continent ever had was on the pastoral stations because, whether it was good or bad, living in a sort of feudal situation on a pastoral station where the pastoralist was something like a feudal baron with a tribe and two or three white stockmen around him, it was comparatively easy for the native tribe, whose territory was not disturbed and whose hunting rights were left untouched, to enter into an easy new personal relationship with the new white society.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  made a statement which seemed to suggest that he thought that in the centre of Australia there are still untouched a fairly large number of **aborigines** leading a fully tribal life.

* The number of **aborigines** untouched would now be down to only a few score, or, at the most, a couple of hundred.

* The **aborigines** have been attracted more and more into the settlements that we have established.

* A great deal of the work we are doing in the Northern Territory is in bringing schooling to the children of **aborigines** who, ten years ago, were completely tribal nomads with limited and occasional contacts with Europeans.

* To clarify its wages policy for Aborigines of the Northern Territory; in particular - 
to explain why Aborigines are not consulted on wage questions, and to consult them in future; 
To ensure that the recent deaths of six Aborigines from starvation can never happen again by the establishment of adequate food depots and the institution of more frequent patrols.

* We Australians make these mealy mouthed meaningless statements for international consumption; we say that all Aborigines are Australian citizens within the meaning of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948-1960.

* Aborigines in the nomadic state are not normally living under hygienic conditions.

* It is not good enough in 1964 for a Commonwealth Government to act on the assumption, as in fact the Commonwealth Government does act on the assumption, to judge by its actions and not by its words, that a serious death rate among Aborigines is not to be regarded as we would regard a serious death rate among Europeans.

* Aborigines of the Northern Territory have in general a low wage rate and there is a very slow process of transforming the wage rate in the direction of equality.

* I agree with the honorable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr. Nelson)  that we ought to take a look at the industrial conditions of the **aborigines** who are working in the pastoral and other industries to ensure that they have industrial protection.

* Without making it a matter for inflammatory propaganda, and without suggesting exploitation of the **aborigines**, we should see to it that **aborigines** are given the same kind of legal safeguards as are afforded European agricultural and pastoral workers.

* In some of the northern areas of Western Australia, where hunting conditions are good, and where fishing conditions are good, the **aborigines** are of excellent physique, but there seems to be a good deal of evidence that towards the interior, towards the Warburton Ranges area, they are not of equally satisfactory physique.

* It seems to me that anything that can be done on the reserves to increase water supplies for the game to live on, and perhaps to teach the **aborigines** how to grow certain types of food to supplement their diet, and to make a regular check on their survival, and the survival of their children, would be the most that the Commonwealth could do for them, although I emphasize that I speak on these points quite ignorantly; I have no expert knowledge of the problem.

* Employment of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* Nobody with any conscience, any sense of justice or any sensitivity at all could see that provision in the Constitution as anything less than an insult to **aborigines**.

* I believe that the Attorney-General has great capacity, but for more than twenty minutes he indulged in legalistic quibbles that did great injustice to **aborigines**.

* The Attorney-General says that if we remove from the Constitution the provisions in question we shall discriminate against the **aborigines** whereas, at present, we do not discriminate against them.

* Let me consider for a few moments,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  the present position of Australian **aborigines**.

* The law to which I refer is the Aborigines Welfare Ordinance 1954  -  Ordinance No.

* The definition of **aborigines** is quite extensive and I will not bore the House by reading the whole of it.

* It includes - 
So it does not matter that **aborigines** are free citizens in Victoria.

* This is the position of all **aborigines**, whether they are my good friends who come here, Pastor Nicholls or Captain Reg Saunders.

* There is one in New South Wales, two in Queensland - one for the Queensland **aborigines** and one for the Torres Strait islanders - an ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory, various ordinances in the Northern Territory and laws in Western Australia and South Australia.

* Innumerable differences occur in the definition of **aborigines** in these laws.

* My party and I have not been necessarily conscious of doing so at any time we have raised any question relating to **aborigines**.

* Every person in this country, including migrants who may just have stepped ashore, come under Commonwealth law except **aborigines**.

* For instance, this is the situation of American Indians - 
That is not the situation of the Australian **aborigines**.

* That is the kind of system that we would envisage being applied to the **aborigines** - a system that is not prohibitive or restrictive but which confers some benefits.

* The policy of assimilation means that all **aborigines**' and part **aborigines** are expected eventually to attain the same manner of living as other Australians and to live as members of a single Australian community enjoying the same rights and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities,, observing the same customs and influenced by the same beliefs-, hopes and loyalties as other Australians.

* Thus, any special measures taken for **aborigines** and part **aborigines**' are regarded as temporary measures not based on colour but intended to meet their need for special care and assistance, to protect them from any ill effects of sudden change and to assist them to make the transition from one stage to another in such a way as will be favorable to their future social, economic and political advancement.

* Before doing so, however, let me say that I am aware that most honorable members realize that in the past - and, in terms of our Australian history, long in the past - the attitude towards Australian **aborigines** has been by no means- a good one.

* In my opinion, and in the opinion of other people whom I will quote if time permits, Queensland has the best and most humane system for treating **aborigines** and attempting to raise them to the stage of assimilation that we all desire.

* More than 20,000 of Queensland's **aborigines** are in no way controlled.

* The number of **aborigines** in Queensland who have full citizenship rights exceeds the combined total of such **aborigines** in four or five other States.

* The honorable member endeavoured to create the impression abroad that Australia has not in recent years given much consideration to our very great friends, the **aborigines**.

* The honorable member for Hindmarsh implied that Australia has treated her **aborigines** shabbily and is continuing to do so.

* Our treatment of the **aborigines** in the past has been wrong in many ways but to-day governments, both State and Federal, are doing their best to overcome the mistakes of the past as quickly as possible.

* In that report the " Tribune " foreshadowed that a resolution dealing with Australian **aborigines** would be adopted by that conference.

* One wonders, may it not be because the native population of Australia, as the Brisbane Conference on the rights of **aborigines** pointed out, is subjected to racial discrimination, like the Africans in the Union of South Africa.

* Just as in South Africa there is segregation in Australian schools, theatres, cinemas, and other public places with regard to the **aborigines**.

* As first steps, we call for full citizens' rights, full award wages for aboriginal workers, especially the pastoral industry, preservation of the remaining tribal lands and provision of land for those driven off the reserves, education and training facilities, and abandonment of racial discrimination, and the repeal of the infamous Aborigines' Protection Acts, and encouragement to the **aborigines** to establish their own committees to manage their affairs.

* I went to school with **aborigines** and I am glad I did, because I grew to love them.

* Research by  Dr David  Jose of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research, concluded over the past 2 years, has revealed a problem group of Aborigines showing evidence of malnutrition.

* .- In April of this year patrols from the Western Australian Native Welfare Department, the Northern Territory Welfare Branch and the Commonwealth Weapons Research Establishment at Woomera made contact with Aborigines in Central Australia near the junction of the Western Australian, South Australian , and Northern Territory border.

* The Press information that we have seen on this matter shows that 71 Aborigines were contacted in Western Australia, and 42 were taken at their own request to the Papunya native settlement, 300 miles away in the Northern Territory.

* The first is: Were the Central Australian Aborigines informed through competent interpreters of their intended position at Papunya, and were they correctly understood by the expedition?

* We ask this because the Yirrkala affair showed that linguistic difficulties were the basis of the misunderstanding between the Commonwealth Government and the Aborigines there.

* The second question is this: If these Aborigines are dissatisfied at Papunya, will they be transported back to their homelands?

* On Sth August the Minister for Supply  (Mr. Fairhall)  wrote to me concerning the elaborate nature of the safety precautions and he spoke about the attempts of patrols from his own Department to contact the Aborigines.

* Realising that further attempts were useless, and  knowing  that the Aborigines were by now outside the possible impacT area, the native patrol officer camped in the vicinity of Lake Perceval and remained there.

* In the course of his speech he referred to these patrol contacts with the Aborigines and he said that differing methods were employed by Western Australian patrols and Northern Territory patrols.

* The Aborigines, when found, were given food and were told that food was plentiful at Papunya but that in future they could not have it in their own country.

* Dr. Duguid  said that if this were correct it constituted inducement and pressure rather than free choice and it left one dissatisfied as to whether the real issues were clear to the Aborigines.

* Then, in connection with other activities, he referred to the buzzing of Aborigines by aircraft.

* This buzzing had taken place so often that the Aborigines were going into biding and were not lighting fires because the smoke revealed where they were.

* Some of us saw this settlement when wc were on the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* F. Lancaster Jones, in his "Demographic Survey of the Aboriginal Population of the Northern Territory", published in 1963 after work under the auspices of the Australian National University and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies, wrote this of Papunya - 
Outbreaks of bowel diseases are almost inevitable in the crowded and often unhygienic conditions under which Aborigines live at some missions and Government settlements.

* On any reasonable assumption the infant mortality rale among Aborigines remains extremely high.

* The rapid increase in the number of Aborigines at many Government settlements and Mission Stations has tended to foster conditions conducive to the rapid spread of diseases such as gastroenteritis, dysentery and pneumonia, all of which have caused excessive mortality among Aboriginal infants and children.

* Dr. Humphry,  who was employed by the Northern Territory Medical Service, has pointed out that leprosy did not begin to spread rapidly among Aborigines after its introduction by Chinese brought into Australia by the South Australian Government until there were concentrations of population at Goulburn Island and Oenpelli.

* Writing in the "Medical Journal of Australia "in 1952  Dr. Humphry  estimated the probable incidence of leprosy among Aborigines of the Northern Territory at 56 per 1,000.

* There are comparatively small numbers of Aborigines and large areas in which to live.

* We say these things about the background of recent years, because we are concerned about any policy of concentrating Aborigines in inadequately prepared settlements.

* The Minister for Health recently said that Aborigines had the lowest tuberculosis rate of non-Europeans in the world, but the significant fact is that the rate is estimated to be higher than that among the European population.

* The devastating fact is that  Dr. Crotty  and  Dr. Webb  of the Northern Territory Medical Service, writing in the " Medical Journal of Australia " in September 1960 pointed out that 20 per cent, of deaths in the Northern Territory of Aborigines over 20 years of age were due to tuberculosis.

* Mr. Packer  of the University of Adelaide pointed out that a survey of Aborigines in the north of South Australia, close to the Northern Territory border, where they have not been concentrated, revealed not one case of tuberculosis in 440 Aborigines examined.

* The facts that I have outlined are a prima facie case against concentrating Aborigines in any place unless you are utterly certain something entirely more adequate for their health has been done than has been normal practice in the Northern Territory Administration in the past.

* The **aborigines** constitute yet another class of people responsibility for whom falls heavily upon the States.

* The single exception relates to **aborigines** who are nomadic and who have no fixed location.

* The Governments of the States, which have primary responsibility for **aborigines**, are doing practically nothing to record their languages or life.

* Ethnological Studies among the NorthWestCentral Queensland Aborigines.

* I do not know what the governments hoped their policies would achieve for the **aborigines**, but there certainly was not an attempt to formulate a policy based on any understanding of them.

* Those of us who were on the select committee inquiring into the grievances of the Yirrkala **aborigines** saw how seriously Commonwealth policy can go astray.

* They were transmitting to the Commonwealth Government what they thought concerned the **aborigines**, but when our parliamentary select committee went to Yirrkala with competent linguists as interpreters, the welfare officer concerned was amazed at the opinions the **aborigines** were expressing.

* He was surprised at the problems concerning the **aborigines** and admitted that the entire proceedings were to him a complete revelation.

* I hope that the establishment of this institute will encourage Australian governments to utilize the knowledge of anthropologists, linguists and ethnographers in framing policy, particularly educational policy, in relation to the **aborigines**. "

* Conform to us " seems to be the demand made on the **aborigines**.

* This is related to another object that he had - to collect and record the letters and early memoirs of Europeans concerning contact with **aborigines** since the first exploration and settlement of this continent by Europeans.

* The early French explorers who landed on Tasmania and elsewhere had contact - sometimes unfortunate contact - with **aborigines**.

* Very valuable descriptions of the **aborigines** of Tasmania, who have now become extinct, have been located in the French maritime museums.

* The Leader of the Opposition asked for the indexing of what is possessed by museums, libraries and individuals of significance to the knowledge of **aborigines**.

* In a sense, the **aborigines** are of value because they represent an extreme type.

* They were not like the **aborigines**, who are regarded by anthropologists, in their own sense, as the intellectuals of the primitive world.

* Studies being made under the auspices of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies show how subtle are the thought patterns in the minds and thought processes of **aborigines**.

* But there are no treaties with the **aborigines** - except for Batman's bogus one - because none of us recognized that they had any possession.

* But the early belief that **aborigines** saw no significance in particular land was quite wrong.

* I hope that appreciation of the **aborigines** will lead to a more humane policy.

* Assimilation is the policy, and it will be carried out more readily if the **aborigines**' conception of themselves is one of self-respect and respect for their own culture and their rights.

* There can easily develop, among welfare officers and many authorities who are administering aboriginal affairs in the Commonwealth and in the States, a possessive attitude towards **aborigines**, a resentment if somebody else comes into the field and a particular resentment if somebody else's study reveals things that are inconvenient.

* I am quite certain that if, in the course of time, all aboriginal languages die out, there will develop a considerable resentment that they have disappeared from Australian life when an educational policy could have preserved some of them, even though the **aborigines** concerned may also master English.

* If we do not take steps to preserve the knowledge of the ways of thinking and the languages of the **aborigines**, our own people in the future will resent this generation which assisted in the disappearance of these things.

* The Commonwealth Government should not regard the aboriginal race as a race for museum study; nor should it regard **aborigines** as curiosities, examples of stone-age men living in Australia and, therefore, something to be looked at as a spectacle.

* When I was last in the Northern Territory I noted that the Australian Army, for example, in teaching its men survival under certain conditions which they might experience has been utilizing the knowledge of the **aborigines** in regard to such matters as what can be eaten in the desert and in the bush, and how to live off the land.

* Nutritional studies that have taken place in the Northern Territory and elsewhere - not under the auspices of this institute - have led to the discovery that many of the foods which **aborigines** utilize for survival have a high vitamin content.

* There are many parallel cases to be found in the foods that **aborigines** utilize for their survival.

* We express the hope that there will be early imitation by the States of the Commonwealth's action in supporting aboriginal studies so that there will be an intelligent appreciation of the work of this institution not only by the Government but also by people, such as missionaries and station-owners, who have so much to do with **aborigines**.

* It is our hope that, in this atmosphere of appreciation, the implications of the dignity and the rights of **aborigines** will begin to be worked out.

* The nomadic habits of these **aborigines** who still live a tribal life and the nature of their own views regarding the land have led us to the view that the present policy of reserving large areas of Crown land for the exclusive use of the aboriginal population ensured that their present needs are protected and their future needs can be met.

* Aborigines are at present employed in Queensland, South Australia and 
As to the newspapers' interpretation that there is some alteration in the entitlement to social service benefits, I would say quite plainly that the entitlement of **aborigines** to these benefits is determined by an act of this Parliament, and the matter is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Social Services.

* It applies to **aborigines** in the same way as it applies to all other Australians.

* In respect of children under fifteen- 
The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 21 of the Northern Territory (Administration) Act which provides for the establishment and operation of the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund.

* I hope that my remarks have conveyed the important role which is seen for the Aborigines Benefits Trust Fund in advancing the social and economic position of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory and that all honourable members will not only support the measure before the House but also support the principles which the Government considers should be followed in administering the moneys available in that Fund.

* In common with other members of this House I welcomed the Government's decision to put to a referendum a proposal to repeal section 127 of the Constitution which provides that Aborigines shall not be counted for certain purposes.

* I believe that it does not go far enough, and I have two motives in bringing before the Parliament this expanding Bill which provides that there shall be more responsibility on the Commonwealth to help the States to deal with Aborigines and to prevent racial discrimination in Australia.

* Let me refer first to the Aborigines themselves.

* I think that everyone who has had contact with Aborigines, as I have, has a personal liking for them and a feeling that we have a responsibility to them.

* Most of us would also have some sense of failure in relation to the way in which we have dealt with our Aborigines in the past.

* It is not just a matter of saying: " We will regard the Aborigines as merely poor white people".

* First, the Aborigines themselves want this to happen.

* The Aborigines are such a group and should be the first people to whom we would turn before deciding anything relating to their future.

* As a result of inquiry and a very considerable degree of contact with Aborigines, I know - I think the House would agree with me on this - that they want the Commonwealth to assume a greater degree of responsibility towards them, their rights, their opportunities and their advancement.

* We must not regard the Aborigines as having no rights.

* We must look first and foremost to what the Aborigines want, and they want the Commonwealth to accept a greater degree of reponsibility towards them.

* From time to time in the past the States have said: "We would like to do more for our Aborigines but we do not have the funds.

* Indeed, apart from those reasons, it should go to the aid of the States also because the burden of assisting the Aborigines is not shared equally among the States in proportion to their total population.

* The Aborigines, very rightly, require equal protection throughout the Commonwealth from adverse discriminatory laws.

* I am saying that it is bad that there should be a lack of uniformity and that the Aborigines throughout Australia need equal protection against adverse discrimination.

* Whilst all Aborigines are entitled to equal protection against adverse discrimination, the special welfare measures that are needed for them may well be different in different parts of Australia.

* There are two possible ways of dealing with it: First, the way that I have described and, secondly, the way of simply omitting the words " other than the Aboriginal race in any State" so that the Commonwealth would have power to pass discriminatory laws in regard to people of any racial origin, including Aborigines.

* But, if honorable members will turn their attention to the judgment delivered by the High Court of Australia in the case of the City of Melbourne v. the Commonwealth of Australia in 1947, they will see that the operation of section 109 may not be quite as untrammelled as some people are inclined to suppose, lt may be that the High Court, applying the principles that it laid down in that case, would find, for example, that a Commonwealth law providing that Aborigines shall be eligible for a State franchise was a law relating not to Aborigines but to the organisation of State government and, as such, beyond Commonwealth power.

* Hence, I think, this sub-section, which has never yet been used, should come out and be replaced by the positive sub-section I have suggested, giving the Commonwealth responsibility for the advancement of our Aborigines.

* I think it is advisable to write a prohibition against racial discrimination into our Constitution in something like these words, because unless we did so there would be inadequate protection for Aborigines in both the Commonwealth and the State spheres.

* It applies only to Australian electors including, of course, Aborigines, and their children and it applies only inside Australia.

* The main point is to help our Aborigines, the people to whom we owe, as I have said, a special duty and for whom we should have a special feeling.

* Let us do this primarily because we want to help our own Australian Aborigines, to help them in this period of transition, to bring them through to full citizenship - a goal which we will not achieve overnight but of which we should never lose sight.

* It is also interesting to put on record, as, no doubt, other speakers have done, that the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines was unanimous.

* On the subject of the rights of **aborigines** there is often heard, of course, a good deal of emotional and misinformed comment.

* The changes to be made under this legislation represent the fourth of these achievements, and I believe that the exten sion of voting rights to all **aborigines** and Torres Straits Islanders is equal in importance to the other three reforms that I have already mentioned.

* I may be permitted to spend a few moments in dealing with general criticism of our treatment of the **aborigines**.

* It is, of course, incorrect to assume that **aborigines** in Australia represent a large problem or a single problem.

* As we know, the **aborigines** are a very small minority in the Australian community.

* In general terms it is estimated that the total number of **aborigines** and part-**aborigines** is 100,000.

* The conditions under which **aborigines** live range from those primitive conditions of the few I have mentioned, through all graduations to the conditions of those, probably about 30,000, who are living to-day no differently from other members of the Australian community in general.

* The essential aim of the Australian policy with regard to **aborigines** is equality of rights and privileges and opportunities as compared with the non-aboriginal people.

* The reduction in their numbers between 1778 and recent times was, of course, due largely to infectious illnesses to which the **aborigines**, by reason of their long isolation, were usually vulnerable when they came in contact with Europeans and Asians.

* I want to bring to the debate the emphasis that our **aborigines** need the goodwill and the genuine help of the community.

* There are now in Western Australia no government settlements for **aborigines**, and during the past thirteen years education facilities for native children have been revolutionized, while improved medical and housing arrangements have been made.

* I am sure that many of my colleagues, and many of those who have contributed to the debate, have read with interest what Professor A. P. Elkin, emeritus professor of anthropology, wrote some years ago in a booklet titled " Aborigines and Citizenship ".

* He wrote - 
Contrary to what many people think, all adult **aborigines** in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, whether full-blood or mixed-blood, have the right to enrol for, and vote in, both State and Federal elections.

* Professor Elkin then emphasized that **aborigines** are British subjects and Australians by birth.

* He pointed out that the number of such **aborigines**, however, would be decreasing yearly, and that in any case their non-use of a legal right would not cause any confusion.

* I point out that this portion of the report, dealing with disenfranchised **aborigines**, endeavours to present reliable figures upon which to work.

* The figures used in this section of the select committee's report refer to full-blood **aborigines**, except for the Torres Strait islanders.

* The committee estimated that, of the total of 46,872, some 26,000 fullblood' **aborigines** and Torres Strait islanders would be involved in this extension of the franchise.

* The exclusion of some **aborigines** under Commonwealth legislation up to the present has been based, not upon race, but upon the non-inclusion of tribal and nomadic **aborigines** within the general community and the lack of relationship between their way of life and the life that we ourselves lead.

* For the time being enrolment is to be voluntary, but, once **aborigines** are enrolled, compulsory voting will be enforced, as it applies to all other people on the rolls of the various divisions of the Commonwealth.

* Federal voting rights having been extended to **aborigines**, I believe the stage will have been set for the various States which need to take action because of their vote-denying laws, which are still in existence, to put their own houses in order.

* In our genuine endeavours to help the **aborigines** of Australia.

* I believe that it is most important that we not only extend voting rights to **aborigines** but also take appropriate steps to extend to them higher education and assist them towards social integration.

* I believe,  Mr. Speaker,  that we ought to strive also to achieve a better standard of housing for **aborigines**, which again was emphasized by the select committee.

* I believe, too, that farm and trade training schools should be brought into our thinking in relation to this higher education for **aborigines**.

* The committee reported on legislation the purpose of which was to remove any discrimination against **aborigines**.

* However, if employers were obliged to provide **aborigines** with all the conditions mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition some **aborigines** would not have an opportunity to obtain employment.

* The employment of **aborigines** is not an easy task.

* I agree with the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  that .the Minister is to be congratulated ,upon the wonderful work that he has done in connexion with **aborigines** in the Northern Territory.

* My remarks to-day will relate mostly to those Northern Territory **aborigines**, with whom we are mainly concerned.

* There, perhaps, it is possible to lift the **aborigines** stage by stage until they almost reach equality with our own people.

* The great number of **aborigines** for the welfare of whom the Federal Parliament is responsible, as distinct from those in the States, are scattered about the Northern Territory.

* We are apt to say that you cannot depend on **aborigines** because they go walk-about.

* But the **aborigines** are not the only ones who behave in this way.

* It is true that in appearance and dress they may not have been up to the standard of people to be seen in the suburbs of Can berra, but it was obvious that these aboriginal women - many of them full-blooded **aborigines** - had the same love for their children, and the same desire to do something for them, as other womenfolk in Australia.

* I am pleased that the Minister has recognized that we must do the best we can to help the **aborigines**.

* We are most concerned now about teaching the **aborigines** how to use the country.

* That is a laudable object and something of which we can be proud, but at the same time I think we should recognize that, after a period of training, the **aborigines** themselves should be able to do a lot of that work.

* The same applies to the **aborigines**.

* An attempt has been made on the far west coast of South Australia to help the **aborigines** by setting aside a large area where they can run cattle and sheep and learn how to look after them.

* On behalf of these folk I make a plea that we be not satisfied with building schools, sending teachers to those schools, raising the **aborigines** up to a certain standard and then saying to them, " If you go  500  or  1,000  miles away you will be able to get the real benefit from what you have been taught ".

* .- Like other speakers who have taken part in the debate on this bill, under which it is proposed to grant voting rights to **aborigines** under certain conditions, I commend the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines upon the work it has done.

* But there are a few things which I think should be said in connexion with this problem of **aborigines** and their voting rights.

* This bill is based on recommendation 77, which appears on page 8 of the report of the Select Committee on Voting Rights of Aborigines.

* In my opinion, the **aborigines** of this country are all subjects of the Queen, and therefore already have the right to vote.

* I will agree that, because of conditions which apply to their way of life, it may be necessary to organize the voting of the **aborigines**.

* But I start off by saying that I consider that the **aborigines** already have the right to vote.

* Everybody who has spoken has commended this Parliament, commended the Government and commended Australia upon this tremendously forward step of giving the Australian **aborigines** a vote.

* In paragraph 27 of its report, the committee itself says - 
I would have liked to see a committee such as this inquiring into the whole question of the integration of the **aborigines** of Australia into the Commonwealth as a whole, and I am delighted to note that in its report the committee uses the word " integration " in preference to the word " assimilation ".

* I remind honorable members that there is an essential difference between our way of living and thinking and the way that the **aborigines** live and think.

* The **aborigines** here, like some of the African natives, live under a system of community ownership.

* The **aborigines** do not understand our system of private ownership, which is fundamental to our way of thinking.

* Selected **aborigines** should be trained to be social workers, professional workers and technical workers amongst the natives.

* Training **aborigines** to work among their own people would eventually lead to complete integration.

* They start by living on native reserves and selected **aborigines** are then given a better class house, not right in the town, where they are able to learn housekeeping and how to adopt standards of living similar to those of the whites.

* While the aboriginals who have been selected to live in these houses are not a nuisance to the rest of the community, other **aborigines** who come to live with them may be.

* This problem must be overcome, and I believe it can be overcome if we educate the natives in a system which provides for the selection of **aborigines** to train their own people.

* If we can inculcate such high standards into the way of life of the **aborigines**, we will have done something worth while.

* Certain concessions were made to **aborigines** by the present Government.

* I do not know whether the Government expects to get any votes from the **aborigines** because of that.

* Government members know that the Labour Party, mainly through the efforts of the honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr. Beazley)  got a vote for the **aborigines** of Australia.

* In Tasmania, for example, there are no **aborigines**, and this proposal would have no popular appeal there.

* Therefore, even if section 127 were deleted from the Constitution an amendment of Queensland law would be required in order to allow **aborigines** to be counted in that State.

* They are virtually proposing that, by an amendment of section 51 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth should assume full power to legislate with regard to **aborigines**.

* In its report it stated - 
When the Committee ceased its deliberations in 1958, it had given some consideration to the very important question as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament should have an express power to make laws with respect to **aborigines**, and representations from various quarters advocated the adoption of a recommendation to this effect.

* In 1929, a royal commission decided specifically against giving the Commonwealth power with respect to **aborigines**.

* It stated - 
We do not recommend that section 51 be amended so as to empower the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to **aborigines**.

* We recognize that the effect of the treatment of **aborigines** on the reputation of Australia furnishes a powerful argument for a transference of control to the Commonwealth.

* But we think that on the whole the States are better equipped for controlling **aborigines** than the Commonwealth.

* We think that a Commonwealth authority would be at a disadvantage in dealing with the **aborigines**, and that the States are better qualified to do so.

* He referred to principles and said that all Australian **aborigines** should have a vote.

* I have been a jackaroo on properties in the far west of Queensland, and I know that some of the **aborigines** on the mustering camps have seen an aeroplane go over and have referred to it as a high-powered buggy.

* If so, the honorable gentleman and the committee, indeed, are seriously misunderstanding the intelligence of the **aborigines**.

* Do honorable members believe that one could go out to some of the **aborigines** in the far west of Queensland and say to them, in homely style: " Brothers, you have a vote on Saturday.

* If the honorable member for Reid did so the **aborigines** would be puzzled and I do not know whether they would regard him as a great white chief or as a specialist in yo-yo.
