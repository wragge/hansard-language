* We should be trying to get other countries, such as Canada, to influence the Chinese to influence the North Vietnamese, and that is the only answer.

* He is claiming that the  President  of the United States will agree, as he agreed, with every point made by the Chinese Premier.

* The Chinese Government - whether it be the government of the People's Republic of Mainland China or Taiwan China - has a very considerable degree of public order.

* We cannot compete in costs with Japanese, Hong Kong, Chinese and other Asian textile manufacturers.

* We are seeing the establishment of a new Indo Chinese empire under one nation, controlled from Hanoi.

* The Russians do not appear to have given too much attention or concern to the effect of their nuclear program upon the Chinese.

* It did not come from the Government of the People's Republic, nor did it come from anyone with an official status in the Chinese Government.

* Mr L.  V. Price, who is the  President  of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, is quoted in today's Melbourne 'Herald' as saying he believes that because of the increased demand to which 1 have referred the quota increases were justified, and he says he believes that there is a prospect of a Chinese contact this year.

* The right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon),  who was Prime Minister at the time, has admitted that members of the Wheat Board were used to pass an official note on to the Chinese in May 1967.

* Instead of capitulating completely to the Chinese demands, as our Prime Minister did even before he reached office, a wiser Prime Minister would have found an accommodation similar to that which  President  Nixon has negotiated, that is, the setting up of a trade mission in the initial stages to fulfil much the same functions as an embassy.

* His  death will be sadly felt not only by the Chinese people but also by people throughout the world.

* The Chinese have done a very good job in respect of this disease.

* For instance, there are 700 million Chinese.

* Honourable members should realise that the Kuomintang regime which retains some tenuous existence in the Chinese Province of Taiwan has always been more nationalist and imperialist in its attitude than anybody has ever been able to establish that the Government in Peking is.

* It of course depends on the requirements of the Chinese government and upon the availability of material in Australia.

* The Australian Democratic Labor Party used them back in the mid-1960s when it showed Chinese soldiers marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

* The honourable member for Parramatta calls past occasionally to present a flag to a local school, implying that he bought it and that we would be living under Red Chinese domination if he were not the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

* But the honourable member for Chifley was prevented from informing the House of what the honourable member for Mackellar had said prior to the departure of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  to be the guests of the Chinese.

* The Chinese see the Soviet Union as attempting an encirclement of China, and that will lead to countervailing action and competition on the mainland of South-East Asia and in other parts of South-East Asia.

* The population of Nauru is around the 7000 mark, about half of that number being citizens of Nauru, about onequarter being people from other Pacific islands, mainly from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands as I mentioned before, and the remaining quarter being Chinese and Europeans in equal proportions.

* Hordes of Chinese coolies were used at one time to lay railway tracks.

* The official languages of the University are to be the official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian.

* It is totally intransigent and, of course, it has the Chinese and the Russians on the hook.

* That invader would find that the cost of such an invasion, although inflicting a heavy cost on the Chinese, would still be greater than would justify an assault on that country.

* Next month Australia will be sending the first Australian Government trade mission ever to visit the Chinese People's Republic.

* So much for the phoney efforts at dialogue supposed to be being conducted in deadly secret by the Government with the Chinese.

* Not once have I heard the honourable member for Lilley in this House oppose the selling of Australian wheat to Communist China or our trading with the enemies of our people, as he says the Communist Chinese are.

* Let us not forget that the loss of the Chinese market for wheat in 1970 was a dreadful blow to the hopes of Australian wheat growers.

* The formula takes no account of academic programs, though a school may offer specialised courses to meet a particular need in the community such as a technical course at an independent school in the city or a Chinese language course at another school.

* One thinks for example of the fact that the Goverment, indirectly perhaps but by exhortation sporsored industrial disruption against French ships and approved all that was done to help Chinese shipping.

* He also tried to make capital out of the fact that the Acting Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  was taking the point of view that the Chinese people might be wrong in saying that Royal Australian Air Force officers should not wear their uniforms when they visit China.

* Too often we have seen the dangers and tragic consequences of inflaming Australians against people of other races, whether they be Chinese, Japanese, Arabs or Indonesians.

* As far as Australia's investment overseas is concerned, the latter is of particular relevance because although the Australian shareholder must have a majority interest, it will mean that investments entered into on the basis of a joint operation with a Hong Kong business or a Chinese business in, Singapore or Malaysia will be eligible for cover by the EFIC.

* He accepted the policy of domination of the Chinese Government.

* It pretends to uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, yet many member nations pay no regard to the human rights of the 14 million Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan.

* If we just want a very cheap manufacturing industry, why not import a thousand Chinese, pay them $2 a day and make the shirts here just as cheaply as elsewhere?

* They said that wheat sales were lost to China because T made on that programme statements that were offensive to the Chinese.

* When one considers that the linguist bounty for an officer who has equipped himself with Japanese, Chinese or even both is only $500, one can hardly be surprised.

* He should be called the Minister for Chinese Trade.

* It was no accident that I went on the first all Party parliamentary mission to China and I must say now that I wish to assure  His Excellency,  the Chinese Ambassador here, and  Dr Fitzgerald  that there are many people in this country who are most anxious to improve cultural relations between the 2 nations and I will do all I can to assist.

* We feel sorry for the Chinese people who have got involved in a diplomatic position which means that they are obliged to help Kampuchea.

* Whether Russian or Chinese communism prevails, the result will be the same - that is communism.

* The principal Chinese language newspaper in Singapore, for example reported, in comment on the Minister's speech in response to  Mr Denis  Warner, that Australia had decided to stop urging Asians to fight Asians.

* If so, is the right honourable gentleman aware that the Chinese Prime Minister, Chou En-lai, consistently refuses to accept the 2-China formula and emphasises that his government will never surrender his country's sovereignty, irrespective of where the political pressure comes from?

* He attacked Whitlam constantly because he was in China, saying that he was a political candidate endorsed by Chou En-lai and that the Chinese were playing him like a fish on a line.

* The physical features which give Australia that option of approaching the International Court of Justice against the French tests are not applicable against the Chinese tests.

* It is in some ways a reflection of the Canadian system, but it is not a Chinese copy of it.

* Those people who are listening to the debate, including the very few Government members who are in the chamber, must have listened with some extraordinary amazement to an announcement that some uniform discrepancy between members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Chinese Government has precluded the  Deputy  Prime Minister, the present Acting Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  from embarking on his visit which was to have begun tomorrow morning.

* I appreciate that Malaysia and Singapore did not join us, but they have a particular problem with their indigenous Chinese population which we fully understand.

* He more or less reminded me of a line of, I think it was, Bret Harte: 'We are ruined by Chinese cheap labour'.

* The Prime Minister made certain suggestions in China that the Chinese Government is our friend- the present Prime Minister was Minister for Defence at the time of our sorry record in Vietnam.

* One day the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)-  standing in the very place where he now sits, incidentallywas making one of his normal speeches against communism, unity tickets, the Russians and the Chinese, when Leslie Haylen said to me: Quickly, go into the bar and get a couple of white coats.

* The Russians and the Chinese are supplying arms to the North and the Americans and we are supplying arms to the South.

* The Chinese, 1 trust, will simply say to me about the Leader of the Opposition: 'Forget that unfortunate man, but we would rather not see him again'.

* The Australian Democratic Labor Party used to show Chinese soldiers marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

* -This day of good food and fine wine, of mirth in the House and of the visit of the Chinese delegation is a day that Leslie Haylen would have enjoyed.

* Chinese merchants provide the link between these opium growing villages and the heroin manufacturing laboratories which are hidden away in inaccessible jungle in this mountainous region.

* As the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  said last night, about the only other areas which have increased that we can think of are massage parlours and Chinese restaurants.

* The Prime Minister continued his answer, and there was some cross-talk about the pronunciation of the name of the Chinese Premier.

* Would the Chinese turn up here and say: 'Well now, what have you got?

* He is the one who is sponsoring the selling of wheat to the Communist Chinese.

* We need a national commodity corporation to replace the ad hoc decisions on Asian aid which led to such gestures as the presenting of buses to Djakarta with no spares, no replacements and no maintenance, which became a laughing stock until they were replaced, I am sad to say, by Chinese vehicles.

* There is probably the largest cross section of migrants and ethnic groups in Australia- British, Greek, Italian, Macedonian, Yugoslav, Croatian, Lebanese and substantial Chinese and Philippines communities.

* We hear similar predictions that the Indonesians, the Japanese, the Chinese, the Russians and the Cubans are coming.

* So far as Communist China is concerned, most of us know that the United States has a very large organisation in Hong Kong, which is an obvious listening post to read the Chinese newspapers and to hear what it can from those who come out of China.

* -When Madam Chen Muhua, a Chinese Deputy Prime Minister, attended a Press conference in Canberra last Wednesday week she was asked a very important question by a very distinguished member of the Press Gallery, Max Hawkins.

* He said that he would take our forces out of Terendak and put them in Singapore so that they would not be involved in a communal situation or the in-fighting, if I may use that terra, between the Malay and Chinese sections of the Malaysian community.

* What a hue and cry there would have been from the Government if the treatment that James received at the hands of the Chinese had been handed out by America or South Africa.

* This was the idea of a Australian Chinese wool corporation.

* Finally, does the Minister recognise that the limitations, in the context of the present position of excess production, placed on Western Australian loadings under all past and existing contracts with the Chinese now constitute a flagrant differentiation between State and State by a Commonwealth instrumentality, to wit, the Australian Wheat Board?

* When I was there I observed very closely the discrimination that existed between first class and second class passengers, so much so that I made reference to it to the Chinese who were accompanying the Australian delegation on that occasion.

* We asked the members of the Taiwanese Chinese community whether the Fretilin Party was communist.

* If the Chinese like to send a sporting team here, subject to security requirements, of course we would welcome it.

* The thought that is occupying the minds of those who are looking for a compromise is that Taiwan may have its own seat in the United Nations, not specifically for its own islands but that it may build up a small family of islands under the control of the Nationalist Chinese Government.

* The Leader of the Opposition has a rather strange, wholly mystical but understandable Chinese treatment for the social welfare policies of this nation.

* The deportee shown under Category 'A' as Malaysian was actually Chinese.

* One is the Dai-Gum-San village which is based on the old Chinese gold mining era in Bendigo.

* I find it difficult to accept the second proposition because I know personally Australian soldiers who were captured in Korea and who were interviewed by Wilfred Burchett in the company of communist Chinese soldiers in North Korea.

* Will the Prime Minister assure the House and the people of Australia that the Minister for Overseas Trade in his trade talks with officials of the People's Republic of China will not commit Australian exports in a season of short supply exclusively to the Chinese and to the exclusion of all other traditional markets?

* Discussions have also been held with the Chinese Government to undertake a feasibility study for the introduction of a direct AustraliaChina liner service.

* He said he would not sell his soul to compromise 750 million Chinese.

* Is it a fact that the Queensland Sugar Board negotiated the first sale of sugar to China, then negotiated the second sale - not of bagged sugar but in bulk - and has recently been in the process of negotiating a long term contract with the Chinese?

* Britain and America are by their attitude sponsoring the Patriotic Front and the Chinese and the Russians are supplying it with arms.

* The Chinese feel encircled by the Soviet Union.

* We do not know at this moment who is going to use or refrain from using the nuclear weapons which certainly now exist in Chinese hands as we know they certainly exist in Russian hands.

* The simple fact is that what we were referring to initially was an alleged statement between the British Charge d'Affaires in Peking and somebody who was not what could be regarded as a member of the Government of the People's Republic of China but who was an official of one of the Chinese departments.

* A few years ago, about the time of the Vietnam conflict, it was not the Russians who were coming; it was the Chinese.

* There is, finally, a naxalite type of movement led by Mukhtiar and the one man who threatens every Chinese strategy in Pakistan is Mujibah Rahman because he could form, with the consent of the overwhelming majority of people in East Pakistan, and enough to be a majority in both Pakistani, a government which would be really independent.

* We have registered with the Chinese Government Australia's opposition to its nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere and are pursuing with the utmost vigour an international legal and political campaign to induce France to abandon her testing program in the Pacific.

* It is currently in the process of negotiating a contract to help the Chinese- a subject dear to the  Deputy  Speaker's heart- to develop their hydro electric power potential.

* The much vaunted Chinese peace proposals were a capitulation, as one of my colleagues has said.

* Firstly, the CSR Company in its commercial transactions in Hong Kong and Peking has never had any discussions on quantities and price with Chinese authorities for a long-term agreement.

* For example, on the forthcoming visit to China, for which very worthwhile arrangements have been made by the Chinese, about half the number of people who accompanied the former Prime Minister will be accompanying me.

* I would think that in the long run the Chinese are likely to be more rational neighbours than the Russians, or even the Americans in some contexts.

* Although China did come to us early in the piece Canada beat us to that market to the extent that we were practically frozen out until late 1972 when the Chinese, because of their needs, decided to come back to us.

* It was fashionable in 1966 to suggest that the Chinese were coming.

* One of the things Chinese economists said was: 'We have not got inflation in our country'.

* Have apologies been extended to Chinese officials who saw this reported unfortunate incident?

* The Chinese are sensitive people.

* We all would be delighted if Chinese troops had stayed at home and had not gone into South Korea, Tibet and India, and if Russian troops had stayed at home and bad not gone into Hungary and Czechoslovakia.

* Fallout from French operations is most evident in the southern hemisphere, and that from the Chinese in the northern hemisphere.

* There have been, for more than a century, Australians of Chinese ancestry.

* Chinese hordes would have attacked India through Tibet.

* Since then the Australian Government has made many representations regarding  Mr Francis  James, including a series of representations made through the British Charge d'Affaires directly to the Chinese Government.

* I say nothing about the Russian people or the Chinese people who are just individuals like we are and well-intentioned like we are.

* Following the 1940 takeover of China by the Chinese Communists, he argued that the Democrats had lost China.

* He boasts 4 of them - English, Irish, Chinese and Italian.

* If we sell just a few dollars worth of commodities per head to the Chinese people in a year, we can double our hade overseas in that time.

* Does it want to insist that the Continental Chinese should have the right of domination of these people and of preventing the people from expressing their will at the polls as to the kind of government they want?

* In fact what it says is that we will be watching the situation carefully following the assurances given and the interpretation placed upon them by the previous Australian Ambassador to China and accepted by the present Government as a significant change in the attitude of the Chinese Government.

* The deportee shown under Category 'A' as Malaysian was actually Chinese.

* Can he also inform the House with respect to reports of increased road building activity by the Chinese and the North Vietnamese in Laos and indicate whether those activities are regarded by non-Communist countries in Indo-China as constituting a direct threat to their security and further evidence of Comunist aggressive intent and practice?

* The Chinese have managed to dam the Yellow River, which for centuries under the old Kuomintang Government went into flood.

* I remind him of the congratulatory message which he sent last week to  Mr Hua  Kuo Feng on, as the Prime Minister put it, 'his recent appointment as  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party'.

* The Chinese leaders quite properly say that they will continue nuclear testing because their enemies have nuclear weapons and they cannot deny themselves that technology.

* Additionally, does the Minister expect the number of Chinese refugees coming to Australia to increase as a result of civil unrest in Vietnam?

* 1976 Census: Chinese Residents (Question No.

* 3728) 
(a) French, S3 cabin crew and 234 other staff; (b) German, 61 cabin crew and 165 other staff; (c) Russian, 2 cabin crew and 19 other staff; (d) Chinese, 1 cabin crew and 37 other staff; (e) Japanese, 4 cabin crew and 8 other staff; (f) Malay/Indonesian, 1 cabin crew and 32 other staff; (g) Italian, 27 cabin crew and 120 other staff; (h) Greek, 12 cabin crew and 54 other staff.

* People in my electorate say: 'We refuse Chinese and we refuse various other Asians but we are bringing people from the Middle East into Australia.

* I refer to the statement made in Peking last Tuesday by  Mr Liao  Cheng-ching, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to the effect that the United States should sever any diplomatic or military links with Taiwan.

* The following sub-categories have been proclaimed for coloured persons: Cape Coloured, Malay, Griqua, Chinese, Indian, other Asian and other coloured.

* The expansion of the Chinese industry means that they will probably be looking for further outside sources of raw material to supplement their own.

* After considerable discussion with people, very close to the Chinese Government we were then somewhat peremptorily warned that it would be advisable for us.

* Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement by  Mr James  Kibel that if he told the true story regarding the negotiations with Chinese officials over the proposed visit of the former Minister for the Army to China the Government would be forced to resign?

* Will the Minister provide the House with transcripts of the broadcast statements made by  Dr Han  Suyin, especially her 'Guest of Honour' programme and any others denigrating United Nations action in Korea and justifying Chinese aggression in Tibet and against India?

* I wonder whether it is more than coincidence that the Chinese acrobatic team is visiting Canberra this week.

* If the Soviet Union can get rid of the Chinese distraction on its eastern border its possibilities of surveillance over Albania, Yugoslavia and Rumania may begin to operate, and then from the forcible consolidation of the Communist bloc the Soviet Union may be well placed to dominate western Europe.

* Mr Speaker,  the Prime Minister implied, in an answer that he gave to a question by me in the House this morning, that my Government was not prepared to permit Ministers to visit the People's Republic of China, prior to recognition of that country, on an official invitation from the Chinese Government itself.

* It will survey Japanese an in the period spanning the 12th to the 18th centuries and will be in the genre of such other overseas exhibitions to tour Australia as the Archaeological Exhibition in 1977, El Dorado Gold in 1978, Chinese Classical Paintings in 1980 and 5,000 Years of Korean An in 1983.

* It includes the remaining treasures of our colonial architecture and such homely parts of the national heritage as paddlesteamers and even a Chinese joss house.

* Has he given the classification to it because he wishes to keep its contents from the Chinese people or from the Australian people?

* and (3) Formal diplomatic channels, not a direct approach from me to  Chairman  Mao (who is  Chairman  of the Chinese Communist Party and not, as the honourable member erroneously stated on 23 October 1973,  Chairman  of the People's Republic of China), would be the appropriate way to arrange a visit by an Australian Parliamentary delegation to China.

* Since then I have received the Record of a Conversation between British officials and Australian officials which took place in Australia, which states that the actual conversation in which the Chinese views were stated took place in Peking.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of concern being expressed in the community at what is interpreted to be a difference in attitude on the part of the Australian Government between French nuclear tests and the tests conducted by the Chinese?

* I have lunched with the Chinese Ambassador.

* In a speech in Phnom Penh on 7 November, visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wang Tung-Hsing referred to the Kampuchean people fighting the worst flood for 70 years.

* I had some little difficulty in persuading the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade,  Mr Pai  Hsiang-kuo, to agree to this principle.

* I preface it by saying that while I have an appreciation of the many problems confronting the Royal Australian Navy concerning numerical capacity, taking into consideration the position of Russian entry into the Indian Ocean and Chinese infiltration in certain areas in Africa, I ask: As the Royal Navy is co-operating in combined exercises with the South African Navy, could consideration be given to the Royal Australian Navy joining in these combined exercises?

* At the very time that our men are dying in battle against Red Chinese troops, so we are saying, the honourable member says that he is prepared to sell on such markets.

* This means that the Japanese and Chinese interests are very similar.

* The United Nations has played no role in the winding down of the Vietnam war or in the contacts between American and Chinese leaders.

* If one looks at the problems of that great community one sees that there was a need for the Chinese to own their land and to exercise political control over it.

* A then Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Council made the statement that it would attract Chinese rockets.

* The Minister's statement, if he will forgive me, reminds me of what is often said of Chinese food: It is agreeable to receive and easy to digest, but afterwards you still feel hungry.

* Will the Minister explain to the Chinese Government that Australian Rules football is a pleasureable, fresh and entertaining game and that it is no more harmful or subversive than ping-pong?

* Having regard, inter alia, to the reciprocal most-favoured-nation provisions of the Australia-China Trade Agreement, the Australian Government considered that the only responsible course of action was to consult with the Chinese authorities to seek to reach a mutually acceptable level of restraint on trade in the products concerned.

* I noticed a news item in today's Melbourne  Herald  suggesting that the Soviet Union has threatened to intervene in China at a time when the Chinese leadership is not at its strongest.

* I only wish more Australians had a similar opportunity so that they too could gain some understanding of where Australia stands in the Japanese and Chinese perspectives.

* The commencement of the Chinese trade fair in Australia tomorrow and the opening of the Australian trade fair in Peking some days ago are material evidence of the bonds of friendship that have been built between, ourselves and the largest country in Asia which the conservatives continually ignored for all the years in which they were in office.

* Failure to gain a contact with the Chinese this year would mean a substantial reduction for Australia's wheat growers, whose incomes have already been heavily depressed by the introduction of quotas to curb overproduction.

* The National Estate report not only recognises the need for the preservation of historic buildings and things like the Chinese joss house that was mentioned in the Minister's speech, but also the natural environment.

* I have referred previously to a Chinese lass who has been underpaid.

* 1 ) Did he send a congratulatory message to  Mr Hua  KuoFeng on his recent appointment as  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

* The reason I am saying these things is to recapitulate the situation as we can imagine the Vietnamese or the Chinese saw it then.

* During this month we have seen a Chinese invasion of Vietnam along the length of an illdefined border.

* The Chinese forces are large but their progress has been slow and we would hope there would be an opportunity for them to withdraw.

* The Chinese have a problem and we will put forward the position as we see it.

* The Chinese have occupied the Red River area of Vietnam for 1,000 years.

* Sixth, the Vietnamese government, for half a decade, has been building and intensifying sentiment against Vietnamese of Chinese origin, hundreds of thousands of whom are, and many more of whom may become, refugees.

* Eighth, there is the recent history of Chinese engagement in the region.

* This 'united front' has become the centrepiece of Chinese policy.

* At the moment, however, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Australia appear isolated in the world in the level of their acceptance of the Chinese operation against Vietnam as an antiSoviet operation.

* It is important to note that the strategy has changed with changes in the Chinese leadership.

* This Government and the Chinese Government are the only governments to cut off aid entirely to Vietnam.

* Not only did the Leader of the Opposition raise matters that concern the domestic politics of this country and try to gain the support of the Chinese for the Labor Party cause but he also insulted our allies and particularly the Japanese and the  President  of the United States.

* So,  Sir, I  want to- 
The attitude of the Chinese and Australian Governments on this matter is well known.

* On the other hand when I visited China as the guest of the People's Republic, a visit for which I am grateful, it was quite clear that the Chinese, for their part, could not countenance the existence of a bloc of Soviet organised states on their southern borders.

* I tracked this matter through 5 hospitals, not as a member of this Parliament but in the company of a Chinese man who was living in the area and who was able to gain access to these hospitals.

* Was the insistence of Taiwan that there should be no division of the Chinese nation an important factor in the great discrepancy between the for and against votes on the final resolution from Albania?

* Chinese.............. 1,350 
Mention has been made of the success of the program for which governments of both political complexions can take credit.

* We go to the Chinese and Hungarian restaurants and do things of that kind.

* I did issue a statement welcoming the purchase of wool from the Australian Wool Corporation by the Chinese wool mission which recently visited Australia.

* Chinese delegations to Australia have indicated interest in Australian uranium.

* Is he now in a position to provide information relating to the number of persons of Chinese origin who were resident in (a) Australia and (b) the Electoral Division of St George at the time of the 1976 Census, referred to in his answer to Question No.

* Did the Chinese Government intimate that following a recent statement by a senior Australian Cabinet Minister - believed to be the Minister for Trade and Industry - it had decided to make no further purchases of wheat from Australia?

* 1 ) How many primary and secondary schools, both state and private, in each of the 6 states teach the following languages: (a) French; (b) German; (c) Italian; (d) modern Greek; (e) Serbo-Croatian; (0 Chinese; (g) Japanese; (h) Indonesian/Malay and (i) Arabic 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the statements made by Chinese Vice Premier Madame Chen Muhua at the National Press Club that China's trade in its modernisation program will follow practices such as (a) compensatory payments, which she defined as being payments with the products of the enterprises and (b) delaying payments for equipment.

* Ever since the Chinese first showed any signs of developing a nuclear weapon both the honourable member for Reid and I have consistently opposed this.

* I added that Australia had made its opposition felt in relation to the recent French tests and that it was no less opposed to Chinese tests.

* Anyone who is not naive from the ankles up knows very well that the spread of the Russian ideology or the Chinese ideology, thrives on disorders.

* Between 1969 and 1975, for instance, the numbers taking Japanese multiplied nearly sevenfold, in Indonesian/Malay enrolments trebled, and in Chinese almost doubled.

* It is interesting to note that a public opinion poll conducted for the  Report on the Teaching of Asian Languages in Australian Schools (The Auchmuty Report),  which was tabled in March 1971, listed Japanese, Indonesian/Malay and Chinese (in that order), as the most important languages to be taught in Australian schools.

* The Australia China Council whose establishment was announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in June 1979, with an annual budget of $500,000, is becoming actively involved in encouragement of Chinese Studies in Australia.

* In view of the Minister's recent successful visit to China, can he advise the House which Australian industries, in his view, are able to get greatest access to the Chinese market?

* Has he any information which shows that the overwhelming majority of Australians do not want to see any Ugandan Asians brought to Australia and also that they feel strongly that the intake of 10,000 coloured and semi-coloured migrants, other than Chinese, should be reduced to no more than SOO annually.

* No; although the note to the French Government did contain a reference to one matter not included in the Note to the Chinese Government, namely, the further disregard by the government of France of the order of the International Court of Justice dated 22 June 1973.

* 1 ) During the present visit by Chinese Vice Premier Chen Muhua, a mutual desire by both countries to conclude a science and technology agreement was expressed.

* I refer to reports today that China has announced officially that as from 5 March all Chinese frontier troops are withdrawing from Vietnamese territory.

* The editorial did accuse the Government of joining the Chinese side in the Sino-Soviet conflict.

* How many staff and aircrew of Qantas are reasonably fluent in (a) French, (b) German, (c) Russian, (d) Chinese, (e) Japanese, (0 Malay/Indonesian, (g) Italian and (h) Greek.

* Most of the Chinese tests have been underground tests, and the only indications we have had of those tests have been seismic disturbances which have been picked up by surveillance stations around Asia.

* The Chinese tests have not been atmospheric tests, so there is no analogy to be drawn between the French tests and the Chinese tests.

* Chinese Students in Australia (Question No.

* It is the biggest Chinese aid programme anywhere, and I think it is the only aid programme of any significance in Africa.

* It is winning the Chinese a lot of credit in that part of the world not, I think, because it has been overly political but because the people taking part in the programme have been well trained.

* We discussed this with people in Kenya and asked them how they felt about the Chinese.

* It is obvious that in some ways the Chinese have an advantage over Western countries when they mount an aid programme in Africa.

* But the Government is now saddled with having previously recognised the Nationalist Chinese administration in Taiwan as being the representative of China.

* We are now in the position where, if we are to develop relations with the People's Republic of China and have an Australian Ambassador in Peking in the future, and a Chinese Ambassador in Canberra, this 
Government will have to withdraw from its position of recognising Taiwan and accrediting an Ambassador to the Nationalist Chinese in Taiwan.

* Did the Government deliver protest notes to the Chinese and French Governments on 18 June 1974 for exploding nuclear devices in the atmosphere; if not, what form of protest took place; if so, were the notes in the same terms, or were they identical.

* There is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese Government has made certain that Australia will become a satellite communist country much the same as Czechoslovakia is to the Soviet Union, much the same as Poland is to the Soviet Union.

* It may be that Australia was marginally more hostile to China - to use the Chinese term - than was Canada in that from the middle 1960s onward Australia had troops in Vietnam and an embassy in Taipei whereas Canada had neither.

* Nevertheless when last year the Chinese were given an option of choosing a friendly country or a hostile country as a supplier they naturally chose the friendly country.

* For the Chinese a government agency takes on the character of its government; a corporation can take on the character of its ownership.

* JETRO has produced a book listing the friendly companies as the Chinese would regard them.

* The wheat situation was sewn up by Canada before we ever spoke to any Chinese officials.

* I learned - and I will quote one of the most favourable sources, the Sydney 'Morning Herald' of 5th July - that on 3rd July in a televised Press conference in Perth the Prime Minister had said: 
The Chinese Government reaffirms, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Territory of the People's Republic of China.

* The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government.

* The Canadian Government does nol consider it appropriate either to endorse or to challenge the Chinese Government's position on the status of Taiwan.

* China is still extremely suspicious of any interest which Japan takes in Korea, which was detached from Chinese suzerainty in that war, and in Taiwan which was taken from Chinese sovereignty in that war.

* Furthermore any continuing economic interest which Japan shows in Taiwan arouses Chinese suspicions that Japan wants to continue to regard Taiwan as her colony.

* Secondly, the Chinese Communist regime had been branded by the United Nations as an aggressor in Korea.

* (The last Chinese soldiers left Korea in 1958.)

* First, we should accept the view of Chiang Kai-shek, and the view of all the other Chinese that I have heard speak on the subject, that there is only one China, and that Taiwan is a province of China.

* Nor is there dispute between them on any of the other matters which are frequently thrown up against the Chinese Government, namely, questions of offshore islands, fishing rights, the ocean sub soil, the seabed, the continental shelf, Tibet and the China-India border - to use the historic  term,  the McMahon line.

* We risk being confronted in the future with a fait accompli of some face-saving compromise between Taiwan and Peking of the kind for which the Chinese have a genius, and to find ourselves with nothing but the disdain of both sides, of all Chinese - unless America and Formosa first involve us in some war on this account.

* How many members of Parliament could pass the most elementary examination on Chinese history, or civilisation or geography or economics?

* Was an agreement signed by representatives of Australia and the People's Republic of China enabling a Chinese Consulate to be opened in Sydney with appropriate rights for Australia to open a Consulate in China.

* Is it any wonder that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  came back from Peking with a message from the Chinese Prime Minister, Chou En-lai, that China looks forward to the time when Labor takes office?

* You have to go back to all those reassuring communiques out of the Kremlin and Shanghai in order to understand what the Soviet and Chinese representatives said here at the United Nations about the Middle East crisis.

* This was apparently a reference to brothers, Brian and James Kibel who have negotiated with the Chinese for the Australian Government.

* Mr Speaker,  this is a most incredible statement to come from any member of the 
If necessary, will he ask some Australian Chinese Communophile who has visited China in recent times to assist him to determine the facts.

* The greatest hope for a lasting accommodation between the conflicting interests so manifest in the South East Asian and East Asian area may lie along the path of endeavouring to convince the People's Republic of China that Japan has no territorial designs on Chinese territory and that neither the United States of America nor Japan wishes Japan to move into a vacuum left by an American withdrawal.

* Still speaking in this vein, if I think that the performance of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  in Peking is open to criticism and was in some respects, as I believe, not such as to serve Australia's best interests, I must say that I feel no compulsion whatsoever to denigrate him as a disgrace to Australia or as the Chinese candidate in our next general election.

* If so, is this a breach of the same United Nations resolution, having regard to the report of an International Commission of Jurists on genocide and other crimes perpetrated by the Chinese since the occupation of Tibet.

* I believe he was right when he sent  Dr Fitzgerald  as the first Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China and to open negotiations between our country and the Chinese people.

* The Chinese people to whom I spoke at the Institute of International Affairs asked whether we really understood what was going on in the world.

* At every meeting that I had with Chinese Ministers concerned with foreign affairs they pointed out that Australia and Western Europe are completely unable to understand the power of the Soviet Union.

* Afterwards I asked whether these tunnels were under all Chinese cities and military establishments.

* The Chinese take nuclear war very seriously indeed.

* To a degree 1 think all of us can go along with that statement because in Vietnam the Russians and the Chinese are testing the United States of 
Has this Naval exercise taken place, in part at least, in South China Sea, in waters claimed by China to be Chinese waters.

* I should now like to quote from an article on Chinese foreign policy, and I will give the source of the quotation in a minute.

* It states: 
Who has represented Australia at China's National Day reception at the Chinese Embassy in Canberra in each year from 1965 to 1970 inclusive.

* -This is a time for us to reaffirm our friendship for the Chinese people and to express the hope that the death of Mao will usher in a new and better era for them and for the world.

* It is plausible to say that he had no alternative and that the Chinese masses could have been controlled by no gentler means.

* Perhaps, but for the misguided General Marshall, aided and abetted by ignorance and worse from Washington and Canberra, a better road may have opened for the Chinese people.

* It is the fashion now to speak well of Mao because Chinese communism provides some counterpoise to Russian communism.

* Maoism has subjected the Chinese people to an alien ideology and has denied them all their traditional life and culture.

* Will the Chinese people now have the wisdom and courage to abandon these moronic aspects of Maoism and reassert their historic values?

* And so, as we hope that the Chinese people will be partners in a peaceful world, we must realise that this will depend largely upon their replacement of Maoism by something bettersomething which retains at least part of the Chinese values and culture in which for so long they have taken such proper pride.

* I have not had the experience that he has had, nor has the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford),  but it is not impossible that one would have that sort of experience because Qantas employs indigenous people in other countries and there is no way in the world that one can make a Japanese or Chinese look and sound like an Australian.

* *English, Arabic, Chinese, Danish,*Dutch,*Finnish, *French,*German, Greek,*Italian, Japanese, Macedonian,*Maltese, Norwegian, Polish,*Portuguese, *Serbo-Croat (Cyrillic),*Serbo-Croat (Latin),*Slovenian, *Spanish,*Swedish, Turkish.

* We have no hostility to the great Chinese people whose history and culture have contributed so much to the achievements of mankind.

* If I were the Chinese looking forward to improving relations with the United States one of the first things I would do would be to offer to purchase substantial quantities of American wheat.

* I defy anyone here, and those who went on that visit, to show that there have ever been any North Vietnamese combat aircraft or any Chinese communist combat aircraft over South Vietnam during the war.

* The Khmer Rouge is a national communist group, and although during the period of fighting the North Vietnamese have had to make their accommodations with the Chinese communists and the Soviet Union, the differences are fundamental.

* Wheat Board to go to China and sit down with the Chinese.

* The Chinese Government has generally in the past made public announcements when its nuclear weapons tests have taken place; and the United States Atomic Energy Commission has released esti mates of the yield of all the tests monitored by them.

* Is Australia obligated to supply wheat to China before other countries in the event of the Chinese requesting it.

* The fact is that the Japanese, the Chinese, the Indians, the Indonesians, are not people that have emigrated to other countries at all.

* On that occasion did he raise the question of China in his talks with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggesting that the United States of America had been late in coming to terms with the Chinese.

* 651) 
The Chinese Army has not fought a real war for decades.

* Chinese Ring-neck Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) 
Was it alleged at the time that the people who lost their lives were members or supporters of the pro-Chinese Communist Party in Indonesia.

* I have noticed in Hansard that a recently deceased member of this House once referred to the Chinese coolies as the greatest race of people on earth.

* 1 ) Did the Department of Foreign Affairs give him or the Foreign Minister a report on how the Press was able to obtain (a) the record of the conversation between the Prime Minister and representatives of the Chinese government in Peking and (b) the cable from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta reporting on the conversation between the Foreign Ministers of Canada and Indonesia.

* It did not come from the Government of the People's Republic, nor did it come from anyone with an official status in the Chinese Government.

* So one interpretation put on it which I have heard was that the Prime Minister said that the Chinese Government had stipulated a condition.

* Let me assure the Government that Australians will remember for a very long time the hysterical attempts in the 1966 election campaign to construe the civil war in Vietnam as part of a Chinese policy of territorial expansionism.

* Another very curious thing about the Minister's statement is that, according to him, the influence of the Chinese no longer seems to be important.

* I use the term 'superpower' because the Japanese, the Chinese and the Americans are all operative in this area, as is the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.

* The Chinese Government co-operates, as I was told by the Hong Kong authorities, in the sense that it provides them with further food, water and petrol and helps them with repairs if they get into trouble.

* These groups of refugees just go along the Chinese coast until they finally reach Hong Kong.

* At Townsville for 24 hours a day sugar is loaded on vessels including Chinese ships.

* I suppose the Chinese seamen are fascinated by the smell of the raw sugar.

* Will the Prime Minister now admit to the House that the Government has received reports of 3 discussions, the first at a meeting between the British Charge d' Affaires in Peking and a director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and the other two at lunches between representatives of the Australian Wheat Board and officers of the China Natural Resources Commission - lunches specifically sought by the Australian Wheat Board to discuss possible wheat sales?

* Does the right honourable gentleman still claim that a director of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade does not speak on behalf of his Government?

* The Chinese Government has agreed to purchase very large quantities of sugar from Australia within the provisions of a long term sugar agreement with Australia.

* I informed the Chinese that because the 1973 crop now being harvested was tightly committed, particularly because of the suspension next year of the economic provisions in the current International Sugar Agreement and also because of the problem of bulk handling facilities in China, it would not be possible for Australia to commence any agreement involving such huge amounts of sugar until 1975.

* The details of the agreement will be the subject of further discussions between the Australian sugar industry and the Chinese National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation and the Governments of China and Australia.

* In effect, this means that the actual details of the agreement will be arrived at in the normal commercial way in which Australia and the Chinese Corporation conduct their international dealings in sugar.

* The decision of the Chinese Government to purchase on a long term basis such large quantities of sugar is a magnificent achievement for Australia.

* This was the myth upon which the Government fought the 1966 election with the concept of the Chinese or communism or whatever it was pouring down over Asia and dropping on to Australia as though on every Sunday morning we could expect to see the Chinese communists or somebody else on Bondi Beach.

* Back in 1970, soon after I came into this Parliament, my attention was drawn to the circumstances surrounding some Chinese deportees who were picked up off the Queensland coast just north of the Mooloolaba pilot station.

* A newspaper report there dealt with the fact that the customs and immigration officials learned of the plot to smuggle the Chinese into Australia and they acted as a result of the information they received.

* Furthermore, because of the meticulous manner, in which the Chinese have honoured their commitments in the purchase of Australian wheat on credit, will the Minister authorise this mission to enter into credit transactions, if required, on much the same terms of payment as have been successfully negotiated by the Australian Wheat Board?

* Finally, in the review and restructuring of the Australian Tariff Board will the Minister give consideration to offering advantages to Chinese exports in return for contracts for the purchase of Australian wool?

* To my mind there seems to be more than ever before an attempt by the present Government to imply that we are identified or associated with the Chinese  vis-a-vis  the Russians.

* The only basis on which I would think it would be reasonable to support China  vis-a-vis  the Soviet Union is that the Chinese appear to be weaker.

* It is important from our point of view that these 2 countries should be kept from confronting one another and that the point should not be reached where, as the Chinese would put it, there would be absolute hegemony on the part of the U.S.S.R. vi'savis China.

* From that point of view I suppose it is reasonable to support the Chinese against the Russians.

* I am depressed when I sometimes see people who are opposed to the Russians go overboard and pretend that the Chinese Government is a much better type of government than the Russian Government, that the Chinese society is a much better type of society than the Russian.

* Hence the right-wing Sinophilia of those who abhor the Chinese system but who see virtue in Chinese power as a counterweight to the Russian, is as flawed as the left-wing Sinophilia of those who see virtue in a society which combines a maximum of unfreedom with a minimum of efficiency.

* I conclude by going back to the Chinese position.

* I do not have the question and answer with me in the House at present, but some time ago I put on the notice paper a question dealing with a supplement produced by the Melbourne  Age  on the exhibition of Chinese art that is touring Australia at present.

* It read like a handout from the Chinese Government.

* He said nothing about any Chinese activities; it was all about American activities.

* Vietnam has been under foreign attack and domination for over  100  years - from the French, the Japanese, the Chinese and the Americans.

* Those who turn their backs on eastern Europe and on the Chinese do so out of sheer ignorance.

* In recent months there has been more effort with the Chinese but, I believe, quite insufficient effort with Europe.

* So the honourable member for Wentworth returned to Canberra for what the Chinese- or should I say the mainland Chinese because we are always careful how we say this, are we notgently call thought rectification.

* I also said that we had carried out investigations both through the British Charge d'Affaires in Peking and other avenues in order to ascertain his whereabouts but that the Communist Chinese resolutely refused to give any information.

* Again he met with exactly the same attitude from the Chinese Communist Government and no information whatsoever could be obtained.

* Honourable members can go and look, as the Minister for External Affairs has done, and say that the important thing is that they are still trying to ensure that Taiwan stays out, or they are still trying to extract guarantees from the Chinese that they will live as a friendly and civilised nation.

* The essential point is that the Government of Malaysia is no longer obstructing the admission of the Chinese into the United Nations and, most importantly, it is moving in the direction of recognising China.

* It looks as though the city might fall', and if the other person said: 'It is the Chinese.

* You cannot trust the Chinese', it would only take one person to hear that and all he would have to do is to report to the commissioner the incident, the time and the public place at which it happened.

* Of course, let it not be forgotten that Gough Whitlam 's sorties into China, with a subsequent real recognition of China as a trading partner, have also given us greater access to the Chinese wheat market.

* Noone could ever accuse South Africans of being guilty of the crimes against humanity of which the Russians or the Communist Chinese have been guilty.

* One must have a short memory indeed if one forgets what Communist China did in Tibet or the suffering that Chinese weapons and supplies have caused the people of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.

* We can see that being offset to some extent by the Chinese relationship with Pakistan.

* It could move gradually towards incorporation within China or alternatively the Taiwanese - as opposed to the Chinese on Taiwan - could assert their independence and say that they have no particular wish 10 become absorbed within China and in fact could work towards becoming an independent nation.

* I ask: Following on the Labor Party's successful delegation to China and the Prime Minister's subsequent announcement that he would seek dialogue with Chinese leaders, is he able to tell the House how far that dialogue has advanced and whether he has sought or received an invitation to visit China?

* Alternatively, would he seek Chinese approval for a joint parliamentary delegation to visit China during the next recess in order to prove beyond doubt his Government's genuine desire to establish full diplomatic recognition in the near future?

* Let us face the fact that both Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists claim Tibet.

* Both Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists claim some of the disputed border territories.

* But Chiang Kai-shek has denounced the Chinese Communists for ceding territory to Burma.

* We had a lecture, a discussion, on one occasion from a diplomat from the country concerned, who told us of the great numbers of Chinese troops in the north of Laos who periodically despoiled villages to get supplies - and they were not Chinese Communist troops; they were the troops of Chiang Kai-shek who maraud and depredate in the north of Laos and also in the north of Burma today.

* The Soviet Union will work with you to prevent the Chinese thrust south'.

* The Soviet Union's objection to China was that China was raising the question of the 600,000 square miles of Chinese territory annexed by the czars after 1858 and was raising the kind of ideological issues which are a potential dissolvent of the Soviet Union, whether Georgians, Ukranians or others would continue or wish to continue to be subordinate to the White Russians in what is a vast colonial empire of the Soviet Union.

* De Gaulle realised that if the Soviet Union could get rid of this Chinese distraction nothing would stop her from occupying with the greatest of ease Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania - all Communist countries.

* But De Gaulle realised that at worst the Chinese distraction could be a factor in .war against a successful Russian thrust right through to the Channel Ports and at best in normal times stop the enormous increase in Russian pressure power on Europe if she occupied the other Communist countries.

* Without the Chinese distraction what has Russia got?

* even begin to assess Chinese policy, and the ridiculous debates in this House because the Government can get the preferences of the Democratic Labor Party by yak-yak-yak about Red China are a disgrace to this Parliament and would be unacceptable in a high school.

* In a notorious article in the  Australian International News Review  of 17 July 1965 the present Prime Minister blamed President Truman for the Vietnam war on the ground that he had prevented General MacArthur from attacking the Chinese mainland.

* The Liberals have always needed a foreign threat- Chinese hordes, Indonesian hordes, Vietnamese hordes and, now, Russian hordes.

* So as some accommodation has been reached with the USSR it can also be achieved with China, but it will be harder and will take longer because the Chinese see themselves, for historical and other reasons, as the centre of the world.

* The present Chinese leadership represents a more orthodox MarxistLeninist leadership.

* During that visit to China Ivor Greenwood and I, together with other members of the delegation, had many serious lengthy discussions with the leaders of the Chinese people.

* He was a credit to Australia and was loved by the Chinese.

* Did he take the opportunity at the meeting to make clear that he disapproved of Chinese testing of nuclear devices in the atmosphere, and to suggest that the French tests were more reprehensible than the Chinese tests.

* If so, is the attitude of the Government based on the premise that the French tests are more reprehensible than the Chinese tests (a) to the world and (b) to Australia.

* Many honourable members opposite thought that  Mr Fraser  would not wish to talk to the Chinese, that he was some form of terrible conservative wearing blinkers who would move away from that relationship.

* Now the Chinese are, of course,  Mr Fraser  's very good friends.

* With the Soviet Union spreading its influence in Asia, Chinese intervention was inevitable.

* The Chinese intervention in Vietnam aimed at showing to the Soviet that China would not sit idly by while her interests were put in jeopardy.

* Does the Prime Minister see the presence of some 67 divisions of Chinese and Soviet forces on either side of the SinoSoviet border as being probably as volatile a threat to world peace as the situation in the Middle East?

* When I visited China recently with a parliamentary delegation I had some discussion with the Chinese public health officials.

* The source of information did not come from within China, but it came to an official of the British Consulate-General in Hong Kong* from allegedly Chinese sources.

* The third point I want to make is that in this matter we are relying not on direct evidence from the Chinese Government itself but on third hand and fourth hand evidence.

* Canberra lacks the aura of the Forbidden City - or even Queanbeyan - although no doubt many Government supporters will say that the Ming Dynasty gives Australia a great link with our future Chinese allies.

* At the end of the day a refreshed Prime Minister could challenge all comers to a game of ping-pong - undoubtedly the 'in' Chinese game at the moment and much safer for him at this stage in view of his present erratic squash form.

* Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his protest note on the nuclear tests, he said that the protest to China was oral so there would be no written response?

* program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia's Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,'  lodged a protest note with the Chinese Assistant Minister?

* In January long-standing resentments, particularly over the undue influence of foreign capitalists and local Chinese entrepreneurs, over alleged corruption in the Army-run government, over conspicuous consumption and privilege among the affluent few, and over the lack of education and opportunity for the many, erupted in largescale riots in Djakarta.

* He also should be aware that the official Foreign Office spokesman told the daily Press briefing in London last Friday that on the day before the British counsellor in Peking had met Chinese officials and had 'discussed all aspects of the Vietnam situation, including the Geneva Conference, with the Chinese.'

* In view of the Minister's previous representations to the -Peking Government when he was Leader of the Opposition, will he ask the new Australian ambassador in Peking to raise at the earliest opportunity the question of Chinese nuclear tests?

* Finally, will he ask the Chinese Government at least to allow foreign experts to check on safety precautions in relation to its tests which, admittedly, are performed inside its own territory?

* Does the Minister know that the former Ambassador has repeatedly stated- a statement with which I agree- that an awareness of the Chinese view of the world is essential to any process of conducting negotiations with or seeking to understand China?

* And what a paradise it proved to be on the Communist's own documentation, because this man soon emerged - not as the benign Uncle Ho, the father of the Vietnamese revolution, but as the hard line MaoistMarxist - to impose on the North the kind of conditions that he had seen taking place in the Chinese revolution.

* I believe it is not entirely irrelevant that we find it difficult perhaps to decipher how much of Chinese policies would be founded in China's past and often tragic history, and how much of it would be founded in some imperial Communist ideology.

* Has his attention been drawn to the statement by  Mr Liao  Cheng-chin, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, made in Peking on 28 February 1978, that the United States of America should sever its diplomatic and military links with the Republic of China.

* Has the Australian Government pursued relations with the Republic of China in a manner completely acceptable to the Chinese Peoples' Republic.

* If not, what actions concerning diplomatic relations with the Republic of China has the Australian Government pursued which are not completely and totally acceptable to the Chinese Peoples' Republic.

* Has the Australian Government since 1973 discussed with the Government of the Chinese Peoples' Republic any softening of its rigid attitude towards the Republic of China; if so, when did these discussions take place.

* Can action be taken in this respect so as to demonstrate that Australia 's foreign policy is its own and not that required by the Chinese Peoples ' Republic.

* This man sits on when he has just heard, in one unambiguous sentence - and I will not quote it all - the epitome of what Chou, Mao and Lin Piao and other Chinese Communists have been spelling out at length for decades, namely, that they, China, not the United States, Japan or anyone else, are going to dominate the East, including Korea, Taiwan, IndoChina, Thailand and the Philippines.

* The friendly Chinese forces will move in to assist their Communist comrades in those countries to expel the United States aggressors or, if they are not in evidence, their running dogs and imperialist lackeys - that is, all the non-Communists.

* Does he recall the way the Taiwan issue came into being: How Britain, Labour Britain, trying desperately to establish normal relations with China, opted 21 years ago to support Peking in the matter and how the British Labour Party and its Ministers were insulted and rejected by the Chinese Communists?

* Similarly the United Slates Government will not provide military aid lo Chinese forces on Formosa.

* To show how fully he is now in accord with Chinese Communist thinking, the Leader of the Opposition takes up the dialogue.

* Has he never heard of the Chinese road through Laos to Thailand, for example, guarded when I was there last year by 5,000 front-line Chinese troops with surfacetoair missiles?

* What of the Chinese volunteers in North Korea and Chinese support for the terrorist movement in Malaya?

* Fancy the peoples of the United Arab Republic not understanding that the Maoist guerillas, trying to oust their governments by the use of murder and terror, are just good Chinese social workers!

* Fancy the African leaders, who have seen the fruits of the huge Chinese embassies in their countries in blood, rape and fratricide, not understanding that this was just rendering assistance.

* Perhaps the Chinese soldiers inside Laos were only playing and that Souvanna Phouma did not really understand his people's true interests.

* He left China trumpeting about Chinese honesty and reliability which he declared to be a watchword.

* He said among other things: 
One finds in Chinese publicity continual examples of statements designed to create hatred of America which are simply untrue.

* As for Chinese-British Labour Government relations, surely the Leader of the Opposition remembers the calculated insults which the Chinese gave to Ministers and Parliament alike when they visited England in 1950.

* He speaks of United States aggression and says nothing of Chinese aggression.

* He even stated to the Chinese: 
To praise Chinese genocide in Tibet as the elimination of feudalism, to attend peace congresses in China, to see wall pictures advocating hate of the outside world, and to come home and hold up China as the paragon of peace, as some members of the Party have done, extends this form of blindness a degree further.

* The Chinese Charge made perfectly proper representations, and in the light of the situation brought about by the honourable gentleman publicising the real character of the intended visitor the visa, which had not up to that stage been sought, was not granted.

* Has he noted President Nixon's statement last Sunday that the United States of America acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain that there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China?

* The Department has put out a booklet giving them full advice on how to make contact with Chinese agencies.

* My Department keeps in close contact with the Chinese marketing agencies in Hong Kong so that there is an exchange of information to enable trade to take place on normal conditions.

* In general terms, the effect of the Chinese nuclear tests is only one-tenth as great in Australia as the effect of the French nuclear tests at Mururoa.

* However, I emphasise that it is not only the question of degree which makes the French tests more actionable than the Chinese tests.

* A little while ago my attitude to French nuclear tests was compared to that towards the Chinese and the Russians.

* In recent years I have written two or three letters to the Chinese Foreign Minister and two or three letters to the Russian Foreign Minister protesting against and arguing against the conduct of those nations in nuclear testing.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Did the Chinese Premier, Chou En-lai, tell him that the United States of America should not withdraw its forces hurriedly from South East Asia and the Western Pacific?

* Did the Chinese leader say that Washington would bear a heavy responsibility for the consequences of rapid disengagement from the area in the encouragement of Russian extension of influence?

* The present Prime Minister drew attention to such a communication on 6 April 1971  (Hansard,page  1462) when asking the then Prime Minister to confirm that the Chinese Government had indicated that it would not buy further supplies of Australian wheat because of a statement made by a Minister of the former Australian Government, which China considered to be hostile.

* The then Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Member for Lowe, confirmed that his Government had received a report that a Chinese official had indicated to a British representative that China would not place any further wheat orders with Australia because of the attitude of the then Australian Government to China.

* It was reported in the Press only a few days ago that one of the Minister's latest initiatives was his offering of the Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia to the Chinese for $20m.

* A report stated that the Minister made the offer to high Chinese officials while he was in Peking to open the recent trade exhibition.

* The Chinese have clearly shown themselves to be as completely pragmatic as ever, and  Mr McMahon  should meet them in the same realistic spirit.

* (2), (3) and (3) Australia on 21 December 1972 recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China.

* This was accepted by the Chinese Government and remains the position of the Australian Government.

* The honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  was good enough to use a picturesque phrase a few moments ago and talk about my playing footsie with the Chinese etc.

* I have always opposed Chinese communism just as much as I have opposed Russian communism.

* According to the Government, the Mao communists, the Chinese communists, are OK, they are number one, but the bad ones are those Soviet communists.

* I also remind the House of the uncompromising speech by the Chinese delegate to the United Nations on his first appearance at that forum earlier this month.

* We have no hostility to the great Chinese people who have contributed so much to the culture and history of mankind and we favour an accommodation with them.

* Responsibility for arranging the Chinese Government sponsored training program in Australia rests with the Australian Development Assistance Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* These channels will be used as the requirements of the program emerge and the Chinese Government provides details of the fields in which it wants its students to study.

* Is it also a fact that the computer complex forms an essential part of the American early warning system and is a link to a satellite that monitors Chinese radio communications, as reported by John Shaw in the Los Angeles  Times  on 12 December 1978.

* I do not believe that either the Chinese or Soviet Government will become directly involved in the conflict .

* There is some indication that the Chinese are starting to behave a little more satisfactorily.

* The honourable member for Prospect said: 
The Institute should be looking at how settlement first started, at what happened to the original communities- Anglo-Saxons, the Irish, the Chinese who came in and the South Sea islanders who are totally ignored.

* They are still Irish-Australians; they are still Scots; they are still Chinese.

* The Chinese people have lost not only their  Chairman  and their Premier Chou En-lai, but also their great military leader, Chu Teh.

* The Chinese Communist Party was almost wiped out in the Long March of 1934-36 but these men won sufficient support within their country to be able to take over the government of the country in 1949 and be the first government in history to unify China and have the support of all the Chinese people.

* Following the Minister's advice to the House yesterday that he discussed with the Chinese authorities last week ways of co-operation between Australia and Chinese authorities to assist China 's agricultural development, can the Minister now provide any more specific information as to how this cooperation might be achieved?

* I preface it by reminding honourable members that yesterday the Prime Minister told this House that he had made strong protests in China about Chinese nuclear atmospheric testing.

* Did the Prime Minister receive any assurances from the Chinese about their future behaviour?

* We were among the first countries to predict the Chinese invasion of Vietnam.

* Does the Chinese Government tell us, or the Chinese people, what they are doing at Lop Nor?

* The naval exercise PX51 did not therefore utilise waters claimed by the Chinese to be Chinese waters.

* Now, because of the situation in Iran and the Chinese invasion of Vietnam there seems to have been another shift in the Government's position with respect to spending.

* I ) &amp; (2) The final content of the Chinese antiquities exhibition to Australia is still being negotiated.

* The Chinese authorities reserve the right to decide what material is exhibited abroad, but every effort is being made to ensure that the exhibition to come to Australia will be of comparable importance and quality to those seen elsewhere.

* Its best uses would be for spectacle theatre (Australian Ballet, State Dance Company of Victoria, Russian Georgian Dancers, Slansk Polish Dance Troupe, Chinese Acrobats, Rock Operas like Hair and Superstar, etc., Traditional Opera, Pop Concerts, the Melbourne Film Festival - 
I noticed certain newspaper reports over the weekend and this morning concerning Australia's intake of refugees.

* That is well and good, but why is there no pother about the Chinese nuclear  tests?

* lt has been said that the Communist Chinese are not really parties to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and they cannot be brought before the International Court of Justice, which they have not acknowledged.

* It is extraordinary that when the Chinese are doing these things the Government is falling head over heels to establish diplomatic relations with them, but when France is doing them we threaten to break off diplomatic relations with that country.

* It is obvious that the Chinese owner of the Oceanic Grandeur' is not the least bit interested.

* I refer to two of my constitutents who are Chinese, a  Mr Sui  Kei Samson Man and his wife Yuen Ling Rositta Chan.

* This unfortunate couple, now illegally in Australia, have been reduced to the state of being poor and penniless as a result of what I consider to be exploitation by a Chinese solicitor in Sydney who has, if I may use the Australian vernacular, ripped off this unfortunate Chinese couple of about $ 10,000.

* The Chinese solicitor is  Mr W.  J. Lee of Selborne Chambers, 13th floor, 1 74 Phillip Street, Sydney.

* He sought payments in cash, and I have photostat copies of a receipt for payment of $1,000 in cash by this couple and another receipt in Chinese for $6,500 paid by my constituents to the Chinese solicitor.

* How can the Chinese solicitor contact them when they have no telephone and he does not know where they are living?

* The Chinese couple were not anxious for me to raise the matter in Parliament because they fear that the solicitor may organise some injury to them.

* The serious part of the whole matter, which I emphasise that I am most reluctant to believe, is that when this large sum of money was obtained by this Chinese solicitor for the reasons that I have stated he said, in the  words  of my constituents: 'I only get about $1,000 out of this.

* They have been exploited by this Chinese solicitor in Sydney who, I believe at this stage, is unscrupulous.

* My constituents tell me that before they entered the office of the Chinese solicitor another Chinaman was going in with $7,000 in cash to pay the solicitor for some litigation.

* In this case the Chinese authorities did not take up the Prime Minister's offer of help.

* I am frankly of the belief that no amount of American military assistance in Indo-China can conquer an enemy which is everywhere and st the same time nowhere - an enemy of the people which has the sympathy and covert support of the people ... for the United Stales to intervene unilaterally and to send troops on to the most difficult terrain in the world, with the Chinese able to pour in unlimited manpower, would mean that we would face a situation which would bc far more difficult than even that encountered in Korea, lt would seem to me that it would be a hopeless situation.

* Can we and the Australian nation ignore reports of mass executions including 2,000 at Lamaknan; 27 women both Chinese and Timorese on the wharf at Dili; 59 men on that same wharf in front of a crowd of 500 which was ordered to count; the murders at the Catholic Church of San Antonio in Dili; the execution of Chinese community leaders in the shop Toko Lay; the murder of a group of Timorese who dared to display an Australian flag from the third floor of a Dili building; the mass murders in the Taibesse area; the slaughter of 500 Chinese at Villaverde; reports of looting of Catholic churches; rounding up truckloads of young girls who were then subjected to mass rape; the desecration of the grave of Father Martins in Maliana; and last but not least, the vile and brutal murder on Thursday 16 October 1975 of five Australian newsmen, three of them shot in cold blood by an officer whose real name or war name was Lieutenant Markos.

* It could have been a Chinese gambling game as far as he was concerned.

* So here we have the honourable member for Kennedy arguing an alliance between the Government and what he called  atheistic communists ' of the Chinese brand.

* Secondly, Communist China requires the acceptance of the sovereignty of mainland China over the 14 million free Chinese in Taiwan.

* The recognition by Canada may be a great victory for the Chinese Communists, but the fact that Canada has seen fit to take note - I think this was th?

* wording - of Communist China's claim to sovereignty over Taiwan despite the wishes of the people of that country and simultaneously to break off diplomatic relations with the free Chinese Government of Taiwan shows, I believe, the Canadian Governlent of  Mr Pierre  Trudeau to be one of expediency rather than one of principle.

* I do not see how we can possibly compete with Chinese industry on the matters that have been quoted here today.

* There are all sorts of factors in the Chinese system which make this impossible.

* There is a Chinese oriented, horrendously repressive regime in Cambodia that is engaging in mass slaughter.

* On 27 April, the Chinese put forward eight proposals of their own, which in turn have been rejected by the Vietnamese.

* The nature of the Chinese proposals indicates that Peking is linking any improvement in its relations with Vietnam with the Vietnamese military presence in Kampuchea, and more indirectly with Vietnam's treaty relationship with the Soviet Union.

* If I may coin a phrase, it's time for the Government to come down to earth and get its feet on to the ground, and by the ground I mean Australian ground and not Chinese ground.

* Can we see the Chinese Premier giving a Press briefing on what goes on at Lop Nor?

* He was with me only about two months ago at the opening of a Chinese restaurant in the St George electorate and he was enjoying himself immensely.

* He told me how he had always tried to relate to the Chinese community in his own area and he was supporting me in the opening of the restaurant.

* He did not say a word to me about why he was enjoying himself on the dance floor, introducing everybody and mixing with all the Chinese people.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Has radioactive fall-out from Chinese nuclear tests been registered in Australia?

* In order to justify his statement which I have just quoted, will he inform the House of the relevant percentages of total radioactive fall-out registered in Australia attributable to Chinese and French nuclear tests?

* The details are said to be available in China, but the only real guidance one can get is from broadcasts from Peking and from people who are Chinese experts.

* By 1965, it had become clear that the greatly expanding North Vietnamese military presence in South Vietnam and the arming of the Vietcong with Chinese and Soviet manufactured weapons had increased pressure upon the South Vietnamese Government to critical proportions.

* Is it a fact that the Captain of the MVCapeMoretonon passage from Darwin to Thursday Island received word from Canberra to investigate Chinese fishing vessels, and that on encountering these vessels, the Captain was ableonly to ask them to pick up their nets and head home.

* Chinese have a glut of this type they do not want our varieties.

* Therefore the Chinese look to the United States and to Canada.

* Even last year when the present Opposition Parties were in Government the Australian Wheat Board came to an arrangement with the Chinese to sell, from memory, some 70 million bushels of wheat.

* I pointed out in answering my colleague's question that the basis for the signing of the agreement for the sale of wheat was obtained by discussion between myself and the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade.

* The willingness of the Chinese Government to sign a long term agreement for the first time was secured in that discussion between myself and the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade - and nobody else.

* So whilst I. cannot comment on the exact phraseology used by the Chinese Communists 1 can at least say that none of them approves of the principles of democracy.

* -There has been no interference by the Chinese.

* There has never been a Chinese person discovered anywhere in Vietnam.

* I think it is important that we recognise the importance of teaching Japanese, Chinese and Indonesian/Malay.

* One of the arguments that they put forward is: Why should we discourage a Chinese doctor who can speak English coming to Australia from Hong Kong while we accept a peasant from Southern Italy?

* These people are making value judgments in the same way as those who oppose the immigration of Chinese are making value judgments.

* I would be quite happy to go to China to tell the Chinese the same thing.

* I have been to France to tell the French and I am quite happy to tell the honourable member who has interjected and his Government to keep their hands off nuclear weapons too, just as I would be prepared to tell the Chinese.

* The Publication 'Immigration Categories and Procedures' is available only in English at this stage: but my Department is arranging the printing of the information in a special leaflet, entitled 'Migrant Entry to Australia', in the following languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, Danish.

* China has not specifically rejected it but there have been press reports to the effect that Chinese leaders have rejected the idea of an international conference on Kampuchea outside the United Nations context.

* Furthermore, in view of the Government's efforts to increase trade with mainland China and the loss of the wheat sales due to nonrecognition of China, does the Minister consider that requests may also be made for increased Chinese migration as the basis on which that country will conduct negotiations?

* The Chinese made statements in reply that their relations with foreign communist parties would not be allowed to impinge on government to government relationships.

* We recognise as a fact that the Chinese Government has historical links with some of the insurgency movements of South East Asia.

* We do not approve of these links, but we recognise that for the Chinese Government they involve various accumulated obligations, commitments and political investments.

* We also recognise that whether party-to-party relations impinge on state-to-state relations is not a matter which the Chinese leaders alone can decide: the views of other states on this matter may differ from their own.

* Nevertheless, taking all this into account, the impression we were given, both by the particular statement made and by the general concern expressed about stability, was that the Chinese leaders will be concerned to conduct party-to-party relations in ways which will not damage the efforts to develop good relations with the countries of the region; that a clear priority is given to the latter.

* The Vietnamese were not prepared to meet the Chinese in such talks.

* They are refusing to negotiate until, in their own terms, Chinese forces are withdrawn from Vietnamese territory.

* Chinese forces are thought to be occupying small areas of disputed territory, and the Chinese claim that the Vietnamese are committing armed provocations and incursions along the border.

* The Chinese are building, without the approval of the Laotian Government, a highway leading from Yunnan Province down to a place called Pak Beng close to the Mekong River.

* The road is being built by Chinese and is being manned by Chinese military personnel.

* The reasons for this are not clear, but it is thought either that it is needed because the Chinese wish to support the Communist insurgents in north-east Thailand, or probably in the long run they wish to establish their political hegemony over those parts of Thailand.

* We heard today, for example, of the glories of Chinese acupuncture.

* That is an old art; it is not something the Chinese communists have produced.

* It is being peddled in Australia as some kind of evidence of the glories of Chinese communism.

* If it be worth anything it is due to the glories of the system which the Chinese communists supplanted.

* Communist China has troops and engineers in Tanzania ostensibly to build a railway line, and Chinese Commuist subversion, terror, investment and influence in Zambia, Uganda, the Congo and Guinea are a continuing threat to any hopes of African democracy.

* Whilst in Rhodesia I held in my hands a Chinese mortar and other weapons captured from the terrorists, which were exactly the same as those I had seen and held in my hands in Vietnam which had been captured from the North Vietnamese.

* It states that the Chinese have very few fighter aircraft, that they are very short of high octane fuel, that they have a vintage type Soviet submarine and that they have shallow draught naval craft, but that they have one of the strongest armies in the world, armed with small scale- 
I certainly say it is not important in the eyes of the United States nor are the things that the Opposition, when it was in government, regarded as important by the United States.

* When  Senator Robert  Kennedy came out in a move of United States policy which sought to buy Sukarno out of the Chinese communist orbit by handing over to him West Irian, what the former government for at least 15 years when I sat in Opposition said was that a crucial Australian interest had been thrown to the winds.

* He was taunted at the time by the Chinese as a coward but instead of risking a nuclear war with the United States he was prepared to withdraw.

* However, everyone to whom I have spoken believes that this attack can be contained and that ali the North Vietnamese will get out of it will be heavy casualties and loss of most of their Chinese and Russian equipment.

* We must talk to the Chinese, as our diplomats have done on the instructions of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon).

* The Communist Chinese, or mainland Chinese as we call them today, as much as the Americans, as much as ourselves, as much as the Taiwanese regime, want reality.

* This could be either through armed force or through some sort of peaceful merger, but there is not a shadow of a doubt that Communist Chinese policy is to liberate Taiwan, and we have lived long enough with wars of national liberation to know what they mean.

* The fatal flaw, the inhuman flaw - even, I would argue, the tragic flaw - in the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is that it says to the mainland Chinese: 'Go ahead.

* He is saying to the Communist Chinese 'Go ahead'.

* Because mainland China and the present nationalist Chinese rulers will not budge from their claim over Taiwan - what one might call their legalistic claims - this is no ground for Australia to give away other people's basic rights by selling them to the strongest bidder, without even a fight.

* I was a candidate at that election, one of the people who had to try to explain that the Chinese not only were not coming to Australia but also were militarily incapable of doing so.

* But the most interesting example is this: If one rings up another doctor one gets a Chinese restaurant and his patients are becoming concerned.

* This is becoming something of a health problem because in Earlwood it appears nowadays that if one wants a doctor one will get either a Chinese restaurant or somebody's mum.

* I suppose that, when we look back and realise that the split was about bringing troops back from Asia, banning bombs and recognising China, symbolically we could say today that the great luncheon for the Chinese delegation was Leslie Haylen 's vindication.

* It was called  Chinese Journey.

* If we just kill a few more million Chinese we can win this war'.

* We have almost daily discussions with the Chinese Government.

* If it were good enough for the United States to fire missiles at Soviet and Chinese cities, probably those countries would retaliate.

* We should be taking the jingoistic attitude out of this fear complex about having to watch the Chinese and where do we draw the.

* One could also argue that President Suharto in his present situation might believe that an independent East Timor could lead to future dangers and future Russian or Chinese bases.

* I would like to think that in the future when we look at matters of self-interest, we do not simply say that if East Timor becomes independent it may do a deal with the Russians or with the Chinese and therefore we must support the Indonesians in their invasion with 12 000 troops.

* Why was the Leader of the Opposition denigrated in performance by the Chinese leadership?

* I venture to say that what happened was that the Chinese discovered that they were not dealing with a serious man.

* It is only in recent months that Chinese interest in Australia has been renewed, and it has been reciprocated.

* If one goes to Peking one will be shown shelters and be told by the Chinese that rocketry is aimed at Peking and that the shelters are to protect them from nuclear fallout.

* The Chinese see this and they see a threat of their being surrounded, not merely from the land border of Asia but from the south.

* The Chinese are fearful of being surrounded.

* The Chinese have done this, the Soviet has done this down through South-East Asia and, if that competition builds up, there will be a destabilised area.

* The Chinese have no sea power or airborne sea power but they have plenty of ground power.

* Therefore, if the Chinese are to match this Soviet naval presence it can do so only on the ground.

* We see welcomes being given to our erstwhile enemy the Vietcong, and to the Chinese and yet if anyone is the least bit centre of the road or right wing, such as the Taiwanese, the Rhodesians, the South Africans and the Portuguese, they are unacceptable.

* There has been the abuse of the French and the wel coming of the Chinese and the Vietcong and the abuse of Lee Kuan Yew and  Mr Heath.

* Members opposite, want to turn the clock back to the 1966 election when their election propaganda had the communist Chinese dripping blood down over Asia and onto Australia.

* The Labor Party does not support aggression whether it be from the North Vietnamese, the South Vietnamese, the Americans, the Chinese or the Russians.

* As always in such situations, the 'them' was the Chinese rather than the Vietnamese.

* I do not believe that it is possible to draw any clear moral distinction between Vietnamese and Chinese actions.

* What we objected to was the precipitate way in which Australia prostrated itself to the Chinese and pleaded for recognition on any terms.

* Australian Government has called for a withdrawal of Chinese and Vietnamese forces, as I said before.

* During our visit to China, the delegation had discussions with representatives of the Chinese Government, including one meeting with the Chinese VicePremier,  Mr Li  Hsien-nien.

* In this discussion I raised with the Chinese Vice-Premier the question of Chinese nuclear testing because, as all honourable members and people in Australia know, the Australian Government is strongly opposed to nuclear testing by any nation, and particularly to atmospheric testing.

* The Chinese Vice-Premier's reply was that the Chinese are prepared to discon tinue their nuclear testing but only in the context of all nations, including the United States of America and the Soviet Union, dismantling their own nuclear arsenals.

* Personally, I cannot agree with this point of view of the Chinese Government, and neither does the Australian Government.

* If this argument were to be used to justify the Chinese developing their own nuclear weapons, then the same argument could be used for every other country doing the same.

* The overwhelming impression given to our parliamentary delegation in China, as far as the foreign policy of the Chinese is concerned, was that their great fear is of the Soviet Union.

* The Chinese maintain that the Russians are bent on a policy of territorial expansion.

* The Chinese also claim that the Soviet Union has maintained and does maintain one million troops on the Sino-Soviet border to enforce its claims on what it believes is Chinese territory.

* Moreover, the Chinese say that their suggestions for a mutual withdrawal of troops from either side of the disputed border have been rejected.

* I repeat that I am not saying whether the Chinese point of view is justified or not.

* To the Chinese, this is not a balance of deterrent forces but a gross imbalance.

* Obviously, that is why the Chinese feel apprehensive about the situation.

* Up until now they have spoken to the Russian leaders, as in the Nixon-Brezhnev summit meeting, and this makes the Chinese suspicious.

* When the Americans speak to the 
Chinese, the Russians become suspicious.

* I am, of course, a Sinophile in the sense that I am a friend of the Chinese people but I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition meant something else.

* I am, I hope, a friend of the Chinese people although I am not prepared as are some other members of this House to go crawling to the Chinese communists.

* It was only when the Labor Party raised as a political issue in this House, only when the Labor Party moved a motion in this House which turned wheat into a political issue - and the honourable gentleman who asked the question was in this - that for the first time the Chinese decided to assign a political reason for the non-purchase of wheat from Australia.

* This is what has made wheat a political issue, and as long as the honourable gentleman continues in this House to make it a political issue the Chinese will treat it as such.

* We had the Minister for Primary Industry come into this House this afternoon and say that there is a deep plot to help the communist Chinese.

* I am only sorry that this whole mess occurred in the way that it did, with the attempt by the Government to shift the responsibility on to the ACTU and to blame the communist Chinese - again I quote the Minister.

* Even the 800 million Chinese are not entitled to have their vote obstruct the wishes of the rest of the 4,000 million of this planet.

* Is it a fact that China, without consulting Laos, has constructed an allweather road across the north of that country leading to the borders of Thailand, and is that road guarded by thousands of front line Chinese troops with the most modern weapons?

* In those days the Menzies Government uttered the fearful cry 'the Chinese are corning!

* But now the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  rubs his hands with glee and- says, 'the Chinese are coming, hurrah, hurrah', and it is a completely different situation.

* I think that we need to understand the Chinese fear at this stage.

* The Chinese position is similar in some ways perhaps to the state of mind that existed in the USSR at the beginning of the Cold War period.

* When we both visited the Peking Construction Tool Plant, I was amazed to be taken down to see underground shelters and to be told that throughout the Chinese People's Republic every major building has its own air raid shelter.

* That is, the Chinese thought that the USSR would not make a pre-emptive strike using atomic weapons.

* -The Government is very much aware of the importance of the Chinese market.

* The Chinese market, of course, has been a very important market for Australian wheat for many years, but a demand is now developing for minerals, other types of grains, manufactured goods and technology.

* -The Chinese invasion of Vietnam is now in its second tragic week.

* As the United States attempts to woo the present Chinese leadership for big markets for the big corporations, it is a most audacious act on the part of the United States to send its ambassador to China at a critical time when the Chinese have invaded the people in Vietnam.

* Last week, five days after the Chinese invasion of Vietnam, at a time of a serious threat of a global nuclear war, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made a superficial statement on general instability in the region.

* Today, 10 days after the Chinese invasion of Vietnam, when the possibility of international escalation of the war is heightening, the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  has made another empty statement.

* Let us remember that the Chinese people fought in a similar struggle to seek their independence.

* There were external provocations by the Chinese to exploit the internal difficulties and to encourage the ethnic Chinese to leave.

* At that time 160,000 Hua people, who are Vietnamese people of Chinese descent, migrated north to China.

* I was told during my visit to Vietnam in July 1978 that the Chinese were encouraging a heightening of the conflict with Vietnam.

* The Vietnamese should get out of Kampuchea and the Chinese should get out of Vietnam.

* But it is of no use to confuse Vietnamese involvement in Kampuchea with the Chinese involvement in Vietnam.

* The Minister for Foreign Affairs almost excuses the Chinese invasion of Vietnam as part of its containment strategy against the Soviet Union.

* The news media had to obtain the information from Chinese news broadcasts.

* There is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese Government has made certain that Australia will become a satellite communist country much the same as Czechoslovakia is to the Soviet Union, much the same as Poland is to the 
The Communist Chinese told us on 25th January that we had to remove our officials from Taiwan, and this we did in an obsequious way.

* The Peking Chinese realised that we would start 'the new Australia' on 26th January 1973 as a satellite to their country.

* The Communist Chinese said to our Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that he had to write to the  President  of the United States of America condemning him and the American people for their involvement in the war in Vietnam.

* Is it any wonder that  Mr Byrne,  the Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation, Minister for Tourism and Minister for Immigration, said: 'If I can get 500 Chinese under contract to come to Australia I will get them.'

* In general discussions with Chinese leaders I emphasised that apart from Australia's natural resources we have technologies and equipment which are well suited to China's needs.

* The response which I received in all my discussions with Chinese leaders and officials was, I think, extremely encouraging and has significantly enhanced Australia's trade prospects with that country.

* Racial tensions between the Indo Chinese peoples have prevented effective cooperation against the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

* If the honourable member had been present in this House during the various debates when Australia was placed at the bottom of the list as regards wheat sales to China and when it was made quite clear following the Canadian recognition of China that we would continue to be placed at that level, he would realise the truth of the content of what I se id and that it was the action and the disastrous foreign policies of the previous Government that caused the Chinese Government to take this action.

* Whilst there we had extensive discussions with the Chinese authorities on sugar soles to China.

* Our attitude to the movement of Australian citizens and, for that matter, Chinese citizens to and from Australia has, I think, already been made clear by me in a statement made to the National Press Club one day last week.

* Already the Leader of the Opposition has decided that this Party would make application to the Chinese Premier,  Mr Chou  En-lai, for a visa to allow one of the members of his Party to go to Peking in order to find out why continental China - the People's Republic of China - is not purchasing Australian wheat.

* At that time, the Chinese were in the fray.

* One was given to understand that the Chinese were pouring down from the north, but nobody found the Chinese anywhere.

* But the Federation steadfastly turned its back on the geographic advantage of Western Australia in respect of its proximity to major markets, particularly China, lt is common knowledge that the Chinese would load most of their ships at Western Australian ports if the Wheat Board would permit them to do so.

* There are always spec iiic clauses included in every contract made with the Chinese which limit their Western Australian loadings to a fraction of what the Chinese desire.

* If the criteria for a right to stay in the wheat industry is simply to be who can produce a bushel of wheat at the lowest cost, then let us go straight out for collective farms on the Russian pattern or communes on the Chinese pattern or huge state farms and be done once and for all with this hypocrisy of pretence for the rights of the common man.

* -Various Chinese Ministers and officials in discussions I have had with them referred to Australia's highly developed agriculture and to the way in which we have developed our pastoral regions.

* I mentioned to the Chinese what the South Australian and Western Australian Governments have done in setting up pilot farms in places like Algeria and Libya where we have been able to apply our technology and use Australian made equipment.

* His achievement was remarkable by any standard and in paying our respect to his memory, we also wish to express our sympathy to the Chinese Government and people at the loss of their outstanding leader.

* The fact that we do not share the same political or philosophical views does not mean that we do not understand the sense of loss which the Chinese people must feel or that we do not recognise and acknowledge the tremendous influence which Chairman Mao had on his nation and his place in history.

* The histrionics of the Prime Minister, the way in which he rolled his Foreign Minister in that Minister's absence, and the hostility and sabre rattling of his criticism of Vietnam are in contrast to the back seat approach which he took in responding to the Chinese punitive intrusion.

* But the antagonism and aggression of the Prime Minister's reaction in the case of the Vietnamese invasion is quite apparently at odds with his virtual indifference, in diplomatic terms, towards the Chinese invasion.

* It is ironic that Leslie Haylen died the day before the visit to this country of the Chinese delegation from the National People's Congress.

* Whereas Chou was preeminently the skilled administrator and interpreter of China to the world, Mao was the inspiration to the Chinese people themselves.

* Under Mao's leadership, and largely because of that leadership, the Chinese people found the purpose and summoned the strength for a prodigious effort of revolutionary struggle.

* No man has so embodied the aspirations of a great people and given in equal measure practical and spiritual impetus to a revolutionary movement as did Mao Tse-tung during his long and remarkable life- 50 years as a leader of the Chinese people, 40 years as head of the Chinese Communist Party, and 27 years as leader of the Chinese State.

* His  courage, his sagacity, his gifts as a writer and interpreter of Chinese philosophy and civilisation, and his extraordinary stature as national leader have ensured that his influence will outlast his death; that the Chinese people, far from discovering a vacuum in their national life, will take renewed inspiration from the memory of his great achievements.

* On behalf of my colleagues and the Australian Labor Party, I extend to the Chinese people and Government our sympathy in the loss they have sustained.

* Clearly Russia is now attempting to increase her influence, probably for a mixture of motives, perhaps to check Chinese infiltration or open up trade opportunities.

* It is extremely interesting and important to note that in most, if not all, cases the rejection or deterioration of the Chinese position was attributed to undue interference in domestic political affairs.

* When I listened to broadcasts which are made continually from southern China promoting insurgency I wonder whether the  Age  and other journals are aware of the fact that the activities of the Communist Party in China  visavis  Communist parties in other parts of the world are distinct from attitudes between the Chinese Government and other governments.

* At the same time Chinese Communists are in the process of constructing a first-class military road from the Chinese border through Laos to the border of Thailand.

* Meanwhile the strategic road which the Chinese military are constructing in Northern Laos creeps steadily nearer to the Thai  border.

* 1 ) How many persons of Chinese origin were resident in Australia at the census of (a) 1966(b) 1971 and (c) 1976.

* Are any figures available of the number of Chinese persons resident in the electoral division of St George or the St George general area.

* While on that point, I might also add that this great boasting about what America did during the conflict in the south west Pacific area fails to pay regard to the British soldier and to the Chinese who kept millions of Japanese forces employed so that these forces could not be deployed to this region or to the islands to our north during the Second World War.

* In effect, I asked the Prime Minister why he had sent a message of congratulation to Hua Kuo-feng, the  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

* The handout from the Prime Minister's office for the Press on 27 October 1976 reads as follows: 
Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, 
If the honourable gentleman had been listening at all to the statements that I have made during the course of the last few weeks he would  know that I have been extremely careful to state that what we are doing is protecting the interests of 144 million Taiwan Chinese people in the United Nations.

* Communist governments, including the Chinese government, frequently recognise and receive royal heads of state.

* Presumably the implication is that the Chinese decision to sign a 3-year wheat agreement was brought about only by the election of a Labor Government in December 1972.

* This is absolute rubbish, because the Chinese over the years have purchased Australian wheat when the price has been right and when the quality of our wheat has been to their liking.

* In carrying the argument a little further, it follows from what the Minister implied that those governments that have similar philosophies to those of the Chinese Communist Government have the best chance for trade with Australia.

* However, the Chinese are more pragmatic than that.

* The Minister for Overseas Trade may be interested to know that the British Government and the Chinese Government are on the verge of concluding a massive industrial agreement.

* With the approval of the British Government, the Rolls Royce Co. in England is preparing to conclude an agreement with the Chinese Government involving the sale of about 800 Spey jet engines and the licence rights for the Chinese to manufacture this engine.

* It is also a futile exercise for the Minister to try to discredit the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  by quoting Chinese Ministers and their views.

* The only ones who could accurately say what the views of the Chinese Government are in this matter are the Chinese leaders themselves, and I would certainly not rely on the interpretation of the Minister for Overseas Trade to establish the facts.

* The Australian Government advised the ROK that it was willing to speak to some of the DPRK's traditional friends on this matter (the Prime Minister had already spoken to the Chinese Premier, in October 1973) but at the same time made it clear that our negotiation of diplomatic relations with the DPRK would not be contingent upon the outcome, since Australia was not prepared to give those countries what would have amounted to a veto over its Korean policies.

* In October 1973 the Prime Minister spoke to the Chinese Premier of Australia's hope that the associates of each Korean Government could have relations with both Korean Governments.

* Has the Government information on the reported intention of the People's Republic of China to explode nuclear devices in the atmosphere shortly, either on the Chinese mainland or elsewhere.

* Over the last 4 years South Australia has had 95 teachers qualified in Indonesian and Malayan; Western Australia has had only 1 but it has had 3 qualified in Japanese; Tasmania has had only 1; and Victoria has had 10 qualified in Japanese and 3 in Chinese.

* The Chinese refer to these as 'buy back' rather than barter deals.

* The Chinese party would of course insist on handling the sale of the product within China.

* As the Chinese Ambassador was able to tell me, every time we have a disarmament conference we seem to have more armaments following the conference.

* We talked with the Chinese trade people.

* Unfortunately the quality of oil which the Chinese have in great quantities is such that our refineries would have to spend billions of dollars to take out wax and other impurities.

* But he did not give the ground which the veteran Chinese Premier clearly most hoped for, a denunciation or even a backdown on the ANZUS treaty or an expression of hostility towards Japan.

* Of course, we know the propaganda which was put out showing an Australian soldier drawing a rickshaw and a Chinese man with an Australian girl.

* In the event of the People's Republic of China being admitted to the UN, I take it that the Nationalist Chinese Government on Taiwan will be expelled.

* I would bc one of the first people to recognise the dogma of the Chinese Government in Peking.

* The Chinese said that they had already defeated the paper tiger - the United States of America - in Korea and they could take the territory of Taiwan if they wanted to.

* He is a man of stature in the Chinese Government.

* If I may say so, I think it is a false fear, although the conflict in Vietnam has probably led the Chinese to think that they should fear the United States.

* He has previously praised the Chinese system of morality.

* One would hope that this might lead towards a further introduction of the Chinese nation into the gatherings of the world.

* The Government of China has governed more in the interests of the Chinese since 1949 than governments in China have governed in the interests of those people for several centuries past.

* Specifically, we would be concerned if Chinese or Soviet influence in the area extended to control of the water areas or significant parts of the littoral.

* Therefore, there appears to be no requirement at this time for us to feel impelled to control, or even decisively influence any part of the Indian Ocean or its littoral, given the nature of our interests there and the current level of Soviet and Chinese involvement.

* We now have a great change in the attitude of the Chinese, yet Mao Tse-tung, the man who says that diplomacy comes from the barrel of a gun, has not retracted those words.

* Fretilin has been supported by the Chinese communists.

* She understands full well that the Chinese are not welcome in Indonesia and they never will be.

* Everybody on this side of the House will remember publications of the Department of External Affairs, as it then was, which suggested that Chinese troops were actually involved.

* One afternoon in this House the late Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Harold Holt, suddenly admitted that the Chinese were not involved.

* So all the commentaries over recent years about Chinese involvement in Vietnam and about America really opposing China in Vietnam, not a minor communist power, like so many other things in American policy, will be disposed of in a 180 degrees turn in foreign policy.

* In more recent times we heard from the ex-Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, the idea of a communist Chinese thrusting down between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

* For the very first time in the protracted hostilities in Vietnam the Chinese Government had endorsed the proposal made by Hanoi.

* The first time they had ever done it- 
The Chinese, that is - the clearest indication that the proposal was a substantial and genuine one, one which would be seen through, that the people sponsoring it would in fact see it through, they would back it.

* In China he conceded every single point the Chinese made to him, and he did so in public.

* More will be said about China in the foreign affairs debate this session, but let me say just this: I believe his visit compromised discussions which the Australian Wheat Board was just about to begin with the Chinese when he announced his intention to go to China.

* An old Chinese proverb states that time is like a crack in the ground under a speeding horse.

* Its best uses would be for spectacle theatre (Australian Ballet, State Dance Company of Victoria, Russian Georgian Dancers, Slansk Polish Dance Troupe, Chinese Acrobats, Rock Operas like Hair and Superstar, etc., Traditional Opera, Pop Concerts, the Melbourne Film Festival and individual artists like Barry Humphries and Frank Sinatra).

* Is the honourable member saying that they are threatened by the Chinese?

* So this man of great military distinction puts in the area a squadron or so of the Royal Australian Air Force and a battalion or so of Australian soldiers to stop the Chinese.

* Apart from agreeing that Taiwan and its population of 14-odd million people live in just another Chinese province, the man aspiring to be Prime Minister of Australia gave away in advance during the great kowtow every bargaining counter that Australia would have had in future negotiations with China.

* It has polarised Chinese official opinion to support of the Australian Labor Party and not the Australian Government.

* The Chinese entertained some American sportsmen and journalists.

* Nice words were said by the Chinese Prime Minister, Chou En-lai, about future relations between the two countries.

* According to slogans displayed at the Canton Trade Fair the official attitude remains that the Americans are aggressors and in the Chinese phraseology 'running dogs'.

* In the week before the first American visit to China the Chinese Press was full of what it saw as the victory in Laos of North Vietnam over the Saigon Government.

* This emphasises the almost euphoric nature of the reception given by the United States to Chinese gestures of friendship.

* This change in attitude could be interpreted as an appeal by the Chinese over the heads of the American  President  and his Government to the war-weary majority in the United States.

* In Chinese terms the United States is an Imperialist country; the Soviet Union is Social Imperialist.

* There will always be pinpricking, such as the 24th Congress resolution which decisively rejected the 'slanderous inventions' of Chinese propaganda on the policy of the Russian Communist Party and the Soviet state.

* The United States is pulling out rapidly in Vietnam and this is apparent to the Chinese Government, which has referred to the vicious scheme of Vietnamisation.

* At the same time there has been no falling off in the level of Russian and Chinese help to North Vietnam.

* If we in the complacent West do not recognise this fact, at least the Chinese do and have been saying so for years.

* It is the Chinese navy that has been upgraded and trebled in size over the last 10 years.

* It is the Chinese who are paying very serious attention to defence.

* It is the Chinese who are extremely fearful of Soviet involvement as Russia continuously increases its naval capacity in the Indian Ocean.

* It is the Chinese who, in early 1975, approached Australia and suggested that this country should consider assisting in the containment of Soviet expansion in the Indian Ocean.

* I would remind honourable members that to this day there are still no Communist Chinese combat forces in Vietnam.

* It has always disturbed me that we have been ever ready to credit the Communist Chinese with masterminding everything from minor riots to major coups.

* We have built for the Communist Chinese a reputation which their own ineptitude in diplomatic affairs and their nonexistent conventional strike capacity could never hope to do.

* Give him a Chinese flag and he will stand up and chant  The East is Red  with no problems at all.

* Today I asked the Prime Minister about the Chinese protest note.

* I also asked the Prime Minister about the effect of nuclear fallout from Chinese atomic tests in the atmosphere.

* Even then he sought to obfuscate the truth by giving the impression that the effect of the Chinese nuclear fallout in Australia was one-sixth of that provided by fallout from French tests.

* He does not recollect -or more likely prefers to forget- the spectacular thud of the sortie of his Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  into Sino-Australian relations in China a little over 8 months ago when the Prime Minister proposed a 4-power alliance, including clumsily aligning himself with the Chinese on a fairly sensitive issue which the Japanese were trying to handle delicately; questioned the future security of Malaysia and Singapore; raised doubts about the stability of the Indonesian Government; and challenged India's sincerity in its concern for world peace.

* Reports of mass, indiscriminate killings have now come to Australia from Fretilin, which alleged that the Indonesians were 'massacring' the population and from Chinese sources, including from Taiwan, which claimed that the Chinese minority in East Timor bore the brunt of much of the indiscriminate killing in the territory from Timor Democratic Union- UDT- refugees in Portugal, many of whom claim actually to have witnessed atrocities of a disturbing kind.

* The Opposition's new found interest in recognition presumably derives from the publicity that has lately been given to the Chinese invitations to Australian and American table tennis' teams, and recent, moves by the United States.

* For their part, the Chinese authorities also seem to be making the important distinction, to which the Prime Minister referred on Tuesday, between the steps they have taken and the question of inter-state .

* Our long-term policy must therefore be to 'seek a normalisation of bilateral relations with the Government of the 750 million people on the Chinese mainland.

* It is true that the Chinese leaders have lately been showing signs of greater interest in the development, of understanding between peoples and  in regularising their relations with certain Western and.

* But in other areas, including neighbouring countries, the Chinese leaders are continuing their support for armed revolution and insurgency, and this support is material as weir as ideological.

* We feel no animosity towards the Chinese people.

* Dr FitzGerald  quoted how, in my conversation with  Mr Chi  Peng-fei, 1 had in particular discussed 3 matters on which there were basic disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Australian Labor Party.

* The first,  Dr FitzGerald  mentioned, was Vietnam on which the ALP, while sympathising with the Chinese position on withdrawal of foreign troops, strongly supports a negotiated settlement or a peace conference if either would bring an immediate halt to the carnage and produce a settlement acceptable to the Vietnamese people.

* I have protested against Chinese nuclear tests.

* The balance of power shifted dramatically towards the Soviet Union, and we now have the Chinese stating openly that Vietnam is the Cuba of Asia.

* The Chinese view bears very careful consideration.

* They have tried to expel or get rid of the ethnic Chinese from their country.

* I say this knowing that it is a very wonderful exhibition of what the Chinese people and the Chinese culture are capable of being.

* These people, well-meaning as they are, will come back from China giving us the version of things there which the Chinese communist authorities want to put over to us- a version which is a lie.

* Board by the Chinese and was arranged by the China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation.

* The Wool Board mission visited several Chinese woollen and cotton mills.

* It explained to the Chinese the efforts of the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat to promote greater use of wool and that as part of these efforts, technical advice was given to wool textile industries in wool-consuming countries to help them modernise their wool textile manufacturing techniques and to apply new processes.

* 1 believe also- thai it the figure he gave was correct and the Chinese are spending about $US200m a year in assisting those countries around her, this amount pales into insignificance when compared with the $US2,500m a day which the Americans have been pouring into Vietnam in weapons and men as a result of its rejection of an election to enable the people of Vietnam to chose their own government.

* He has been ever ready to credit the Communist Chinese with masterminding everything from minor riots to major coups, and he has built for the Communist Chinese a reputation which their own ineptitude in diplomatic affairs and their non-existent conventional strike capacity could never hope to achieve.

* But we also have rights and these are particularly important when the United States is indulging in brinkmanship in Indo-China which could lead to Chinese intervention or he possibility of the use of nuclear weapons.

* We saw not so long ago an attack by the Chinese upon India.

* There was an attack by the Chinese and a takeover, if I can use that expression, of Tibet.

* The Chinese Communists influenced many of the African countries but I believe that by our action in Vietnam, by our showing that we were prepared to take certain actions and make a certain stand we gave these nations the ability to stand firm and not follow a course that would have led to their destruction.

* When we are talking about the change of policy in relation to Communist China, while I do not oppose talking to the Chinese I would remind the House and the people of Australia that the late Neville Chamberlain went over to talk to Hitler but it did not make much difference.

* After that recognition I saw a complete change of attitude in the Chinese towards the United Kingdom.

* The UK had done what China wanted and the Communist Chinese literally ignored the UK and insulted that country.

* If you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  were to visit China, as a group from the Opposition side did, and tell the Chinese that you know that they will not buy your wheat unless you recognise them would this not put into their hands the very weapon with which to destroy the economic and financial situation of Australia in this sphere?

* I know that the Chinese Government is similarly impressed with the recommendations which were made.

* I expect also that the Chinese Vice-Minister for Agricultural Machinery will visit Australia this month.

* I am particularly pleased to see the Chinese Vice-Minister coming to Australia so that he might get some idea of the vastness of our farming operations and how we handle them with our type of equipment.

* We have no representatives in Peking but we have asked the British authorities to do the maximum in their capacity to try to find out whether he is under supervision or what the Chinese authorities are doing with him.

* The British have advised us that the Chinese are particularly careful about giving any kind of information at all.

* But I regret to inform him and the House that it is highly improbable that the Communist Chinese will give us any information whatsoever.

* The Chinese nuclear armoury is already substantial enough to be taken into account by both of the super powers.

* As to the intentions of the Chinese Government there are as many predictions as there are experts.

* But Chinese military capability is a factor which cannot be ignored in considering Australian security.

* That their policy to support Communism in South East Asia is, in part, an attempt to offset Chinese influence and hegemony is of no consolation.

* Events in Laos - the Communists have shamelessly ignored the 1962 Geneva Agreements - and the road being built right to the Thailand border in Laos bv Chinese are ominous indeed.

* No consideration has been given to the aggressive acts of North Vietnamese troops, Russian and Chinese assistance or treaty obligations.

* Not very long ago, the representatives of this Government in seeking reelection published large red maps with arrows pointing downwards, suggesting that the Chinese would invade Australia.

* Well, the only reason why people of such intellectual incapacity bellieve that the Chinese will come down for the next election is this: They look at a map hanging on a wall and, because China is above Australia on that map, they think that the Chinese must come down to Australia.

* Republic of China: Chinese bilateral assistance in 1970 was $US1, 171,040 and was primarily in the fields of agriculture (vegetable seeds, vaccines, water pumps, sprayers and other equipment); power (study or construction of a number of electric power projects); public works (including the continuation of the dredging project in the 
Is the Government now satisfied that the modest additional contribution referred to by  Sir Robert  Menzies has been successful in defeating the Communist Chinese.

* Are the Communist Chinese, who were named as the real aggressors, now ready to sue for peace.

* The Chinese get kicked around at times, but at least they are going through their universities to see what they can cut out.

* Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his protest note on the nuclear tests, he said that the protest to China was oral so there would be no written response?

* program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia's Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,  lodged a protest note with the Chinese Assistant Minister?

* As Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs he should have been aware that the Ambassador to China whom he appointed had stated in a radio interview that a protest note had been lodged with the Chinese Assistant Minister.

* He asked whether the Australian Government had made a protest to the Chinese Government about that country's nuclear atmospheric testing, whether there had been a protest and whether it had been verbal or written.

* Senator Willesee  replied that a protest had been lodged and that it had taken the form of a letter from the Foreign Minister to the Chinese Foreign Minister.

* Our complaints about the French Government's attitude apply equally strongly to the Chinese Government, and there should be no distinction between our attitude to those 2 countries.

* Mrt SNEDDEN  -  I find it extraordinary that when I speak in terms of the same attitude towards the French atmospheric tests as to the Chinese atmospheric tests Government supporters seem to disagree.

* They seem to think there is a different standard for the Chinese tests.

* We must be reminded of the words of the Chinese Premier, Chou En Lai, when he was farewelling the Prime Minister over a year ago.

* There has been silence from the Government on the offer by the Chinese, revealed by supporters of the present Government, to cancel a $$60m wheat deal if it would help the Labor Party to gain power.

* How far are the Chinese prepared to involve themselves in Australian politics or to make Australia's great industries a pawn in international politics?

* I had clearly indicated that I did not feel the Chinese would like a visit by the then Minister for the Army and I clearly indicated that I did not like it either.

* Now let me come back to what I did say in the House and whether- 1 can be accused - I believe wrongly accused - of saying that it was the Chinese who imposed any conditions.

* The Chinese did not specifically impose any conditions but they said it was to be a private visit.

* But let me go further to show why I did not incriminate in any way the Chinese Government.

* It did not come from the Government of the People's Republic, nor did it come from anyone with an official status in the Chinese Government.

* So I completely absolve the Chinese Government from any responsibility for the decision itself.

* He wants to know from the Minister for Immigration how many people of Chinese origin are in the electoral division of St George.

* He is trying to ascertain how many Chinese votes he can get, now that the Greek community has been prosecuted for fraud.

* But it turns out to mean 'a Chinese figure of a deity or an idol'.

* I can assure the House and the Leader of the Opposition that 1 do not regard  Mr Hawke  as a Chinese figure of a deity or an idol.

* With the export prices for Chinese rice now noticeably lower and the increasing selfsufficiency in rice production amongst its Asian clients, this source of revenue for the Chinese could be greatly affected.

* Does that communique state that Australia recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China and acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People 's Republic of China.

* If, when in Peking, the Leader of the Opposition had asked Chou En-lai what was one of the greatest lessons learnt by the Chinese people this century, no doubt he would have pointed to the Japanese invasion of a then militarily weak country and the need for preparedness against the unforeseen.

* A number of other officers are undertaking Chinese language tuition both on full time and on a part time basis.

* In addition, Nigeria has now announced that it recognises 'the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government representing the entire Chinese people'.

* The first aspect is the chauvinistic nationalism which often leads to racism and opposition to other countries, not on the basis of their policies but on the basis that they are Americans or Indonesians or Japanese or Russians or Chinese or Arabs or Israelis.

* The forthcoming exhibition of Chinese art was arranged by the Australia Council on the initiative of my Government.

* An exhibition of Chinese crafts toured Australia last year.

* Church who had just been released by the Communist Chinese.

* And the reason for this silence about Russia's role is plain: The war in Vietnam could never have been sold to the Australian people or to the American people except on the basis that it was essentially a Chinese war.

* I have already pointed out the crucial reason behind our original commitment of troops to Vietnam - the false rationale that it was really a Chinese war.

* It seems to be an exaggeration for Dulles to say that the Communist Chinese are 'mighty close' to open aggression.

* The majority of Australian people believe that before Australia becomes involved in Indo-China the whole matter should be thrashed out not between the American and the French on one hand and the Viet Minh and Chinese People's Republic on the other, but by the United Nations.

* The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of China.

* It reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves.

* The Chinese Government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.

* The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government.

* The Canadian Government does not consider it appropriate either to endorse or to challenge the Chinese Government's position on the status of Taiwan.

* The Italian side took note in the joint communique of the statement of the Chinese Gov ernment about the status of Taiwan and understands the importance that the Peking Government attaches to its statement.

* When the  President  of the United States concedes that there must be, in the words of the communique, 'a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves' does anyone doubt that this is a concession that the question will ultimately be settled in favour of Peking?

* You cannot have a Chinese ambassador in Canberra if you have a Taiwanese ambassador and the Taiwanese will not allow that ambassador to remain if you have an ambassador in Peking and wish to have a Chinese ambassador in Canberra.

* I was also disgusted that he asked the Chinese people not to play 'God Save the Queen'.

* I am sure the Chinese would hold loyalty to one's own country, which includes its flag and anthem, above petty personal feelings.

* The Government did not accept the Communist Chinese position on entry to the United Nations, lt did not accept the Nationalist Chinese position on membership of the United Nations.

* Is it independence for the Leader of the Opposition to talk in terms of Communist Chinese solutions to problems when we are talking in terms of our own solutions to these problems?

* Two great events in particular - the withdrawal from Vietnam and the admission of the Chinese Communists to the United Nations - have induced some woolly euphoria and isolationism in Australia.

* In keeping with these declarations (Cairo and Potsdam), Formosa was surrendered to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and for the past four years, the United States and other Allied Powers have accepted the exercise of Chinese authority over the island.

* Shortly afterwards in an effort to dispel any doubts on Chinese title to the island, the United States Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, said: 
However, with the outbreak of the Korean war in June 1950, the American policy became militarily well denned but legally ambiguous.

* To defend the United States against a Chinese Communist accusation on these lines, in a statement before the Security Council on 25th August 1950 the American representative in the United Nations, Ernest Gross, reversed his country's policy.

* The Chinese Government was asked by the Allies to take the surrender of the Japanese forces on the island.

* That is the reason the Chinese are there now.

* People outside China are wrong to distinguish between Chinese and Taiwanese.

* When I was in China I expressed to the Chinese Government the view that, as we saw the situation, permission ought to be given for Miss Susan Day to marry the Chinese to whom she wished to be engaged.

* I understand that subsequently she made an application to take out Chinese citizenship.

* I am not aware of any response having been received from the Chinese authorities.

* He was given regal treatment at the beginning of the meeting in the Chinese Embassy, but was shown politely out the back door when we had nothing additional to offer.

* The Chinese are fearful of the Soviet Union.

* The Soviet Union detests the Chinese.

* The Soviets think that the Chinese are funny little yellow people crawling about like mice.

* Let it become true in the minds of the people that, as the Chinese have said and as I say with great reluctance, the United States has become a paper tiger.

* He said: 
Can he say how many commando raids have been launched from Nationalist Chinese held territory against the Chinese mainland since January 1969.

* Has the Government protested to the authorities in Taipei about their military operations against the Chinese mainland.

* The Chinese may be Maoists.

* It is true, as the honourable gentleman says, that the Red Chinese Government and the Canadian Government have decided to recognise one another.

* It states: 
The Chinese Government re-affirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Territory of the People's Republic of China.

* The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government.

* Will he also provide the Taxation Office with a list of the names of the Chinese nationals resident in Hong Kong on whose behalf  Mr Lee  made representations to his Department but which were not successful.

* The assertion was that Chinese forces were involved in Vietnam.

* There came the day when I heard Harold Holt deny as he stood in this Parliament that there had ever been any Chinese troops in Vietnam.

* There is an additional story in Malaysia, of course, and that is that the Malays never supported Chen Peng's Chinese communists.

* As for the thesis of Chinese primary interest in this, China would be totally undisturbed if we sent one million men from Australia back into 
Vietnam.

* The Chinese were totally undisturbed.

* I have heard the Chinese diplomats at a number of conferences in Europe.

* If the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  had given a description of Russia, he would almost have given it in identical terms to those used by the Chinese delegates.

* But when this is projected into a wider scale and alleged to be a basic and fundamental interest of Australia and that we should be involved, I do hot know in what respect we are to be involved; if it is by humanitarian action it is not clear to me what humanitarian action the Opposition is advocating; and if by military action, it is not clear to me what the Opposition is advocating; and if by representations to the communist governments, it is not clear to me why the Chinese Government would regard itself as particularly involved- it is an accusation in point of fact that the Chinese are ordering what is taking place in neighbouring countries.

* I am of the view that he is not suited to hold the first appointment as  Chairman  of the AustraliaChina Foundation, for five reasons, not the least important of which is that he has come desperately close in his own views not only to saying that Australians should understand the Chinese view of the world but also that Australia should support the Chinese view of the world.

* The most notable statement whereby he comes close to supporting the Chinese view of the world as his own view is found at page 18 of his book  China and the World.

* It is interesting that he writes: 
But it is interesting that the Chinese direct their criticism at both Super Powers, whose societies we tend to regard as political opposites, and in both cases their argument is about the record of external behaviour- and is not without foundation.

* We wish to live in friendship with the Chinese, but to say that there is not going to be subversion or any threat of trouble in South East Asia is absolute rubbish.

* Will he now give me an assuurance that neither he nor any member of his staff unofficially gave the media information that  Dr S.  Fitzgerald was to be appointed by him as Australia's Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, when he officially stated he could not announce the name of the Ambassador until the Chinese Government had agreed; if not, why not.

* Did the information reach the press by way of (a) unofficial advice by himself, (b) unofficial advice by a member of his staff, (c)  Dr Fitzgerald  or (d) the Chinese Government.

* But can he say that Communist China's influence is less now than it was in 1965 when we sent our forces or in 1954 because now, at a time when United States  prestige throughout Asia is at its lowest ebb, Communist Chinese prestige is at its highest?

* Chinese people, including the people of the Province of Taiwan; and lastly, Australia is collaborating with the United States of America to create  2  Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan and is, therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of  China 
On my return to Australia the first statement I made was that the door to trade with China was open.

* This was open hostility to the Chinese Government.

* Who will forget the occasion in 1967 when the Australian Government handed a note to the Austraiian Wheat Board delegation in Hong Kong to give to the Chinese Government stating that the wheat contract for 1967 could be terminated unless the Chinese Government interfered to stop the Hong Kong riots.

* I said: 
As regards the restoration of the wheat trade with China, the facts are that while in China I did everything possible to persuade Chinese authorities to alter their wheat policy as it presently discriminates against the Australian unheal grower and to resume wheat purchases from the Australian Wheat Board.

* Contrary to the Deputy Prime Minister's crude attempt to blame me personally for the loss of last month's wheat sale, if the Chinese Government does decide to resume wheat purchases from Australia in the near future it will do so because of the explanations and pleas which we - 
The thought that the honourable member for Dawson could be selling our products on the world's markets is a terrifying thought to me.

* The Chinese are famous for being inscrutable and for playing their cards close to their chest.

* The honourable member for Dawson told the Chinese he spoke for the Australian Labor Party.

* Is it any wonder the Chinese have expressed a desire that the Labor Party should govern in Australia?

* If the  honourable member for Dawson were heading the negotiations the Chinese would get wheat from us at half price.

* We are importing from China a third of the value of commodities the Chinese buy from us.

* Unfortunately I have not been supported to any great extent by the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  whose position with respect to Chinese atmospheric nuclear testing has been ambivalent in the extreme.

* Firstly, he put to us the extraordinary position that because China was in the northern hemisphere and the winds went one way in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the southern hemisphere the Chinese testing did not have any influence on Australia.

* Then on 8 May he put forward the extraordinary position that there had been an oral protest to the Chinese Government about their tests.

* In a written answer to a question on the Senate notice paper he said that in fact the protest note had been a written protest note which had been handed to the Chinese Foreign Minister.

* There is also a growing contribution of these materials from Chinese weapon testing.

* Let us look at one other aspect of the Government's position; that is, its position in relation to the Chinese.

* The total amount of nuclear products injected into the atmosphere by the Chinese tests was 12.6 megatons.

* Taking again the Academy's figures of one-sixth, we would get an injection into the southern hemisphere from the Chinese tests of 2.1 megatons.

* So rather than the very low figures that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has sought to portray the Chinese as having contributed, in fact the Chinese tests contributed more like one-quarter of the nuclear fallout on Australia of the French total.

* There is very little doubt that the Chinese contributed closer to one-quarter as much of the nuclear fallout as did the French.

* So under any measurement, there is a very real case for Australia being consistent in its opposition to atmospheric nuclear testing and, if we are going to the extreme of taking the French to the World Court, we should certainly place a much stronger protest with the Chinese than the one which was firstly described as an oral protest to which, therefore, we would receive no reply and which secondly was seen to be a written protest and to which still we do not know whether we are to receive any reply.

* The position of the Chinese test site means that fallout from the Chinese tests goes across the most highly populated portion of the earth's surface.

* Therefore, the fallout from the Chinese tests affects literally thousands of times more people than do the French tests carried out on their site in the southern hemisphere.

* If we are to be consistent - if this Prime Minister is to have any credibility in the eyes not only of Australians but also of the world - then he must protest to the Chinese as well as to the French.

* In fact, we have protested to the Chinese Government against its failure to accede to this treaty.

* T believed the statements - and some of the stuff came from the Department of External Affairs - which indicated that China was really involved in Vietnam, until, staggeringly, at a later stage in history we had the late Prime Minister,  Mr Harold  Holt, saying in this House, after the Government had been twitted and twitted about the level of government trade with China, that the Chinese were not involved in the war in South Vietnam.

* That is why 300,000 Chinese were murdered in cold blood and that is why, in West Irian today, without any tremor from us, large numbers of people are being consistently chopped down.

* I do not believe that over the Gulf of Tonkin, which was the casus belli for bombing North Vietnam, or over such questions as the presence of Chinese, the Government wilfully misinformed the country.

* Yesterday we had an assurance that the Chinese had achieved their purpose and we are being asked to believe that they are planning to return behind their own borders, having duly reprimanded the robber Vietnamese.

* Perhaps the present Administration in Washington and the about-to-retire Government in Great Britain will consider this simple fact when they are negotiating and concluding their sales to the Chinese Government of major military equipment of an offensive as opposed to a defensive capability.

* We talk of the invasion of Kampuchea by the Vietnamese and the invasion of Vietnam by the Chinese, and we express horror.

* Unfortunately, the technicalities of the Treaty are such that without some explanation the terms of the Treaty which are annexed to the Bill convey about as much information to an ordinary reader as a Chinese laundry ticket.

* Nor, I believe, can we condone the Chinese invasion of Vietnam.

* One would imagine that if a direct request were made and the Soviet Union attacked China in any force, the Chinese would neutralise their southern flank with a much, much heavier blow being directed at Vietnam than at present.

* Anything could happen unless all parties withdraw their troops, unless there is a ceasefire as soon as possible, unless the Vietnamese withdraw from Kampuchea and the Chinese withdraw from Vietnam.

* Maybe it fears the Chinese so much that it believes that it must do this.

* Mao Tse-tung,  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, died on 9 September.

* He led the Chinese Communist Party through a long and destructive civil war and in his writings set out a new conception of what China could be.

* Mao Tse-tung devoted his life to the vision of a rigorously egalitarian society, and, in pursuit of that vision, he mobilised the vast energies of the Chinese people.

* The loss of Mao Tse-tung will be deeply mourned by the Chinese people.

* I am sure this House would wish to place on record its sympathy for the Chinese people in their loss.

* What is obvious is that Prince Sihanouk has joined forces with Communist regimes and hopes to form a dissident government in exile in Chinese territory.

* United States of America in the Bay of Pigs episode and its intervention in the civil wars in Vietnam and Chile; Nazi Germany's aggression in World War II, its endeavours to create a fascist world and its involvement in the Spanish civil war with its fascist ally, Italy; Japan's bombardment of Pearl Harbour; Australia's involvement with the United States in the conscription of its youth to the Vietnam war; Indonesia's march into Timor- and now the Chinese invasion of Vietnam.

* Now we have the Chinese invading Vietnam's territory again.

* The 'Montoro' has Australian officers and engineers and Chinese cooks, stewards and fitters.

* In 1968 it changed from a Singapore Chinese crew to a New Guinea crew and on 4th November 1969 changed to a 
Solomon Island crew.

* This same ship employs a mixture of Solomon Islanders and  Singapore  Chinese cooks, stewards and fitters.

* I will give a comparison between the rates and conditions provided for New Guinea seamen, Solomon Islanders, Chinese and the rest of them and Australian seamen.

* We object to Chinese crews from Singapore and Hong Kong being employed on this New Guinea-Australia trade.

* The remainder are mostly Chinese or 'mestico' Chinese, many of whom appear to have bought their way out.

* 1  enemy alongside the United States in the minds of the Chinese.

* in the 1960s there was serious trouble between India and China, India nevertheless has maintained the view consistently that it should continue diplomatic relations with the Chinese and should continue to press for the granting of legitimate rights to the People's Republic of China.

* On 20th November 1970 the Indian representative on the United Nations said: 
Planning is well advanced on a Chinese antiquities exhibition which is expected to come to Australia early in 1 977.

* In fact, the latest development is for the Chinese Government to encourage Taiwanese people to visit China in certain circumstances.

* The first nuclear bomb test by USSR in 1949, was unexpected, the North Korean attack across the 38th parallel, in June 19S0 was a surprise, as was the later Chinese communist intervention; and the Bay of Pigs expedition by the CIA against Cuba in 1961 was an intelligence failure, in both senses of the word.

* We all remember the rather facetious and witty remark of the right honourable member for Melbourne when he found it necessary to refuse entry to a certain Chinese gentleman named  Mr Wong,  that 'two Wongs don't make a White'.

* I have a lifelong friend whose father was Chinese and whose mother was Australian.

* I had lunch at the Chinese Embassy today and the Ambassador outlined his country's policy in this regard.

* Are we not involved in Vietnam, according to the Government, to stop the Chinese who are pressing down through the Asian countries steadfastly to Australia?

* Knowing of the anxiety of farmers in the United States of America to enter the China trade and of the hostility of the Chinese to this Australian proposal, what consideration was given by Cabinet to the interests of the Australian exporters?

* The fact is that the effects of the Chinese bomb on Australia will be very much greater than the effects of the French tests.

* But, with respect to the Chinese tests, which have done very much worse both to Australia and to the world, we have had only formal protests.

* The Government has not sponsored any ban on Chinese shipping.

* I know that the Prime Minister has said that the Chinese are not signatories to the relevant United Nations documents and that therefore we cannot bring them before the International Court of Justice.

* But where are the protests about the Chinese not being signatories?

* The Chinese have refused to come to court.

* -Is the Minister for Trade and Resources aware that the Seamen's Union of Australia, in support of one side of the ideological war in Vietnam, has placed bans on Chinese ships which load iron ore at the ports of Dampier and Port Hedland in Western Australia?

* On the positive side the editorial marks the first time in seven years that the Chinese have noted this anniversary.

* If there were any quotations by any Chinese leaders which would justify that allegation he would have quoted them.

* We should realise that Singapore, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma - all of them - vote against us on these Chinese issues.

* It can then resume its share of Chinese wheat purchases, but still more, it can play a proper role in having peaceful relations in the Pacific.

* The Russians are coming, the Chinese and the Vietcong are coming and all the rest.

* First, that there is no restriction whatsoever on the movement of Australian people to China; provided only that they can get a visa from the Chinese and provided that security considerations are not involved.

* On 28th July, the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  reaffirmed our position, saying that we have no hostility to the great 
Chinese people whose history and culture have contributed much to the achievements of mankind, and that we look forward to the day when we would be able to recognise the People's Republic with honour and without deserting old friends.

* Indeed, a major criticism of the excursion of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to China lies in the way in which he conceded in advance everything to the Chinese, leaving his country with no negotiating elements at all.

* It is true that the Chinese have bought no wheat from Australia this year and that they have said they will continue to consider Canada first as a source of wheat as import needs arise.

* The Vietnamese are expelling the Chinese middle class- a lot of their entrepreneurs and merchants.

* It is time, in fact past time, that we looked calmly and objectively at what we have come to regard as the Communist Chinese threat.

* We have been propagandised into believing that hordes of Communist Chinese will turn up on Bondi Beach next Sunday.

* But the Communist Chinese have no monopoly on aggressive intent.

* The Chinese Navy has no battleships, no cruisers, no aircraft carriers.

* The makeup of the Chinese Air Force is defensive in character with emphasis on fighter interceptors.

* The United States has produced remarkable evidence at this stage to indicate the corruption and the extortion of the Kuomintang Chinese in Formosa.

* Lest anybody be in any doubt as to where Indonesia is standing on the question of the Indo-China conflict, I say that one can be quite certain that it is not supporting the Chinese.

* When buildings and villages inside Chinese territories were shot, blown up, damaged and destroyed, as has been demonstrated clearly by television films and remains uncontradicted by the Vietnamese, what was China to do?

* An article by Rodney Tasker in the  Far Eastern Economic Review  of 1 5 December 1 978 reads: 
The withdrawal of Chinese aid and assistance was a heavy blow to their economy.

* And if you project it against the background of long-standing struggle against the Chinese, then you have the explanation for the (Moscow-Hanoi) treaty.

* I note from the Laurie Oakes report of today that the Minister was rebuffed in the Chinese negotiations when he found, much to his surprise, that the prices which had been negotiated by the Japanese had also become the benchmark for negotiations with China.

* Not only has that price washed off upon the rest of the Australian iron ore contracts, but on the Chinese contracts also.

* Of course he could not, because the Chinese were not going to pay for equivalent grades of iron ore any more than the Japanese were prepared to pay.

* It was not only last year that the Wheat Board has been in contact with the agency which in fact negotiates contracts for the sale of wheat to the Chinese.

* The Board has been in constant and continuing discussion with the officials of the Chinese Government, and there is a very close commercial relationship between them.

* At the moment wheat is in short demand throughout the world and anybody who thinks that the sale to China was negotiated in a market where the Chinese were other than willing buyers knows nothing of world market conditions.

* In my view, the Soviet's ideology is much more dangerous to genuine world peace than the Chinese ideology, certainly in the short term.

* I do not believe that the present Communist Chinese hierarchy is interested in overt means of securing this Utopia.

* Like the Chinese, the Soviets believe in the doctrine of permanent world revolution, but unlike the Chinese, the Soviets are committed to a traditional policy of Russian colonialism which makes the former great colonial powers look positively benign.

* The honourable member for Lalor has said how many speeches he has made in opposition to Chinese nuclear tests.

* Let us hear the honourable member for Lalor and the honourable member for Reid make speeches in the Parliament - where they are paid to be - about the Chinese and Soviet Union atomic tests.

* The states of Asia, whether they like it or not, are in a cauldron in which Soviet power and Chinese power are competing for influence.

* After all, his Leader is more concerned about sending messages of congratulations to the  Chairman  of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

* I list those only two growth industries as massage parlours and Chinese restaurants.

* The Chinese people come here, and they are welcome.

* The Chief of Staff in Britain says that the Chinese are his friends, that the people who were on his side in the two World 
Obviously this agreement was absolutely necessary to help a sister nation of the Pacific.

* The honourable member seems to be involved very considerably with the Chinese situation.

* After all, New Zealand has a standard of living and objectives in line with Australia's, not similar to the objectives of our Chinese friends.

* Some people say that the Chinese communists have obliterated the Tibetan culture.

* I suggest that, if the Chinese communists want to clear their name, if they want to put an end to these stories if they be untrue, they have a very simple remedy.

* We know that Tibetan refugees, including the most eminent Tibetan refugees - and I have spoken of the Dalai Lama - accuse the Chinese Communists - whether rightly or wrongly we do not know, but the accusation stands - of conducting a systematic assassination of the Tibetan people and of their culture.

* Europeans, the Chinese and the Mixed Race communities who will have to live under tensions and fears of violence because of the political paddling of a man whose party has as much hope of victory at the next elections as Rabaulites have of seeing snow on the Mother Volcano.

* When I first saw the reports of statements which had been made repeatedly by the honourable gentleman, the Chinese Ambassador never having raised the matter with me, I asked the Chinese Ambassador whether he would come to see me, and indeed he did come to see me.

* I pointed out to the Chinese Ambassador that it was extraordinary that  Mr Pai  had complained about anything on 23 July when the Minister for Overseas Trade had felt able to make a statement, portion of which I will shortly read, on 3 August and it was not until 31 August that the Minister first decided to make these matters known.

* I must say that when I told the Chinese Ambassador of that statement by the Minister for Overseas Trade the Chinese Ambassador was staggered.

* After all, the Russians, the Americans, the Chinese, the.

* When other countries which had surplus wheat to sell - Canada and France are examples - they could see the great value of the Chinese market to their wheat industries and they set up de facto diplomatic relations with that Communist country.

* Let mc tell the Parliament this: The Chinese know more about our wheat surpluses than we know about its wheat needs.

* When those other countries are trying to discover what Chinese wheat needs will be they get out and get the sales before we even discover that China is buying wheat.

* The possibility, remote as it seems now, is that the Chinese people may reject the tyranny of life under Mao Tse Tung or whoever comes after him.

* live with the menace of Communist Chinese aggression.

* What about the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Chinese conquest - not invasion - of Tibet, the actions of North Vietnam in Cambodia in relation to which we have just had a delegation?

* There is clear evidence of both Soviet and Chinese Communist penetration in Africa, the Middle East, the Suez Canal zone as well as strategic Indian Ocean points such as Socotra, Mauritius and Zanzibar.

* But, if all allied troops were immediately withdrawn, would they be strong enough to resist the attacks not only from North Vietnam but assisted by the Chinese and the Russians?

* Basically, the domino theory is that there are in the South East Asian area a number of small states, none of which individually would be able to stand up against the might of North Vietnam assisted by the Chinese and the Russians.

* What would the Chinese have to offer us?

* The Chinese are honest traders.

* As a preface, I refer him to his Press conference of 8th May at which, in reply to the question 'Have you had any response from the Chinese Government on your protest note on the nuclear testing?

* 1 also refer him to an answer to a question on notice reported in the Senate Hansard of 15th May in which  Senator Murphy,  in reply to a question asked by  Senator Webster,  said that the Prime Minister had furnished the following answer: 
The protest took the form of  a  letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-fei.

* The letter was banded to the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister ... by the Australian Charge d'Affaires in Peking.

* In New York in October last year I had a useful talk with the leader of the Chinese Mission to the United Nations who was then serving his term as  Chairman  of the Security Council.

* Labor Party members who support the Chinese leadership and say how wonderful the Chinese leaders are.

* He has already been assured by the Chinese Government that China will be prepared to take substantially increased quantities of Australian iron ore which will to a large degree offset the loss of iron ore exports to Japan because of the cutback in intake by the Japanese steel mills.

* This is tied in with the Chinese 10-year plan from 1 975 to 1 985 which involves, among other things, a 10 per cent annual industrial growth rate; an allocation of 60 per cent of government expenditure on economic construction; a steel production target of 60 million tonnes per annum or 2.4 times last year's production rate; and the development of 120 large scale plants including ten iron and steel plants and nine nonferrous metal plants.

* The Minister also has received assurances that the Chinese will be looking very seriously at the possibility of using Australian technology, particularly in the mineral processing field.

* Also in accordance with many of the Chinese long term ambitions, particularly for the mechanisation of agriculture, it looks as though there will be a strong possibility as a result of the Minister's visit that our exports of agricultural machinery will be substantially expanded to the Chinese market.

* We have just about reached saturation point in sales of agricultural machinery in this country and the fact that the Chinese market for the export of our agricultural machinery may be expanded is, I think, a feather in the Minister's cap and a substantial achievement.

* It is a substantial achievement, particularly as the Chinese hope to have a very substantial proportion of their agricultural industry mechanised by 1985.

* In fact, the Chinese hope to have some 85 per cent of their agricultural industry mechanised by 1985.

* This, indeed, is what has happened with respect to Communist Chinese actions over recent years.

* Here was a real test, and the Communist Chinese refused to have anything to do with it.

* What we wish to see, and what the Malaysian Prime Minister and his Government wish to see, is a series of positive actions indicating that the Communist Chinese are prepared to guarantee the neutrality of South East Asia.

* I do not believe that either the Chinese or Soviet Governments will become directly involved in the conflict as neither would be prepared to risk a major confrontation with each other over the dispute.

* Now, in the words of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in this debate, they are the products of half a decade's intensifying sentiment against Vietnamese of Chinese origin.

* They should recognise that many people of other than Chinese origin have sought to leave Vietnam and other countries of Indo-China.

* One fact in relation to wheat sales to China is that in 1964 this Government deliberately stood oyer the Australian Wheat Board and directed that the Wheat Board pass a note to Chinese authorities, thus introducing politics into the wheat trade.

* For political gain and for no other purpose they handed to the Chinese a stick with which to beat the Government.

* When I hear people like the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  talking about wheat being really political as far as the Chinese are concerned I want to know how he can explain the fact that the Chinese are buying increasing quantities of sugar.

* So by the time  Mr Harry  Webb leaves office, there will only be his wife and two or three Chinese for him to represent on Christmas Island.

* Letters were exchanged in Peking on 18 September between the Chinese Foreign Minister on behalf of the 
Government of the People's Republic of China and the Australian Ambassador on behalf of the Government of Australia, which constitute an agreement between the two Governments for the establishment of Consulates-General in the two countries.

* The agreement provides for a Chinese Consulate-General in Sydney and an Australian ConsulateGeneral in either Canton or Shanghai.

* If we adopt that view, the actions of the Chinese must be of importance to us also.

* The physical features which give Australia that option of approaching the International Court of Justice against the  Frencn  tests are not applicable against the Chinese tests.

* We do have fallout from Chinese nuclear testing on Australia.

* We must make the strongest protests to the French - and also to the Chinese.

* While diplomatic relations were not established with the Mainland Chinese we could protest only in general terms through the United Nations.

* If atmospheric nuclear tests are contemplated by the Chinese then we are duty bound to protest to them in similar vein to our protests to the French.

* In any case, if and when action is taken against the French, a believable and honest Australian Government would have to make similar protests against the Chinese.

* Chinese Government announced that from 5 March all Chinese forces are withdrawing from Vietnamese territory.

* Chinese forces penetrated 30 to 40 kilometres into Vietnam, capturing a number of provincial centres of which Lang Son was the most important.

* It is too early at this stage to ascertain whether the Chinese have actually begun their withdrawal and what has been the Vietnamese military reaction.

* It is to be hoped that neither side will take any precipitate action which would hamper the withdrawal of Chinese forces.

* Chinese public statements that their actions were confined to the border area and were limited in time to date have been adhered to.

* It is to be hoped that the proposed Chinese withdrawal will result in talks being held, leading to a lessening of tension in Indo-China.

* I might add that I expect to discuss the situation this afternoon with the visiting Chinese Vice-Premier during our consideration of both bilateral and international issues.

* The Chinese have removed that type of slavery from Tibet.

* Tibet was always a part of China and the people of Tibet are better off today under direct Chinese rule than they were under the old Dalai Lama rule.

* I have seen copies of the letters that the Chinese Government wrote to the governments of those countries, asking for a round table conference to define their borders because China bad no defined borders with them after the Communist Government took over the country from the old corrupt, crooked Chiang Kai-shek regime.

* But the letters written by the Chinese Government to India were never answered by the Indian Government.

* We have heard so much about this Chinese bogey for so long, but now some of the truth is starting to come out.

* We know that the Government is changing face and is going to vote for China's admission to the United Nations, but I think it has left its run too late, because the Chinese realise, and they state, that we have been the puppets of the United States for too long.

* But the Chinese army is equipped with small-scale weapons for defensive purposes.

* When I was there I asked the Chinese people why they were arming themselves when they should give higher priority, I thought, to health and education.

* I think honourable members would admit, at least in private to their friends, that there was a move to invade North Vietnam and China by the Chinese lobby in the United States during the period of the Vietnam war.

* By agreement between the two parties, the terms of sale, prices received and amounts and types involved in the Corporation's recent sale of wool to the Peoples Republic of China are confidential matters between the Corporation and the Chinese authorities.

* I suppose that sort of error is to be expected from a Government which only 6 years ago was telling us to expect a Chinese, invasion.

* The agrarian reform campaign was carried out under the supervision of Chinese cadres familiar with the similar campaign in China, and Truong Chinh identified himself publicly with it.

* Chinese patterns had to be followed even when they proved to be unworkable in the different conditions of Vietnam, and the number of casualties appalled the most battle-hardened soldiers.

* Has the Government of the People's Republic of China approached the Australian Government with a request for Australia to accept greater numbers of Chinese students in Australia.

* In view of the publicly stated interest of China in rapidly expanding numbers of Chinese students studying abroad, what steps has the Government taken to consult with State authorities and tertiary institutions to establish what needs to be done to accept these students.

* Similarly Red Chinese cultural delegates and central bankers seem to have gained fairly easy access to the country.

* It would seem to this basis, particularly as Red Chinese central bankers have entered fairly easily, that if someone is connected with trade or material transactions, especially with the wheat industry, their presence is welcomed irrespective of their political affiliations.

* Can he say whether these essential differences have been evident in the  Peking People's Daily  or in any of the Chinese media; if so, when.

* Are there any examples where the incitement of revolution by Peking Radio, the  Voice of Thailand  or the  Voice of the Malaysian Revolution  has been discussed by the Chinese Government.

* i  Is it realistic to accept that the doctrine that Chinese 'relations with foreign Communist parties would not be allowed to impinge on government to government relationships' absolves the Government of responsibility 
Let me quote a short passage from the communique which was issued by  President  Nixon and  Mr Chou  En-lai.

* This is what the Chinese said in that communique: 
The Chinese side stated that it firmly supports the struggles of all oppressed people and nations for freedom and liberation .

* Anybody who supposes that when the statement appears in the communique that the Chinese still, as in the past, support unequivocally wars of national liberation - we know what that phrase means - and that peace is likely to ensue, is rather more naive or perhaps more disingenuous than I would suppose him to be.

* Last month he opened in Melbourne, as I shall open next month in Sydney, a visiting Chinese exhibition.

* Did he state in March 1972 that Australia would like Taiwan to be independent and that his Government still accepts the claim of both Chinese regimes that Taiwan should be part of one China.

* 1 have no doubt that the Russians will move carefully and not too quickly because they do not regard the Chinese as an immediate threat.

* The Australian Government recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China, and has decided to remove its official representation from Taiwan before 25th January 1973'.

* The substantive passage of the Sino-British communique of 13th March 1972 reads: "The Government of the United Kingdom, acknowledging the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China, have decided to remove their official representation in Taiwan on 13th March 1972.

* He told the Chinese that a question mark hung over the future of Indonesia because of the nature of the present regime.

* He told the Chinese that  detente  was a delusion- a policy developed and cherished by the United States and adopted by both presidential candidates.

* It has been subjected to pressure from the Chinese to the north and the Kampucheans to the west and south-west.

* The Chinese have been taught to see themselves as the sole repository of the true Communist doctrine and practice.

* The Chinese have done a magnificant job.

* If one is in the caves of Yunan as I was, one sees where the Chinese had to fight the Japanese years before we did.

* It is important that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  at last has gone there, has had a discussion with the Chinese, and would no longer write the same words that he wrote in 1 970.

* It is important to realise why the Chinese place the highest priority on improving.

* I remind those on the Government side of the House who say that history shows that the Vietnamese and Chinese have historical and cultural differences, that in their own Party expediency dictates at times that they bury their differences and unify for the purpose of power.

* Is it a fact that an Australian citizen, Miss Susan Day, presently employed by the Government of the People's Republic of China as a teacher, has applied to the Chinese authorities for permission to marry a Chinese citizen?

* Will the Prime Minister be prepared to use his good offices to encourage the Chinese authorities to give permission for that marriage to take place?

* He maintained before the Australian Labor Party delegation went to Peking - he has maintained it since - that there was absolutely no truth in the claim that the Chinese postponed wheal purchases from Australia because of politics.

* He recently referred to the Chinese people as being carpet-baggers, a derogatory and insulting expression.

* The Minister for Shipping and Transport gave his views while overseas on the Chinese situation.

* The Chinese view of Australia was put bluntly in these terms: 
It was maintained that as each day passes and Australian troops continue to remain in Vietnam Australia's image in Asia and throughout the world worsens.

* The Chinese view is that the war should be ended immediately so that the people of Vietnam and Indo-China can solve their own problems immediately, without interference from the United States or Australia.

* The Chinese Foreign Minister's view is that the essence of United States imperialist policy, which Australia is blindly following, is to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries by openly engaging in war or by other surreptitious means under the guise of protection by stationing troops in those countries.

* Ministers of the Chinese Government maintain, as we well know, that the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of China and that Taiwan is an unalienable part of China - a province of China.

* Chinese policy with regard to relationships with China is that good relations cannot exist between China and Australia as long as the Australian Government continues its hostil ity towards China and tails the United States aggression in Asia.

* Another point the Chinese made was that the present poor relations with China have not been caused by China and therefore an initiative must come from the Australian Government.

* The Chinese view is that it is not possible to have normal relations with the Australian Government while the Australian Government openly supports Chiang Kai-shek, continues to establish close relations with him, opposes China in the United Nations and supports United States resolutions to exclude China.

* I rose in my place yesterday hoping that you,  Mr Speaker,  would give me the call, because yesterday a former Minister for the Army,  Sir John  Cramer, engaged in a deliberate infringement of the Standing Orders and the Prime Minister, fully aware of what he was going to say rose, almost rubbing his hands, and poured the bucket of hate over the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition and, indirectly, over myself on the Chinese question.

* Because the whole basis of the Government's propaganda, the only way this wretched war and our futile, wasted commitment to it could have been sold to the Australian people was by depicting it as a long distance war against China - a war to stop the downward thrust of Chinese communism between the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

* Furthermore, to suggest that that new combination of nations should include Peking when the Indonesians had had a rather sad experience with the Chinese Communists was, as I have said, either naive or ignorant.

* The Chinese have achieved national unity and industrial strength and their diplomatic initiatives have spread throughout Asia, Europe and Africa.

* Despite earlier advice the Chinese concern was with a statement attributed to  Mr Anthony.

* It seems the local High Commission merely assumed  Mr Anthony's  television interview might have been a source of irritation, and it is now admitted that nobody really knows what ministerial statement was made, if any, which could have been responsible for the Chinese concern.

* Might it not be nearer the truth to say that the real damage was done a few months ago when we were at a very delicate stage of negotiations and waiting to hear from the Chinese and the honourable member for Dawson and the honourable member for Riverina were going around the countryside making mischievous statements which severely embarrassed the Wheat Board and may well have done irreparable damage?

* 102, will the proposed Chinese Antiquities Exhibition be the same as that which was shown in the United States of America in 1 975.

* Australians and Chinese can now visit each other with the full warmth that should always have applied but which was suspended for 23 years.

* In a communique authorised by the Chinese Government, this intertwining of politics and trade is referred to specifically.

* The Peking Review' states: 
That is the Chinese assessment of the situation.

* Not only was he telling the Chinese that they were unfit to be dealt with because of the peril to his soul but also a former Foreign Minister,  Sir Gordon  Freeth, spoke of 'serious questionings of conscience in Australia about how far we are justified in trading with China'.

* The facts of Chinese trade are available for him to study and digest.

* I am criticising the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for naming the Chinese in this respect.

* Obviously he and not us is against the Chinese.

* According to its information the Chinese did not eat correctly, they ate with chopsticks.

* It was also told that the Chinese did not dress properly so it exported suits and western clothes to China.

* It was told that the Chinese could have a sense of culture so it exported pianos to China.

* Today, when we hear magnificent reports concerning the prospects of the Chinese market, I would hope that the Government would give exporters very precise advice and quite clear guidelines as to what might happen.

* Chinese oil from Tai Clung- it is heavy; it is waxy- is another element in the export of Japanese technology and machine equipment.

* I will give one example of what has occurred and then raise some matters with the Government with respect to Chinese trade.

* When in Government last year we made some efforts to normalise relations with China and the Prime Minister, then Leader of the Opposition, conceded this in talks with the Chinese Premier as early as 
The Prime Minister developed Australia's dialogue with China.

* Presumably the Chinese concurred in this.

* But on what basis did he presume to explain to the Chinese Government the views and the attitudes of the ASEAN countries?

* We know now that he raised the issue of Chinese nuclear tests but did he receive any committment from the Chinese that they would try to make their tests cleaner, to test underground or to curtail their testing program?

* If not, did he indicate to the Chinese what further action he intends to take?

* We would seek action by the Chinese on their nuclear testing and if they refused it we would say that they refused to do so.

* We know, for example, that during talks in Peking in 1971 the Chinese Premier referred to Prince Sihanouk and the Leader of the Opposition, as he then was, replied: 'It is tragic for his people that his Government was subverted in this clandestine, in this evil way'.

* I also mention to the honourable gentleman that Communist road builders are constructing a road from Chinese Communist territory down to Pak Beng on the Mekong River, close to the Thai border.

* The Minister said that  Chairman  Mao, who is a dreadful fellow, said: 
This debate on foreign policy is not a debate about China alone, ft is true that the Chinese exercise at the present time has captured the imagination of people because of the initiative of the Australian Labor Party.

* I believe that in a way the attitudes of the Chinese, whether it is Taiwan to the mainland or the mainland to Taiwan, belong to this mode of thought - sentimental imperialism is the term I would give it.

* Seriously,  Mr Speaker,  I did raise with the Chinese authorities the possibility of a visit to China by an Australian Rules football team.

* For this reason alone it is physically not possible for the Chinese Government to agree to many of the requests that are made by people to visit China for medical reasons or for reasons such as this one.

* The Chinese authorities have pointed out that the game is not known in China.

* The Chinese authorities have not yet completely given up reading the Australian Press, although I should imagine they soon will.

* Are the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Australian Wheat Board awaiting a letter from the non-recognised representatives of the nonrecognised 700 million Chinese inquiring as to the possible purchase of wheat from Australia?

* I think it was on 20 December last the Chinese communist government launched an attack on the islands in the China Sea which had been occupied by South Vietnam.

* However, the permanent delegate of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Security Council had subsequently issued a thoroughly negative statement, presenting a distorted version of the facts and clinging to the false claims of Chinese sovereighty over the Hoang-Sa (Paracels) and Truong-Sa (Spratley) archipelagoes.

* When, in this area, its power is first tested, the United Nations is paralysed by the fear of a Chinese veto.

* The Spratly Islands are next on the Communist Chinese agenda.

* I brought my knowledge up to date by contacting the Communist Chinese Embassy in Canberra to find out the extent of China's claims.

* That is why I have difficulty accepting the present Chinese overtures of friendship with Australia as being genuinely sincere.

* I noted that a distinguished Chinese lady the other evening still called that country Cambodia.

* We commend the Soviet Union for its moderation in response to the Chinese actions, but it is to be regretted that the same moderating influence was not extended from Moscow in the case of Vietnam's actions against Kampuchea.

* Perhaps a pair of socks for every Chinese is more important than for wool to be identified with high fashion.

* At the 1976 Census, 36,638 persons describing themselves as of Chinese racial origin were resident in Australia.

* I am advised by the Australian Statistician that tabulations of 1976 Census data as currently planned up to September 1979 do not provide information on the numbers of persons of Chinese racial origin in individual electorates.

* China has managed to create a different atmosphere about itself I do not know that the Government of China is so much more free but most of us feel that we can talk to the Chinese and come to some sort of negotiating position with them more easily than with the Russians.

* What would be the result, after all, if we had around the table in the middle of the chamber the leader of Russia,  Mr Brezhnev, Mr Carterlittle  as my friend from Deakin thinks of himand  Mr Deng  Xiaoping, the Chinese  Deputy  Premier.

* I apologise for not pronouncing Chinese words as well as Chinese people handle English.

* A heartening aspect was the behaviour of Albania, which attacked everybody- the Russians the Americans and the Chinese, and all its neighbours also.

* So we have reached the situation in which 50 million Britons, or 50 million Frenchmen, or 250 million Americans or Russians, or even 800 million Chinese can stop over 4,000 million people of the world by having their representatives act in this way.

* What number and proportion of (a) sponsored students and (b) private students from Malaysia were of (i) Malay and (ii) Chinese descent.

* It was very odd to visit Paris and to be asked by so many people in France: 'Is it true that the Australian people like the Communist Chinese more than they like the French, or is it that they are just a little hypocritical in their attitudes to bombs?'

* I was able to tell the French that the postal workers' boss, when asked whether he would also put a ban on Chinese mail as well as on French mail, said that he would not.

* They are more inclined to believe the views of the Communist Chinese Government than the views of the Whitlam Government on matters like this.

* They believe along with the Chinese Communist Government that the detente is a lot of hog wash and that the revolution is on the march as much as it ever was.

* Mr Maechling estimated that the Viet Cong were getting only a trickle of supplies from North Vietnam and noted that nobody, had found a Chinese rifle or Soviet weapon used by the guerillas.

* That was at a time when the United States of America had sent 125,000 men 7,500 miles across the sea to within tens of miles of the Chinese border to fight.

* The contrast between what has been the effect of the involvement of the United States from so far away, and the little part played by the Chinese, if any, is one that we cannot fail to see.

* In a statement on foreign policy made by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Bury)  it is stated: 
(a) At the census of 1966, 6048 persons describing themselves as of Chinese racial origin were resident in Australia.

* and (3) The numbers of persons describing themselves as of Chinese origin, resident in the electorate of St George were as follows: 
The above statistics refer to Chinese as defined by racial origin, not by birthplace.

* Never was there a word of insult, or abuse from him against the Chinese.

* The incredible statement made yesterday by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in an endeavour to dismiss the importance of the loss of this huge Chinese market is a direct smack in the face for every wheat grower in Australia.

* Firstly, the Australian Government should apologise to the Chinese Government for the continuous insults which the Deputy Prime Minister and other Ministers, backed by the Australian Government, have been and still are directing against the Chinese people.

* It is obvious that this decision is not secret as far as the Chinese Government is concerned.

* We see the Chinese diverting wheat to the North Vietnamese people.

* A Labor Government will trade with China, and there may be no fear of any Australian soldiers being killed by the North Vietnamese who are fed with Chinese wheat because a Labor Government will have no troops at all in Vietnam.

* I do not complain about the action of the Chinese leaders.

* But what I do call into question - I believe a majority of Australians agree with me - is that, at a time when the Government was in contact with the Chinese seeking to open up a dialogue, a full surrender to Peking's point of view was made publicly by the Leader of the Opposition.

* He did, of course, come out of China saying that the Chinese Government was quite willing to particpate in a renewed Geneva Conference.

* The official Chinese Press has also described talk about a new Geneva conference as 'a sheer fraud which is ridiculous and absurd'.

* I remind the House again that there is no sudden short cut to normal relations with China, as history so clearly shows, particularly Soviet and Chinese history.

* In his statement on the subject the Canadian Minister of State for External Affairs,  Mr Mitchell  Sharp, said Canada had made it clear to the Chinese from the start of their negotiations 'that the Canadian Government does not consider it appropriate either to endorse or to challenge the Chinese Government's position on the status of Taiwan'.

* And, as I have said, by so doing does not exclude the use of force in the resolution of this issue by the Chinese.

* In October 1950, Communist Chinese troops moved into Tibet to establish the authority of the then recently established People's Republic of China.

* We are beginning to get many appointments of Japanese, Chinese and other nonBritish subjects to teach their languages.

* Did the 2 meetings between the Australia!, and Chinese ambassadors in Paris, to which the Prime Minister referred on 17th July 1971, take place on 27th May and 2nd July.

* In which countries did Chinese ambassadors make the representations to which the Prime Minister referred on 16th September 1971 (Hansard, pages 1401 and 1404).

* An honourable member on the Opposition side mentioned a while ago how the 1966 election campaign was fought with pamphlets showing arrows coming down from the Red Chinese, as it was put.

* In the middle of last year there was the expulsion of about 150,000 ethnic Chinese from Vietnam.

* Equally we believe there must be a withdrawal of Chinese forces from Vietnam.

* As I said, there should be a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Kampuchea and at the same time a withdrawal of Chinese troops from Vietnam.

* They used to say that the Chinese would be landing on Bondi Beach.

* The previous Government in this country for years tried to frighten the Australian people with the threat that the Chinese were about to land on our shores.

* The arrangements applying in the case of the United States result from specific agreements and understandings reached between the United States and Chinese Governments when they entered into full diplomatic relations.

* The Chinese Government has not agreed to similar arrangements by any other country except Japan.

* I ask: Does the Prime Minister deny that in May 1967 the Australian Wheat Board delegation in Hong Kong, after negotiating a contract for the sale of 1,500,000 tons of wheat with China, was forced, on the instructions of the Commonwealth Government, to hand to the Chinese a note, after the contract had been signed, which stated that if China did not use her influence to stop the Hong Kong riots Australia reserved the right to cancel the contract?

* Does the Prime Minister deny that the reaction by the Chinese negotiators to this blatant blackmail was so strong that the wheat trade in 1967 was almost wrecked and the next Wheat Board delegation was bluntly informed by China that if such a provocative attitude by Australia continued China would do no more wheat business with Australia?

* I do not advocate and have never advocated war against the Chinese people.

* The Chinese did not even have a nuclear weapon.

* It should be used to destroy the factories which are making nuclear material in China- not war with the Chinese people, not wholesale destruction in any way at all, but simply the removal from their hands of the weapons whereby humanity can be destroyed.

* Nothing that we can do in the form of military exercises can intimidate the Chinese or anyone else.

* As 1 said here in debate last week, one of the interesting facts about China's entry to the United Nations is the enthusiasm with which the Chinese apparently are accepting that promotion, if that is it; and with China in that body there is a new forum and a new grouping of people to try to find a solution.

* The major point of my tour was to visit Vietnam to discuss with the Vietnamese Government the problems it is having with China and then to go to China, as the guest of the Chinese Government, to spend a fortnight in that country.

* The Chinese Government has recently passed a Bill through its parliament which permits Chinese companies to undertake joint ventures.

* It is therefore very interesting that I was able to take this news back to companies in my electorate and ask them whether they could assist the Chinese Government with some of the more modern technical applications of the refrigeration industry and things of that sort.

* Everywhere I was impressed by the number of young Chinese- and young Chinese girls- who were handling some of the most sophisticated and most modern machinery.

* I am wondering whether some of the Australian tobacco companies will start buying Chinese tobacco.

* I must say to my Chinese hosts that I was deeply grateful for the opportunity to visit their country.

* Everywhere one sees Chinese they are always working, busy and active, and they are always bicycling.

* Finally, if he refers to the Wheat Board itself, I have made it clear in the House that at the last meeting the Wheat Board had with the NgFung Hong company that now does the official transactions on behalf of the Chinese Government, the Wheat Board was in fact welcomed, and the representatives were asked to keep in touch so that when the opportunity arose they could proceed to an attempt to negotiate contracts.

* It was at a time when the Chinese market temporarily folded up.

* Secondly, I was asked to try to get the Chinese Government to upgrade its bulk handling facilities.

* The third thing I was asked to do was to get a team of Chinese experts to come to Australia to study bulk receiving facilities.

* It reads: 
As a result of the Peking discussions with  Dr Patterson,  the Chinese Government had agreed to pro- o vide long-term access for Australian sugar.

* The sugar industry representatives told  Dr Patterson  that they welcomed the initiative he had taken with the Chinese Government which had achieved the basis for long-term access to the Chinese market for Australian sugar.

* To go to the extreme from our system, I would like to tell the House something of what Professor Galbraith reported on a Chinese commune.

* What is operating in Chinese foreign policy in this respect is not an ideological consideration but a national consideration.

* Equally, the Soviet Union suspected that Chinese policy over Cuba in  1962  was an attempt to involve the Soviet Union in a war with the United States in which they would both destroy one another, leaving China as the gainer.

* Eastern border clashes between Soviet and Chinese troops have been serious.

* Chinese claims that have been put forward for an abrogation of the unequal treaties imposed by the Czars seriously worry the Soviet Union.

* A less obvious factor is the Soviet fear of a Chinese strategy to disintegrate the Soviet Union.

* Krishna Prakash Gupta, who is one of the leading thinkers in the field of Indian foreign policy, had this to say about China and the over-simplifications of Chinese policy that are sometimes put forward: 
You did denounce cruelty in Tibet because it was the action of communists; you do not denounce it if it is not the action of communists.

* You did not check by representations massacre of Chinese in Indonesia.

* The nature of Australia's overtures to the present Chinese leadership have been motivated by opportunism in the search of lucrative markets for the big private corporations.

* We need to recall the enormous struggles of the Chinese people over many years against occupying foreign exploiting nations and their struggles over many years to feed their massive population, develop mass literacy and progress towards industrial and agricultural development.

* Of course we should give praise to the Chinese people.

* The antagonisms during 1978 deepened as the links of struggle were drawn across the rivalries of the Chinese and the Russians.

* In July Vietnam openly broke with Peking and accused the Chinese of stirring up trouble amongst the ethnic Chinese in Vietnam.

* Antagonism in Kampuchea, and in the Vietnam border dispute, again was blamed on the Chinese.

* Conflicts on the China-Vietnam border again were stirred up over many questions, over the indigenous Chinese people in Vietnam whom we call the Hua people.

* I believe that we should take five major steps: Firstly, we should call for an immediate withdrawal of all Chinese forces from Vietnam and call on United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to avoid any action or statement that could provoke a further escalation or inhibit the resolution of the conflict.

* I do not know whether this is really a conscious attempt by our Department of Foreign Affairs or whether it is just a preference by the new Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  who has always been closer to the peasants and therefore prefers the Chinese regime to that of the Soviet Union.

* 'Mr Whitlam  is a great showman, perhaps  Mr Fraser  is a great statesman', said one Chinese diplomat in Canberra recently.

* For others it is something of a worry that Fraser may go overboard in embracing the Chinese communists.

* We see a Prime Minister who is crawling to the Chinese at present.

* He apparently thinks it is all right to play footsie, or whatever the appropriate title is, with the Chinese regime.

* It spent thousands of dollars of the taxpayers money on snivelling and crawling to the Chinese people, but did not write one order.

* What plans does the Government have for trying to stimulate overseas trade in the export of beef cattle7 Never mind about crawling and snivelling to the Chinese at a display in China.

* It is interesting to note that narcotic addiction used to be a disease of Caucasians and Chinese, many in the older age groups.

* At present only 30 per cent of all addicts in the United States of America are Caucasians or Chinese.

* It is estimated that, since the end of the Vietnam war, some 600,000 refugees, mainly of Chinese descent, have fled to neighbouring South East Asian countries.

* The ethnic Chinese continue to be persecuted, and that trend has increased since the Chinese invasion of Vietnam earlier this year.

* It is interesting to note that ethnic Vietnamese now form a significant part of the exodus, by comparison with ethnic Chinese, as they realise that the intent of the regime in Vietnam is not one of massive benevolence.

* We had the situation of the Minister for Overseas Trade feting a Chinese communist delegation and refusing to receive a trade delegation from Portugal, a country with which we have friendly relations.

* I approve of his opposition to the French nuclear tests, although I would have greater respect for his integrity if he displayed equal vehemence in condemning the Chinese nuclear tests.

* Mr Whitlam  went to Buckingham Palace and suffered a Chinese earthquake.

* The Prime Minister has tried to put the blame for failure to get effective relations going squarely onto the Chinese.

* He said on the television programme, 'Monday Conference', that the Chinese had cut off discussions 'suddenly .

* He said further: 
We thought quite frankly that we were on the way to success but the Chinese act in their own inscrutable ways.'

* The Prime Minister's phraseology alone would indicate that his understanding of Chinese psychology and politics was still in the realms of Fu Man Chu and Charlie Chan.

* It was disclosed a week later in the National Times' that the Prime Minister had rejected an invitation by the Chinese to have a member of his Ministry go to China for 10 days.

* It was revealed that the Chinese had sent the invitation through  Mr J.  C. Kibel to the former Minister for the 
It became clear that the Government, in seeking to get a trade mission to China, had hooked a rather bigger fish.

* The Chinese had invited  Mr Peacock  and his wife to go to China, apparently on the recommendation of the brothers Kibel.

* It gradually emerged that the Government had been using the Kibels as emissaries or intermediaries with the Chinese.

* This entailed flying them to Hong Kong and accommodating them while they negotiated, surely a most potent comment on the standing of Australian trade officials with the Chinese.

* If the 'National Times' had not stumbled on the story, the negotiations and the eagerness of the Chinese to receive a member of the Australian Government would have been obscured forever.

* According to  Mr Kibel,  the Chinese were intrigued by the Minister's relative youth and the nature of his portfolio.

* Initially the Prime Minister said of the negotiations with the Chinese: 
There is not the slightest doubt from the context here that the Prime Minister was referring to either the Chinese or the Kibels stipulating that the Minister had to give up his portfolio before making the visit.

* Later in his answer the Prime Minister said: 
This implies that the Australian Government had pointed out to the Chinese that Australia was participating in Viet nam, and that  Mr Peacock  would have to resign if he wanted to enjoy the comforts and delights of Peking.

* Apart from the remarkable fact that the Chinese had to be told Australia had troops in Vietnam, it is clear that the Prime Minister has given 2 versions that cannot be reconciled.

* On the first version, he said the Chinese through the Kibels had stipulated that the Minister had to resign to accept the invitation.

* The second version is that the Australian Government stipulated that the Minister had to resign and this was pointed out to the non-official Chinese source.

* The invitation was then promptly withdrawn by the Chinese.

* We have not heard from the other party to these negotiations, the Chinese.

* It is probable that we will hear very little from any Chinese sources, official or nonofficial, while this Government remains in office.

* It is pointless for the Prime Minister to express pathetic hopes that the Chinese should disregard Taiwan in dialogue with Australia, as he claims it has done with America.

* Any hopes of an effective dialogue have been destroyed by the constant campaign of distortion and vilification towards the Chinese conducted by the Prime Minister in the past year.

* This reached its peak in the Prime Minister's rewriting of events which have baffled the Chinese just as much as it confounded all who heard it in this House.

* The Chinese can only wonder what limits exist to the blatant charlatanism of this Government's conduct of its foreign relations.

* Why should the Chinese have relations with us at any level while these misleading statements persist?

* The Council already has two resolutions before it: A Soviet- draft calling for a Chinese withdrawal and a Chinese draft calling for a Vietnamese withdrawal.

* Mainland China, any sense of satisfaction that it will always be that way, because when we see the Chinese people - and I have seen them all over the world, and some of you have, too, whether in Hong Kong or Thailand or Singapore or Bangkok, any of the great cities, Manila, where Chinese are there - they are creative, they are productive, they are one of the most capable people in the world, and 800 million Chinese are going to be, inevitably, an enormous economic power, with all that means in terms of what they could be in other areas if they move in that direction.

* He said more, but what I have quoted shows Australia that the policies which the United States has pursued towards China for 20 years, that is, policies of military containment of the Chinese and diplomatic isolation, are no longer to be followed in the United States.

* 5 ) Has his attention been drawn to a report concerning an illegal immigrant couple of Chinese origin, resident in Australia 3 years, who have been persuaded to pay $10 000 to a person in authority in Sydney to obtain Australian residence, without success or hope.

* I believe that we now have a much greater understanding of Chinese attitudes on these issues.

* I believe, too, that on the Chinese side, there is now a much clearer and first-hand understanding of our policies.

* While there were areas of agreement, there were also issues on which our policies differed and, in such cases, I did not hesitate to put our position fully and frankly to our Chinese hosts.

* Arrangements were also made for the active promotion of closer consultations between Australian and Chinese officials and for a program of visits in both directions.

* The Australian and Chinese Foreign Ministers are to exchange visits at times to be determined in 1974.

* Honourable members will be pleased to know that an understanding in principle was reached between the 2 sides on travel from China to Australia by relatives of Australian citizens of Chinese descent and Chinese citizens residing in Australia.

* I preface my question to the Prime Minister by stating that I am inter.ested in a request by a naturalised Australian Chinese constituent whose aged parents, who are also naturalised and live in Sydney, are not enjoying the best of health.

* I ask: Will the honourable gentleman in his forthcoming discussions with the Premier of the People's Republic of China request that sympathetic consideration be given by his Government to the granting of exit visas to Chinese citizens who desire to be reunited with their families in Australia?

* The Australian Government recognises the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, acknowledges the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China, and  has decided to remove its official representation from Taiwan before 25th January 1973.

* '- 
The Chinese Government reaffirms that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.

* The Canadian Government takes note of this position of the Chinese Government.

* I was very interested in all that was shown to the parliamentary delegation when we travelled to China and in the attitude exhibited by the Australian Government towards the Chinese Government.

* I do not believe that the Chinese want this lap dog subservience.

* The British go about matters unobstrusively, yet perhaps they can claim to be the most successful nation in selling their products to the Chinese!

* The Chinese do not want it nor, I am sure, do the majority of Australians.

* Since the finish of the cultural revolution Chinese leadership has attempted to get things back on an even keel.

* The Chinese want to see a reasonably stable situation around them.

* They do not want to see any further increase in the influence of Russia in these areas of South-East Asia immediately surrounding or abutting the Chinese nation.

* For this reason the Chinese are in somewhat of a cleft stick simply because the Government of North Vietnam has shown such marked and open expansionary tendencies.

* It was necessary, in order to travel to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to pass through China where I was able to renew contacts, particularly with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade, Minister Poi Hsiang-kuo, and with the Foreign Minister, Chi Peng Fei.

* An Australian Wheat Board mission was expected shortly after and the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade expressed his satisfaction at the way the twoway contacts were developing over a range of commodities.

* All Australian officials and others in China have witnessed in recent weeks and months the increasing willingness of the Chinese to assist Australians in everything they are trying to do and the extremely friendly relations that they exhibit towards Australians at every level.

* As I announced last week, real progress has been made towards finalising a 3-year long term wheat agreement with the Chinese and indeed agreement has already been reached with the Chinese on the signing of this agreement.

* With him and with others both in South and North Korea and with the Chinese Foreign Minister, I had discussions about the relations of their countries with other countries.

* One notes how the leader of this sensitive Government one week refers to the Chinese as 'carpetbaggers' and next week disparages the Foreign Minister of Canada.

* It is appalling that an Australian Government should be quite unable to obtain any information about the whereabouts of an Australian citizen  ot  even to speak about his whereabouts directly with the Chinese Government.

* Our hearts go out to the Chinese people as they mourn the death of Mao Tse-tung.

* His inspired analysis of the Chinese situation led to the recognition of the key role to be played by the masses of the people, who in China were the peasants.

* He merged the cause of national liberation with the goal of social revolution to overthrow the Chinese ruling class.

* In the cultural revolution he alerted the Chinese revolution and all social revolutions to the dangers of the re-emergence of the ruling cliques or classes.

* He had a profound faith in the ability of the Chinese people to overcome the vast obstacles that faced them and to carry through an effective revolution.

* His firm conviction placed an indelible stamp on the course of the Chinese revolution, and on the revolutionary theory that the world has inherited from Mao Tse-tung.

* I have observed at first hand many examples of the Chinese people taking joy in their work for the benefit of the whole society.

* Mao stressed the need for the Chinese economy to be self-reliant.

* After more than a century of exploitation by colonialist powers, and economic disruption at the hands of the Soviet Union, the Chinese economy has been set upon the course of self-reliance.

* The Chinese people foresee it.

* However, my visits to China, particularly the second visit a few months ago, have left me totally convinced that, for the Chinese people, no struggle is too great and that the will of the vast majority of the people will undoubtedly prevail.

* His thoughts have guided the Chinese revolution for 50 years and they will live long in the future achievements of new China.

* British ships carry Chinese and Russian weapons from Hong Kong and elsewhere to Haiphong.

* Department of External Affairs publications, blatantly concocted for party-political use, were put out showing Chinese weapons and inferring Chinese intervention.

* Three visits to Peking were made by officers of the Overseas Property Bureau and the Interior Design Section of the Department of Housing and Construction associated with the furnishing of the15 staff apartments recently allotted by the Chinese authorities.

* But of course, the facts are that United States representatives and the Chinese have met in Warsaw off and on over a very considerable period of time and no progress has been made.

* He has clearly become a Chinese candidate for the next Australian elections.

* So the question immediately arises: What other secret promises were made in private discussion between the Leader of the Opposition and the various Chinese representatives at different levels?

* Let us forget the wars of liberation for a moment as the Leader of the Opposition plainly has and just recall the gross Chinese interference in the attempted PKI coup in 1965.

* He discarded the Canadian formula as soon as the Chinese said that it was not acceptable to them.

* On every occasion, the transcript will show, he accepted the Chinese policy.

* When the Leader of the Opposition spoke to the Chinese about it he was apparently told that the Chinese knew nothing about it.

* Then the best that he could do was to appeal to the Press and say how Francis James had supported Chinese policies and that if the Press could convince the Chinese that Francis James was a friend of China, they might let him go.

* He is the Chinese candidate for the next Australian election; he is the Chinese advocate for the Chinese cause in Australia and around the world.

* In that case we will be condoning the sweating and exploitation of Chinese labour by the Chinese communist state.

* If it turns out that there is sweated labour, by Australian standards, in these industries where there is imported from overseas the technological efficiency of our industries, we should take steps to see that the products of such industries are not imported into Australia because either we should protect the Australian workmen or, alternatively, if we have any international obligations at all, they include the international obligation to assist in protecting the Chinese worker against exploitation by his own state machine.

* It was about the time of the Senate elections last year that the Canadian Government finalised its arrangements for the recognition of Communist China anr) 2 weeks after that was announced to the world the Chinese announced that the Canadians had won a bumper contract, one of the best that the Canadian Government had ever pulled off.

* All honourable members on the other side of the chamber on the Country Party benches and on the Liberal Party benches know that, contrary to their claim that trade and politics in China do not mix - a little in the same way as sport and politics do not mix in South Africa - the reality is that the Chinese Government has announced that they do mix.

* The Chinese have indicated that they prefer at present to buy wheat from Canada, which recognises them, rather than from Australia, which does not.

* One of the statements was that the Chinese did not buy wheat from Australia because the price of wheat was going up.

* So the Chinese waited.

* The Chinese were waiting for the price of wheat to go up so they can buy it at a higher price.

* He used the term 'Chinese people', but 1 dare say that the Chinese Government would regard the term 'Chinese people' as relating to the Chinese Government.

* What the Government is trying to get the Chinese to agree to is nonsense.

* What  Mr N.  H. Bowen,  Mr McMahon  and  Mr Anthony  are really trying to tell the Australian people is that it is not reasonable for the Chinese to refuse to go into the United Nations as one China with some rival claimant to the same power sitting opposite them.

* The people who should be asked this question are the Chinese themselves because they are the people whom you are trying to win over.

* It has been stated in official or semi-official statements of the Chinese Government that the Canadian Government from now on will receive priority.

* To put it in a negative way, it means that Australia will receive last consideration from the Chinese.

* To put the matter more bluntly, the assertion of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon),  the  Deputy  Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry that Australia's foreign policy or ministerial criticism of China has had nothing to do with the loss of the huge Chinese wheat market is false.

* The Chinese Foreign Minister,  Mr Chi  Peng-Fei, and the Minister for Foreign Trade,  Mr Pai  Hsiang Kuo, made it patently clear that as regards trade with Australia, economics and trade cannot be separated from political decisions.

* I quote the words of the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade,  Mr Pai: 
Firstly, Australia is supporting Chiang Kai-shek and has established diplomatic relations with Taiwan; secondly, Australia has continuously opposed the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations; thirdly, Australia supports and follows United States aggression in South East Asia; fourthly, Australia refuses to recognise the Government of the People's Republic pf China as the sole legal government representing all the Chinese people, including the people of the Province of Taiwan; and lastly, Australia is collaborating with the USA to create 2 Chinas, or one China and one Taiwan and is, therefore, interfering in the internal affairs of China.

* As regards the possibilities of future trade, the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade informed the delegation that if the Australian Government changed its present policies of hostility towards China then Australia would receive the same consideration and priority as Canada, but until this happens Canada has first priority to supply the wheat required by China.

* It must be patently obvious that to try to blame myself or the Labor Party and to maintain that Australian Government policies have nothing whatsoever to do with the loss of the Chinese wheat market is absurd and wrong.

* As the Chinese Foreign Ministers say: 'Politics is the fundamental question.'

* As regards the restoration of the wheat trade with China, the facts are that while in China I did everything possible to persuade Chinese authorities to alter their wheat policy as it presently discriminates against the Australian wheat grower and to resume wheat purchases from the Australian Wheat Board.

* Contrary to the Deputy Prime Minister's crude attempt to blame me personally for the loss of last month's wheat sale, if the Chinese Government does decide to resume wheat purchases from Australia in the near future it will do so because of the explanations and pleas which we made to China's trade policy makers on behalf of the Australian wheat farmers.

* The danger now is that, because of this deceit in attempting to blame the Labor Party delegation to China and myself in particular as well as refusing to accept the real reasons why China has suspended wheat purchases, Chinese Ministers who are contemptuous of Australian Government foreign policy may now completely dismiss the extra considerations they were prepared to give to the case that Australian wheat farmers, via the Wheat Board, are distinct from the Australian Government.

* The facts are that Australia was incredibly lucky not to lose its wheat sales to China in 1967 when the Wheat Board introduced politics into its negotiations by handing the Chinese buying agents a threatening political note.

* I do not believe that any responsible Chinese authority on the Chinese wheat trade so informed him.

* Does it honestly think that the Chinese Government regrets the presence of American troops in Vietnam?

* The Chinese have not the slightest regret at the presence of American troops in Vietnam any more than the Communists in the French Chamber of Deputies had any regret when they voted with the ultra-right to overturn Mendes-France so that he would not give independence to Algeria.

* It seems to me that in every world situation Chinese policy is to support the Mau Mau type of activity, the anarchist type of activity, the National Liberation Front type of activity - the  sort  of thing that the Arab guerillas are engaging in.

* We always dismiss the Chinese as liars.

* The Chinese are critics of the whole of the West, including Russia, and it may well be that from them there are sometimes utterances of truth.

* Now that an Australian delegation has gone to Communist China perhaps we could ask the members of that delegation to look at what happened in Tibet where religious persecution was accompanied by wholesale genocide, where the Dalai Lama, the religious leader of the country, is in exile and where that country is still being closed by its Chinese overlords to any visit by observers from democratic nations.

* 1 see in today's Press that the Chinese communists are putting up the prices of their exports.

* On the other hand, when wages are low and the extra super profits are being used, the workers are being exploited by the Chinese state.

* Either products of sweated labour will be dumped here and elsewhere throughout the world at cheap prices or e'se the Chinese state, exploiting its own workers as so many communist states do - this is a matter of express and general communist policy - will be taking what I think Lenin called super profits from these unhappy factors of production.

* I feel that we should be asking him and his delegation specifically to bring us back a factual report about communist Chinese wages.

* Surely the most important fact which every Australian worker will want to know from the delegation is what is the Communist Chinese wage level, because the products made by cheap sweated labour are in competition with him, his products and his wage level.

* Should we be living on the products of sweated labour, or if the goods are to be increased in price - apparently, if the newspaper report is to be trusted, the Communist Chinese State now proposes to make J 00 per cent superprofit out of the sweated labour of its workers - surely we should know something about it.

* have a delegation going there, this information is something from which we can learn and which the Chinese can give us.

* The Government might well feel embarrassed in relation to its new Chinese communist friends if it had to take on its own single initiative something like this.

* We now have as a direct result of the highly successful visit of the Prime Minister to China a working relationship with the Chinese.

* Let me say that rightly or wrongly I believe the Chinese are non-aggressive at thus point of time.

* The Chinese Ministry of Information (within the Foreign Affairs Department), has arranged trips for foreign correspondents in Peking to selected communes and other areas.

* His  work has however been made more difficult by the failure of the Chinese authorities to provide the ABC office in Peking with the HSINHUA News Wire Service- the principal source of official news in China.

* Honourable members opposite want this man who lives in the bosom of the Communist Chinese to dominate Cambodia.

* -During the past month a Chinese delegation known as 'Minmetals mission' has been in Australia.

* I am not in a position to disclose the details of negotiations that have taken place at this stage, although I will do so as soon as they have been cleared by the Chinese authorities and the companies concerned.

* This is very much in accord with the 
Now that we have his Leader's joy with China - the honourable member himself spoke about the hysteria of the Western world in watching the Chinese - should we no longer watch the Chinese?

* Are we to hand the information to the Chinese on a plate?

* I say: Let him go; let him ask the Chinese exactly what their defence secrets are and what their provision for the defence of their homeland is; and let him bring that information back to the Australian people.

* Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to indexed item 55- Chinese communications on resumption of wheat trade, 1971.

* The most charitable explanation of the Prime Minister's statement is that he is seeking to ingratiate himself with the Chinese.

* Wedded as he is to the doctrines of confrontation, to notions of monolithic 'camps' and 'blocs' in world affairs, the Prime Minister imagines that the only way Australia can please the Chinese is by insulting the Soviet Union.

* General Macarthur wanted to attack the Chinese bases beyond the Yalu River, but he was not allowed to do so.

* In the House on 21 October 1964 he developed a colourful theory about Chinese nuclear blackmail.

* He said: 
What is to prevent the Chinese from sending a merchant ship with a nuclear weapon in it to some harbour?

* Then some situation could arise and some city would be under blackmail from Chinese nuclear power.

* In the House on 19 August, 1971 he accused me of being 'the Chinese candidate for the next elections' and 'the candidate for the Chinese cause throughout the world'.

* Perhaps we should all begin to learn the Chinese way of pronouncing 'Taiwan'.

* Oh, yes, it is true that they have not had regular troops outside their borders except in circumstances which might be justified; but nobody can deny that the Chinese have fought by proxy outside their borders.

* But the honourable gentleman said: 
Let us look in this regard at Africa: Burundi, Dahomey, Upper Volta, the Central African Republic and Ghana which expelled Chinese who were fermenting insurgency in that country.

* But the Leader of the Opposition stated: 
Can honourable members imagine any better way of reviving Japanese militarism than by fomenting, pouring oil on the flames of Chinese hostility to Japan?

* Then, when  Mr Chou  denounced *he Soviet Union for terminating the Sino-Soviet friendship treaty, the Leader of the Opposition said: 

 Mr WHITLAM: If my party wins the elections you will be able to see the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister to the Chinese People's Republic and its sole capital, Peking.

* The Leader of the Opposition has failed in his trade objective because now he has politicised trade in a way in which it has not been politicised before and now the Chinese cannot trade with us without going back on what they have told the honourable gentleman who is about to speak and the Leader of the Opposition.

* The Chinese will say: 'If you want us to buy your wheat, you must recognise us', or: If you want us to buy your wool, you must cut off your relationship with the United States'.

* I mention the Chinese who, in the 19th century, joined in our rush for gold as the fields were discovered, explored and exploited.

* The experience with the early Chinese immigrants was one of success so far as enterprise was concerned, irrespective of the difficulties of the terrain, the cUmate, or whatever they had to face at that time.

* In all the contracts which have been made with the People's Republic of China, it has been found necessary to include a clause strictly limiting the tonnages which the Chinese may nominate for loading at these ports.

* Chinese history has a remarkably consistent cycle of periods of strong central government effectively administering an extensive empire because it has maintained and can maintain the support of the people of the nation.

* Chairman  Mao's period of office, as I said, restored that strength and vitality of the Chinese empire.

* The Chinese have a greater sense of history than any Westerner can ever understand.

* I expect, knowing a little of Chinese history, that the Chinese would regard themselves as having been rescued from the humiliation which they suffered with the decay of the Manchu dynasty; the period of unequal treaties when Western imperialistic powers- and they could truly be described as imperialistic colonial powers of that period- brazenly exploited and plundered China, sought to undermine the confidence of the people of that country and to sap any strength and cohesion which Chinese society may have had, in order to exploit China commercially.

* I do not think that people should lose sight of the fact that after promising a revolution to restore the pride, confidence and strength of the Chinese empire, Chiang Kai-shek first turned the machine guns on the striking workers in Shanghai in the early 1920s- workers who had struck to facilitate his takeover of the country- then proceeded to collaborate with the very people who had been responsible for the destruction and subjection of China for so long.

* The revolution succeeded because it was able to attract the confidence and patriotic support of the Chinese people.

* Chairman Mao was able to revive the country culturally, socially and economically and to restore the pride of the Chinese people- something which has been a strong ingredient throughout the millennia of their recorded history.

* The high death rates of which I read when I studied Chinese historythe deprivation, the exploitation, the few who are very rich and the mass of people who are very poor- no longer exist.

* Fulsome or not, at least they were helpful and showed a better understanding of the need to welcome China 's and the Chinese people's participation in world affairs.

* The Soviet Union is greatly advantaged by the Chinese operation in Vietnam.

* They do not like the Chinese idea of military operations to teach people lessons.

* They feel some unease about the link between these events and the Chinese attitude towards Chinese elsewhere in the world.

* However, I draw the attention of the House to the position of Thailand which is subject to strong pressure to assist in the Chinese resupply of the Democratic Kampuchean forces.

* Under  Sir Paul  Hasluck it was the Chinese who had been raised to the front rank as the devils in the Asian area, lt was under  Sir Paul  Hasluck that the Russians were downgraded: they were good and the Chinese were bad.

* If the honourable member cares to do a bit of solid study he will see that the Chinese Government merely accepted from Canada a statement that the Canadian Government took note of the situation.

* The Russians are in the area, the Japanese are in the area and the Chinese are also in the area.

* they will realise that some of the nations today are working on the old strategy of the Chinese General Sun Tzu who said, in effect: 'If you want to conquer a people send in your agents to brainwash them and undermine their morale.

* It did not come from the Government of the People's Republic, nor did it come from anyone with an official status in the Chinese Government.

* from our side, anyway, there was never any indication given by the Chinese that they required  Mr Peacock  to resign his portfolio before he visited China.

* I don't know where he got that information from, but it certainly wasn't from us because all the negotiations which took place between the Chinese representatives, myself and my brother, nothing of the sort was ever suggested.

* Not the Chinese.

* Not the Chinese.

* The Foreign Minister said on Friday evening: 
The Foreign Minister further stated on Friday that the stumbling block for the Australian Government, not the Chinese Government, was the fact that the invitation was to the Minister for the Army.

* Instead the Prime Minister gave the Parliament a fantasy, a fabrication, designed to put the Chinese in a false light.

* He said that the Chinese had fiddled about.

* He said that they - the Chinese or the Messrs Kibel - had thought is wise for the Minister to give up his portfolio.

* He said they had given as the reason the importance of the People's Liberation Army in Chinese affairs.

* It was to put the Chinese into a poor light in the eyes of the Australian people on this matter.

* He wanted us to believe that the Chinese were the sole stumbling block to more sensible relations - that they were acting without rhyme, without reason, as he asserted on this very matter 3 months ago.

* Not for him to worry that in doing so he makes certain the very thing he professes to deplore, that he makes it certain that the Chinese will become more wary and cautious of any Australian approach on trade or diplomacy.

* Not for him to worry that the Kibels - acting as they were with disinterested patriotism and utter scrupulousness and discretion - are embarrassed with the Chinese officials with whom they must conduct their own business.

* Furthermore, I look forward to further visits to Australia of Chinese Ministers.

* The Chinese clearly did not understand what had happened in Australia.

* I have suggested that as an interim measure China might take wool from the sourthern parts of Australia until Chinese technicians can come here to survey the situation.

* I am also hopeful that the Chinese, as a result of information I was able to give them on the International Sugar Agreement, will consider their position in that regard.

* The Chinese have informed me that they are interested in buying, amongst other things, more wheat, sugar, iron ore, steel and wool.

* The then Labor Party member for Alice Springs in the Northern Territory Legislative Council deplored the proposal saying that it would attract Chinese rockets.

* Is there any sign of a diminution of Chinese support for insurgency in, for example, Burma or in the Marxist-Leninist party in Malaysia and in other South East Asian countries?

* Our policy on tariff protection should never be decided according to what suits the Japanese manufacturers, the Chinese manufacturers or anybody else who has an interest.

* The Gang of Four did nothing other than keep the Chinese people in a complete and utter revolutionary confusion.

* Therefore, how could the Chinese people advance and continue to make their way in the world with a series of revolutions?

* We can do nothing but congratulate the Chinese People's Government in realising that they are now anxious to establish themselves, to work with the rest of the world and to improve China's technology.

* We hope that the Chinese people agree with us and want us to work together.

* The visit which I made to the People's Republic of China between 25 April and 4 May had two main purposes- to maintain and develop contact and communication between the Australian and Chinese Governments, and to explore the prospects of increasing and diversifying an economic relationship which is highly important to both our countries.

* The Chinese Government regards the Prime Minister's visit in 1976 as having been a great success and is pleased with the reception which the National People's Congress Delegation, led by Vice Chairman Ulanfu, received in Australia last year.

* The Chinese Government is aware, as a result of my visit, that the Australian Government had noted the significance of Chinese high level visits to Australia in 1977 and fully reciprocates China's interest in the maintenance of contact and dialogue at a high level.

* The Chinese leadership frankly acknowledges that it faces a multitude of uncertainties in moving along the road to becoming a developed society.

* Indeed, as I have already described it in China, the Chinese have now embarked on their second long march.

* The Chinese Government has made clear the value it sees in these exchanges and has also, in a direct way, informed me of its requirement for natural resources from Australia in addition to technology and plant equipment.

* I was assured by Chinese authorities that although China planned to rapidly increase its own production of steel the planned rate of production would be insufficient to meet their needs.

* I expect that there will be continuing export opportunities for Australian iron and steel in the Chinese market.

* The Chinese Government informed me that it now seeks to buy patents and this removes an obstacle which has existed in the past to the sale of advanced Australian technology.

* My discussions with Chinese leaders also covered in some detail the question of people to people contact.

* For example, our teachers and students in China on government exchange programs, some of whom I met, and over 20 teachers directly recruited by the Chinese authorities, are making an important contribution to better understanding.

* It is appropriate that I should put on record in Australia as I have expressed directly to my Chinese hosts, my appreciation of the warm reception which I received in China 's three major cities and of the positive and practical approach taken by Chinese leaders in all my discussions.
