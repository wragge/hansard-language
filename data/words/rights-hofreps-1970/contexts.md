## Contexts in which the word "rights" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* First or second position on the ticket of u major party ensures election and Stales' **rights** must come a poor second to that sort of logic.

* I am surprised that the Minister for Housing and Construction would support such a measure because he, above all people, as a member of the Public Works Committee, was a champion of the **rights** of the little people to have a voice in big government expenditure.

* Firstly, the Government believes that it ought to be possible to appoint 7 commissioners to run TAA, instead of 6 as at present, and that the Act should enable the General Manager to be appointed as a commissioner, with the same **rights** and responsibilities as other commissioners.

* What a tremendous irony it is that a Leader of the House should come before this chamber seeking to restrict the **rights** of members to participate in a full examination of issues during the course of an adjournment debate.

* One sees that in 1969-70 $15,566,000 was received from air navigation charges, $4,875,000 from rentals, business trading **rights** and so on, and $10,517,000 from aviation fuel tax; while $5,175,000 was spent on runways and taxiways maintenance, $2,692,000 on buildings maintenance, $5,434,000 on maintenance of navigational aids and other communication facilities, $4,229,000 on meteorological services and $18,531,000 on operational services and general expenses.

* In so far as superannuation, retirement and employement security benefits are concerned the Bill continues certain provisions in the existing Papua New Guinea law and preserves the continuity of pensions and the **rights** of contributors.

* We do not have lefts and **rights**, anti-Communists and proCommunists within the Liberal Party.

* Additionally, section 23 (o) and section 23 (p) relating to income derived from gold mining and sale of **rights** to mine minerals respectively provide for total exemption from income tax.

* If it does uphold the principle, a government with a majority in either House could bring in any rnining code it liked and then we could discuss the **rights** and wrongs of it.

* One could almost say that the Act has been, since it was first introduced, with its so-called constitutional **rights** to certain union organisations, responsible for the type of situation with which Australia has been confronted for many years and which is still in existence.

* It appears clear that the **rights** and wrongs of a dispute will not be investigated now.

* There is protection of the **rights** of the people and everything that goes with it, yet the member for the Northern Territory today said that those people do not need additional representation when everybody in the House knows that he is a complete failure himself.

* It indicates the difficulties that are associated with ex-servicemen, former members of the Services, and their **rights** under the Repatriation Act.

* I have to compliment those committees for the work they are doing, but, as the honourable member for Grayndler said to me, I hope that in the process we will regard ourselves and the Ministers will regard themselves as the protectors of the **rights** of this Parliament and the people of this country and not allow the bureaucracy to put into law what it wants because it might find it easier to administer the amendments it wants rather than the amendments that the representatives of the people want.

* I am assured it is a basis which will not deny any individuals the capacity to rely on the protections that exist within each of these ordinances but rather will protect any **rights** that they may have.

* The needs of local and semi-government authorities are considered at Australian Loan Council meetings but the allocation of borrowing **rights** among local bodies is a responsibility of the appropriate State government.

* We must in providing them realise that the people who go into these homes should continue to be independent and to exercise independent **rights** as individuals in our society.

* If not permitting such activity were an infringement of civil **rights** and civil liberties of Australians citizens I make no apology for expressing that point of view.

* An assurance was given that in any amalgamation the employees would not be disadvantaged in respect of wage rates, long service leave, seniority **rights** in some cases and superannuation.

* I express dissatisfaction at the fact that this motion denies the **rights** that honourable members have and which can be exercised only on certain daysnormally a Thursday.

* For example the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, in relation to its mineral exploration **rights** in Portuguese Timor and Trans-Australia Airlines in regard to its operations to Timor, have been experiencing considerable difficulties.

* The Opposition recognises the **rights** of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with our society.

* So it is quite within my **rights** to demand that world experts be brought in.

* I suggest that with regard to this question, which involves very difficult questions of international law, the Parliament should look at the **rights** of States in international law.

* Mr Wran's  hypocrisy must be exposed and must be nailed to the wall here and now, because this great champion of lower taxation, this man who says he wants to reduce the burden on the people of New South Wales, has to my certain knowledge never made a public statement conceding that under Stage II of the federalism policy he can in fact exercise his **rights** to grant a rebate.

* Those who are performing duties which are better fitted to Public Service employment and who are not qualified or suitable for appointment as police officers would remain in Public Service Act positions and retain normal Public Service **rights**.

* Let me remind honourable members once again that nine of the Vietnamese refugees have been denied basic political **rights** in Australia and this is something that has never happened before in the history of this country.

* They want to be involved in a growth tax, they want a share of the income tax collected and they have, in fact, for the first time since the abolition of the income taxation **rights** for States become eligible to receive 40 per cent of all the income tax collected.

* As I said at the beginning, this clause is bad enough, but when I hear these sorts of arguments, I am terrified that anyone ought to have these sorts of powers because what we are dealing with are the **rights** and liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen and what this clause is dealing with is the crime of subversion.

* One of the important features of the agreement was that it took account of the interests and **rights** of all the parties involved, contrary to what the Minister now would have us believe.

* They have opposed the **rights** of people as individuals.

* The effect of the Bill will be to bring those of the present judges who were appointed before 1 December 1973, the date on which Papua New Guinea achieved self-Government, under the Australian Judges' Pensions Act, so that their pension **rights** are guaranteed by Australian legislation.

* He did not state that the Australian Housing Corporation was taking over some of the **rights** and privileges of the States.

* Supporting mothers have sacrifices imposed on them at the expense of their infants to keep intact the Prime Minister's strange notions of the **rights** of the better off and the privileged in our community.

* It is interesting to note that at yesterday's hearing the federal unions, particularly the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Workers Union, made it quite clear that they wanted an absolute assurance that any joint sitting arrangements would not interfere with their **rights** and their operations and would not adversely affect their members involved in other refineries throughout Australia.

* The States wanted to guard very jealously their **rights** to maintain their approach to the construction of water con?

* The Government is also guaranteeing that any transferrable **rights** for hostels will be honoured.

* It does not take into account the responsibilities of State planning authorities; it ignores the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* I would simply make the point that whatever the **rights** and wrongs of Australia 's participation in the Vietnam war- and that can be argued at great length in this Parliament- I believe that no one in this Parliament should argue that Australia does not have a great moral responsibility to take additional numbers of these people from their refugee camps in Thailand.

* The real issues are jus jtice equality before the law and a guarantee that people can get equal **rights** irrespective of income.

* Yet in respect of these 2 ships the Minister for Transport, a Minister of a Labor Government which claims to champion the **rights** of the people, did not tell the Parliament that the maximum  subsidy  offered by the new Labor Government was only 25 per cent, the bottom of the barrel.

* I have mentioned to the previous member for Sturt on a number of occasions the number of points of order that he took- I can say that many of them were not really points of order- and the number of times that he objected and stood up for what he considered to be his **rights**.

* The intent of the Bill is to provide that in any reciprocal agreement this German migrant could become naturalised without losing his German pension entitlement and, conversely, an Australian who is in receipt of some social service payment who goes to Germany and there becomes a naturalised German citizen would not lose his Australian **rights**.

* If, for reasons of national interest, changes have to take place and people have to be disemployed, that will be done with proper protection and with proper **rights** to retraining  - things that the previous Government apparently never thought of.

* If, like the Prime Minister, one were a dedicated anarch-capitalist who relished an Ayn Rand-type society where governments exist only to police the property **rights** of the very wealthy, maybe one would applaud the Government's methods.

* The whole meaning and purpose of the Liberal phoney war over States' **rights** is to protect private affluence and perpetuate public squalor.

* It is a State **rights** matter as to whether the laws of the State should allow or disallow abortion.

* I hope that the relevant Ministers will examine it to make sure that Commonwealth employees enjoy the same **rights** in this area as other members of the community.

* The 2 matters of difference between the Government's Bill and the Opposition's amendment relate to the period of residence which enables a migrant to become eligible for portability **rights** and to reciprocal agreements on pensions with other countries.

* There is not much purpose in encouraging people to explore if they are uncertain about their **rights** to be involved in subsequent developments.

* Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 6 of the principal Act to ensure, inter alia, that the appointment of a judge as Director does not affect his **rights** and privileges as the holder of his judicial office.

* To call the national strike apparently without even getting a resolution passed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions saying there should be a national strike unquestionably shows an approach to a Government of this country and to the **rights** of citizens in this country which rides completely roughshod over the concept of elected members of the public coming to this House and deciding economic and other policies.

* In order that these entitlements will not be wasted and to add further stimulus to the legislation, the Bill introduces a provision which will enable an organisation which does not intend to take advantage of its **rights** to transfer them in whole or in pan to another eligible organisation, subject to the approval of the Director-General of Social Security.

* The point I want to make to the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  the honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  and the honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  is that under section 5 1 of the Constitution this clause relating to 'just terms' was inserted specifically to protect the **rights** of the States in relation to land acquired.

* However, when read in conjunction with other outbursts by the Government on industrial matters, the statement is seen as an insidious attempt to prevent unions from fighting for the **rights** of their members.

* The report of the International Commission of Jurists of May 1974 showed evidence of a massive and continuing violation of human **rights** which suggested a planned campaign of systematic liquidation.

* He has undermined Australia's credibility as a nation prepared to act on questions of self-determination and human **rights**.

* I consider that under the Constitution any judicial interpretation on what are our **rights** belong to this House alone and to no other body.

* These national servicemen will have the same **rights** as those Australians who served in the rotten conditions in New Guinea.

* The Export Market Development Grants Bill provides that grants will be payable to claimants on eligible export market development expenditure in respect of any goods, services, property **rights** or know-how which are substantially of Australian origin.

* We have heard much tonight from the Liberals and the Country Party members about the **rights** of individuals.

* I do not want to argue the **rights** and wrongs of this case or what the Minister could do about it.

* They have continued to produce a surplus, and are very jealous of their States' **rights**.

* This is a crucial Bill as it concerns the Government's credibility on the whole question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* People have asked, very surprisingly, about the taxation **rights** of this body and complained about exemption from taxation as if it were some greatly significant body in competition with commercial publishers.

* The Government, by causing this delay, has not only unilaterally and surreptitiously cut the **rights** of all past servicemen who have not yet used their entitlement for home assistance, but it has also breached the contract to which it was party with enlisted servicemen.

* In similar fashion their objections to other pieces of associated legislation simply complicated the transition from the old health insurance scheme to the new Medibank, deprived members of the public of protection of their **rights** as contributors to private health funds and stopped implementation of reforms in the supervision of health insurance organisations, as had been recommended by the Nimmo Committee inquiry into health insurance which was set up, honourable members will recall, by the then LiberalCountry Party Government in the late 1 960s.

* In any reasonable assessment of what happened last Saturday, it was a blundering, unnecessary performance and a clear exercise of political discrimination by a Minister who pleads the **rights** of democracy but practices the principles of partiality in support of those he wishes to advantage.

* Women who are aware of social issues and who like to think that they should be treated with full civilian **rights** and have opportunities available to them in much the same way as you gentlemen have opportunities available to you feel oppressed and discriminated against.

* But those days of  laissezfaire,  I am glad to say, have long since passed and there should be no dispute as to the **rights** and duties of air operators adequately to insure their passengers against all eventualities.

* It ought to be, and I am sure it is, understood by honourable members that in these circumstances applications will be made, as they have been made on other occasions by servicemen to opt out of an exercise, and these crew members are exercising their normal **rights**.

* As it is a seed borne disease, control can be achieved by injection of funds into research or with the introduction of plant variety **rights** legislation.

* After all, we realise that when a person builds on a rural property, after gaining the permission of the owner- the owner might be that person's parents- to occupy that dwelling, that person has no actual legal **rights** which will protect him in the long term.

* He said that the average presence was 3 to 4 ships and that they had no base **rights**.

* custodian of the **rights** and privileges of this House you,  Mr Speaker,  must be deeply concerned.

* There will be a basic reform of the Australian Education system, the development of a schools commission and a pre-schools commission, the abolition of university fees, the overhaul of our social welfare system, the introduction of a universal health insurance system, the establishment of a school dental service, the establishment of Aboriginal land **rights** and the setting up of a cities commission.

* It boils down to the very simple fact which we recognise, that the States have **rights** in these matters.

* Recently the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  announced that assistance to the value of about $5,000 to $6,000 would be given to a woman at Ferntree Gully to fight against quarry operations which were allegedly despoiling the environment and encroaching onto the communal **rights** of nearby residents.

* Yugoslavia, although it is said to be developing human **rights** programs, is still a communist country.

* In the last 11 years there have been significant changes to ensure the protection of the **rights** of the individual - the consumer.

* The people will have their democratic **rights**, but they will be unable to exercise them.

* I would Uke to go on and talk about the anti-social greed of the grasping mining com- panies whose record in relation to Aboriginal and **rights** is a shabby one indeed.

* The sooner we cause these things to become **rights** by legislative enactments, the better; the sooner we minimise ministerial prerogative, the better.

* The Russians have been trying to negotiate with India for **rights** to naval bases, particularly in the Nicobar and Andaman Islands, which would enable them to control the eastern approaches to the Indian Ocean via the Straits of Malacca.

* This situation creates difficulties in that an employee, a shop steward, a junior trade union official and even a senior trade union official have to look at 2 sets of statutes, State and national, in order to ascertain the **rights** and obligations of the union and its members.

* The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal **rights**, civil liberties and the freedoms of a democratic society.

* In 1963  Dr Philip  Playford of Perth advised the discoverers of the shipwreck of the Dutch East Indiaman  Vergulde Draeck,  or  Gilt Dragon,  that their proper course was to assign all their **rights** in this wreck to the Western Australian Museum.

* Insofar as some gain from that situation and others are penalised because they do not know about the operations of this tax, I think there is a case for at least some kind of better legal assistance which should be given to people in advance so that they can try to establish what their **rights** are.

* Further, will the Attorney-General inquire into this matter with a view to ensuring that bona fide purchasers of **rights** to exhibit or distribute such a film are not prejudiced by unfair competitive practices?

* One wonders what the **rights** of police are in such situations, even in such mundane matters as directing traffic and the extent to which they are able to lay charges against people and to seek to substantiate those charges.

* However because of problems with our overseas airline agreement and the request by the Indonesian airline for reciprocal **rights**, it has been decided to allow only Qantas Airways Ltd to implement the service.

* I think the Government should make a full statement on its Antarctic policy and on whether it sees Australia's role in terms of some kind of exclusive fishing **rights** off the Antarctic coast.

* I am reminded of a story told of the American film producer Samuel Goldwyn who was at one time endeavouring to persuade George Bernard Shaw to hand over the film **rights** to some of Shaw's plays.

* Another pleasing feature of the Bill is that in future the **rights** of passengers travelling on air taxi flights, charter flights and joy rides will be protected and passengers will be entitled to damages in the same way as if they were injured or killed in an accident on a licensed airline flight.

* Since the first congress in 1955, successive congresses have made an intensive examination of the problem of crime in modern society and have explored a number of imaginative and practical measures to meet this problem, covering such diverse areas as the integration of crime prevention planning with planning in urban development and education, new forms and dimensions of crime, the economic and social costs of crime, alternatives to imprisonment, the human **rights** of prisoners and the organisation of research to assist in the formulation of policy to deal with crime.

* Nowhere in this Bill do we find any reference to the **rights** which an employee might have on dismissal.

* Some of the questions of adulthood by which the relations of unconnected persons are affected are: the age of legal responsibility for con.tractural and proprietary **rights**; the question of domicile and citizenship; the age at which certain social freedoms are permitted; the age at which marriage is permitted without parental consent; the age of responsibility in industrial matters; and age limitations in respect of financial legislation.

* With the great earnestness that our Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  may have to carry out such an exercise- I am pleased that he is sitting in the chamber tonight- there would be no possibility of his doing so because of the proprietary **rights** which are Victoria's over the La Trobe Valley coal, and I think that the Minister might agree with me on that point.

* Matters of property, instruments, agreements, proceedings, **rights**, liabilities and the like to which the Board was a party before commencing day are specified in terms of the manner in which transitional arrangements will apply.

* In addition to the ministerial statements, honourable members on this side of the House, under the traditional rules and **rights** of this Parliament, will continue to introduce matters of public importance, and so they should.

* Many people presently are wrestling with the **rights** and wrongs of what is being done by the State Government in that city.

* That is a matter in which he should exercise his **rights** in the Party room.

* Will the Prime Minister indicate in the firmest terms that this legislation is thoroughly unacceptable and further indicate to the Parliament what steps the Government has in mind and when it can make a full statement to the Parliament as to what action it will take to protect the **rights** of Aboriginal people at those two places?

* lt was a civilised social exercise of political **rights** and I believe it was a credit to the community.

* He was essentially a humanitarian who worked untiringly for the **rights** and wellbeing of every Australian.

* I think it is opening a Pandora's box to provide in a Bill that legal aid shall be given in any matter involving public interest without requiring the person seeking the legal aid, or the group of persons, to comply with the eligibility criteria laid down in respect of the pursuit of individual **rights** and individual actions.

* But Tasmanian members are well within their **rights** to ask for such assistance.

* It is a long time since members have spoken on 2 occasions in a debate, and the honourable member for Lilley was quite within his **rights**.

* They have the same **rights** as the rest of the people of Australia.

* Fortunately there is a growing number of institutions which have taken into account the **rights** and opportunities of the individual.

* It would clearly not be appropriate for me as a Commonwealth Minister to offer comment on the **rights**, liabilities or otherwise of individual parties involved in litigation in a State court.

* Queensland dropped its plans for court action and last January Bjelke-Petersen demanded the transfer of coal export levy **rights** to the States.

* I would attribute largely to the Council's tireless efforts to go to the Aborigines and to listen to their own statement of their viewpoint and wishes the present healthy fact that everywhere within Australia Aborigines now approach Government without inhibition or hesitation, speak up for themselves in no uncertain way, and are quick to demand the full measure of their constitutional **rights**.

* It is still fighting philosophical battles with the ghosts of the past and many of its greatest internal **rights** in recent years have been over State aid.

* It preserves the **rights** of present scholarship holders.

* He ought to be trying to protect the **rights** of these people.

* The United States of America is proud of its name and I am proud of the name 'Commonwealth of Australia' for the same reason, because it signifies the unity that was brought about when various States were prepared to give up part of their separate privileges and **rights** to bring about a unified country.

* They would prefer to do that instead of defending the farmers' **rights**.

* It may be thought that amendment (iv) which deals with the academic progress of students assisted by way of grant, loan or by any other means, impinges on the individual **rights** of students assisted.

* The Bill has established a Family Court of Australia which will explore methods of reconciliation and protect the **rights** of all parties in divorce proceedings in an atmosphere of dignity and humanity.

* They do not know whether the fares that exist now will be able to be used as tour basing fares, just when the likely date is to be of the announcement of fares between other points of Europe and other points of Asia; what exactly will happen to other legs in an all-inclusive tour; whether or not the airlines already operating the Australia-London route will be able to sell a cheaper range of fares to and from those points; and what stop-over **rights** will be allowed to passengers on those particular tour basing fares.

* Intransigent adherence to the shibboleth of State **rights** allowed  Sir Robert  to avert for years the Commonwealth involvement in education which his successors have since accepted on a biased, partial and spasmodic basis.

* Again there was an effort to capitalise superannuation **rights** but this could be regarded in a similar way.

* Can the Minister confirm that this is the result of the sale of exclusive television **rights** by the organisers, the Victoria Racing Club, to a commercial television operator who can provide only a limited coverage?

* Honourable mem- bers opposite have gone out into the industry, met the people whom they say they represent and told them their just **rights**.

* It is time that migrants realised that it is this Government which introduced portability of pension **rights** which will enable them to take their pensions with them when they leave the country after they have qualified by residence and after other countries have passed reciprocal legislation.

* People in any other country would consider that we had taken leave of our senses, lost our sense of perspective and lost all sense of reality if in our circumstances we asserted that to pay some limited regard to these factors was in some way perpetrating an intolerable outrage on the democratic **rights** of the vast majority of the population who live cheek by jowl in a handful of metropolitan cities.

* In the field of the protection of human **rights**, the Parliament will recall that very important law, the Racial Discrimination Act, which established a Commissioner for Community Relations and also a Community Relations Council.

* Briefly, these measures will allow capital investment in Australian film **rights** to be written off over a two-year period, instead of, as at present, over a much longer period of up to 25 years.

* We oppose this clause believing that all divisions should be capable of receiving postal votes for other divisions; that it is part of the facilities, the **rights**, and the convenience that should be allowed to citizens; that to pass this clause will again increase the postal votes which will be invalid because they cannot be included in the count; and that it will deny the opportunity to electors to have their votes recorded.

* It domonstrates that this man is not in fact sympathetic with the **rights** and opportunities of the family farmer.

* This is to safeguard the **rights** and obtain the best possible advice on employment with respect to the wool industry.

* No company can be sure as to its **rights**.

* In this respect the position of Papua New Guinea is parallel with a good many tropical African countries and with the West Indies but that **rights** of entry have been extended to Papua New Guinea is very welcome, lt could be that in the future an expansion of trade will develop between Papua New Guinea and the EEC.

* The company says that in relation to present State leasing **rights** generally it agrees to the Authority providing that the Authority allows for the continued existence of individual explorers and developers in co-operation and competition on equal terms with the Authority, and that the Authority confines its activities to the Territories and off-shore areas or leases from the States and undertakes work commitments similar to the rest of the industry.

* The urgency of the task is demonstrated by many reported submissions from countries or organisations wishing to have fishing **rights** or joint ventures established in our area of responsibility.

* But when we look at that in the context of overall expenditure cuts there is no doubting that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has done a sterling job- that is almost a pun because the honourable member represents the seat of Stirling in Western Australia- in ensuring that the **rights** and aspirations of the Aboriginal people are, as far as possible, met in the context of the current economic problems facing this nation.

* I believe we in this House would know how much he owed to the precedent set, not least in Canberra, by his brother, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Allan Fraser)  and his devotion to all matters affecting the **rights** of the citizens.

* Those people are subsidising the airline operators to the extent that their properties are becoming less valuable and they have no **rights** to compensation.

* I am well aware that there are faculties such as engineering, medicine and so on, but - and it does not matter whether the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  sniffs or not - the plain fact of the matter is that some of us have done a little thinking about this over the years and it is, as are so many problems on education, totally insoluble in terms of **rights** or wrongs.

* This procedure avoids the more costly, more inconvenient, more uncertain, more uncomfortable and sometimes hazardous practice of husbands using their conjugal **rights** to put a bit of compulsion on their wives to take the pill.

* Why do they not have travel **rights**?'

* The question to which the Prime Minister replied a moment ago from the honourable member for Lilley indicated one field in which, unfortunately, there seems to be some sections of the trade union movement which are quite intent on denying the **rights** of the individual worker in a way which I am quite sure the responsible members of the trade union movement would abhor.

* A person who is killed on the road has little interest in the fact that he has been able to safeguard States' **rights**.

* I do not intend to go into any technical detail but surely in a democracy information concerning the activities of government and policy decisions should be open to all so that people can know the full nature of their **rights** and privileges as decided by their elected representatives and so that informed and adequate public debate can take place on policy issues to ensure that checks and balances are available on the activities of government.

* I invite the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner)  to turn his attention to clause 9 of the Bin which seeks to give protection against a Federal organisation preventing members exercising their **rights** within a State industrial system.

* justice is done to everyone and to ensure that the **rights** of ex-servicemen are protected.

* They pointed out, not that there was any difficulty at all about obtaining finance, but that the real problem was associated with the slowness with which the Western Australian Government was approaching the problem of providing leases for mining **rights** in that State.

* It is abusing its **rights** as a government by trying to stifle the Opposition and by trying to get this matter before the Australian people by stealth, hoping that in their ignorance they might cast a yes vote.

* One view is that as women have **rights** equal to men as members of the work force, their childbearing role should not be allowed to prevent them from finding work, job advancement or job satisfaction.

* The Minister also shows a concern, which is unique in this hurley burley of mining and so on, for the interests of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* We cannot accept the proposition that Australia's relationship with the Indonesian people will be destroyed if we take a moral stand on the **rights** of the people of East Timor to independence and seek the truth about the death of these S young men.

* Where were the Liberal Party's fine, upstanding principles on individual **rights** on that occasion?

* After all, it is the dignity of the House and the **rights** of members with which the law of privilege is very largely concerned.

* The purpose of the Australian Shipping Commission Bill, as outlined by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones),  is to amend certain provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-73 in order to alter the name of the Commission, to increase the number of Commissioners from five to seven, to make specific provision for the appointment of a full time  chairman  of the Commission- a very worthwhile amendment because of the increasing importance of the Commission- to alter the basis on which the Commission is to be reimbursed for the losses in operation of the shipping services undertaken at the direction of the Minister for Transport, and to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to the **rights** and benefits of the Commission's officers formerly employed in the Australian Public Service.

* The Bill provides for the staff of EPIC to be transferred to the new Corporation without loss of their existing **rights** or privileges.

* I am confident that they will cause the industry to function much more efficiently and with better regard for the **rights** of investors.

* Because of the complications of the new Family Law Act- the protection is much greater than under the old Matrimonial Causes Act but the new Act is much more complicated and accordingly needs qualified legal opinion and legal assistance for interpretation- such a woman who may be on a deserted wife's pension, for example will be forced to go to a private solicitor and pay $120 to protect her legal **rights**.

* I think that she has a much better attitude to the **rights** and powers of this Parliament than does her agent in this country.

* Whilst the Government makes all these moves with regard to regressive taxation measures, it forfeits completely its **rights** to impose such measures as a resources tax on exploitation of our non-renewable energy resources, a capital gains tax, or a wealth tax with an appropriate threshold level.

* He also neglected to mention that in Ballarat in the past two years the Liberal Government has done more, I believe, to strengthen the **rights** of individual trade unionists than any other government in a generation.

* We believe that the Act, as it is currently worded, does not give full protection to the **rights** of the average citizen.

* In Victoria the general view taken is that prosecutions are launched for summary or relatively minor offences in an attempt to get a quick hearing and to have directors convicted so that they lose their **rights** to be directors for some years.

* The anxiety that the establishment of separate local government bodies might be in the Government 's mind and that it might lead to what has variously been described as separate development, the creation of semi-autonomous Aboriginal entities and /or an encroachment on State **rights** under the federal system has occasionally been expressed.

* While the individual **rights** that exist here are still far greater than under totalitarian regimes, they also are being steadily eroded and reduced.

* They have far greater **rights** than any citizen.

* That Atlantic Charter sought to respect the **rights** of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live.

* The Leader of the Opposition has not answered the charge made by the Minister for Social Services that he brought into the House a Bill that would have precluded this country, through the mechanism of reciprocal agreements, from doing what it could in relation to Australian born residents of this country who wanted to go and live in other countries, and in relation to new migrants to this country, to get through our negotiating position the best possible deal on the **rights** that those migrants accrued in their countries of origin.. 
My colleague the honourable member for Warringah  (Mr MacKellar)  has drawn attention to the fascinating grouping of clients of Southwood Press.

* Southwood Press Pty Ltd, incorporated as a company in New South Wales on 28th February 1966, has a nominal capital of $10,000 divided into 300 A class shares with full voting **rights** and 4,700 ordinary or B class shares.

* The honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  talked about education and what we were doing to take away the **rights** of people-parents and individuals- to obtain the education they required.

* The Attorney-General has in mind making available to honourable members the contents of the report that he receives, subject to proper consideration being given to **rights** of particular individuals as they might be affected by it and having regard to any court proceedings that may be possible.

* This has been reflected in the deliberate theft of people's **rights** in the sell-out of their shares in Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd.

* This sort of tradition is a protection of the **rights** of this House of Representatives.

* Certainly the Liberal Party's platform on taxation states that the **rights** of the taxpayers should be safeguarded by ensuring that taxation adjustments do not have a retrospective effect.

* Is there any connection between his failure to impress his Cabinet colleagues on this proposal and his failure to provide his promised land **rights** for Gurindjis?

* Finally, as he has the confidence of neither the Cabinet nor the community-- 
Honourable members opposite complain readily ; I do not argue the **rights** or wrongs ; about an increase in the price of steel or any other commodity, but we do not hear any suggestion that productivity is a matter of grave and considerable responsibility for the individual.

* Did the South Australian Premier write to the Prime Minister on 27th September 1972 in connection with the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway, agreeing to a grant of Crown land for the railway without reservations concerning mineral **rights** and requesting the Commonwealth to keep the existing line from Port Augusta to Marree open whilst necessary for the general welfare of the State of South Australia, subject to arbitration if a dispute arose as to economic viability?

* Each producer, in the **rights** of using  a  common carrier, could set  a rival  and excessive pricing structure according to its whim and belief as to what the market would stand.

* However, they never came into operation because when the business community protested vigorously about these proposed infringements of their assumed **rights** to combine against the interests of the public, the then Government scrapped its original proposals.

* Private members received no **rights** or consideration under the former Government.

* There will inevitably be a great shortage of standard ward beds for many years, and poorer people who in some States, for example Victoria, have had special **rights** to beds in public hospitals will now have to compete with the richer elements in the community for these beds.

* For the first time they have been given somewhere to go with a plea for information about how their country is governed or what they can do to gain their full **rights** as citizens.

* I come now to the other point which has been raised in the media concerning the **rights** of those who volunteered during the period referred to.

* Until we do that, we feel that it is improper and discourteous for us not to talk with the States, because it does have very severe implications as regards some of the authority and some of the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* I state this because before the defeat of the Australian Labor Party Government in Queensland in 1957 rents were controlled and the **rights** of tenants were safeguarded.

* As Leader of the House I am obliged to try to get the business of this House through with the least inconvenience to members  and giving members their full **rights**.

* Tt will also serve to ensure that the- **rights** and property of landholders are adequately protected.

* I suggest that there is nothing more totalitarian in any country than to deprive a man of his liberties and his **rights** as a citizen of the nation by forcing him against his will and his conscience to serve in any armed force.

* In that period of time, of course, I sat next to htm on many DC3 flights to and from Western Australia - in those days only Western Australian members had air travel **rights** - and I got to know him extremely well.

* I simply point out that there is a question on the notice paper which I put down on 8 March last dealing with the announced intention of the Attorney to engage foreign lawyers to advise him on the drafting of certain legislation dealing with Aboriginal land **rights** and restrictive trade practices.

* I say to you,  Mr Speaker,  that you should declare forthrightly and show by every action that you take that you do have the courage of the commitment and conviction to principle that this Parliament will function with full recognition of the **rights** of the Opposition and the Government and the obligations of the Opposition and of the Government.

* I acknowledge that in any consideration of the future of ethnic radio it is absolutely imperative that the **rights** and privileges of minor ethnic groups within the community be taken into consideration.

* This may be very attractive to advocates of State **rights** but it will appear anomalous and retrograde in the eyes of everbody concerned with the proper responsibility for public expenditure.

* It was to the effect that nobody would quibble about an Australian Government asserting its role and **rights** in regard to the housing needs of migrants, servicemen, ex-servicemen, persons living in the Territories, students, employees of the Australian Government or contractors to the Government and their employees.

* On the question of royalties, it would be very hard for a government to be arbitrary and say that Australia's **rights** must be preserved.

* Honourable members will recall that Australia welcomed through a statement of the Prime Minister, joined as I recall by the Leader of the Opposition, the two agreements signed after the Camp David meeting as a constructive framework for resolution of the Middle East conflict based on the provisions and principles of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 and the legitimate **rights** of the Palestinian people.

* At most times they are very jealous of their sovereign **rights**.

* I agree with the honourable member that this is a most important matter that affects the **rights** of the people of Australia.

* I for one have welcomed the new movement - the special drawing **rights** - that has been in existence now for some 3 years or so, which provides for the automatic creation of credit at an international level to allow for the fact that in a growing world population with rising standards, the volume of international liquidity must continue to rise and that it ought not to be dependent upon the price of gold as a metal.

* It also provides protection for their existing **rights**.

* It is not and must not be accepted that the Australian Country Party will, as a result of sarcasm, criticism or abuse, be a party to a redistribution or any other alteration to our electoral laws which will deprive those people living in country areas of their **rights**.

* The point is that clause 114 is directed and devised in order to protect particular types of people from action which can be embarrassing to them or which can be considered as infringing their **rights**.

* Since then, however, there have been protracted negotiations with the Queensland Government on extending the coal recovery **rights** from the field, and also on the freight rates for carriage of the coal to Hay Point.

* The contributors, who paid over $68m to the Medical Benefits Fund during 1970-71, are told their **rights** in clause 18 of the articles of association which I have finally obtained.

* If the Government is sincere in all the statements it makes about equalising the **rights** of the individual, helping the underprivileged and all those sorts of things, why does it not do something about the equalisation of fuel prices throughout Australia?

* There seems to be an ideological battle going on aU the time between centralists and State lighters- those who think that all power should be at the centre and those who think that for some reason the States have some inalienable **rights**.

* Even in the 1950s, an era of which I personally recall, they did not enjoy the normal **rights** that the other workers enjoyed.

* But my hunch, based on discussion with members of the ethnic communities and so on, is that six weeks is not an adequate time for migrants to become skilled enough in the English language for the purposes for which the Government wants to give them training, namely, to ensure they can better fit into jobs and that they can find their way around and have better access to their **rights** as members of the Australian community.

* In other words - 
I circulated another memorandum to all members earlier this week in which 1 pointed out that 1 had had discussions with the Clerks of the House and they had brought to my attention the fact that although 1 had identified the 3 areas in which the House would want to take decisions, because the Standing Orders required motions to be in a technically acceptable form and also to protect the **rights** of members it was desirable to work out the terms of the motions which would be moved to give effect to each of these 3 principles.

* I would have hoped that today the Minister for the Interior would have informed honourable members about the situation and told honourable members how a very prominent member associated with the Liberal Party in South Australia came to lay his hands on this property at a time when the Commonwealth Government was negotiating the purchase of the property, according to the Prime Minister's statement of 26th February of this year relative to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Another area of disagreement concerned the issue of reciprocal **rights** and obligations of exporters and importers, including questions of supply and purchase commitments.

* So, as far as my officers were concerned, he proceeded overseas with all the **rights** and privileges of an Australian citizen.

* I cannot comment on that because the matter has not yet been brought before the courts-- 
The agreement which we are seeking to ratify has been produced as a result of extensive discussions at both ministerial and official level and takes account of the interests and **rights** of all parties.

* It should also be said that the proposed law would certainly be in breach of many of the provisions of the international covenant on civil and political **rights**.

* I put to him the view that that is not a good principle, State **rights** or otherwise.

* Of course, the allocation of mining **rights** is made by the State, as he knows, and not by the Commonwealth Government.

* There is going to be no more of that stupidity because the University has had the sense to gain patents to the **rights** to their own exclusive process in the countries I have referred to.

* An important section of the resolutions that the honourable member for St George pointed out is that an ALP government would recognise the **rights** of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way free from government and judicial interference.

* In any case, in view of the curfew at Sydney (KingsfordSmith) Airport being constantly broken with the approval of the Minister, will he make public the legal **rights** of individuals and organisations to protection against this threat to their way of life?

* SDRs are special drawing **rights** or what were in the early days rather sneeringly described as paper gold.

* I warn the honourable member that a continuance of this conduct may force us to adopt the tactics which the previous Government did and that will restrict completely the **rights** of honourable members opposite.

* But one does look a little askance at what has been happening in State courts, when they have been insisting all the time that these appeals to the Privy Council and that they should maintain their **rights**.

* But whatever the nature of the majority, the **rights** of the individual members remain protected by the charter's emphasis on individual national sovereignty.

* Clause 8 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* Nonetheless, he did make the reasonable point that minority **rights** must be defended in a democracy.

* By asserting our confidence in the AttorneyGeneral we are also asserting our own undoubted and unchallengeable **rights** as members of the House of Representatives.

* The clause has the effect, which I know the Minister did not intend, of taking away from certain pensioners in Australia **rights** which they possess at present.

* I feel that this is an interference with State **rights**.

* That applies to the **rights** of widows and to the question of invalidity.

* The Senate has shown the Government that it cannot simply ride roughshod over not only the States in terms of State **rights** but also the people of those States who are affected by this legislation.

* Basically this is a policy to return a fixed percentage of revenue, and income tax **rights** to the States and to return to a colonial system of government which was old hat 75 years ago.

* It has negotiated and announced its decision on Aboriginal **rights**.

* There are many instances of local authorities approving planning schemes for the development of urban areas around the country which, at this stage, ought to be making allowances for **rights** of way for the use of personally automated transportation, whether or not they are similar to  Mr Loder  's scheme.

* Will he speed consideration of the legislation to confirm the Commonwealth's undoubted **rights** to the Bass Strait area so that it can exercise its undoubted power to fix the well head price of natural gas?

* The threats to the **rights** of the working people, which are contained in this Budget, must be challenged and defeated.

* I might say that the honourable member is way off when he talks in such terms of the current Minister, because it is my understanding that the present Minister for Repatriation cannot claim any praise for his handling of the **rights** and benefits of ex-servicemen.

* Factors such as 'the area of the division', 'the density or sparsity of population' and references to 'disabilities arising out of remoteness or distance' inserted by the previous Government in 1965, are contrary to the concept of equality of political **rights** and encourage departure from the quota of electors in a manner which makes the value of a citizen's vote depend largely upon his geographical location.

* In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears - " assets " includes property and **rights** of any kind and also includes money; " Australian Industry Development Corporation " or " Corporation " means the Australian Industry Development Corporation established under the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970-1973; " Board " means the Board of Directors of the Corporation; " bond " means an investment bond created under this Act; " Director " means a member of the Board; " holder ", in relation to an investment bond, means the person whose name is entered in the Register as the holder of the bond; " National Investment Fund " or " Fund " means the National Investment Fund of Australia constituted in accordance with this Act; " Register " means the Register of Investment Bonds kept in pursuance of this Act; " Supervisory Council " or " Council " means the Supervisory Council established under this Act.

* The interstate commission they envisaged was modelled largely on the commission created in the United Kingdom by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, which was designed to prevent unjust charges and ensure **rights** of through traffic amongst private railway systems.

* Should we not now put the interests of all Australians ahead of State **rights** and Party considerations?

* We may differ in approach along the road to achieving our objectives but I hope that adequate laws to protect the **rights** of consumers are beyond argument in the political context.

* But I do emphasise that specific appeal **rights** will be provided to individuals so that they cannot be adversely affected.

* We are of course concerned internationally that we have a responsibility to the **rights** and aspirations of people in the world.

* I ask the Minister again to consider allowing the Opposition and those interested in this legislation a reasonable period of time within which to consider the legislation and its impact upon the **rights** and the protection of consumers throughout Australia.

* The tendency was a progressive attenuation of the **rights** of the public interest in the land on the one hand and it brought about an increasing allotment to the occupier of all increases in value that occurred to the land.

* To the credit of the Ministers who sat on this side of the chamber in the former Government and who had responsibility in the area of Aboriginal affairs and in the area of urban and regional development, as it then was, I am pleased to record the pleasure that members of the Committee felt in receiving some advance notice so that they had an opportunity to discuss with Ministers Bills, as they then were, on such matters as Aboriginal land **rights** and the National Estate, which had particular interest to the Aboriginal people and which related to their own national heritage, which is of the utmost importance.

* Observance of this arrangement will ensure that the best interests of children involved in " inter-country adoption will be served and that their legal **rights** will be established.

* However, I should also say to the honourable gentleman that should any proceedings of this character be instituted, and should they be proceedings which are capable of being taken- having in mind a question as to the **rights** of people to bring proceedings of this character in the High Court- then no doubt if applications are made to me in relation to legal assistance I will give those requests careful consideration.

* The Minister has positively undertaken that there will be no erosion of these **rights** as a result of the amalgamation.

* May I say in passing that it is extraordinary for members such as the honourable member for Reid to pretend that less time has been given this year to the consideration of Estimates than was given in the past, and that the **rights** of members have been eroded.

* Their effect is to ensure that the **rights** and liabilities of members who commute the whole of their retiring allowance, and of their eligible dependants, are the same as under the existing 50 per cent commutation provisions.

* I only wish its spokesmen would get out in the streets and do a little more for the **rights** of servicemen through political action rather than its leaders preaching some of the nonsense that they have at various times.

* If the honourable member thinks this Government is not exercising its **rights** he should read the record of the infamous administration of his colleagues over 20 years.

* There has been some criticism of this approach particularly from State premiers on the grounds that it infringes State **rights**.

* In view of the fact that this year is International Women's Year, it is sad to see a Bill before this Parliament which not only takes away **rights** to which every Australian woman has always been entitled but which also imposes upon them new obligations.

* These people who would deny  Mrs Whitehouse  her freedom to speak are, I have no doubt, the very same people who shout loudest about their own **rights**.

* This allows protection for the Commonwealth Government and, should objections on a States' **rights** basis be lodged they can be dealt with in this place or in the State parliaments.

* Even though we do not want to encroach upon the sacred and sovereign **rights** of the States I feel that we should at least evaluate and regard these situations.

* Is it a fact that there is no statutory charter setting out the **rights** and duties, not only of the Public Solicitor but also of the indigenous inhabitants who can rarely afford to engage one of the few private practitioners in the Territory and who can still more rarely find one who is not already retained by expatriate interests?

* Because mainland China and the present nationalist Chinese rulers will not budge from their claim over Taiwan - what one might call their legalistic claims - this is no ground for Australia to give away other people's basic **rights** by selling them to the strongest bidder, without even a fight.

* So far as special drawing **rights** are concerned, we indicated that we supported an examination through the International Monetary Fund to increase use of them, but we did point out that we do not believe that there should be an abandonment of the present world monetary system with all the benefits it has given over the last quarter of a century until we really know what would be the benefits and how they could be sustained through an SDR or international currency system.

* They have a respect for the rule of law and for the **rights** of the individual citizen.

* Honourable members opposite have no regard for the free **rights** of people in those nations and want to dictate political courses by interference and by asserting their point of view on those countries.

* The initial step should be for the Commonwealth to provide compensation for those who have a high level of disability assessed irrespective of whether those injured or sick are congenitally so or have become so later in life, and irrespective of whether they have **rights** at common law or under the workers compensation Act.

* Yet today the Attorney-General- the parens pater of the country, the man who should stand and speak to defend the views, the **rights** and the liberties of every subject in this country without fear and without favour- lends the weight of his eminent office and its authority to such a contemptible move as to expect this House of Parliament to deal with this measure in such a short time.

* The Bill provides for: The establishment of mobile polling facilities at hospitals and institutions; the retention of franchise **rights** for persons in the service of the Crown or a public authority outside Australia; a prohibition on sitting members of other legislaturesincluding those of the Territories- from nominating at House of Representatives and Senate elections; a declaration relating to a recent change of name and the printing of a former name on the ballot paper; and a prohibition on the use of offensive or unacceptable names for enrolment and candidature purposes.

* He will have noticed that the Queensland Government has awarded the **rights** over the Oakey Creek coal area in the Bowen Basin to a foreign company, apparently without considering the claims of other companies, including Australian owned and managed ones, and has stipulated that the foreign company must allow a 20 per cent Australian equity in the project.

* There has been a delay because the matter has to be arranged so that the Aboriginals may get their land **rights** established and lease the land back to us.

* The only way in which an authority such as the one suggested by the honourable member could be set up would be for the States to relinquish some of their constitutional **rights**.

* He said that telephone taps are a significant intrusion into the **rights** of the individual.

* I have no opposition whatsoever to the concept of adopting a joint approach to this question, but I do object very strongly to the Commonwealth Government pushing itself over the top of the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* The ultimate sanction that is used on such occasions is that persistent flouting of the limits results in cancellation of operating **rights** of the airline responsible.

* If they find that they have been deprived of their **rights** because of the lapse of time- not by any action of the Governmentthey can lay the blame on the honourable member for Kooyong and the honourable member for New England because they have wasted all this time trying to raise an issue that was not even specified in the matter for discussion and can well be canvassed in the debate on the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* What is involved is the restriction of criticism and the opportunities and **rights** for full discussion in this place.

* Some criticisms of this clause are that it comes dangeroulsy close to the situation where those who would object might seek to obtain, to have and to keep monopoly **rights** into and out of a particular market.

* In view of the immense practical difficulties experienced by individual citizens in exercising their **rights** under the Act without expensive legal costs, and in the light of his assertion this afternoon that he is willing to institute proceedings under the Act, will he ask for a report on newspaper companies which mislead the general public with bogus claims of exclusive stories, particularly disgraceful pieces on  Her  Royal Highness The Princess Margaret, or are the activities of the Murdoch empire, no matter how revolting and how distasteful, completely off limits to his Department?

* The young man reports that on his return to Australia he received the same address and the same impression as to his equal **rights** when he was in camp at Enoggera.

* Clause  45  replaces these outmoded provisions with more equitable procedures for the recovery of the loss of public moneys or stores that are under the control of an accounting officer or for the value of stores lost or deficient or damage to stores due to negligence or misconduct as a debt due to the Government, and gives to the Government, and its employees, the **rights** and protection of the law.

* We believe that the amendment which has been moved expresses the complete disapproval, not only of honourable members in this House but also of the nation, of the actions of the Prime Minister, of his complete disregard for the forms of this House and for the **rights** of members of this Parliament and, as I have already indicated, of the completely contemptuous attitude which he has adopted towards the legislation that is on the notice paper.

* (e) to protect the **rights** of members of the teaching service.

* The Opposition today tries to argue that it initiated a policy of wiping out the old white Australia policy; that it initiated a policy of equal **rights** for allpeople to come to Australia.

* We have announced that a major legislative commitment in the early life of this Government will be the recognition and implementation of Aboriginal land **rights** in the Northern Territory which I expect to introduce before this autumn sitting ends.

* How much more suffering has to be undergone by a people in order to make the Fraser Government listen and to stand up for the **rights** of a people so near our shores to self-determination free from interference?

* The intention is to confer jurisdiction on the Court in matters which, if they arose in isolation, might not be matters of federal jurisdiction but which, arising in association with a matter of federal jurisdiction, must be disposed of at the same time as that matter in order that the **rights** of the parties may be finally determined.

* There have been recent allegations of massive atrocities and these have compounded the basic fears we have all had since that fateful morning in December 1 975- a morning when a despicable chapter was written in blood in the history of our region, a morning when tanks, guns and bombardment served as the curtain upon the basic **rights** of a people to self-determination.

* Clause 20 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, where appropriate, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* I can say only that it has been the intention of the Opposition in moving these amendments to strengthen the Bill in order to give effect to the Government's announced intention to strengthen the **rights** and the prerogatives of the Aboriginal people in determining their own future.

* Commutation will not, however, affect the **rights** of the member's widow or widower to an annuity.

* The trade will continue to flourish while the law protects the property **rights** of traffickers derived from these profits.

* I would like to remind the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Adermann)  that the Opposition will not oppose the motion although I think that to preserve the integrity of this Parliament it would be wise on occasions such as this for us to use the forms of the House to ensure that Ministers understand that they often trample upon the **rights** of all members of the House, particularly members of the Opposition.

* No one in this House or in this nation should lose sight of one of the resolutions of the Australian Labor Party conference at Adelaide earlier this year to the effect that an Australian Labor Party government would recognise the **rights** of unions to regulate their affairs in a democratic way free from government and judicial interference.

* If we cannot get that definition accepted this time perhaps it could be looked at by the proposed committee which will oversee the implementation of this legislation in respect of the **rights** of the traditional owners.

* If we look at the criticisms which are made from time to time by those not in government and who have not the responsibility of government, the usual solutions proposed are that there ought to be large scale resumptions, which clearly affect individual **rights** which Australians correctly expect and maintain.

* They are the ones who will be sacrificed because this Government has been so frugal and so disrespectful of their **rights**.

* I will work in this Parliament and in my electorate as a member of a government which is pledged to work for equal opportunity in education for Australian children; greater employment opportunities; a better deal for pensioners; a real attack on poverty; a proud and progressive Australia a vote for the 18-year-olds in the community and recognition of the status and **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* In other words, this clause does no more than guarantee to a political party that it shall have the same **rights** to its name as a partnership, a trust, a firm or a company once it registers its name under appropriate legislation.

* The policy it will pursue is intended to try to ensure the protection of the **rights** and interests of those people and to preserve to the maximum the harmonious relations with Indonesia that we have traditionally and customarily enjoyed.

* Let me say quite clearly that this Government's view is that the responsibility for maintaining surveillance of the activities of permanent building societies currently and traditionally rests with the State governments which have available specific legislation concerning the **rights** of borrowers and lenders and the stability of building societies and the administrative machinery necessary to discharge that responsibility.

* Very strong representations have been made to the Opposition in regard to this matter, mainly on the point that the **rights** of the officers are not being protected.

* I instance the **rights** of Aboriginals.

* in taking this view the Board saw Promotions Appeal Committees as tribunals discharging the function of assessing personal qualities of officers competing for promotion, not to determine **rights**.

* One other thing that was revealed by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition is that he also ignores the States and local governments and shows that even in the handling of garbage he would adopt a very centralist approach and ignore the sovereign **rights** of the States and local government.

* They give valuable **rights** to an insurer or auditor to have a rehearing of decisions taken by the Administration.

* He also will be aware of the fact that, whilst the Minister for Minerals and Energy says that he supports the **rights** of the company and wants to see its contracts honoured, other Ministers have refused to grant the titles required.

* Firstly, I take the opportunity to express my appreciation to the States for their co-operation in arriving at what I believe is a good solution, and certainly a fair solution, for people who whether or not they had accumulated legal **rights** would have been seriously disadvantaged if an arrangement of this sort had not been possible.

* The major **rights** Australia will enjoy under the Agreement are those stated in Article 6 concerning the organisation and management of the Fund.

* While the Committee was dealing with its alcohol inquiry it also took on the inquiry into Aboriginal land **rights**.

* 1 want quickly to make the point that a lot has been said this evening about the **rights** of people.

* There was a threat of a ban and a stoppage to ensure that the legal **rights** of the families were protected.

* existing drug in common use, making some alteration to the molecular structure of the drug so that its action is not altered but its structure is altered sufficiently so as to get around any patent **rights** that the existing preparation has, and then go ahead to compete with other drug manufacturers by way of a product which is almost identical to other preparations.

* I emphasise what I said when I began: We will base our action on two principles: Australia's national interest comes first at all limes, and our diplomatic conduct accords with the highest conventions of honourable dealing and respect for the **rights** of others.

* In his recent discussions overseas on international monetary arrangements did he indicate any firm views as far as Australia was concerned on the following matters: Increases in special drawing **rights** and their allocation; international capital movements; floating exchange rates, dirty or clean; the price of gold; and the American surcharge on imports?

* The need to set up this commission is based on the recognition that a high standard of health care is one of the fundamental **rights** of every Australian, and that the Australian Government must accept its full responsibility in this regard.

* I am going to check to see whether I will be inside my **rights** under the relevant ordinance to have an amnesty on those people who have received parking tickets.

* Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or well, on the provision of community faculties adjacent to a mine or well, or on the purchase of rnining **rights** or information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated life of the mine or well.

* The Bill represents an infringment of the **rights** of the individual.

* The honourable member for Boothby  (Mr McLeay)  believes that the Australian Housing Corporation Bill will be a threat to State **rights**, an intrusion into State affairs and a monster body which will sweep aside State housing bodies.

* The departmental **rights** in this matter should have been carefully examined.

* Admittedly it has been reduced from $80m to $73m, but that is brought about merely by removing the tariff on books, which would have restricted the **rights** of individual citizens to acquire books for purposes of private education and self-development.

* During the years that I have been here the **rights** and privileges of the rank and file members of this Parliament have been eroded bit by bit, and greater power has gone to the Executive.

* President  Park 's Government faced enormous problems in managing the country's economic development and meeting this continuing external threat, and there were criticisms of his Government's observance of human **rights**.

* Two years ago, when I congratulated you on behalf of the Government on being elected  Chairman  of Committees, I said that all those who had served you in the Parliament knew what an avid student you are of parliamentary procedures and what a redoubtable proponent you are of parliamentary **rights**.

* Answering the last part of the honourable member's question first, no, he cannot look forward to an early announcement that the Gurindji people will be granted land, because it is not Government policy to recognise traditional land **rights**.

* The BUI makes proper provision for the transfer to the Australian Film Commission of the assets, **rights**, etc., of the Australian Film Development Corporation and also from Film Australia.

* First, there was the row over air **rights**, where according to  Mr Renouf,  the Australians sought to over-protect Qantas Airways Ltd against lower fares and new competitors.

* Without debating the **rights** or wrongs of a statutory marketing authority of this type, the point is that the Government has not done what it said it would do and primary producers are getting sick and tired of this Government saying one thing and doing another or, even worse, saying something and then refusing to do anything at all.

* My Leader mentioned the disadvantages that are suffered by children born out of marriage- the Commonwealth Superannuation Act, the property inheritance where ex-nuptial children have to sue and fight to contest their natural **rights**; the embarrassment that one has to go through in paternity tests; and the housing difficulties encountered by single mothers with children.

* We are talking about the **rights** of the people.

* In regard to some of the comments made by Government supporters, I point out that every time they moved for the suspension of Standing Orders when they were in Opposition they stood firm on the **rights** of an opposition to have its say in this Parliament.

* The result is often to leave a significant degree of discretion to those exercising the **rights** or wielding the powers legally conferred, defined or permitted.

* It has unfortunately become a reiteration of the debate we had on Tuesday about the **rights** and wrongs of the Vietnam Moratorium.

* I suggest it is time that this House asserted its **rights** in respect of what are called money Bills - that they must originate only in this House and that they may not be amended.

* I would ask him to look a little more closely at his own proposals and attitudes towards the Australian population, the people involved in its development and his proposals for immigration, Australian families, the numbers of children born in Australia and the **rights** of Australian children, old, young and even unborn.

* We are pressing for a recognition of the **rights** of the Timorese.

* Following the discussions in Darwin, the Government is pleased to see that there is agreement on the way in which the Park should be managed, respecting the **rights** and responsibilities of both the Northern Territory Executive and the Northern Land Council.

* When he tried to exercise his **rights** and go to a union meeting he was denied entry.

* I want to use the opportunity presented by clause 17 to point out the deep concern of all members of the Opposition at the cavalier way in which the Government has chosen to treat this Parliament by gagging this legislation, legislation which affects the **rights** of some two and a half million people, legislation which dramatically alters the basic fabric of the Act dealing with conciliation and arbitration and the settlement of industrial disputes.

* In doing so, I condemn this Government for its blatant interference with the **rights** of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* This legislation affects the **rights** of some two and a half million people.

* Therefore I can tell the honourable member for Hunter that people 's **rights** are well and truly protected.

* When honourable members opposite get up in this House and talk about civil liberties, the **rights** of the individual and not being middle class they should think of the right of any man in this country.

* Can the Minister say whether the platform of the Australian Labor Party at the time of the 1972 General Elections stated that Aboriginal land **rights** shall carry with them full **rights** to the minerals of those lands.

* Does the Government now accept that mineral **rights** should be held for all Australians equally.

* This then was the Australian position and the extent of our **rights** as they existed prior to my visit to the United States.

* Honourable members opposite know their **rights** under the Standing Orders of this House and frequently exercise them, and in a debate on an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the statement they could, of course, canvass the whole range of issues relating to the export of merino rams.

* They have expertise and application and they respect the farmer's or owner's **rights** and look after the machinery.

* On one side he advocated the proposition of solidarity of the workers- the workers unite to destroy the **rights** and privileges of other people.

* The stabilisation of land prices is one piece of such legislation and the guarantee of consumer **rights** is another.

* The Supreme Court of the United States, however, ruled in a historic judgment that such practices were prohibited by the Federal Constitution - in particular, by the equal **rights** amendment.

* As I have said before, a matter of privilege in this House is not an issue of personal **rights** or privileges as that word is normally used in relation to members of the Parliament.

* It would appear that the shareholders of Kathleen Investments (Australia) Limited have not been able to do so and that only a small number of the general public, holding about 13 per cent of the shares, have exercised their **rights** in this respect.

* Will the Acting Treasurer have this deal investigated immediately by the Insurance Commissioner to ensure that policy holders' **rights** are fully protected?

* But we have to look after defence in our own region, and in the immediate environs nobody will doubt that we have to look after our continental shelf and our fishing **rights** in the area.

* I am speaking like this only to try to get through to the Government that when the proposed committee has been formed it will have to look very carefully, as has been mentioned by the Minister, at the operation of the lands **rights** legislation and give consideration to the complementary legislation being passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* Briefly, it states: 
The parliamentary system is being undermined, yet the present Leader of the Opposition, when he came into power earlier this year, made some fine speeches on the **rights** of the Senate.

* I am keeping in touch with the Northern Land Council to follow what is happening in carrying out the procedures of the land **rights** legislation with regard to the proposed Ranger agreement.

* I have no hesitation in expressing my complete confidence in the capacity and the credibility of  Mr Yunupingu  in seeking to fulfil his statutory responsibilities and those of the Northern Land Council under the land **rights** legislation.

* The officers of the Public Defender in Queensland have been most diligent protectors of the **rights** of persons in criminal cases.

* Most of the matters to which the honourable member has referred are directly the sovereign **rights** of the States concerned.

* Will the Minister act immediately to protect these women, who are acting only in accordance with their legal **rights**, by issuing appropriate directions to prevent the union secretary and other unionists from intimidating these women?

* It spells out, along with property **rights** and the protection of the person, a marital relationship and the family.

* Does the staff shortage mean that inadequate medical care is available to patients seeking to exercise their **rights** as hospital Medibank patients?

* What action does the Government intend to take to ensure that patients are not deprived of their **rights** in this unilateral fashion by some Canberra medical practitioners?

* During question time on Tuesday, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  made a statement on what he sees as the **rights** of persons to oppose government decisions and government policies.

* I suggest that that statement is most likely the narrowest interpretation of the **rights** of individuals in a democratic society ever made by any person supposedly holding a responsible office.

* The remainder of the community's **rights** are restricted to voting once every 3 years or as often as an election occurs.

* Any honourable member who reads what the Prime Minister said in this House will see quite clearly that he disagrees with that proposition and that, on behalf of the present Government of Australia, he has said that those **rights** do not exist.

* Did the Prime Minister receive a recommendation on Aboriginal land **rights** from his Council of Ministers, and did he personally direct the Council to reconsider that recommendation after the  Chairman  of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs,  Dr H.  C. Coombs, had advised him that he would resign over it?

* However, the fact that one has a property does not give one any particular **rights** or privileges to speak on this matter.

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs says that he has no legislative power with which to override Queensland in the matter of negotiating mineral **rights** or the takeover of the administration of the missions on these Aboriginal reserves.

* It is the responsibility of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to check the insane attitudes of the Premier of Queensland who is talking of abolishing land **rights**, restraining all possible land **rights** for Aboriginals on the ground that this could lead to a black takeover in Queensland with the assistance of communist governments overseas.

* There is a valid argument that as far as possible the **rights** of taxpayers should be spelt out in income tax legislation.

* (6) to clause 9 whereby the Opposition seeks to require that a redeployment declaration should include certain details of the declaration made and the reasons for it, the date from which the redeployment declaration is to be effective, and the **rights** of and methods for appeal against the declaration.

* Among these matters will be the information to be given to an employee at the same time as a copy of a redeployment declaration, including the information to which I have referred, namely, details of the declaration itself, the reasons for it, the date of it and the **rights** and methods of appeal.

* The Deputy Leader's last references to State **rights** and the federalism policy seemed to me to be almost absurd and purely political in their substance.

* I think we should set to **rights** so far as honourable members opposite and the public at large are concerned just what it is that we are attempting to do in this field.

* It seems that there is still a role for the Grants Commission, that despite pride in sovereignty and States **rights** there are still advantages in retaining the despised mendicant status.

* I regard it as an obligation of the Press to protect the **rights** of the many rather than sometimes just take a scoop that will advantage a few.

* The FILEF organisation has been told by way of correspondence that the grant for the employment of a welfare **rights** officer will terminate on 1 January 1977.

* Whilst as a nation we have given serious consideration to the subsistence **rights** of the people of the Torres Strait, it seems to me that their chance of having a viable economic future is seriously prejudiced but, I am prepared to reserve my judgment on the report to see how we go.

* They are quite satisfied that the **rights** of the individual are fully protected under these provisions.

* By the end of World War II all European countries had introduced basic **rights** to maternity leave benefits and employment security.

* The aims and objectives of ICAO are to develop the principles and techniques of international air transport so as to ensure the safe and orderly growth of international civil aviation throughout the world; to encourage the arts of aircraft design and operation for peaceful purposes; to encourage the development of airways, airports and air navigation facilities for international civil aviation; to meet the needs of the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient and economic air transport; to prevent economic waste caused by unreasonable competition; to ensure that the **rights** of contracting states are fully respected and that every contracting state has a fair opportunity to operate international airlines; to avoid discrimination between contracting states; to promote safety of flight in international air navigation; and to promote generally the development of all aspects of civil aeronautics.

* Thirdly, perhaps the Government has thought that land **rights** and the settlement of land **rights** in itself would largely solve the Aboriginal problem.

* Now, as then, I welcome the agreement which has been reached between Australia and Papua New Guinea that a protected zone should be established in the area confirming the traditional **rights** of the Torres Strait Islanders and the coastal Papuans.

* The overall need is that the mentally handicapped person should be regarded as an individual personality having the same **rights** as other Australians and, through his lifetime disability, having greater need of specialised assistance than more gifted citizens.

* The honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  said that this Bill is a proposal to give TransAustralia Airlines **rights** to compete in tourism.

* As honourable members will recall, during 1974 there was a press campaign notifying consumers of their **rights** and educating them to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act.

* There would not be a person in this House who did not concern himself with the lack, in varying degrees, of human **rights** throughout the many countries in the southern African subcontinent.

* Whatever the **rights** and wrongs of the decision itself, namely the forcing of an election by the Head of State- I do not go into the constitutional details but I concede the point that that could well have been an inevitable outcomethere is no visible excuse for the way it was done.

* Despite that apparently the Prime Minister wishes to deny the New South Wales Government its **rights** and its prerogatives under New South Wales Law in respect of companies  incorporated  in New South Wales.

* This is not an example of a State member exerting or protecting his State's **rights**.

* Apart from the **rights** and wishes of the island people involved, a strong objection to the proposal was that Australia would lose control of the great north-east channel which connects the Indian and Pacific Oceans.

* Two questions are involved- the **rights** of the people at Aurukun and the foreign investment policy of this Government.

* The report makes great play on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* in the event of failed contraception and consequent unplanned, unwanted pregnancies, the social, psychological and medical results of termination and failure to terminate such pregnancies, and adequacy and effectiveness of existing medico-legal determinations in relation to termination of pregnancy, including the incidence of such terminations, the factors influencing their occurrence, the adequacy of medical training in, and evaluation of methods of termination and the consultative **rights** of the family and other parties to the pregnancy, and 
This Bill proposes an amendment to the income tax law to provide for the reinstatement of an income tax exemption for income derived by bona fide prospectors from the sale, transfer or assignment of **rights** to mine for gold or any other metal or mineral that is prescribed for the purposes of the exemption.

* Prospectors are encouraged to look for minerals they cannot hope to mine themselves if they know that any income that they will receive from transferring **rights** to mine their discoveries is not going to be reduced by taxation.

* They are refugees from West Irian who were attempting to arouse in the people of West Irian an awareness of their **rights**.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation aware that the New Zealand Government has now granted landing **rights** to American charier companies wishing to take thousands of tourists to New Zealand?

* I, too, am concerned about **rights**.

* -I do not want to take up too much time of the House by referring to procedures in the House but I think that the protection of the **rights** of private members is fundamental to the operation of this House and therefore fundamental to democracy.

* They give lawyers of the Office who are in charge of local offices the same **rights** to practise as a solicitor who is a principal in a firm.

* Of particular importance to the Aboriginal community has been the attainment of land **rights** and the Government has, as honourable members will recall, established the Aboriginal Land Fund in response to this felt need on the part of the Aboriginal community.

* Having said that, there is no need for me to go into details about the superannuation **rights** that have been adequately touched upon by the honourable member for Moore.

* Several times both inside and outside this Parliament the Prime Minister has stated that it is the firm objective of the Government to arrive at a settlement which will protect the **rights** and interests of the Islanders and preserve their traditional way of life and livelihood.

* The amendments concern the two important areas of the Bill, that is, the provisions which introduce a new disciplinary code within the Australian Public Service and those which relate to the **rights** of officers of the Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment.

* It is not the intention to exclude a claimant who had exports of eligible industrial property **rights** and know-how in excess of $10,000, but who also had other export earnings, the combined total of which did not exceed $25,000.

* In other words, in a legislative committee, each person other than the 13 to 19 shall have less **rights** than they have in this House.

* Only a full, open and independent inquiry into the whole of the operations of the Deen family and Hall and the system of warrantee **rights** over pensions can clear the air of this hideous manifestation which revealed itself in my electorate today.

* Such a move should be seen as the first stage in exercising, in accordance with international law, Australia's 200-mile zone **rights** around Australia and the Territories.

* Offset credit is also allowed for the value of transferred technology, the waiver of licence fees, manufacturing **rights** and royalty payments and the like.

* This Bill makes provision for the **rights** of officers employed by the Department of National Development to enter on to properties, to place survey marks, geodetic pegs or whatever it might be, in relation to survey work.

* We need not map them for the purposes of showing the limitations of territorial water: and the high seas if we lay claim to the **rights** of the Barrier Reef waters on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia, which in effect would be on behalf of the Australian people.

* Are we getting the **rights** result?

* In the United Kingdom, which economically is a poorer society than ours, the **rights** of the disabled are enshrined in the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act.

* The **rights** of these people to fulfilling lives cannot be denied, and their contribution to our national life should not be thrown away.

* This is a massive trade off of the public's **rights** and entitlements.

* We also welcome the prospect of bilateral exchanges of charter **rights** which will enable charter operators to bring here a new type of tourist business.

* Many members of a trade union would be denied any **rights** at all simply by the apathy of others, simply by a campaign being waged to say 'Do not return your ballot paper', or by the ballot papers being intercepted and never reaching the returning officer.

* In that way we would also protect the **rights** of the original States.

* But if in the pursuit of such breaches there is any evidence of undue activity in one area or any suggestion of a denial of proper civil **rights** and liberties then I would certainly want to be given examples .

* Whilst I know that you want to rule on the question of sub judice,  Mr Speaker,  and I do not mind that, I put to you that the **rights** of citizens are involved.

* I think if the Minister, taking him at his face value, really wishes to preserve some **rights** for State branches he will look at the suggestion very closely indeed.

* If we are seeking in this Parliament, as I believe we should, to preserve the **rights** of individuals to speak to issues what we must do is to act in such a way that an expression of a point of view by a minority group, the expression of dissent or consent and the expression of approval or disapproval can be preserved, and this was implied in the statement made by the Minister for the Interior.

* Does he also realise that he is for the time being chief custodian of the **rights** of Parliament?

* Later in the day the Deutsche Welle radio station broadcast a report, which was later seized on by other western news media, saying that 'Yuri Orlov, a prominent human **rights** campaigner' was arrested by the Soviet authorities ' for his dissenting views. '

* -The agreement and the position into which that agreement puts the Commonwealth make it quite certain that the **rights** and prerogatives of the Aboriginal people  of those two communities can and will be safeguarded.

* My question which is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry is in relation to plant breeders' **rights**, now known as plant variety protection.

* I say in passing that I hope the Grants Commission, in determining grants in the future, will not give such dispersal of police services any added weight because of the Government's periodic calling in of police from outlying areas to Brisbane to prevent people undertaking their democratic **rights** to march in protest through that city.

* Recommendations have also been made in relation to access to finance, the Brisbane airport, regional routes for domestic airlines and intrastate pick-up and set-down **rights** for longdistance coaches.

* Such risks will be eliminated; the **rights** of Australians to express themselves freely at the ballot box, with equal knowledge of all the candidates' views, will be guaranteed by this legislation.

* It should be remembered that in the great tumult of the early 1950s and the confrontation in the community over civil **rights**, and in particular over the Communist Party Dissolution Bill and so on, he locked horns with another very great Australian in  Dr Evatt.

* If honourable members were to go through that list they would find that with the exception of cases where trade unionists were nominated specifically to be a part of those committees - that is, the trade unionist had to be a part of a committee such as the manning scale committees in my own Department, the tradesmen's **rights** committees within the Department of Labour and the like, on which there had to be employer and employee representation - I will defy any member of the Opposition to name more- 
We believe it is quite critical that a man should be appointed to this important position in this chamber who is able to ensure that the parliamentarians of this place, all of whom are meeting for the first time in the 29th Parliament but some of whom are meeting for the first time ever in the House of Representatives, are given during the life of this Parliament an adequate opportunity to debate all those pieces of legislation which come before us.

* In that way I believe that the **rights** and privileges of the private member can best be protected and the prospects for democracy in this chamber enhanced.

* I ask: Can he further clarify the **rights** of the public to receive certificates of decrees absolute as appears to be the plain intention of the Matrimonial Causes Act passed by this Parliament?

* With your concurrence,  Mr Speaker,  I want the Minister, by the time question time comes next Tuesday, to tell the House what steps he has taken to ensure that all candidates in this election are given equal **rights** to canvass the voters who will be deciding the result of the election.

* Because of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of human nature, as soon as the **rights** and incentives of the professional man to practise in a free, competitive society are taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, break-throughs in knowledge and further explorations of the perplexing problems of mankind cease and we are all reduced to a level of mediocrity.

* In the event of any further delimitation agreement or agreements being concluded between governments exercising sovereign **rights** with respect to the exploration of the seabed and the exploitation of its natural resources in the area of the Timor Sea, the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia shall consult each other with a view to agreeing on such adjustment or adjustments, if any, as may be necessary in those portions of the boundary lines between points Al 5 and A 1 6, and between points A 1 7 and A 1 8 ".

* This Government, more than its predecessors, has protected the privileges and **rights** of the Parliament and of individual Australians, wherever they may be, against bureaucratic decisions.

* I believe that the Australian Labor Party, more than any other party, puts Aboriginals ahead of mining or anti-mining issues or any other issue involved with Aboriginal land **rights**.

* They have **rights** and other human beings have responsibilities towards them.

* We had great difficulty in making quite certain that he knew his **rights** of appeal.

* by inserting after sub-section (6) the following sub-sections: "(6a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the **rights** and freedoms of any person.

* We believe that this Parliament, being representatives of the people of Australia, has certain **rights** and responsibilities on behalf of the people of Australia.

* We hope, despite the opposition that has been indicated by the Opposition, that the provisions of this Bill which state the **rights** of Parliament in the control of monopolies that are handed over to private groups will be exercised in the interests of the Australian people.

* The centre would be used, firstly, to inform people of their **rights** and to ensure that they are protected; secondly, to provide ways in which unemployed can be meaningfully involved in using their skills, irrespective of whether the inter-industry market requires them; thirdly, to act as a local pressure group on the labour market; and fourthly, to encourage the unemployed to be involved in implementing these aims.

* It is not unfair to say that in the past State Premiers have regarded any proposals for the direct financing of local government by the Federal Government as an intrusion into State **rights** and responsibilities, and have been loath to let their power go.

* A further question in this respect concerns the protection that will be given to the existing **rights** of policy holders.

* The tragedy of the Government's approach is that in order to extend coverage to all Australians it is taking away the **rights** and freedoms of choice of many Australian people and professional groups involved in health care.

* I do not wish to interfere with the **rights** of the honourable member for Mallee, but this is a second reading speech if ever 1 have heard one.

* I said that little people must have **rights** and must be protected against the great combines and the great monopolies which do exist, in my opinion, in television and the Press in this country.

* His career has been totally and irrevocably wrecked by people in the McMahon Government who are more committed to serving the wealthy interests and the establishment interests in the community than to catering for patients **rights** and maintaining some responsible restraint on the way in which the public's money is thrown about in the community.

* Other prospecting **rights** have been granted to Aboriginal groups from Maningrida and Goulburn Island and these groups have received and continue to have available to them technical and other assistance from the Territory Administration.

* It is a very sorry episode for the status of new Australians who have taken unto themselves, with natural born Australians, the responsibility of the **rights** and privileges of this country.

* I would believe that it was not the Government's intention to prejudice either existing part time students, whose **rights** are safeguarded, or future part time students.

* Avenues will be available to them to ensure that their **rights** can be effectively protected in law.

* Regretfully, under both Liberal and Labor Governments, we have seen an expansion into the privacy of the individual- an erosion of the individual's liberty and **rights**.

* Proceedings relating to property, for example, are not valid if they are related only to property and therefore we have to look at this matter from the point of view of the normal problems of a marriage or the normal problems that follow in a dispute between parties to a marriage about property **rights**.

* However, I feel bound to point out that the whole purpose of the Government's policy towards Rhodesia to date has been to support Western diplomatic efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement in that country, incorporating both majority rule and the protection of human **rights** for the entire population of Rhodesia.

* Has he since become aware that ASCO has traded profitably for the last 5 years and would he explain why the managing director of ASCO has notified employees- about 1,000 of them- in writing that they will be retrenched, of course with a loss of full superannuation **rights** and other benefits?

* People voted for the Fraser Government on promises of a better future, but what they are getting is coming to the surface by a sort of flotation process- grievances, questionable personal dealings, internal turmoil, resignations, patchups and cover-ups- with a total disregard for the **rights** of this Parliament to know why a Minister of the Cabinet resigned.

* They lack the strength to fight for their legal **rights** to get what others get in the short or long term.

* In my 13 May statement welcoming the acceptance by the ACTU of an Industrial Relations Bureau and the re-constitution of a tripartite consultative council, I stressed that the Government was committed to legislating for the protection of individual **rights** in the industrial relations area but that it was prepared to review the provisions on these and other matters relating to the operation of the Act contained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill laid before the Parliament on 3 1 March in the light of their further consideration by the new Council.

* The statutory advisory authority will bring in independent national views and other committees involving State **rights**.

* It has no precedent in older countries overseas, for until now they have tended to ignore, or had scant knowledge of, the need or the appetite of the public for more information about their own country and about Government: about what Government is doing and why it is doing it, about **rights** and privileges.

* They should exercise their **rights** in the courts if they consider that the hours of labour, rates of pay and conditions in general are a disadvantage to their industry.

* These **rights** are defined in Section 24 of the Northern Territory Crown Lands Act.

* In consequence, he recommended the provision of realistic penalties to secure Aboriginal **rights**.

* In line with  Mr Justice  Woodward 's recommendation, the amended provision now provides a penalty of $2,000 for interference with the full and free exercise of the **rights** reserved to Aboriginals.

* In both of these discretionary areas, the Commissioner's decision will be open to the usual **rights** of objection and appeal.

* Such amendments may be made whether or not the employee has exercised the **rights** of objection and appeal that the law provides.

* Are not her **rights** to be fully considered, as are the **rights** of others who interfere with her benefits?

* I do assure the members of this House who are genuinely concerned about the longstanding breach of the confidentiality of information supplied to the Department of Social Security on trust by members of the public, that I will take steps to preserve people's **rights** and that this will be done in an effective way.

* We will not merely mouth homilies, as has happened with the Opposition now, and neglect to preserve people's confidentiality and **rights** in relation to these matters.

* Seeing that such an impost is a direct tax upon the already overburdened producers, is the Government allowing the Governor to take over some of its taxing **rights**, or will the Treasurer assure me that this tax will not be imposed?

* We also welcome the prospect of bilateral exchanges of charter **rights** which will enable charter operators to bring here a new type of tourist business.

* It is envisaged that reports of complaints considered by the State Committees will also be published in the annual report so that the world at large can see who in Australia is disregarding this important human **rights** convention.

* Because of the interpretation which has been given to judicial power since the early 1920s, the fact is that the High Court has restricted its judgments to matters, that is, to matters involving the decision about **rights**, duties, liabilities or the obligations of the parties.

* (Quorum formed) 
1 ) Did the  Speaker  and the  President  of the Senate write to him saying that in the light of recent experience in the settlement of the 1978-79 Estimates of the Parliament, they now must conclude that the existing working relationship has done little to protect the **rights** of the Parliament, that discussions with the Presiding Officers did not occur, that queries raised by the Minister for Finance by letter in respect of the House of Representatives, the Parliamentary Library, Joint House and  Hansard,  were answered by the Presiding Officers fully and with clear re-statement of Parliamentary needs and priorities, without effect, and that in most cases these priorities were rejected by officials of the Department of Finance, it seems, without further consideration by Government.

* The United States has established a system whereby ex-servicemen who cannot avail themselves even of ordinary insurance **rights** because they are regarded as a greater risk than most other people in the community are given the benefit of a privileged insurance system.

* The so-called 'Croatian Embassy' has thrown doubt on Australia's ability and willingness to protect the **rights** guaranteed by the Geneva Convention.

* -The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1978 in some respects is a machinery Bill but it has particular significance for the Opposition and for Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It is true that the purpose of the Bill, as expressed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  in his second reading speech, is to retain the current **rights** of mining companies in the Alligator Rivers Region, in regard to access to inprovements that have been constructed, when the land becomes Aboriginal land.

* The question of Aboriginal land **rights**, as has been mentioned in the debate on the Bill which has just been passed, is not something that was dreamed up in recent years or after the days of the Labor Administration in Canberra.

* The merit of the claims received some publicity which started to bring home to people such as politicians and journalists what Aboriginal land **rights** were all about.

* Two years later, with a different parliament in Canberra, the Labor Government made the point that it would take action on Aboriginal land **rights**, despite the opposition of the conservative parties which had been in power in 1972 and which opposed land **rights** at that stage, as was mentioned in the debate on the previous Bill.

* The Labor Government appointed  Mr Justice  Woodward to inquire into the manner in which land **rights** could be put into effect.

* 1 do not know when the new look in the Liberal and National Country Parties came about or where they spelt out their commitment to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Other commitments were that Aborigines should also determine how their land **rights** are to be used and that they should have the same **rights** as any other land owner to determine who enters the land.

* I believe that the Aborigines ought to have more than just the same **rights** as any other landowner to determine who enters their land.

* Basically, we in the Opposition are still uneasy about the degree of commitment to Aboriginal land **rights** which is spelt out in every one of these Bills, as against a commitment to the **rights** of States and State-like authorities- including the administration which will be responsible for the Northern Territory when it gains selfgovernment on 1 July- and the **rights** of mining companies.

* He saw fit to relate my remarks to his previous interest in mining in Australia and to find them somehow impertinent or irrelevant to his commitment to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I stress again that I am not impugning his commitment to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* What we are concerned about is the erosion here and there of the **rights** of Aboriginals to their traditional land in favour of commercial development.

* I submit that it is genuine cause for concern that the Government is not really putting Aboriginal land **rights** first, before appeasing and conceding to what has been apprehended as being public opinion- in fact, it was a public outcry.

* The mere fact that States are charged with the responsibility by and large to determine mineral development, the mere fact that they are reluctant to concede to other governments, whether they be neighbouring State governments or the Federal Government, any of the **rights** which might bring them credit or profit- particularly mineral exploration, mineral leases, mineral royalties and the like- and the mere fact that this is a State function traditionally ought to make it clear to members of this House and to the public generally that State governments and State-like authorities are not the appropriate bodies to give priority to Aboriginal land claims.

* The Federal Government is more disposed and more likely to be able to look at matters in the broad and not to be so uptight, so worried or so concerned whether mining **rights** are preserved or whether mineral development goes ahead.

* The Federal Government has more resources and can look at Australia as a whole in a way which ought to preclude it from putting those **rights** before Aboriginal land **rights**.

* There are many ways- perhaps small- in which these mining **rights** are acceded to or conceded to.

* We talk a lot of the **rights** of people on other issues so why not extend television coverage and broadcasting privileges to these people?

* It sets a very dangerous precedent on the very principle of the **rights** of the individual person, organisation or company to advertise its respective goods that are readily available to the public.

* I hope that reason and common sense will prevail because if they do not and  Mr Dracup  's **rights** have to be protected, we could have a very serious situation on our hands in regard to the mail service in Western Australia.

* They could be put back into a position in which they are in peril again through what is in essence a retrospective piece of legislation affecting vested **rights**, civil liberties, remedies, liabilities, privileges and everything in which we have all been brought up to believe.

* The purpose of the Embassy was to bring to the attention of members of Parliament and others, matters of complaint concerning the welfare of the aboriginal race and in particular their 'land **rights**'.

* It was a testimony to their peaceful intent in relation to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* We accept that because of the invalidity flowing from this reasoning all manner of cases have gone wrong and legal **rights** have been upset, and these things have to be put right.

* Will the Prime Minister state to the House, as requested at the Congress, that the Government will tolerate dissent only while it stays within the law and does not infringe the **rights** of the majority of the population?

* I repeat that it stated there would be no peace with Israel; no negotiations with Israel; no recognition of Israel; and no abandonment of Palestinian **rights**.

* When in 1955 Australia extended the Convention of the World Meteorological Organisation of 1 1 October 1947 to the Australian Antarctic Territory the United States Government notified the Australian Government that 'it does not recognise any claims so far advanced in the Antarctic and reserves all **rights** accruing to the United States out of activities of nationals of the United States in the area '.

* Whilst people may debate the **rights** and wrongs of the political situation in relation to these people, there is no doubt about the people in the camps- one can only admire them for their determination, discipline, general outlook and the way they have tried to help themselves under difficult circumstances.

* On many occasions while I have been a member of this House- I am sure that ordinary members who have, been here for much longer than I also have seen this- I have seen the **rights** of and the facilities available to the ordinary members come last in the list of priorities in what is actually provided in this building for those who occupy it.

* I believe that the previous Government was neglectful in this area, just as it appears that the leadership of the present Government is being neglectful of the **rights** and privileges of the ordinary members of Parliament in this place.

* for all the additional facilities and requirements that appear to have been tacked on over the years, then the **rights** of ordinary members of Parliament on both sides should come first.

* Of course, honourable members on this side of the House- the members of the Australian Labor Party- resisted that valiantly and fought for the rest of the day to preserve the **rights** of private members.

* If the honourable member for EdenMonaro is interested in the **rights** of members of this chamber I should have thought that he would have been fighting with us on that occasion, but he was not.

* I also emphasise that this legislation and the future activities of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation must place emphasis on people and their **rights**.

* It is very important that these people have their **rights** protected by both Federal and State legislation.

* We on this side of the Parliament believe in the **rights** of the States, and we would not be a party to the kind of suggestion made by the honourable member for Kingston.

* We have talked of things such as fundamental equality, which has resulted in equal pay and in liquor **rights**, things which have had some benefits and some costs.

* Is it a fact that, under the present provisions of the National Health Act, all West Australian workers on the minimum wage will then lose their present **rights** to have their contributions to medical benefit funds waived or reduced?

* It is important that the **rights** of members of Parliament be determined by an independent tribunal.

* It has to accept the responsibility which goes with the conditions, the **rights** and the privileges which the Government confers upon it.

* In his capacity as Minister for Overseas Trade, will he take action to ensure that the **rights** to Australian inventions are made available for the development of this nation before being sold abroad?

* These protections have been set out in the paper read to the House by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and they include land **rights**, provision of national parks and also the employment of Aboriginals in those parks.

* The Prime Minister will be aware from Press reports that book publishers, both in Australia and overseas, are vying for the publishing **rights** of  Sir John  Kerr's memoirs.

* I feel that this is an imposition on the **rights** of the Opposition.

* Was the Australian representative,  Mr Brennan,  correct in reflecting the views of his Government when he said that Australia was of the view that the person seeking protection derived his **rights** merely from his quality as a person in need of protection and from nothing else?'

* As it was further made clear that this proposed convention was seeking to apply the same principles as followed in connection with the **rights** of territorial asylum and the convention on the **rights** of refugees, I ask the Prime Minister: Because of the need to at least appear to be truthful to the rest of the world will he withdraw the quite un-Australian shackles that he has placed on a number of Vietnamese refugees which still prevent them from pursuing in this country their full political **rights**?

* All of us here stand for basic **rights** and we like to see basic **rights** written into legislation.

* But after basic **rights** and other things have been written into legislation, there is a need for government flexibility and versatility which will ensure that hardship and suffering is minimised.

* Does he still think that his personal comfort is sufficient justification for handing to the competitors  of  Qantas a public relations triumph, especially as he failed to gain from the American Government the routes or **rights** upon which the future profitability of Qantas so largely depends?

* ls he satisfied with the present stopgap procedure outlined in the Constitution under which this House acts on the rules of privilege of the House of Commons of the nineteenth century but actually dating in precedent back to the Middle Ages, a procedure in which the accused person has none of the **rights** of an accused person in any court of justice anywhere in the British Commonwealth?

* These include reasonable and uniform periods of residence, good character, knowledge of the language, **rights**, privileges and duties of citizenship and an honest intention to make Australia a permanent home.

* The Government has appointed Judge Woodward to examine the situation relating to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Advertisements have been published throughout Australia and all those who are concerned with the Aboriginal people and their **rights** have been invited to place their submissions before the Commissioner.

* Again, this is going to be a difficult matter to resolve, lt will not be terribly difficult to define the land **rights** of the Aboriginal people in regard to existing reserves.

* Finance for the fund is secured through quotas for individual members which determine their maximum financial liability and also the basis for their borrowing **rights**.

* As I said before, through this legislation is reflected the task which this Government set itself concerning Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Is he aware that some pensioners are therefore inquiring about their **rights** to refuse a pen.sion increase?

* I want to stress again the fact that a far more insidious influence is being brought to bear on honourable members opposite, and that is based on one of two things: It could be based on their dedicated belief, such as that held by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Dr J. F. Cairns),  in an extreme form of socialism, in an extreme form of centralism, in an extreme form of taking away from the individual his **rights** and centralising power in Canberra, appointing bureaucratic boards and appointing people who lack entirely any experience.

* Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* However, this must not impinge on the original discovery **rights** of researchers and must respect their desire, if expressed, for confidentiality.

* Before the last meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General it became borne in upon me that any reduction by legislation of the age of legal responsibility in any field of activity - for instance, the field of contractual activity or the field of proprietary **rights** - would give rise inevitably to pressures for similar action in other fields in which the Commonwealth Government has a vital interest, for example, the voting age, the operation of industrial awards with the consequential effect of such operation on the economy, and the age for marrying without parental consent.

* It is the Government's view that the Cabinet or the Government will be better able to reach a decision which, as I have mentioned and as I wish to emphasise, will have far reaching consequences not only politically but in the field of proprietary **rights** and contractual **rights** and in relation to marriage.

* I am sure the honourable gentleman will agree that an important aspect to consider is what will be the **rights**, responsibilities and duties of all categories of employees in both the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the Government Aircraft Factories, and what, to approach a very difficult subject, would be their superannuation **rights**.

* Has the Queensland Government infringed United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions regarding the **rights** of indigenous people in respect of their traditional lands, particularly the right to be consulted?

* However, the Bill provides that regulations may be made conferring **rights** of appeal to the Tribunal in respect of decisions made under Territory laws that will continue to be administered by the Commonwealth Government.

* I thought that perhaps here was a pensioner who was not aware, of his **rights** and was not getting what he was entitled to because he had not made the correct application.

* They are very much aware of the extent to which they are deprived of political **rights**.

* In clause 8 of the Bill we should remove all the references to the acquisition of proprietary **rights** in goods, of ownership, and let the Corporation be fully confident to act as agent for principals.

* We should bear in mind that although this is consumer protection legislation there are **rights** which have to be maintained for the travel agents.

* Grog **rights** were mentioned.

* It is totally contrary to the sovereign **rights** of individual States to deal with legislation in accordance with the procedures of their parliaments.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order ... the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the **rights** and freedoms of others.

* The Federal Government certainly has an interest in trying to see that national strikes are brought to an end, but it should not do so by interfering in the sovereign **rights** of individual States.

* What the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition failed to mention further is that the Commonwealth has no power to legislate in respect the **rights** of public assembly in a State.

* The last point I mention is the way in which the smokescreen has been thrown up to divert attention from the left wing and Labor-inspired activities of people who seek to abuse the democratic **rights** of others in this country by false and fake assemblies.

* Far from deterring opposition to apartheid, the denial of basic human **rights** and Press freedom, which such measures represent, they are likely to have the opposite effect.

* What consideration was given to the **rights** of the many people who would be within the precincts of the building?

* From the time the Government decided to mine uranium it was inevitable that a time would come when the concerns of the Aboriginal people about their land **rights** and the environment would conflict with the perceived policy of the Government.

* This is an entirely different basis from the way in which we would operate here and impinges directly upon the **rights** of, in this case, Australian companies.

* But no supranational method of dealing with industrial property **rights** evolved until the creation of the Patent Cooperation Treaty.

* &lt;2) If so, does he consider that this information should be allowed on display at the obvious risk of infringing a taxpayer's **rights**.

* Will he give an assurance that all necessary precautions will be taken to protect the taxpayers' **rights**.

* Did he state on 13th April 1972 (Hansard, page 1659) that some countries allow age pensioners or their equivalents in those countries to bring full pension **rights** with them to Australia.

* The Government is saying one thing when it means another and, consistent with its behaviour in the past, it purports to demonstrate concern for the individual when in fact it has no interest in the **rights** of the individual at all.

* The protests related to the question of land **rights** and it is that policy that we are debating.

* I asked the Institute of Aboriginal Studies to convene a gathering in order to find nut best- 
The other point about this matter is that because these teachers are not British subjects they will be denied a number of **rights** which cannot be backdated to the time of their joining the service.

* So even though they may work for 30 years after they have become naturalised, they lose their **rights** for the first 3 years of their service.

* But I would point out to the honourable member that there is a difference between our desire to see that a country is not overrun by aggression and have all its **rights** taken away and the exercise of non-democratic power in various nations in the world.

* I will not enter into the **rights** and wrongs of that.

* Will the Minister have this anomalous situation examined so that the **rights** of these citizens of Australia are protected and so that they may return to the land of their birth without confusion as to their true obligation and loyalties?

* Also, its continuation represents an abdication by the parents of Australia of their **rights**.

* That the House notes that 90 prominent American Vietnam war protesters, including folksinger Joan Baez, poet Allan Ginsberg and imprisoned draft resister James Forrest have signed a petition presented to the permanent Vietnamese observer to the United Nations condemning the Vietnamese Government for grave abuses of civil liberties, suppression of free speech, grievous and systematic violation of human **rights**, filling of prisons with civilians accused only of holding certain religious and ideological beliefs, detention of an estimated 300 000 people in so-called re-education camps, suppression of cultural and polictical expression, and stifling of non-violent dissent.

* Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Court, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entitled to rely on **rights** previously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act.

* Furthermore, a choice is given to the Government either to cancel registration or to set at nought the **rights** of a particular employee.

* By stripping a man of his civil **rights**, he becomes to that extent an outlaw.

* Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Court, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entitled to rely on **rights** previously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act.

* Revolutions come because men know that they have **rights** and that they are disregarded. '

* Generally the two new matters of importance are the conferring upon Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General of a new power in constitutional cases in any court of intervention in the suits of private parties, and provisions conferring new **rights** on legal practitioners of one State to appear m courts of other States.

* The fifth is the protection of members' **rights** by non-interference with grievance debates, general business and adjournment debates.

* It seems to me-1 am sure I will be excused for feeling thisthat members of the Opposition have their usual hang-ups about State **rights**.

* 1 have no wonder that the right honourable member for Higgins,  Mr Gorton,  is still writing articles about how his Party is going wrong in this sphere of action, as is being exemplified by what is being done by the Australian Labor Government as opposed, I repeat, to the nitpicking that is going on about State **rights** on the other side of the chamber.

* It was then given a member in this chamber who had the same voting **rights** as the member for the Northern Territory had at that time - that is, he could vote only on a motion to disallow an ordinance affecting the ACI'.

* Every senator has the same **rights** as every member of this chamber in matters of Commonwealth legislation or investigation or supervision.

* Honourable members will remember the committee which in 1961 investigated the voting **rights** of Aboriginals.

* Again in 1968 - the year I moved this Bill the first time - petitions were received and read by the Senate, firstly on Aboriginal **rights** seeking that the Parliament should make legal provision for certain land ownership and development **rights** for Aboriginals living on reserves; secondly on the lack of medical facilities and qualified medical practitioners for Groote Eylandt; and thirdly, for an inquiry into the cost of living in the Australian Capital Territory.

* Does the Government's decision on Aboriginal land **rights** on 26th January 1972 conform with the land provisions on International Labour Organisation Convention No.

* Is it not almost impossible for an ex-servicemen who has suffered the effects of gas to establish his **rights** and privileges?

* The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human **rights** and democracy in this nation.

* Has the Commonwealth Government power to take any action deemed necessary to protect the **rights** of residents whose homes and land are to be resumed?

* The other matter that I should like to add is that, notwithstanding that there is genuine confusion in some areas of consumer protection and a need to clear it up- I do not think it can be pushed aside by some references to State **rights** versus centralism- the Opposition believes quite strongly that an area in which the Government indisputably has a direct interest and ought to have a direct involvement is the laying down and enforcement of product safety and information standards and the labelling and packaging of goods.

* I do not question whether the Commonwealth Police are acting properly or within their security functions; what I question is whether the **rights** and privileges of access to information of a member of this Parliament can be inhibited by the  knowledge that those persons who pass on information to a member of Parliament are under surveillance, can come under threat and cannot freely disclose information in private without the fear that that information may be passed on to political opponents or persons who could do them political damage.

* While seeking an equitable settlement, I have a duty not merely in relation to Australia geographically or the border between the 2 countries but also to look after, protect and preserve the **rights** and the traditional way of life and livelihood of the Torres Strait Islanders to the greatest extent possible.

* That paper reported that the Indonesian generals have indicated through diplomatic channels that Australian companies with mineral and petroleum concessions in East Timor will be welcome to stay provided they negotiate their **rights** with the Indonesian Government.

* There will be no choice and no **rights**.

* Can a member of the Executive Council who has not been commissioned to administer a particular Department exercise any constitutional **rights** to personally override an administrative act by the Executive Councillor commissioned by the Governor-General to administer that Department.

* The Government is quite mindful of the need to protect the **rights** of private members.

* No honourable member appreciates the position of private members more than the members of the present Government because we were at the receiving end of what I would describe as the most torrid Government in the history of this country in respect of the taking away of members **rights**.

* The Government is pledged to support the **rights** of private members and it is making adequate provision for adjournment debates.

* When honourable members opposite talk about the **rights** of private members they should remember that there are a few skeletons that are well worth rattling in their old cupboards.

* The simple fact is that no other members of Australian Parliaments ever took away more of the **rights** of private members - as the figures I have given show - than did members of the previous Government.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
-Yes, of course.

* From our point of view, their assets and **rights** are fully protected.

* The essential element ofthe second article in each Agreement is that the land on which the facility was constructed remains vested in the Australian Government, which accords to the US Government all necessary **rights** of access to, and use and occupation of the land.

* Ten years ago the previous Government made decisions about the usage of the land which totally disregarded the **rights** of the people in Yirrkala, and now those people are reaping the whirlwind that arose from the decisions.

* I understand that the present Government is obsessed with State **rights** and therefore is loth to interfere with the power of State governments in the field of education.

* I consider, and I believe my colleagues from this side of the chamber consider, that the **rights** of the children transcend any consideration of State **rights** or anything of that order.

* The Labor Government of 1972-75 was elected on a policy of recognising Aboriginal land **rights**.

* By 1975 land **rights** had not been recognised by the Labor Government.

* It was this Government in 1976 that recognised land **rights** for the Aboriginal people.

* I think it is also due to the provisions which the Government has made for men who conscientiously object to military service, including the reference provisions introduced in August last year, and the firm, but I believe sympathetic, administration of the scheme by officers of my Department so that no man is unaware of his obligations or his **rights** and no man is forced to act without due regard to the consequences and in a manner which on reflection he might regret.

* I do not want to press the matter because it would look as though I were fighting entirely for specific **rights** as far as the House of Commons is concerned.

* Clause 45 provides that a contract in restraint of trade or commerce is unlawful insofar as it confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations upon a corporation and that a corporation shall not make a contract or engage in or be a party to a combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce.

* It is correct with regard to the **rights** of the individual but it is not correct with regard to the industry as a whole because any decision can have far reaching effects, good or bad, inside or outside the industry which can extend into the distant future as well as into the immediate future.

* In view of the Prime Minister's recent speech will he advise the House what initiatives have been taken by the Government to protect Aboriginal land **rights**?

* Of course he is entitled to his  view, but in my short experience I have never known the States to be particularly slow in asserting their **rights** or pursuing their interests.

* The Leader of the House refused him leave to make a statement because there was insufficient time, but the subsequent discussion about the **rights** of members has occupied more time than would have been available for the honourable member for Sturt to make his speech.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory referred also to the question of land **rights** and the possible extension of the process of the acquisition of land in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands beyond the land required for the immediate purpose of building a quarantine station.

* However, the Bill provides that regulations may be made conferring **rights** of review by the Federal Court of decisions made under Northern Territory laws that will continue to be administered by the Commonwealth Government.

* We believe that on the subject of safeguarding people's **rights** to a fair trial or to the administration of the law, there should be freedom of information in a matter as important as the use of listening devices.

* For many years in this Parliament I was almost a lone creature in my outspokenness for the **rights** of the individual to maintain his privacy.

* The Committee believes that the civil **rights** of Soviet citizens have improved considerably since the Stalin period ended in 1953.

* Within three years of  Mr Brezhnev  signing the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement, the Soviet Union flouted the Agreement's human **rights** provisions to such an extent that it has even imprisoned or expelled most of the people who, with considerable courage, had openly monitored the extent of Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Agreement.

* The widely proclaimed 1977 Soviet Constitution is at best an expression of hopes and desires, not an instrument whereby basic **rights** may be protected.

* The civil **rights** and freedoms of Soviet citizens are very much subordinate to the interests of the Soviet State; this is made clear in the Soviet Constitution.

* The Australian Embassy in Moscow should keep the Australian Government informed on Soviet human **rights** violations.

* This should include any information available on the treatment of Soviet citizens imprisoned for their political or religious beliefs, or because they have sought increased **rights** for a Soviet minority.

* The Committee recommends that the Australian Government request the United Nations Secretary-General to utilise the UN information services in Moscow to make available to interested people copies of UN conventions on human **rights**, in the languages of the main Soviet nationalities.

* In particular, Soviet penal regulations, and even more so their implementation, fall far short of humane concepts- in the system of punishments, the **rights** of prisoners to make complaints, to communicate with their families and friends, and, most seriously, to receive adequate nourishment and medical care.

* Such an organisation should comprise distinguished psychiatrists, lawyers and human **rights** specialists.

* Australia should be conscious of its respect for human **rights** in its relationship with the Soviet Union.

* It is recommended that in the course of bilateral discussions or negotiations with the USSR, the Australian Government take the opportunities that arise to state its disapproval of Soviet breaches of human **rights**.

* It is recommended that Australia's representatives at the United Nations and its agencies, particularly the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, be instructed to use these forums to raise human **rights** issues.

* Nevertheless, the Sub-Committee was able to obtain a number of Soviet publications which express the Soviet viewpoint on several human **rights** matters.

* It is my duty to ensure that the Government's legislative programme proceeds ' on schedule, but at the same time there must be a full recognistion of the **rights** of all members to adequate debating time for1 general and private members' business.

* During those discussions were the activities of Fesco, the Soviet shipping line, and the proposition concerning landing **rights** for Aeroflot in Australia raised?

* Does the Archbishop's death suggest that a wider campaign of terror is being waged and that basic human **rights** are being denied all Ugandans?

* If one is to talk about land **rights** or Aborigines, go and speak to the people who know something about them.

* There is tremendous pressure from outside the Territory and from some of the advisers and would-be experts on Aboriginal affairs, to see that the Bills for Aboriginal land **rights** or whatever are not referred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* Opposition members should be given their **rights**.

* But to bring down a blanket of this character and say that the entire Committee stage of the Bill has to be concluded by 3.15 p.m. appears to me to be a complete denial of the **rights** of this House and a contempt for this House.

* Ideally in a democracy information concerning the activities of Government and policy decisions should be open to all so that the people can know the changing nature of their **rights** and privileges as decided by their elected representatives, so that an informed and adequate public debate can take place on policy issues and so that checks and balances are available on the activities of governments.

* They are very serious matters which warrant the kind of security measures and the infringement upon the **rights** of members of this Parliament and of Australians to enter the parliamentary building in the course of their normal activities, that we are now witnessing.

* The measures are an invasion of the **rights** of members of this place, and making this Parliament a fortress spectacular will do one thing: It will attract the nuts, the crackpots, the cranks and the misfits who know that any kind of an event - 
I ask a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs about a report in last Friday's Age of hideous tortures of a British doctor, Sheila Cassidy, by the Chilean regime.

* The article stated that the United Nations committee on .human **rights** had concluded in its final report that torture of the utmost brutality had become routine under the Pinochet regime.

* In answer to a question I placed on notice about unratified International Labour Organisation conventions, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on the last sitting day told me that the Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, which is relevant to the land **rights** of Australian Aborigines, cannot yet be ratified by Australia because one State has not yet agreed.

* As my allegations subsequently have been proved correct and no malice was intended on my part, does my experience testify to the fact that the Racial Discrimination Act can in some instances work against the freedom and **rights** of everyone?

* I must also emphasise that in drafting this legislation the Government has been very sensitive to the need to avoid undue interference with the exercise of the **rights** of individuals.

* You have preached in this House, as has the Prime Minister, who recognises the Greek Athenian theory of citizenship in countries, namely, that there are those who are citizens who have all **rights** to share in the wealth, but that those who work are not citizens.

* But we cannot accept this because aged people are human beings and they have **rights** to self-respect and independence as human beings.

* I refer to the onus of proof in respect to the **rights** of exservicemen who served this country in the First World War.

* It could affect church groups, civil **rights** groups, protest groups, minority political groups and, in fact, any opposition party.

* I basically believe that we in this country have a democracy which is robust enough to enable us to accept precision written into laws which concern security and intelligence and which protect the **rights** of every Australian person.

* That is what the Opposition in this place is about; we are here to protect civil **rights** and to protect the **rights** of every Australian.

* It should not be hard to compose a form of words that guarantees those civil **rights**.

* The several areas that the Opposition is concerned with are environment, Aboriginal land **rights**, radiation hazards, nuclear explosions, terrorist activity and waste disposal.

* Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to cover the matters of the environment and Aboriginal land **rights**, but I will deal with some of the other matters.

* port facilities for the development of its scheelite deposits and mining **rights** on the Grassy side of King Island.

* Has the Government any ground to believe that other nations might be provoked to use force to get access to our mineral resources, including our vast deposits of uranium, if, because of its policies on Aboriginal **rights**, environmental factors or overseas ownership, the Government did not make those resources available to other nations?

* They are denied both their dignity and their **rights**.

* What are the reasons for this infringement of personal **rights** and the alteration of traditional Post Office practice?

* It just seemed to me that once a man established his eligibility by enlisting and serving in an overseas theatre his **rights** should not be taken away from him because of something that may have eventuated thereafter.

* They go to the courts and pay their penalty, and we do not pursue them relentlessly and deprive them of getting a decent living and having benefits and **rights** that other citizens should have.

* Do they really believe that they can impose a set of circumstances that can take away **rights** which people can really think of in contractual terms when they enlist?

* The Government's failure to fulfil its promises to acquire land **rights** for the Aboriginal people of Mornington Island and Aurukun in the event of measures adopted by the Queensland Government proving unsatisfactory.

* - Mr Speaker, I made it perfectly clear last week that I would brook no interference with the **rights** of this Parliament and with the determination that it makes on where its members go and who comprises its delegations.

* This is in marked contrast to what occurred in Victoria the weekend before last when not even a condemnation of human **rights** could be supported when the most scurrilous treatment had been handed out - 
I want now to mention very briefly the inadequacy of any mention of political **rights** in the conditions of service.

* I know that there is considerable opposition, particularly in the bureaucracy, to liberalising the political **rights** of servicemen, but now that they have been liberalised for public servants they should be liberalised to the same degree for servicemen.

* For as long as I remain in this Parliament as the representative of the electorate of Forrest I will fight for finance for local government without strings and without a cutting down of the **rights** or powers of the States, especially in the State of Western Australia.

* The Government also decided at that time that Australia should accede to the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles to enable it, consistent with its other international trade treaty **rights** and commitments, to take action against individual low-cost overseas sources of supply whose exports to Australia were causing or threatening disruption of the Australian market.

* of the Constitution could shatter the very base of the States' **rights**.

* Those bodies may or may not have the competence and objectivity necessary to protect the interests of affected people or the **rights** of the respective States.

* As one who has been and will continue to be directly involved in establishing the **rights** of migrants, I find the present situation exasperating.

* There are areas in which the activities of some union leaders have restricted freedom and inhibited human **rights** and human dignity.

* I hope that we will pay proper regard to the need to preserve the civil **rights** involved in this legislation.

* I suggest that honourable members in all parties in this House, as well as those in the other place, pay constant regard to the need to preserve the **rights** of freedom of movement as well as all the other privileges that ought to appertain to people.

* We do not want to surrender too many **rights** over individuals to any sort of legislative body- the House of Representatives, the Senate or an- Aboriginal council on a reserve.

* In my submission I am putting forward the proposition that both the protection of property **rights** and the protection of civil liberties are functions of the courts of this country.

* We believe that TAA should have similar **rights** and benefits because the private air line in this country has a great advantage, as has been pointed out, in the fields of road transport, television, the construction of buses and its diminishing hotel business.

* We believe that TAA should have similar **rights** and benefits.

* We say not that it should have move **rights** and benefits but that it should have the same.

* With the appalling examples of international piracy and destruction of 4 passenger aircraft at Cairo and in Jordan in the last 4 days, involving violence, seizure and international lawlessness without elementary regard to private **rights**, common decency or law and order, does the Minister propose any special measures in respect of Australia's overseas airline or domestic airlines to meet any political or crank attempts to hijack Australian aircraft?

* The honourable member for Curtin  (Mr Garland)  would be a more plausible champion of the **rights** of local government if he had shown some regard for those **rights** in the 3 years during which he was a member of this House and his Party was in government.

* Will he reaffirm that that statement does not contravene the States' **rights** philosophy of the Government or its basic Liberal philosophy?

* We are totally opposed to this concept because it cuts across basic human **rights**, although it is alleged to be in the interests of the workers concerned.

* So far as the damage alleged to be caused by workmen on the Tuggeranong project is concerned, the Minister for Services and Property advises that the **rights** of rural landholders are respected.

* No one would challenge the right of the Territorians to be represented here and have full voting **rights**.

* It has been said the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory should have the same **rights** as the people of the States.

* On 16 May 1975 the Law Reform Commission reported on the question of the appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individual **rights** and liberties in relation to the law enforcement process of the Australia Police.

* So **rights** and liberties ought to be safeguarded, but such a provision is not contained in the legislation.

* Part VIII provided for transitional provisions in relation to the appointment of and preservation of **rights** of police officers automatically transferred to the Australia Police.

* But I make this plea to the Minister: If the Government wants an efficient and effective police force it should ensure that the provisions for the welfare of the members in respect of promotions, appeals and transfers, whether they are written into the Act or made by way of regulations, safeguard the **rights** of the members.

* The amendment will not apply in respect of assessments yet to be raised in respect of earlier years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior years where the taxpayers' **rights** are protected by way of objection or appeal to a court.

* The amendments proposed do not, in any way, take away or reduce the **rights** of existing invalidity pensioners.

* However, I believe that this is not the occasion on which to speak about the **rights** and wrongs or the details of the report.

* The **rights** of present serving members are protected where they are superior to those provided in the Bill.

* As I understand it also- and I repeat that I state all this so that I can be corrected if I am wrong before giving the Opposition's attitude to the Bill- at the same time the Bill preserves the **rights** of competitors and consumers by limiting the initial term of a petty patent to 12 months with, as I mentioned earlier, those extensions to six years.

* Indeed I hope that we will all respond because if we do not we are going to stand condemmed and all our talk about human **rights** and quality of life will be just so much useless and meaningless waffle.

* Yet, the Government is following a course which is becoming usual with it, of treating the States and their **rights** with complete disregard.

* I think it needs to be made quite clear that the Scarf Memorial Foundation is not the principal Australian organisation which trades with Arab countries nor does the Scarf Memorial Foundation have sole trading **rights** with Arab countries.

* I am pleased about this because it recognises the **rights** of private members to speak in these debates.

* Above all, the **rights** and freedoms of the Australian people are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores.

* The persons who preside over the proceedings of this House are the protectors of the **rights** of the Parliament- not of the Executive or a political party- while acknowledging that the Government must control the business of the House.

* ls it a fact, as reported in The Australian of 30th July 1971, that he hopes to be able to announce soon the Government's attitude on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* If so, what is the Government's attitude on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* When will the Yirrkala Village Council and the Djapu Tribe of Aborigines be given answers to their demand for land **rights** made to the Prime Minister on 6th May 1971.

* We are now discussing the war service homes legislation, and frankly I am appalled that the Minister should display such ignorance and lack of knowledge about what after all is one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament dealing with the **rights** of ex-servicemen.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
Under these commissions large tracts of land can be acquired ahead of development.

* I personally favour the Else-Mitchell report which recommends that residential land should be freehold with the development **rights** maintained by the development authority or the State, but in the case of commercial or industrial land it should be leasehold as it is here in Canberra.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the  Sunday Telegraph  of 12 November 1978 which states that motorists who break any of the Queensland traffic laws, while driving in that State with a licence issued in another State, receive letters from the Secretary of the Queensland Transport Department reminding them that driving a motor vehicle in Queensland on a driver's licence issued in another State or country is a privilege, and warning them that if they are convicted again of a breach of the Queensland traffic laws, their **rights** to drive in Queensland could be revoked.

* Another restriction applying to aged persons homes is that people who go into them do not acquire any tenancy **rights**.

* Section 57ab refers to the Northern Territory and it has been interesting to listen to speakers from the Government side of the House during the last couple of nights speaking about the **rights** of the people of the Northern Territory.

* Farrer led a revolt against  Mr Gorton  on so-called State **rights**.

* .We had the ludicrous position last year when negotiating with Indonesia concerning the limits of our exploratory **rights** on the continental shelf that the people who spoke for Australia were members of the Western Australian Government.

* If we could have an inspector or someone who could give them a bit of advice and let them know their **rights** this would make a great deal of difference.

* The approach so far, from what I have heard from the earlier speakers, has been towards land **rights**.

* That fellow has not been hesitant in asserting his own **rights**.

* For instance, when he mentions land **rights** for Aborigines does he include Torres Strait Islanders?

* Fourthly, would they be allowed to control all mining **rights** on this land, and if it was found that mineral wealth existed there would they be allowed to enter into negotiations for mining concessions with overseas organisations if these organisations wished to develop this mineral wealth?

* Finally, I ask the Leader of the Opposition: Is what he spoke about today but has not covered fully yet ALP policy on land **rights** for Aborigines or is it his own thoughts on the matter or something he dreamed up on the spur of the moment for political expediency to gain the support of the coloured people prior to the next election?

* It has been reported that the so-called Aboriginal embassy opposite Parliament House is seeking full State **rights** for the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership, ownership of all other reserves and settlements in Australia with titles to their mining and mineral **rights** and mineral and mining **rights** in certain towns and cities.

* In his statement the Minister for the Environment Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  outlined the Government's policy on Aboriginal land **rights** - a policy with which I am sure the great majority of our coloured people will be happy.

* So 1 suggest that we take their freedom and their **rights** as citizens.

* The effect of clause 1 1 together with clause 13 of the Bill is to continue the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* The transitional provisions of the Bill ensure the continuity of government and personal actions and the vesting of **rights** and responsibilities in the new bodies and entities which are established at self-government.

* It may be that some aspects of that Act, as part of Australian law, but no longer as part of Papua New Guinea law, will require amendment to protect the **rights** under Australian law of persons, matters or things connected with Papua New Guinea or to make provision for the occurrence of matters in Papua New Guinea affecting Australia but not Papua New Guinea.

* In the practical circumstances of professional health and education workers dealing with parents this is an important and complex issue, but I doubt whether a simple answer can be given in terms of moral **rights** and duties.

* It is high time that we had in power a government that has decent respect for human **rights**, human dignity, the liberty of the subject and the **rights** of man.

* Just where do the **rights** of man end or begin, if this is the way you are going to treat this young woman?

* Currently, Qantas can exercise traffic **rights** at Honolulu, San Francisco and New York.

* This Bill is a companion measure to the Superannuation Bill 1970 that I have just introduced and amends the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1970 lo give effect to the Government's proposals for the preservation of superannuation **rights**.

* and (2) Under the National Service Act registrants have the same **rights**, obligations and liabilities.

* the adequacy and effectiveness of existing medicolegal determinations in relation to termination, of pregnancy, the incidence of such terminations, the factors influencing their occurrence, the adequacy of medical training in an evaluation of methods of termination, consultative **rights** of the family or other persons concerned and the adequacy and effectiveness of pregnancy support services; and (f) any other matters in relation to the family, social, educational, legal and sexual aspects of male and female relationships to which the attention of the Commission is directed by the Prime Minister in the course of the inquiry.

* It will continue to support resolutions calling for improvement in the respect for and observance of human **rights** in that country.

* -Does the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations recall my asking him earlier this session a question in relation to the **rights** of trade unionists who were fined by their unions for working during the Medibank strike?

* Clause 6 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decision which affect **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* 1) and (2) Operators of international non-scheduled services are not granted traffic **rights** as is the case with international scheduled airlines designated by their own governments under Air Service Agreements Australia enters into with the governments of the other countries concerned.

* I am also concerned about the attitude expressed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of the amendment, namely, that full and proper recognition be given to the status and **rights** of a woman as a wife and mother and that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage.

* Secondly, will he have an investigation made into the desirability of extinguishing the **rights** of private companies to engage in life assurance because under the Act as I understand it a private company can take 20 per cent of the profits - although they do not take anything like that amount - and so that people insured with such companies shall have greater benefits than they can now obtain?

* The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also mentioned the inclusion in the Bill of provisions to give greater **rights** of entry to union officials.

* Members of the Opposition have always been loud in their concern for the **rights** of the rank and file trade unionist, although whether they have been sincere in this is another matter.

* The provisions in this Bill give effect to that platform as they refer to the **rights** and safeguards of the individual member of a union.

* The Bill, of course, contains appropriate provisions relating to officers' **rights**, staff, audit and finance.

* There are patent **rights** involved which would make it difficult, at this stage, for any manufacturer to enter into the production of this type of product.

* What options are available to the Government to guarantee the **rights** of exporters to export?

* The fact that an increasing number of people in this chamber are turning their attention in this changing age to the **rights** of individuals is at least rewarding for some of those who have been long time champions of the cause.

* Which  is  what this is all about- will give organisations with existing **rights** 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels.

* He indicated that it was a firm commitment of the Government to preserve the independent **rights** of the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.

* It had denied all the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* The facts are that where human **rights** are concerned, where fundamental respect of the civil liberties of people is at issue and where proper standards normally accepted by the community in these matters are concerned the Queensland Government cannot be trusted.

* It is clear from the contents of that Bill- the power which it proposes to put in the hands of the Queensland Government- that the Queensland Government neither repents nor retreats from its position of dogged opposition to the proposition that the **rights** of the Aboriginal people of those two communities, in common with the **rights** of Aboriginal people generally in that State, should be respected and should be enshrined firmly in legislation.

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has often said that the Government is firmly committed to defending the **rights** of these Aboriginal people.

* They said in the firmest terms imaginable that the **rights** of the Aboriginal people would be protected.

* if the legislation for self-management, through local government, is not satisfactory, if it doesn't measure up, if the terms of the special lease to secure these **rights** of use and occupation to the Aboriginal people living there do not measure up, then the Commonwealth is prepared to acquire, to see that the people obtain what they ought to obtain.

* It is quite clear that there can be no parleying with a government as regressive, reactionary and insensitive to fundamental **rights** as the Queensland Government.

* He encouraged those people to believe that the Government would expeditiously take firm steps to protect their **rights**.

* Queensland also reserves to itself power over mineral search and **rights** in these areas.

* It is almost as tiresome as the discussion on constitutional **rights**.

* Another relates to fisheries, in relation to which there is an area of difference between the 2 governments in terms of the waters and the fishing **rights** which are claimed.

* As a result of it, many areas have been extensively rehabilitated; a greater degree of social mix has been introduced to the inner suburbs; and inner suburban communities have become better organised and more vocal in standing up for their **rights** against the many forces which threaten their homes.

* But it will survive only if we maintain and enhance its democratic values at a time when democratic values and the things which accompany them such as human **rights** and civil liberties are disappearing extremely quickly around the globe.

* It is clear that they have been directed to campaign against this Government, which is a serious denial of civil **rights**.

* I ask the Attorney-General a question regarding human **rights**.

* (2) and (3) Following  Mr Viner  's undertaking in his Second Reading Speech that the Government would take all representations into account in arriving at the final form of the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation individual Ministers did receive delegations presenting submissions on the draft legislation.

* Accordingly, the cost price of such property as land, buildings, construction work in progress, shares, other securities and other legal **rights**, including industrial property such as patents and copyrights, will not be subject to adjustment.

* That of course would raise very serious questions of privacy and the **rights** of the individual.

* I almost get sick and tired of saying this, but the Commonwealth has no **rights** at all in imposing production controls.

* We will support their **rights** strongly.

* The reference I made about the recognition of the fundamental **rights** of Aborigines to retain their racial identity and traditional lifestyle also affects another situation at Aurukun.

* Has be given consideration to appointing a committee to advise on legislation with respect  to  public lending **rights** as  a  former AttorneyGeneral did with respect  to  copyrights?

* Offset credit is also allowed for the value of transferred technology, the waiver of licence fees, manufacturing **rights** and royalty payments and the like.

* Many companies involved themselves in purchases of shares which on a basis of one vote per share gave them voting **rights** considerably in excess of 15 per cent.

* The articles of association of the companies were altered to provide that no quantity of shares represented more than 15 per cent of the voting **rights**.

* Did the Commonwealth Industrial Court recently rule that section 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes it lawful for a union executive to carry a resolution containing an erroneous expression of legal opinion as to a member's **rights** to petition for a controlled election in his union and that the only way of testing the validity of an erroneous interpretation of union rules is for a member to risk defiance of such an interpretation, by gambling his standing or office in a union against his own untested interpretation of the law.

* from thieves and vandals and (b) ensure that the **rights** of rural lessees are respected by surveyors, planners and other workmen employed on the Tuggeranong development.

* from thieves and vandals and (b) ensure that the **rights** of rural lessees are respected by surveyors, planners and other workmen employed on the Tuggeranong development.

* As the honourable gentleman knows, members of the Commission are given the same **rights** as High Court judges.

* A further Bill will follow and deal with matters concerning the structures of companies such as their incorporation, voting **rights** and winding up.

* I ask: Can the Prime Minister assure the House that no works will proceed at Ranger or at any other mine site until the national park has been proclaimed, all Aboriginal land **rights** questions have been settled and the recommendations of the second Ranger report have been fully implemented?

* It would take away the **rights** of individual States to determine the way in which persons from those States are to go on to the Council.

* There was a time in this country when every citizen, even the humble sausage maker and candle-stick maker, had 2 fundamental **rights**- to own his own home and to have a job.

* But these **rights** and their associated hopes have been splintered through the schemes and policies of the Labor Government.

* The proposal of the Leader of the Opposition to use section 51 (xxix), the external affairs power, in relation to a Bill of **rights** not only raises some serious legal and constitutional problems but also is totally at odds with the philosphy and policy I have outlined, which is designed to work in harmony and co-operation with the States, and also in a way that protects the basic **rights** of the States to the extent that that is possible.

* I think it also overlooks the fact that we have already legislated in a number of areas to protect the **rights** of citizens and will continue to do so where there is a need.

* The Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and other provisions are areas where the Commonwealth has shown concern for the **rights** of individual citizens against, for example, what can sometimes be regarded as a large, powerful and hard to understand bureaucracy.

* Protection for the **rights** of individuals in a modern society I think is necessary.

* We are also quite well advanced at officer and ministerial levels in developing co-operative Commonwealth-State human **rights** machinery.

* The provision of information to citizens of Commonwealth countries, including those from Cyprus and Malta, who are now living in Australia is tied in with a general campaign by the Australian Electoral Office to inform eligible voters of their **rights** and obligations.

* My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, arises out of the tragic news that reached us at the end of last week from the Gazelle Peninsula and the reminder in it of the intensity of feeling about Aboriginal claims for land **rights** - whether they are made in Papua New Guinea or here in Australia.

* I refer to the delegation from Yirrkala and Gove that attended on the Prime Minister on 6th May of this year, when the spokesman for that group said that Aboriginals could not be satisfied with anything less than- 
On transactions in marketable securities - that is, in company shares or debentures or in **rights** to take up shares or debentures - A.C.T.

* In the light of this and of accounting difficulties associated with capital works undertaken by the respective States on the railway, the Commonwealth Government has agreed to waive its **rights** to share in the distribution of any surplus revenue or profit from the operation of the railway, and thus has enabled the agreement to be wholly discharged.

* I present the following paper: 
in reply - In closing this brief debate on this measure, I express my appreciation first to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant)  for his words of congratulation and also his passionate attachment, as on all occasions, to equal **rights** for all of our citizens.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  making this time a read speech, said that the Minister had not said a single word about human **rights**.

* The Opposition's amendment and attack on the Budget lacks credibility mainly because its policies can survive and thrive only in economic and industrial disaster, and in the socialisation of human **rights** and aspiration.

* As has already been pointed out by the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard),  we will accept the amendments which have been proposed, but we have doubts as to whether it is necessary for the Prime Minister to take unto himself such very vital responsibilities in relation to individual **rights**.

* The recommendation of most significance is that for the future what are called land development **rights** should not rest as they have done in the past, as it were, in the possession of the owner of the land but should be regarded as property of the community.

* If the Minister, having had time to read the report, makes a recommendation and so on the proposition will be that from that time on, as from today, all land development **rights** will be the property of the community.

* I am also not clear on how the value of land development **rights** is to be determined.

* There may be a dispute about how valuable land development **rights** are in a particular area.

* If this takes place and a cash payment is made to somebody on behalf of these land development **rights**, who is to make that cash payment?

* Or will it, as it seems to be envisaged in the report, be a cash payment made by a private developer who, acquiring the land, as he does, somehow or other arrives at a decision as to what the land development **rights** are worth and makes that payment to the public body concerned.

* If that happens, and it appears that it would, it will require much more detailed examination than we can give it at the moment to see how this will help very much the ultimate consumer of the block of land in that development and the house that is built upon it, because if the full value of land development **rights** is paid by the developer clearly he will get back that full value when he sells the blocks of land and subdivides them.

* In some cases I think it has been, and I am agreeing that it is a bad thing for it to be held to ransom; but I also say that just as the community has **rights** and a right not to be held to ransom so the individual has **rights**.

* He has just **rights** and proper **rights** which should not be overridden by making him by force subsidise the community.

* Both these **rights** need to be protected as is clearly noted in the English legislation and in the English approach, as the Minister will agree.

* Will the Minister agree that the raids constitute a blatant violation of civil **rights**?

* It is the way in which human **rights** have been used selectively in order to direct, determine and sour relations between Australia and Indonesia which distresses me.

* Atrocities have occurred in Timor but a nation treads a very serious and dangerous couse when it allows a selective interpretation of those **rights** to direct its own foreign policy.

* There are countless hundreds of people overseas who would like to know that their voting **rights** are protected.

* There are people throughout Australia who would like to know that the updated - 
Australian Industrial Court to be DirectorGeneral of Security;  Sir Owen  Dixon, then a Justice of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to the United States, and  Sir John  Latham while Chief Justice of the High Court, to be Australian Minister to Japan, the Government proposes to introduce legislation similar to that introduced on those other occasions to enable  Mr Justice  Fox to retain his judicial status and the **rights** which attach to that status while AmbassadoratLarge.

* It is derived asCapital and Reserve Funds plus Special ReserveInternational Monetary Fund special drawing **rights** plus other liabilities net of cheques and bills of other banks Bills receivable and remittances in transit loans, advances and all other assets plus rural credits advances to customers.

* The net result of them is this: Public servants are restricted unnecessarily in their **rights** as citizens.

* He is a man who would seem to have strong views, as indeed any citizen is entitled to have, on the question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* In his capacity as an ordinary citizen he chose to make a statement about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* That man, whom the editorial writers of the 'Northern Terirtory News' described as a champion of Aboriginal causes, found himself fined $20 for each of a number of offences he was alleged to have committed by making public comments on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Welfare Rights (Pilot Program) 
Grants have been made available under a pilot program to five organisations in Sydney and five organisations in Melbourne for the appointment of a welfare **rights** officer to provide ethnic and other disadvantaged groups with information, referral and advisory services.

* The Senate has the same **rights** as the House of Representatives in all respects other than the amendment of financial Bills.

* Benefits have been gradually improved and in recent years provision has been made for the preservation of superannuation **rights** on entry into or exit from the scheme and noncontributory units have been introduced to give some relief to members faced with very nigh contributions in their later years of service.

* -I do not think that is the basis upon which to make judgments as to whether or not there should be an amendment to an Act of Parliament to give certain **rights** to a person who, as an individual, will give certain undertakings.

* As to the quibble about particular **rights** of the Public Works Committee, I refer honourable members to clause 25 of the Bill, which states: 
Would granting land at Wattie Creek assist the people who are living there towards this objective?

* I found in discussions I had in Canada last year that the land **rights** which were accorded to the Indian bands there had had the effect, in practice, of encouraging divisions between the Indian people and the wider Canadian community.

* My belief is that the Wattie Creek issue has attracted a great deal of support from people who feel, quite genuinely, that a great injustice has been done to the Aboriginal people by dispossession of their forebears when Australia was settled from Europe, and there is great attraction in proposals to recognise so-called traditional land **rights**, or to set up a compensation fund.

* Does this undertaking mean that the South Vietnamese can never be granted Australian citizenship or, if they can, they will not have the same civil **rights** as all other Australian citizens have?

* 1) the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child states that the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth, and asserts that a child shall be entitled to grow and develop in health and to this end special care and attention should be provided both to the child and to the mother, including adequate prenatal and post-natal care, and 
To examine the implications of the possible extension of part-time work on a number of issues such as establishment arrangements, the question of permanent tenure and the **rights** of full-time officers vis-a-vis part-time officers or employees.

* The Commission of Inquiry into land Tenures did recommend that land disposed of for residential purposes should be granted on the basis of fee simple titles subject to improvement conditions and the reservation of development **rights**.

* However for the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory it was recommended that residential land be held under perpetual leases subject to the reservation of development **rights** and to the payment of capital premiums on allocation but not to rental obligations.

* An extract from that declaration reads: 
Honourable members may be assured that we will preserve to the full their **rights** as private members.

* I would like to add words something like 'and in relation to each group the traditional **rights** which they exercise over such land'.

* I agree that this Bill has been brought forward not without skill and certainly with good intentions, but I believe we are by this Bill unhappily failing a little because we are not looking at the complexities of the situation and asking Aboriginals to give us advice as how best to assure to them their traditional **rights**.

* A declaration of what sort of international value should be fixed for drawing **rights**, or SDRs, will not cure the international problems.

* Is this any way to cater for the **rights** of the Opposition?

* Should we not have an opportunity in this House to say to the Government that the Concorde aircraft should not land in this country until such time as we are assured - doubly assured, for that matter - that it will not interfere with the **rights** of the public of this country?

* The Government has not repealed the National Service Act primarily because it wishes to ensure preservation of the **rights** of those men who were serving at the date the Government assumed office, including those who have elected to continue their service under the provisions of the National Service Act.

* On this side of the House we are more concerned with the **rights** of human beings, their capacity to enjoy life and their ability to take their place in society.

* It is little wonder that the Opposition does not trust the Government's safeguards and land **rights** negotiations, and is dissatisfied with their results.

* -I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications: Did the Australian Broadcasting Commission lose its exclusing **rights** to televise test cricket simply because this Government slashed the ABC's budget and left it without the capacity to submit a competitive tender?

* has each State Government proclaimed or will it proclaim legislation giving adult **rights** lo persons under 21 years of age.

* It is important, as I have said, in this highly complex technological society that the **rights** of individuals be seen to be protected from the bureaucracy which people often feel they are incapable of opposing.

* These functions included a wide range of community services and State functions and a lot of control over many forms of social legislation including, for example, workers compensation, gambling, censorship, consumer protection, the **rights** of women, the **rights** of minors, daylight saving and control of firearms.

* The Government is unable to say that a correlation exists between actions taken by the Soviet authorities against persons campaigning for human **rights** in the USSR and the timing of prospective visits by prominent foreign leaders to the USSR.

* The Government is deeply attached to the need to promote and defend the cause of human **rights** throughout the world.

* The issue of human **rights** in the Soviet Union is one which has drawn the particular attention of the Government.

* The Government has called on the Soviet Union to implement the important principles of human **rights** embodied in United Nations instruments as well as the 197S Helsinki Accords.

* The Government's stand on human **rights** will be maintained into 1980 (when the Olympic Games are to be held in Moscow) and for as long as basic human **rights** are denied in the Soviet Union or elsewhere.

* The policy of the Australian Labor Party as approved at the 29th Conference at Launceston in 1971 included the statement that 'Aboriginal land **rights** shall carry with them full **rights** to minerals in those lands'.

* and(4) The Government will determine what action should be taken in relation to land **rights**, and in relation to minerals in Aboriginal lands, when the final report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission has been received.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demon strates an increasing tolerance of and re-  spect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
I come now to the substance of the agreement and to its effects.

* First, it represents a mutually acceptable accommodation of Australia's and Indonesia's respective claims to sovereign **rights** over seabed resources in the area concerned.

* Second, it will be noted from article 4 that the 2 governments mutually acknowledge the sovereign **rights** of each government in and over tha seabed within the limits established by this agreement and that they will cease to claim or exercise sovereign **rights** over natural resources beyond the boundaries now established.

* The importance of countries' retaining sovereign **rights**, at the very least out to the 200-metre depth line, has been emphasised by Australia in the law of the sea discussions in the United Nations.

* As the Budget allocation for war service homes has already been spent, causing the re-introduction of a 4 months waiting period, will the Government give consideration to a no-waiting period for those who have served in the Vietnam war as distinct from those who served in earlier wars and who have delayed applying for their rehabilitation **rights** and benefits under the Act until this financial year?

* Finally, is it true that wc have consistently refused American charter companies landing **rights** while we awaited the birth of Qantair?

* 3453 (Hansard, 4th November 1971) will he provide (a) full details, for inclusion in Hansard, of the land **rights** extended to Aboriginal peoples in (i) Canada and (ii) the United States of America as sought in the question and now being obtained by the Australian Embassies in Ottawa and Washington and (b) the details sought in part (3) of that question in respect of Queensland.

* The reason basically is that their savings and their superannuation **rights** were accumulated in times when the value of money was quite different.

* In considering the legislation it also needs to be borne in mind that most non-bank financial institutions are already subject to supervision under State or Territory laws which deal primarily with the **rights** of borrowers and lenders and the financial stability of companies.

* It is the Government's intention that payment and temporary staff transferred from the Postmaster-General's Department and Overseas Telecommunications Commission to the new commissions will retain all existing **rights** and entitlements and will be employed under conditions no less favourable than those presently enjoyed.

* It demonstrates the difference between the socialist attitude to people's **rights** and the attitude of private enterprise.

* I indicated that negotiations were already well advanced at both officer and ministerial level to develop co-operative Commonwealth-State human **rights** machinery.

* The difference between members on this side of the House and members of the Opposition is that the Australian Labor Party does not bother about co-operation with anyone; members of the Labor Party just go marching over a cliff, 
The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the preservation of such **rights** as are specified in the regulations by a police officer who is appointed to be a fulltime Chairman of Promotions Appeal Boards under this Act and for and in relation to the appointment of such a police officer to a position in the Australian Federal Police upon the termination of his appointment under this section otherwise than upon the ground of his misconduct or after his having attained the age for retirement from the Australian Federal Police.

* I rate health and education as being pretty equal basic needs in this community and pretty equal basic **rights**.

* I might mention that if the right honourable member for Bruce is to protect the **rights** of individual members of this House he should cease making the very heavy imposition that he has made on the research services of the Parliamentary Library, especially the legal research service.

* It is rumoured that the O-Ten television network is to be granted sole **rights** to telecast traditional cricket.

* It would not be a bad idea if we started with some equal **rights** in this House.

* Human **rights** everywhere are important; it is the duty and obligation of free people everywhere to uphold them.

* But, one would have to be blind to not recognise that inside the Soviet Union there are great deprivations of human **rights**.

* As I said earlier, in my view the **rights** of humanity transcend the **rights** of sovereignty.

* Nobody bothered much about the **rights** of, say, the people of Israel to be free of that sort of criticism.

* They were under constant attack but there was an official inquiry by the United Nations into human **rights** in Chile.

* Racism is one of the more dreadful deprivations of human **rights**.

* If we are prepared to examine that thoroughly then we ought to be prepared to examine the deprivation of human **rights** wherever it occurs.

* I think that human **rights** are very low on the scale of priorities of the Government of Indonesia.

* I am not suggesting that we become as dramatic as that but it would not hurt us to get into' the international arena and point out wherever human **rights** are being trampled on, and try to use whatever influence we have with the people with whom we deal to have those **rights** restored to suffering humanity.

* The honourable member well knows that it is not the duty of the Chair to advise any member of the Opposition or the Government on any tactics he may use or **rights** he may have.

* I would point out that in addition to endeavouring to have an improved airport provided I have also endeavoured to protect the **rights** of the people whose homes will be acquired and are being acquired because of the action which will take place.

* It has been somewhat more difficult to obtain quick results in areas requiring changes of legislation by the Commonwealth and States- for example, in resolving anomalies in voting **rights**.

* In view of the crucial significance of this subject to the future **rights** and liberties of all Australians will the Minister try to arrange that the report, now No.

* It has been a long time coming, but we now have a government which accepts no constitutional inhibitions and which will place our **rights** and duties to the citizenry of Australia before any theology, including State **rights** or constitutional precedence.

* 1 ) Have pilot welfare **rights** projects been introduced. 
)

* What is a welfare **rights** officer.

* 1 ) Did the Else-Mitchell Report on Land Tenure propose that land disposed of for residential purposes should be granted on the basis of fee simple title subject to improvement convenants and the reservation of development **rights**.

* I hope that he will have the courage of his convictions and express the views that he sincerely feels about the **rights** of the Timorese people to determine their own future.

* There still are some great battles to be fought, particularly on the question of land **rights**, mining developments and so on.

* Mr Bjelke-Petersen  is not obstructionist, as has been so frequently claimed in this Parliament, but he will stand up for State **rights**.

* At present the various State governments are accepting the grants on these conditions but if the Victorian people elected a government which had the policy reported as being that of the State executive of the Australian Labor Party against State aid it would be within its **rights** to refuse to accept the grants!

* In other words, we would be usurping their **rights** if in this Parliament we took action along the lines suggested by the honourable member for Dawson.

* Then again, the **rights** of women are involved.

* I hope that none of us would readily say that the **rights** of women should not be taken into account.

* As an honest and conscientious legislator I have to say that although I embrace the Menhennitt ruling, although I am against abortion, and although I understand the sanctity of the foetus, the **rights** of women and the social implications of abortion, I cannot in conscience support the motion.

* Of course, we have a  2-airline  policy which permits these  2  operators to carry on business in a particular way which preserves their **rights** and privileges and affords them protection.

* There can be no question of interfering with the **rights** of people who have already established homes in the Dandenongs.

* Clause 8, page 9, at the end of proposed section 2I9G add the following sub-sections:  "(4)Any person to whom information is communicated under sub-section (3), and any person or employee under his control, shall in respect of that information be subject to the same **rights**, privileges, obligations and liabilities as are imposed on persons under sub-section ( 1 ).

* In view of its importance for maintaining for traditional Aborigines the traditional land and traditional **rights** which this Bill describes in its title, I ask that the amendment be seriously considered, if not here at least in another place.

* The honourable member for Wannon wandered into the chamber at 10 minutes to 10 this evening and, in a dramatic gesture, he - this wealthy exponent of the **rights** of the individual, caring not a hang for the children in sheltered workshops and other institutions - wanted to table a particular document forthwith.

* The proposition that I wish to put to the Attorney-General is this: In clause 14 of this Bill positive statements are made as far as certain **rights**, freedoms and dignities in respect of protected persons are concerned.

* This factionalism, this whole sense of trying to get different groups fighting for their **rights**, fighting to see whether they can get a bigger slice of the cake than another particular group, is implicit in the matters raised by the Opposition.

* He was going to be the upholder of Parliament and of the **rights** of members.

* They have no **rights** now.

* They sold their **rights** down the drain when they voted for the guillotine measure.

* I ask him to respect the forms of the Parliament and the **rights** of the Australian people to know what this Government is doing and why it is doing it.

* The major thrust in the new initiatives set out in that document relate to Aboriginal self-management and Aboriginal land **rights**.

* But those are secondary areas, and if one talks to Aboriginal people one finds that the real thrust, particularly in the traditional areas, is in relation to land **rights**- the relationship that Aboriginal people have to their land, identification with their land, and their wish to have access to it.

* It went on to say that the Minister was no match for Country Party Ministers who see Aboriginal land **rights** demands as being the thin end of the wedge which could threaten existing land ownership in the outback.

* Members of the DLP also would have thrown their weight against any suggestion of land **rights** for the Aborigines.

* The DLP attitude was made quite clear in an article appearing in the Melbourne Herald' of 7th August which stated that the DLP at its State conference had rejected a motion calling on the Government to recognise land **rights** for the Aborigines.

* It is a shocking thing to say, but at least it proves where the DLP stands in relation to protecting the land **rights** of the the Aboriginal people.

* One can well imagine the brick wall that the Minister must run into when he tries to put up any recommendations of his Department in respect of moves towards Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I know that he travelled in that area as a member of the Committee examining Aboriginal voting **rights**, but that is a long time ago.

* Indeed, it makes a mockery of the Government's policy on land **rights**.

* It indicates that land **rights** are an urgent issue of natural justice.

* who have neither land **rights** nor the protection accorded under the Northern Territory Act.

* But it is to the even greater shame of the present Government which inherited a strong body of land **rights** law prepared in the Whitlam Government years and which has whittled them away ever since.

* -I think all members of this House have been concerned about breaches of human **rights** as they have occurred around the world.

* They have certainly emotionally supported the general concern expressed by the  President  of the United States of America about the extent to which human **rights** are prejudiced in many countries- tragically, far too many.

* There is certainly, within the fundamental **rights** that lie in the precepts of the Helsinki agreement, an understanding which it was hoped might be seen as an advance in the general form of protection of human **rights** within the Iron Curtain countries and would lead to an advancement, a recognition, of the United Nations Covenant on Human Rights.

* I think that in general all I can say is that  Dr Orlov  's trial and sentence certainly will serve to qualify Western confidence that the Soviet Union intends to honour its commitments on the implementation of human **rights**.

* Before any action is taken, or if no action at all is taken, will the Prime Minister use his personal influence or his constitutional powers to ensure that the people of the Torres Strait Islands have land **rights** conferred upon them without cost, so that they can decide what they want to do?

* No one can argue that those with a need for legal advice, or with **rights** to be asserted or defended, should not have access to able lawyers and to the courts but the means of providing, within the welfare state, a legal social service is a matter of some debate.

* This amendment will allow the Government to acquire the land that it wants without impairing the **rights** of appeal of the Clunies Ross family.

* All the substantial systems of examination of legislation have been developed over that time to protect the **rights** of minorities in this chamber, the majorities and minorities outside and the members of the Par.liament to discuss the questions before it.

* That this House records with profound sadness the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Czechoslavakia by Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces in the spring of 1968; the tragic loss of life, the continuing violations of basic human **rights**, including the open persecution of the Charter 77 Movement, and calls for the immediate withdrawal from Czechoslovakia of over 70 000 Soviet troops.

* Having regard to a change of practice of the Patents Office following a Court decision and a Patent Office decision with respect to applications for extension of time, will he take action to make section 160 of the Patents Act again available to applicants who might otherwise lose valuable industrial property **rights** due to reasons which may be beyond their control.

* Commonwealth governments in the development of Australia's water resources, I believe he should have gone on to say that th s Bill represented a significant move towards maintaining the sovereign **rights** of the States and the Commonwealth.

* Who but the present Opposition would oppose the Bills by which we propose to change the Constitution or attempt to deny to the people of Australia the benefits and democratic **rights** to which they are entitled.

* This legislation is designed simply to preserve his **rights** as a judge during the period of his appointment.

* Having done that, however, it is illogical to suggest that those people should then be given the full **rights** and privileges of permanency as would be given to any other members of the Public Service if they have not had a similar background.

* I think we all should realise that this is part of an evolutionary process which will show up some of the defects, or what appear to be defects, in the ability of the ordinary individual in the community to obtain his proper **rights** or at least to have his **rights** and role examined.

* Unless the legislation is changed, it will leave only unions open to prosecution under the sections of the legislation allegedly aimed at protecting the **rights** of individuals against actions by unions and employers.

* In other words, the issue of a warrant would be the last resort and it was necessary to go to that extreme length of interfering with the **rights** of citizens.

* It is very important, in dealing with the **rights** of people, to bear in mind that this Bill goes a long way in providing that a judge has to be satisfied on oral and other facts which are put before him before he issues a warrant.

* In fact, they strengthen the Bill insofar as there is a guarantee to every citizen that there will be no unnecessary interference with their **rights** of privacy.

* The **rights** to export the minerals have been given and so an inquiry is now to be held, I suppose, in the hope that the minimum amount of damage is done to the environment, to the sand dunes and the island in the course of those mining operations.

* The Minister may recall a question asked of  him yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition concerning Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the **rights** of members or groups of members.

* There is, of course, a new world wide consciousness of the **rights** and opportunities of women.

* The May 1973- 
mineral **rights**.

* First, takeovers covered by the 1972 policy measures, that is, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral **rights**.

* These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting **rights** attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to board representation **rights** and **rights** to participate in the management or profits of a business.

* Whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government's objectives in relation to such matters as defence, the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and the preservation of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Does the Minister believe that the change of leadership in South Africa will assist black South Africans in obtaining basic human **rights**?

* Therefore, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of the cost of either extending Australian Repatriation and associated **rights** to British and allied ex-servicemen or to extend service pension benefits to allied veterans.

* He has consistently defended the **rights** of the Parliament with respect to the Executive.

* I believe that what I say would be supported by men and women everywhere who believe in human **rights**.

* I think the key to this Bill is the fact, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  stressed in his second reading speech, that the Bill merely confirms the present position of companies in the area and settles any doubt about their legal **rights**.

* Principally, this Bill concerns the **rights** of people, both black and white.

* With due respect, it is this Aboriginal land **rights** legislation which has brought about the fall of the curtain, which is unfortunate.

* I point out to those honourable members who have made so much of the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Woodward, on whose report the whole land **rights** legislation was based, that he was instructed, as the shadow Minister said, to determine how to allocate the land to Aborigines, not whether it should be allocated.

* It was said that the then Opposition did not object to the land **rights** that were brought in in 1972, but in fact I did object as a Territorian because I considered that as they were then phrased they were doing great damage to Aboriginal people.

* One is the **rights** and privileges of every member, including members of the Opposition.

* On 20 December in the United Kingdom the Prime Minister attacked States' **rights**.

* Honourable members opposite are the so-called defenders of the individual's **rights**.

* It states: 
Has his attention been drawn to action by US civil **rights** groups pressing for the banning of Australian beef exports to the US beause of alleged racism by the companies referred to in pan ( 1 ).

* Advice on common law **rights** to sue an employer for damages is available to New Guineans from officials of the Department of Labour, District Administration offices and other Administration officers throughout the Territory all of whom would in appropriate circumstances discuss the possibility of a claim being made and the way in which it could be done.

* There are also those which are issued with the consent of the Association or Associations concerned but without prejudice to the **rights** of the Association or Associations to pursue any arbitration claims for increases in part or whole of the rates involved in the determination.

* One of the matters to be dealt with at the conference will be fishing and the conservation of the living resources of the high seas, including the preferential **rights** of coastal states.

* Here we have a man who leads  li  million people and rules 19 million people and talks about the **rights** of minorities.

* All of those who have served with him in the Parliament know what an avid student of parliamentary procedures he is and what a redoubtable proponent he is of parliamentary **rights**.

* I repeat what I said to the Minister: This Bill is now a complete farce because there is no way in the world the Government can now impose a nuclear code which has any guts in it, any toughness, any restrictions on the States' **rights**.

* Whatever it was, this is the mind of the Socialist government - it just decides what it would like to be done and, irrespective of the **rights** of private citizens, sets about compelling them to do it.

* Whatever the decision may be, if the boundary is redrawn in that part of the world these people must retain certain **rights** to Australian social service payments, repatriation benefits, medical services and the like.

* Their **rights** have to be taken into account.

* If this Parliament refuses to pass the legislation, Australia's national **rights** in this matter go by default.

* at some time before the adoption of the 1958 conventions on the Territorial Sea and the Continental Shelf, Australia had become an independent nation state, ,md the **rights** recognised by those conventions accrued a their entirety to the Commonwealth of Australia.

* State premiers can exercise their **rights** to raise their own loans for the purposes of certain capital works.

* We firmly believe that all citizens should have equal **rights** and obligations under the law.

* As such, Aborigines should be assisted to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society with equal access to the **rights** and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it.

* The assistance will carry inventors up to the point where they will be able to get their patent **rights** in certain circumstances.

* First of all, I hope that the quarantine service in Australia is not judged on the **rights** and wrongs of the Public Service administration of the Department in respect of that individual.

* The evidence proved that certain officers of the Public Service had withheld from Griffin necessary information and assistance and had usurped his powers, that he and his office were ignored, that his **rights** and duties under his contract were denied, that false charges of default were made against him, and that the honourable W. O. Archibald, Minister for Home Affairs, and members of the Departmental Board had endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute the Board 's own design.

* Amendment of these sections is necessary to afford residents of territories the same **rights** as are afforded to residents of the States.

* All his **rights** and privileges will be maintained should he return to his office as a judge of the court in the Australian Capital Territory.

* In terms of civil liberties we have enacted much legislation- for example, legislation to establish the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal- to protect the **rights** of individuals against a large and sometimes seemingly all-powerful bureaucracy.

* But further than that, the Party introduced words which indicated that it was going to seek to turn it into a kind of regional covenant for human **rights**.

* - Australia is a party to more than 10 of them - but what we would oppose is the twisting of the ANZUS Treaty into a regional covenant on human **rights** because this means that its military significance is to be removed.

* As a result of the imprisonment of those women for 14 days for a trivial, insignificant offence, as far as I could discover - and nothing that the Minister has said today in any way contradicts that - I decided that from the point of view of civil **rights** and civil liberties this was going too far.

* I almost get sick and tired of saying this, but the Commonwealth has no **rights** at all in imposing production controls.

* This is a sovereign right of the 
That Article 1 of Declaration of Human Rights says: 
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and **rights** and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.'

* The Australian Government's strong condemnation of cruelty and of disregard for human **rights** has been expressed on many occasions and it has a deep concern over what appears to have happened in Kampuchea.

* I reiterate the appeal I made to the Government of Kampuchea in August of last year to respect international principles of human **rights**.

* It would be invidious- indeed, inhumane- if we were to take any other view for we cannot ignore such questions of human **rights** in Kampuchea in the face of persistent reports of violations of the most basic of these **rights**, namely, the right of human beings to life itself.

* But in the context of our argument that could only mean that you want to prevent the rank and file from having the **rights** which the law now guarantees.

* I believe that the rank and file should have enforceable **rights** to effectively control their union's policies and paid servants ...

* I have never heard you object to the law giving your union monopoly **rights** to enrol plumbers and gasfitters.

* But if you don't accept the sections of the Act that provide protection for a union 's membership against the possibly tyranny of their paid officials, and if you object to those laws which protect the ordinary plumber and gasfitter against rules that are 'oppressive, unreasonable or unjust', and which give him a legal right to force you to observe the union's rules, then why don't you try to persuade your members to allow your union's registered **rights** to be taken over by some other organisation and try working outside the Act?

* You did not like what I said about the **rights** of the rank and file and shouted something about democracy.

* Recently the developing countries agreed to give their joint support to a particular scheme involving a change in method of distributing newlycreated special drawing **rights** (SDR) among participating countries so as to increase the share going to developing countries.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Although it provides wideranging benefits, this Act does not extend to its beneficiaries the advantages of appeal **rights** to either War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals or War Pensions Assessment Appeal Tribunals, or the payment of war pension in respect of non-war related pulmonary tuberculosis.

* That is the view I hold because if ever these land councils are to perform the duty that is cast upon them by the land **rights** legislation they must eschew political activity so that when the time comes in the ebb and flow of politics they will be in a position to serve the Aboriginal people, whatever political party is in power in Canberra or in Darwin.

* What is definitely not is that they are pressing Aboriginal land **rights** only and exclusively in support of their own campaign against the mining companies and the Government's uranium export policy.

* As I have said, the Commonwealth at all times has pursued the spirit of the Woodward recommendations and has pursued the responsibilities of the Commonwealth under the land **rights** legislation in the negotiations that have been carried out concerning the Ranger agreement.

* I am quite sure that in that spirit and in the pursuit of the land **rights** legislation in the end a result will be reached.

* As all these programs of the Department develop, measured merely in money or through the activities of the National Aboriginal Conference, the Council for Aboriginal Development or the Government's land **rights** policies and other policies that honourable members will see in time to come, this Government will be able to look back upon its period of administration of Aboriginal affairs and say that it has given Aborigines a new look at the future- something for which they have been waiting for years and years but which has never been provided.

* What about his personal **rights** as a citizen?

* Accordingly, this presents a challenge for us to search around and to discover new and more efficient ways to provide health services while, at the same time, maintaining **rights** of choice, freedom of quality of care and so on.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information - withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority whodo not hold the same views; 
Electoral officers make periodic visits to remote areas of Australia and conduct educational programmes for the purpose of acquainting the Aboriginal people of their enrolment and voting **rights**.

* Plans for rationalisation will have proper regard for the **rights** and interests of those working in the industry.

* Besides satisfying land **rights** for the Aboriginal groups involved, it was also intended that the properties would provide the communities with an economic base.

* The **rights** of the House are emphasised by the resolution of session 1818 which directs that no clerk or officer of the House, or shorthand writer employed to take minutes of evidence before the House, or any committee thereof, shall give evidence elsewhere in respect of any proceedings or examination had at the bar, or before any committee of the House, without the special leave of the House.

* We should remember that the State governments are sovereign governments in this nation with their own **rights**.

* Let me just put a few things right before I deal with the matter of public importance, which refers to basic human **rights**.

* Originally some sections of the Government and even some sections of the Labor Party considered giving to Aborigines what might be called basic human **rights**.

* It concerns land **rights** legislation for the Aborigines.

* In the land **rights** legislation which was introduced in 1975 there was some hint of endeavouring to do for Aborigines some of the things which were recommended by the Woodward report which, incidentally, was never debated or discussed in any parliamentary forum in this land.

* We have been speaking about land **rights**, the proposed Kakadu National Park, the proposed Uluru National Park, uranium and so on.

* Those people who introduced the original land **rights** Act did not appreciate the Aboriginal approach.

* We should realise the mistakes we have made with regard to the basic **rights** of Aborigines to be able to make their own decisions, to be able to live together with us and to have mutual respect.

* Since the Labor Party introduced its land **rights** legislation in 1975 it has been approaching Aborigines for purely political purposes.

* We respectfully submit that neither the submission by the Australian Labor Party nor that of the Liberal Parry can pretend to be based on the needs and **rights** of country people.

* They become members of the postal career service but they retain all **rights** they now enjoy under the civil service unless changes are made by provisions of labour contracts negotiated between the unions and the board of governors.

* Where we see Communism in action we see the destruction of the **rights** of human beings as individuals.

* The first concerns the timing of this matter and the extent of debate available; the second concerns the economics of the proposition to which he has devoted a great deal of" attention; and the third concerns the health **rights** of people.

* But, if one wants to talk about financial comparisons, or crudely and vulgarly about the economics of the matter and ignore **rights**, then the economics are dead against the proposition which has been put forward by the honourable member for Hume and overwhelm the arguments that he has put in support of that proposition.

* I wish to move on to the health **rights** of people because for me that is the most important proposition involved in this debate.

* They might then have more sensitivity about the **rights** of those people.

* It is the only super power which is increasing rather that decreasing the infringements of human **rights** in its own territory and in its European satellites.

* The basic rationale of the speciality rule is to safeguard the liberty of the person and protect his human **rights**, especially where a person is only accused of an offence.

* The problem has been to achieve a balance between that principle of human **rights** on the one hand and efficient law enforcement on the other.

* The consent modification has been included in recent treaties made between foreign states and in the draft treaties recently negotiated by Australia, lt gives flexibility to and removes the inhibiting effect of the otherwise strict speciality rule and at the same time safeguards the human **rights** of the accused person.

* The Government is also committed to legislating for the protection of individual **rights** in the industrial area.

* to advise employers and employees as to their **rights** and obligations under the said Act, regulations, awards and orders and as to the manner in which the said Act, regulations, awards and orders should be observed; 
The primary functions of the Arbitration Inspectorate are to secure, by voluntary means, the observance of relevant legal requirements and to assist employers and employees to understand and give effect to their **rights**, duties and obligations in this respect.

* At this point I should also reiterate that the Government is committed to legislating for the protection of individual **rights** in the industrial relations area.

* The proposals for preservation of superannuation **rights** as announced on 25th September 1969 will be implemented for members of the Defence Forces by amendment of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1969 to be introduced in this session , of Parliament.

* The best measure of true civilisation is the standard of social care of the citizens and, perhaps above all else, the manner whereby the community cares for those who, least of all, can maintain their **rights** and make their claim valid - the mentally ill and deficient.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on eitherthe majority or minority who do not hold the same views.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not bold the same views; 
That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information - withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
Would it be necessary for Australia, in order to enable Ansett Airlines of Australia to function as an overseas airline in competition with Qantas Airways Ltd and those international airlines which at present exercise landing **rights** in Australia, to re-negotiate existing international agreements to provide for an increase in' flights to end from Australia.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
Above all, I make the point that the purpose of this committee should be to coordinate with the States and to act with the States in a manner similar to the way in which these objectives have been achieved in the education and other fields.

* This committee is intended in no way to usurp the **rights** of the States but is designed to co-ordinate activities in such  a  way that at least in the future we will have commonsense planning for the future.

* The required traffic **rights** enabling it to do so have yet to be negotiated at government to government level with the other governments concerned.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information - withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views.

* The sites are offered at public auction and the **rights** to the grant of leases are knocked down to the highest bidder.

* Will the Minister for Immigration give an assurance that he will seek the same visiting **rights** for Australian businessmen and tourists as we give to overseas visitors and tourists?

* The honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has been forced to move the suspension of Standing Orders so that a reasonable discussion may be held on the **rights** or wrongs of what is contained in paragraph 4 in the terms of the matter of public importance brought before the Parliament today.

* Naturally we favour a return to peaceful development and deplore breaches of" human **rights**, terrorism and atrocities wherever they occur.

* The provision as it stands is, we believe, consistent with proper legal principles for the protection of the **rights** of citizens and is similar to other provisions in legislation covering offences of this kind.

* I rise to say briefly that, whilst I have a genuine affection for the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James),  I do not intend to withdraw one single word of what I said the other night about Soviet Russia or on previous occasions about the denial of human **rights** in Indonesia, Uganda, Uruguay and a host of other countries, but I stand on my record - 
Under the terms of the War Service Land Settlement Agreement, the farms must be offered to the settlers at the cost of development or at market value, whichever is the lesser value.

* Please do not give me the weak excuse which has always been advanced in the past by some of the Minister's departmental advisers, that the Commonwealth interferes with the **rights** of the States simply because of the amount of finance that is involved.

* The implications for civil liberties and human **rights** in this country are frightening.

* How far is Australia from the pro- Western terror regimes of Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and other countries which curtail human **rights** ruthlessly?

* In their attempts to conceal the social inequity of their outmoded and so-called voluntary system of health insurance, the Opposition spokesmen have claimed that improvements in the provision of subsidised health benefits and the inclusion of pensioners within the insurance system will put everything to **rights**.

* The falsity of most of the criticisms of it and the ferocity with which they have been pursued reveal the self-interest of those behind them and their determination that the privileges of the few should be maintained at the expense of the **rights** of the majority.

* The F1 9 or Eastern Freeway experience totally makes nonsense of this Government's commitment to devolution, to asserting the **rights** of local government and to conserving the social environment.

* Suffice to say that the field of transport is a rich field for a government which wishes to confront the problem of unemployment, which wishes to raise productivity and which wishes to provide a proper framework for an industry to plan and to protect and to enhance people's **rights** as citizens.

* Finally, the Government would begin to make possible affirmation of **rights** of those people who have been victimised by past policies and who are very often being denied the most basic of human **rights**.

* The situation is that the only people in Australia who have no long service leave **rights** are private employees in the Australian Capital Territory.

* I hope that honourable members opposite, particularly the honourable member for St George, interested as he is in the **rights** of citizens, will take up this matter with the 2 Ministers concerned.

* She said: 
Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware that negotiations have been going on for many years for the introduction of legislation to grant patent **rights** to the breeders of plants, which are commonly known as plant breeders' **rights**?

* It is manifestly clear, even from the most cursory reading of the Bill, that one of its particular purposes is to seek to override States' **rights** of participation in the oil and mineral industry.

* We on this side of the chamber recognise this as a serious precedent that would erode the principle of States' **rights** in 
Australia.

* This Bill and this Government disregard State mining legislation and the existing **rights** under that legislation.

* The Bill seeks to centralise mineral **rights** under the Commonwealth and ultimately to exclude the States from this field of jurisdiction altogether.

* Dr Evatt  played a central role in the founding of the state of Israel- an event which illustrated dramatically the Labor Party's long-held commitments to protection of the **rights** of individuals and minorities.

* The second, and equally important, principle here is that the Palestinian people also have **rights** which must be recognised and aspirations which must be respected.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from informationwithholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
I have just said that my Party has had a 500 per cent greater contribution from women than the Australian Labor Party has had in the period that I have been in the Parliament.

* Let me borrow the words of the immediate past Secretary-General of the United Nations Organisation who said in a declaration made on Human Rights Day in 1966: 
After paragraph ( f) of sub-clause ( 1 ), insert the following paragraph:- (fa) to advise the Attorney-General as to the educational programs that would be most effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public who have special needs in this respect, of their **rights**, powers, privileges and duties under the laws of Australia and of the Territories; and '.

* Is it a fact that the legislation establishing Medibank enables him to make regulations for those persons who transferred from private health funds to Medibank to have that service taken into account in the acquisition of Commonwealth long service leave **rights**?

* This is a matter of importance to the Parliament because it affects the **rights** of members and because allegations have been made about members by the Premier of a State.

* I was very glad that the honourable member for Grayndler mentioned that there was a need for an advertising campaign to inform people of their **rights** and the services available to them.

* I accept the fact that the **rights** of an individual member must be protected, but there is also the matter of disrupting the business of the House.

* The law of Parliamentary privilege confers upon the House itself and upon individual honourable members certain **rights** and immunities which are essential for the proper functioning of the Parliament.

* Doctors may differ in degree in interpreting the law, but I submit that the **rights** of a mother are well protected.

* While thelaw provides for protection of a mother's life, under these circumstances the **rights** of an unborn child normally would still remain.

* That an unborn child has **rights** is widely recognised despite comments that have been made in the debate.

* Even in the Bill the **rights** are preserved when pregnancy has reached a period of 23 weeks, in the second term.

* Some **rights** are given earlier than 23 weeks in the Bill, except where the life of a mother or serious permanent injury to her is threatened.

* I repeat that the fundamental question before the House is whether the **rights** of an unborn child should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy.

* It is true that an unborn child is at an advanced stage at the period suggested in the Bill as the time when the **rights** of the unborn child are acknowledged by the honourable members who are proposing the Bill.

* The issue is generally described as abortion on demand, or, in other words, where an abortion for any reason is made legal on request without any regard to the **rights** of the unborn child.

* I have received a telex message that carries the advice that the Sydney based Sutton group of companies has bought Tipperary station for $5.4m and that the sale is associated with an arrangement that was previously being entered into with the Tipperary group of companies over a dispute with Aborigines who claim cattle **rights** in the Daly River area.

* It denies a certain and very important section of our community their **rights** as citizens.

* That report argued quite clearly that if a proper balance is achieved between the administrative efficiency and the need to provide for the **rights** of the individual, an effective review process, so far from leading to inefficiency, will in fact increase efficiency.

* It is not in any sense an indictment of the performance of the Public Service or any indictment of its essential integrity, rather it is a recognition of the overwhelming need to achieve a balance between administrative efficiency and the protection of the **rights** of the individual.

* At the same rime equality of political **rights** is inherent in a true democratic state and the electoral system must not be used to benefit a particular Party and disadvantage the people.

* I do not anticipate that the general policy on staff reductions will in any way affect protection of the **rights** and conditions of salaried and wages railway staff.

* In previous years, the following items were also exempted from taxation: 20 per cent of profits from certain prescribed minerals; dividends paid out of profits from sales of petroleum; and income from sale of mining **rights**.

* Will the proposed examination of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation referred to by the Minister on 1 3 November 1 979 be without detriment to the basic principles of the Act; if so, will the power of veto possessed by the Aboriginal community over developments at Jabiluka not be abrogated as a result of this examination.

* If so, is a licence in this form registrable under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act in that it deprives the licensee of all **rights** of lease, tenancy and good will and his estate of all claims in the business, subjects him to 30 days' notice of termination of licence, requires him to buy petroleum products only, from the licenser and may require him to sell only specified brands of tyres, tubes, batteries, etc., and to hold such stocks as the licenser requires.

* - 
A contract in restraint of trade or commerce whether made before or after the commencement of this sub-section is unenforceable in so far as it confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation but nothing in this sub-section shall render unenforceable any provision in such a contract which is not in restraint of trade or commerce.

* I refer to that section of the Bill which seeks to change the **rights** now established before the High Court of Australia of disabled ex-servicemen to have their pensions tax free.

* Does the Prime Minister now acknowledge that the Queensland situation clearly demonstrates that human **rights** are - 
I rise in the adjournment debate in an attempt to put the record straight and to answer some of the bigoted ranting and raving of the Opposition, in particular the members of the National Country Party.

* This gives rise to all sorts of legal consequences, only some of which would be the **rights** of those who have been injured both in their persons and in their property to seek redress under the normal law of torts applying throughout the country.

* It was the day on which the then Government sold out to another power the sovereign **rights** of this country.

* The Government claims to have regard for State **rights**.

* How strange it must seem to those soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought for this country and who have been transferred to Canberra to find that when they were in Queensland or in other States they were able to vote on federal issues and on referendums but that when they came across an artificial line to live in Canberra they lost those **rights**.

* The proposal will not interfere with the **rights** of the States.

* A Yes vote at the referendum would ensure that over 150 000 voters living in the Territories would have the same basic **rights** as the rest of the people of Australia.

Finally, I refer to the matter of energy.

* It will fight for the **rights** of its workers, but it will not be dominated by foreign ideologies.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'the House, in disapproving of this Bill is of the opinion that the provisions contained in it should be referred to the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory to enable that Assembly to consider ways by which land prices in the Northern Territory should be stabilised, but requesting that any lands acquisition proposals which might be included in legislation to be considered by that Assembly should protect the **rights** of private land owners and occupiers and be on just terms'.

* In spite of all the election propaganda about the Labor Party's concern for people, this Bill reveals that Labor cares nothing about preserving the **rights** of the individual.

* This Bill removes from the Lands Acquisition Act the **rights** of an individual who disputes a particular government action from referring that action to an independent legal authority.

* Clause 10 subclause (7), which deals with developed land, states: 
There are five distinct sections which deal currently with the **rights** of a person to appeal to a higher authority in the event of dissatisfaction with proceedings under the Lands Acquisition Act.

* of the Lands Acquisition Act which deals with the **rights** to determine the basis of compensation.

That is the third example of the **rights** that the present Act gives to owners or occupiers when their land is acquired or is in the process of being acquired.

* We want to protect the **rights** of property owners and occupiers and to ensure that the elected representatives of the Northern Territory take part in framing legislative action which will affect the residents of Darwin obviously for generations ahead.

* I do not intend to interfere with the **rights** of private members having been one for so very long.

* Anybody who likes to study the record of the previous Government over a long period of time will see that members' **rights** were restricted, that there was no such thing as open government and that there was no chance of private members getting a go.

* Will the Minister clarify what protection is afforded the legal and civil **rights** of Australian citizens acting in Western Australia in disputes under direction by Federal organisations in respect of national decisions which cause the invoking of the penal provisions of that Fuel and Energy Bill?

* After all, the Commonwealth has already infringed State **rights** - if that is the argument to be used to keep the Commonwealth out of teacher education policy - in the assistance it gives to colleges of advanced education and universities.

* There are numerous ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen who are receiving their full pension entitlement but who certainly are not abusing their **rights** as this man suggests.

* That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: this House is of the opinion that all the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation should be adopted but that accrued **rights** should be preserved where they are more advantageous than the recommendations of the Committee.

* What **rights** do life assurance policy holders have under the provisions of the Life Insurance Act and the Insurance Acts of 1973 to prevent their premiums from being used to finance the conduct of political campaigns?

* The Government is committed to the protection and advancement of Australians' political **rights**.

* This commitment has been demonstrated in a wide range of reforms: 
Clause 4 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* What steps has the Government taken to (a) safeguard the traditional fishing and hunting **rights** of the Aurukun people and (b) discourage illegal liquor sales and exploitation.

* The Bill has been denounced as unchristian, a marriage breaker, a nation destroyer, one which neglects the **rights** and obligations of women and men and the **rights** and welfare of children.

* the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare.

* It is only when we consider the needs of people rather than the legalistic **rights** of people, and base those **rights** on needs and contribution, that we can say we are preserving marriage, not as an outmoded institution but as a family unit of welfare which will lead to a better and stronger nation.

* I am glad to see that the States' **rights** have been maintained.

* I ask the Minister to reaffirm the **rights** of all Australians to take part in political activity and to assure the House that  Mr Dunn,  like any other citizen, will have the full protection of the Australian Government while overseas.

* Most people in Australia ought to express their gratitude for what he did for the preservation of such matters as freedom of speech, the protection of family **rights** and so on.

* I have a very reserved view of governments' attitudes to freedom of **rights** and so on wherever some citizen gets in the road and there is a handy piece of legislation which may well be misused to suppress him.

* I do not think that this piece of legislation does what it ought to do with the necessary precision and does not make a proper reference to other people's **rights** as it ought to.

* (a) The strike in November-December 1966 which was called by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots arose out of claims for salary increases, the formulation of a comprehensive form of contract slating in full all the responsibilities and **rights** of pilots and the introduction of a formula pay system in line with that already agreed with the domestic airlines.

* Under the terms of settlement, Qantas agreed to put into effect the salary increase offer which had been rejected shortly before the strike began, procedures were agreed to settle the operational issues and to deal with the negotiation of a comprehensive new contract covering the **rights** and responsibilities of Qantas pilots and it was further agreed that new channels of communication and liaison would be established between the Qantas management and its pilots.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by  a  method of chance ls an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of  a  minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* It is also correct that contract officers seconded from the Commonwealth or the States who have their **rights** preserved in their home services are also covered by legislation, but other contract officers are not.

* The trend to centralism leads to the erosion in the end of State **rights**.

* My reason for speaking is to protest at the indicated attempts to erode the primary producer's **rights** to negotiate for his survival and to correct the wrong impression that was conveyed by the Minister for Health at the Biloela meeting on Saturday, 3rd March.

* I am supremely confident that the people of my State will back Don Dunstan to the hilt and that, with leadership, the **rights** of South Australia will be protected, not at the expense of the rest of Australia but for the economic development of my State and therefore for the benefit of all Australia.

* Basic legal **rights** are involved.

* We have **rights** to special consideration in the matter of having a storage nearby where water cannot flow upstream and be used by others.

* Even so, the Australian Industries Preservation Act gave individuals and companies **rights** which the Trade Practices Bill did not give them.

* I pointed out that individuals would lose their **rights** under the Australian Industries Preservation Act.

* Have any approaches been made to the Commonwealth Government by persons in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, South Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea or Taiwan or in communist countries for diplomatic, military or other help in defence of their democratic **rights**; if so, willi what result.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* And that this procedure providing by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of (heir respective dates of birth.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* My message to the Minister is that the people who have to vote should be educated in the exercise of their **rights**.

* So for all these reasons the Government completely and absolutely rejects this further attempt by the Opposition to ride roughshod over the **rights** and responsibilities of the States by imposing on them priorities which they themselves do not share.

* Advertising expenditure by my Department has, however, at times been incurred to gain public awareness about **rights** and entitlements available to the public arising from Government policy.

* Information as to the provisions in the rules of the four Western Australian Health benefits organisations concerning election **rights** of contributors was available from Departmental sources.

* If the honourable member will bear with me, he will find that I am trying to defend the **rights** of the back benchers in this House.

* One of the highlights of our repatriation system are the **rights** of the individual exserviceman.

* He wanted to avoid a debate in the Parliament and he wanted to avoid any sort of discussion in the courts on civil **rights**.

* The Aboriginal embassy's letter told the Queen that, if the ordinance is allowed to become law, it is likely to result in a serious abrogation of the **rights** of all Australians, whether Aboriginal or otherwise, to bring before the Federal Parliament a continuous peaceful protest 
I disliked the appearance of those tents outside.

* I travelled 21,000 miles with a select committee inquiring into Aboriginal voting **rights**, but that place was a palace compared to what I saw as a member of that committee and the conditions under which Aborigines live in the south-west of Western Australia, around Gnowangerup and elsewhere where the weather is extremely cold, or generally speaking, throughout the Northern Territory.

* I look upon it perhaps as a second home in some ways, but I am sure that the great majority of the people in New South Wales would agree with me that it is not only their more populous numbers which are to be considered in these matters which affect the whole country but the minorities have some **rights** under our Constitution since it was based on the principle that smaller States and indeed other States would have a say.

* No discussion on abortion should ignore the status and **rights** of the unborn child.

* The **rights** of women are involved.

* But are not the **rights** of a father also involved?

* In a statement to the House on 25th September 1969 the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  outlined the Government's proposals for the preservation of superannuation **rights**.

* The Government's intention is to remove that barrier from Commonwealth schemes so that Commonwealth employees who have spent a considerable part of their working lives in one field of endeavour and who could contribute much more to the community and to their own lives in some other area of Commonwealth, State, university or private employment will no longer feel compelled, by the fear of the loss of thenaccumulated superannuation **rights**, to remain in their employment waiting only for the effluxion of time and the arrival of their date of retirement.

* The rules of other Commonwealth schemes will also be amended to provide for the preservation of superannuation **rights** in general accord with the provisions of this Bill.

* In addition, an employee who moves to public employment with the States, including State universities, within  3  months of ceasing his Commonwealth employment, will be able to preserve his superannuation **rights**.

* Generally, preservation of superannuation **rights** under the Superannuation Act will be effected by means of transfer values or deferred benefits.

* Earlier payment will be made subject to the fulfilment of the prescribed conditions in the event of invalidity before normal retirement or, in the event of the death of the employee, to an eligible widow or chihldren 
Turning now to inwards preservation, on becoming a contributor a person will have the right to choose to pay to the Superannuation Board any preserved superannuation **rights** received from his previous employment, including private sector employment, and to obtain credit in the Superannuation Fund or the Provident Account for the amount paid.

* In this way the **rights** of the employee himself, as well as those of continuing contributors to each scheme, will be protected.

* J should mention that, the opportunity has been taken to remedy defects that have been found in sections 52 and 88 of the principal Act that relate to the **rights** of an employee who resigns to contest a parliamentary election.

* As the Prime Minister said in his statement last year, the Government believes that the arrangements now being made for preservation of superannuation **rights** in Commonwealth schemes mark an important step forward in the development of Australia.

* In their replies, all airlines have indicated recognition of the **rights** of the non-smoker and have clearly indicated that they adopt a very responsible approach to this problem.

* Nor should there be any argument about having the **rights** of appeal on matters so absolute, because safety of lives in civil aviation is a matter that is absolute.

* In view of recent reports of brutality and oppression in Uganda, will the Minister for Foreign Affairs express the Government's concern at these apparent gross violations of human **rights**?

* in growth centres or land held by Land Commissions or urban Land Councils, residential land be freehold subject to improvement conditions and reservation' of development **rights**; 
The operation of provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant Land Council; 
ANR system.

* Any proposed changes would of course take full account of the **rights** and welfare of the employees involved.

* 1 ) What has been the itinerary of  Mr Justice  Staples in his inquiry, which the Attorney-General's predecessor requested him to undertake on 26 December 1976, into the practices, procedures and laws which other countries have adopted for the protection of basic human **rights**.

* Will he ensure that Aboriginals on the Forrest River reserve are fully informed of their **rights** and that Land Councils are established in Western Australia and Queensland before Australia approves foreign investment in our exports from Aboriginal land in those States.

* That this House condemns and censures the procommunist Victorian State ALP for its shameful and disgraceful abrogation of its responsibilities to uphold basic human **rights** by its failure to deplore the continuing persecution of dissidents within the Soviet Union.

* I hope that the AttorneyGeneral and the Government will, even at this belated stage, give some consideration to the extending back of appeal **rights** to those aggrieved ex-servicemen.

* We have heard threats that Queensland would not get its just desserts because of the courage and determination of the Premier of Queensland to put up a fight for the preservation of State **rights** in that State.

* Those of us who live there - surely the honourable member for Lilley should be one of them and the honourable member for Bowman  (Mr Keogh),  whom I heard attempting to make some interjection, should be another - ought to realise the need to preserve State **rights**.

* While I am on my feet, I should like to say to the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  that he acknowledges that one of the fundamental **rights** in our community today is the protection of the individual, and I am sure he will agree with me that one of the fundamentals of our democratic system is the right of free choice.

* The Chair has no knowledge of the **rights** or wrongs of this matter.

* As an honourable member on the other side said, it has nothing to do with land **rights** and nothing to do with anything other than the Minister's propriety in handling the erection of tents in front of Parliament House.

* If they are to be areas which are reserved for the public, which the public can walk over and enjoy and on which the public can exercise their **rights**, then the **rights** of the public will be infringed if any organisation is allowed to set up tents, to park caravans or in any other way to impede the **rights** of the public on those reserves.

* In the instance which is under discussion the **rights** of the public were definitely infringed on one occasion when some members of the public were moved on from the vicinity of the King George V Memorial by some of the individuals who were camped in the tents outside Parliament House.

* Clearly if these lawns are to be preserved - I believe they should be, otherwise we will have a tent city in which any organisation can erect a tent and this would be an unsanitary and unhealthy public eyesore and would obstruct the **rights** of the public - action has to be taken.

* If I were asked to illustrate a third factor I would quickly indicate the acceleration towards centralisation in government - the erosion of State **rights**.

* The tied grants, as they have grown in this Parliament over the years and as they are being perpetuated very strongly by this Government, in fact amount to a form of duress on State governments to hand over some of their **rights**.

* I think that when we are drafting an amendment to the Constitution, we should endeavour to preserve the proper functions and **rights** of the States.

* I agree with the Government that the electors in the Territories should have that right, but I do not think that since the Constitution is a federal compact we should, in any way, impair the **rights** of the electors in the States.

* I suggest to the Prime Minister that in this matter of drafting, he should swallow not his pride but the pride of his Party, and accept my amendment, which is reasonable and one that improves the drafting and makes clear the residual **rights** of the States in the federal compact.

* Moreover, it would preserve, as it should preserve, the position of the States explicitly in this section of the Commonwealth Constitution which is part of the federal compact and is drafted around the residual **rights** of the States in that compact.

1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a report prepared by the United Nations' Secretary-General dealing with the question of individual privacy, with particular reference to the impact of computerisation and data collection on individual privacy and **rights**.

* In so doing, the existing **rights** of the less populous States will be fully protected.

* Then, of course, there is the issue of women's **rights**.

* I wonder what those involved in the financially pinched working women's centre in Melbourne would say about the following: 
Are itinerant relatives of the employees discouraged from camping on the property by being offered no help with social security applications and by having no **rights** to cash cheques or buy from the company store, and are retrenched employees encouraged to leave the property.

* Honourable members will recall that a similar situation obtained last year when air navigation charges were increased and the two airlines agreed to waive their **rights** under clause 8 of the 1961 agreement and to permit a15 per cent increase in ANCs for that year.

* I am pleased to say that the two major airlines have again agreed to waive their **rights** to permit the 25 per cent increase proposed by the Government this year.

* This policy reflects a fundamental review of the **rights** and responsibilities of the parties engaged in industrial relations and the demands of the contemporary community.

* The Government is also committed to legislating for the protection of individual **rights** in the industrial area.

* One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both **rights** and obligations.

* Those **rights** must be protected and the obligations must be met.

* It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial **rights** and obligations.

* While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those **rights** and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those **rights** and obligations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest.

* This Bill represents an important step in that continuing process of reshaping and redefining the **rights** and obligations under industrial law.

* Would the Minister encourage union members to look to their legal **rights**  vis a vis  extremist union leadership?

* This has been done deliberately and with a callous, cavalier and studied disregard for the **rights** of the Parliament and of the people of Australia who elected this Parliament.

* Wherever anybody is employed by the Government, if it cannot bring about a confrontation by suspending and dismissing the malcontents from the Public Service with all **rights** and entitlements deprived then it can extend this Bill to the dismissal of somebody else until ultimately it would succeed in getting that confrontation.

1 ask the Minister for Science whether he saw a report in the media to the effect that clinical trials indicate, that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial [Research Organisation has made an important breakthrough in producing poly-unsaturated meat and dairy foods which could play a vital part in fighting heart disease.

* If so, did he also note that the claim was made that conservatism on the part of Australian agricultural marketing boards has cost both Australian consumers and farmers the full benefits of the breakthrough and that, consequently, CSIRO has assigned licensing **rights** to an Anglo-American controlled company?

* The world's aspiration to do something for handicapped children is best expressed by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of a 
While the Government has defended its refusal to grant recognition to China and to approve its membership of the United Nations on the grounds that it had to defend the **rights** of 14i million Taiwanese,  Mr Fraser  totally reversed the argument.

* Each Australian producer of natural gas claiming its **rights** from the Pipeline Authority as a common carrier could set up a rival and excessive pricing structure, according to its whim and belief as to what maximum return it could obtain.

* Schemes for the protection of new varieties of plants and plant breeders **rights** were amongst the matters in which the visitors were interested.

* The Government has decided that, to enable an annual program of construction to be undertaken and to ensure that the **rights** of organisations which have acquired entitlements under the legislation are preserved, there should be an extension of the time within which the erection of a hostel can be commenced.

* This is a public interest concept providing for the control and regulation of tourist activity, so that the **rights** of individuals and groups are safeguarded, one against the other, and resources are preserved, as considered desirable, for the common good and for future generations.

* Has the Commonwealth Government placed conditions on its offer of $ 10m compensation, namely that the State Government forgo its **rights** to High Court action, and that the $ 10m is to apply to the labour content only of compensation projects.

) Can he say if there has been opposition to construction of the nuclear power plant by citizens of the Bataan province; if so, has he taken any steps to investigate whether human **rights** violations have occurred during the planning or construction of the plant.

* At the moment the principal concern is the **rights** of access to government benefits that flow from being resident in the Torres Strait islands.

* May I say succinctly that our policy towards southern Africa involves, first, supporting both the ending of white minority rule and the protection of white minority **rights**.

* I believe one of the inalienable **rights** of citizens is to be able to contact freely their members of Parliament.

* In the view of the Australian Government, the Four Powers still retain those **rights** and responsibilities for Berlin which they assumed after World War  II.

* How can a government appeal to unions for cooperation when it is pushing legislation through the Parliament to restrict their **rights** in this way?

* The rules relating to travel to Southern Rhodesia do not violate basic human **rights**.

* the Commonwealth Government has agreed to waive its **rights** to share in the distribution of any surplus revenue or profit from the operation of the railway, and thus has enabled the agreement to be wholly discharged.

* Will ghe granting of land **rights** according to traditional association result in the (a) fragmentation of existing Aboriginal communities and (b) transfer of groups of Aborigines from one location to another.

* He was aware of his **rights** to seek support in preparing his case, but declined to avail himself of this assistance.

* 1 ) Has the Government received a request from the Australian Services Council that Australian repatriation and allied **rights** be made available to British and allied exservicemen who are not Australian citizens resident in Australia.

* Instead special arrangements were made that preserved for them their accrued **rights** and established a basis for them to contribute for additional benefits as they arose.

* It is a fact that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber are given, with the indulgence of the Chair, an extension of the **rights** that all other honourable members have in order that they can make their points in debate.

* Finally, as regards the last point which the honourable member raised, we have said consistently that pensioners will receive the same standards of treatment and the same **rights** and privileges as do other members of the community and, accordingly, they will have a full entitlement to private specialist medical services and those private specialist medical services will be covered by our health insurance proposals.

* While I have fairly strong feelings about ministerial **rights**, authority and so onin certain matters I think we are in a special area when we are dealing with the control, ownership and direction of broadcasting services.

* Unions should be encouraged to contact non-English speaking migrant workers in their own languages about awards, **rights** and conditions, safety and health legislation and about how unions work.

* I can understand all these problems but it does seem to me that it is far more important for this Parliament to say clearly to the Minister for Transport so that he will say to Qantas that, given the nature of Australian society- it is a nation that has people drawn from many origins and religious beliefs, or none- as a nation state operating internationally there is no way we will accept a position where we will be told that any Australian citizen who seeks to fly out of Australia to anywhere in the world will have his **rights** restricted by the views of another nation state in terms of its perceived view of a religious belief or of a political belief.

* Quite obviously the  Speaker,  for the House of Representatives, and the  President,  for the Senate, have a very material interest in these matters in protecting the **rights** of the Parliament.

* The **rights** of the Parliament have been protected very effectively by  Mr Speaker  and the  President  over the last two years.

* The allocation reflects the **rights** and responsibilities of democratic participation in local territorial affairs and safeguards the national interest in the seat of government and the national capital.

* With the State governments claiming sovereign **rights** in some of the same areas as the Commonwealth, we find ourselves in the absurd position of having one of the longest coastlines and most extensive continental shelves of ail littoral nations, without a clear decision on this most important matter.

* It is for us - here in the national Parliament  - to  provide the legislative framework which will enable the national Government to exert its sovereign national **rights** and  to  speak with authority in national terms on these matters.

* Part II of the Bill, which deals with sovereignty over the territorial sea and sovereign **rights** in respect of the continental shelf, is based largely on the earlier Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill which has been discussed previously in this House at length.

* Similarly clause  11  makes it clear that the sovereign **rights** of Australia in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.

* Thirdly, the Bill contains, in Division  3  of Part II, certain saving provisions to ensure that the assertion of Commonwealth sovereign **rights** in the territorial sea will not invalidate existing property **rights** in wharves and other installations or works, nor limit or exclude the operation of any law of the Commonwealth, a Territory or a State in force at the date of commencement of this legislation or coming into force after that date.

* This exemption will not extend to any State law in so far as it is expressed to vest  any  sovereignty or sovereign **rights**, or to make these exercisable otherwise than provided in this Bill.

* The other short-term title is the access authority which will authorise a title holder to have limited access to areas outside his title area if the Minister is satisfied that this is necessary or desirable for the more effective exercise and proper performance of the **rights** and duties of the title holder.

* It will permit those intentions to be translated even further into action and it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the **rights** of women in Australian society.

* I refer to the proposed meeting between the Australian Government and the representatives of the Queensland Government on the matter of the **rights** of Aboriginals on the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves which was supposed to occur today.

* In what way and lo what extent will the retirement benefits of members of the Defence Forces be affected by the proposals to preserve superannuation **rights** which he presented to the House on 25th September 1969.

* As (o off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the 3 mile limit.

* Mr Speaker,  as the custodian of the **rights** and the privileges of the Parliament, is it proper procedure when a Government is facing a motion of censure for debate to be gagged in this' way?

* An immediate assurance should be given to employees in the aircraft industry employed at Government Aircraft Factories that they will retain their present **rights** and conditions of employment if the structure of the industry is changed.

* Which of the unions registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act have rules which permit members of an incumbent management committee to sit in judgment on rival candidates' **rights** to nominate for office.

* recruited from the United States of America as an adviser on Aboriginal **rights**, has criticised the absence of Aborigines from the bodies which determine policies on aboriginal affairs?

* Will he make an immediate statement to the House assuring Government employees in the industry that their accrued **rights** will be fully preserved and that they will not suffer disadvantage in any rearrangement of the industry.

* If the legal profession and governments are really concerned with the legal **rights** of the weaker, or indeed all, members of Australian society then the limitations of Australian legal aid schemes will have to be recognised.

* asked the Treasurer, upon notice:  Does the Government support the desirability of allocating any general issue of International Monetary Fund special drawing **rights** initially to underdeveloped countries.

* In any legislation which confers **rights** on the Government of the Northern Territory it ought to be noted that in his report at paragraph 740  Mr Justice  Woodward stated:  .

* He mentioned disquiet that ordinances of that legislature would erode the principles of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Under the present Act, there is no specific provision, as was recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward, which would expand the **rights** of Aborigines to enter upon pastoral leases for traditional purposes.

* I believe at this time, before this Parliament hands over responsibility to the Government of the Northern Territory, it ought to say clearly and unequivocally:  'We will strengthen this legislation in accordance with the Woodward report and in accordance with our review that it is time that the Aboriginal people who, for so long have been discriminated against in terms of their own tradition, their own **rights**, and their own culture will have their place in the sun and that their **rights** will not be diminished by mining companies which are prepared to use considerable funds to undermine their claims. '

* One sympathises, of course, with his views on civil **rights** in the Soviet Union and such places but Indonesia, which is much closer to home - 
1 ) Did the Whitlam Government accede promptly to the recommendation of the first report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission calling for Land Councils based on Darwin and Alice Springs.

* I am not aware of any specific land **rights** claims made in relation to the Iwasaki project area nor am I aware of any extraordinary requirements of a local government nature having been placed on Aboriginals in the area.

* Neither Australia nor, as far as I am aware, any other country has lodged a protest with the United Nations about human **rights** in Kampuchea.

* The main purpose of this Bill is to amend certain provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act 1956-73 in order to alter the name of the Commission; increase the number of Commissioners from five to seven; make specific provision for the appointment of a full time Chairman of the Commission; to alter the basis on which the Commission is reimbursed for losses in the operation of a shipping service undertaken at the direction of the Minister for Transport; and to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to **rights** and benefits of the Commission's officers formerly employed in the Australian Public Service.

* This latter sub-section of the Act purports to give officers of the Commission who were formerly employed in the Australian Public Service the same **rights** and benefits as if they remained in the Public Service.

* These **rights** and benefits are enjoyed by officers in other statutory authorities, such as Commonwealth Railways.

* It is without meaning for the reason that Public Service **rights** and benefits are given pursuant to appointments under section 22 only, whereas appointment of officers is authorised only under section 2 1 and 23.

* The elaborate argument that the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  spun out in the House this afternoon would have been a good deal more credible if honourable members had not been vividly aware of the time which has elapsed since the question of land **rights** was first raised.

* The honourable member elaborated his argument at extraordinary length, but honourable members all recalled while he was speaking the stonewall resistance put up over a period of years to the land **rights** claims of the Gurindji by successive Country Party Ministers.

* Most honourable members would have been aware that behind the honourable member's request for time to study this legislation- allegedly in the interests of securing better Bills- was a plea for time to reconcile the differences which have arisen over this question of land **rights** between the Liberal Party and the National Country Party.

* On the contrary though National Country Party members have always taken a very lively interest in Aboriginal affairs and especially in the land **rights** issue.

* Of course the National Country Party speaks in this place precisely for those groups in our society who see themselves as threatened by land **rights** becoming available to Aborigines.

* We are witnessing this last ditch attempt on the part of the honourable member for Wentworth to have the whole affair referred to yet another committee because the Country Party lives in hope that the matter of land **rights** for Aborigines, like the matter of electoral reform and one vote one value, can be staved off in the hope of an electoral miracle which will somehow make these issues dead letters.

* It was because of the determination of the land holders in the area whose interests are spoken for in this place by the Country Party to see that the issue of land **rights** was killed stone dead at its inception.

* When the honourable member for Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  and the honourable member for the Northern Territory interrupted me, I was addressing myself to this question of land **rights**.

* I was anxious to make the point that it is important to distinguish in this question of land **rights** between those Aboriginal communities which have retained a sense of identity, which have retained a sense of purpose and which have forward looking aspirations of their own as is the case preeminently with the Gurindji, and those Aboriginal communities, such as the people of Lake Tyers in my own State, who have none of these attributes.

* The debate about land **rights** is overwhelming- debate about the restoration of the sense of identity, about the restoration of a sense of self-respect to the Aboriginal people.

* If it is to be effective, there must be some sensitive monitoring of the circumstances in which transfer of land **rights** is encompassed.

* We have had a most unfortunate experience in my own State where, I believe, the Victorian Government would not have behaved differently in the matter of Lake Tyers if it had been the Government's intention to discredit the whole notion of land **rights** from the outset.

* These were the circumstances in which the first transfer of land **rights** took place in Australia.

* We move to 22 May 1975 when the Attorney-General announced that he had referred the matter of the most appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individuals' **rights** and liberties in relation to the Australia Police to the Australian Law Reform Commission.

* If we look at the whole range of Labor initiatives and Labor achievements- in health, in education, in social security, in child care, in industrial policy, in incomes policy, in human **rights**- we can see that women and children are as much the beneficiaries as men, and that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit.

* Labor's policies in these fields are policies for women; they are part of our program to improve the welfare and widen the **rights** and opportunities of the whole community.

* Many people believed that our main concern was for the minority of career-minded women with higher education; that we were interested in abstract questions of women's **rights** and women's liberation rather than bread and butter issues; that the opportunities of professional women came before the needs of housewives.

* We must move from a particular concern with specific women's interests and **rights** to a more general concern for women as members of the community, as consumers, as members of the workforce.

* It was natural that in our first period of government we set about restoring women's **rights**, and removing discrimination in all its social, economic or legal forms.

* We appointed the Royal Commission into Human Relationships- an inquiry of fundamental importance to the **rights** and needs of women and families.

* Until women have equal **rights** to employment they cannot be said to have equal **rights** as citizens.

* A major function of these services is to ensure that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are fully informed of their legal **rights**.

* therefore, becomes the duly of  His  Majesty's Opposition, and every member of it, not merely to oppose this measure in Parliament with all the force of the arguments at their command, but also to exhaust every effort to rouse the people outside the Parliament to a tremendous defence of their own liberties and **rights**.

* The Temporary Assistance Authority by its decision has, at least until the Industries Assistance Commission report later this year, stated in effect that there should be an industry in Australia, that it should have reasonable protection and that the employment **rights** of Australians in this industry should be protected.

* Here we have a situation where a man exercises his **rights**, pursuant to the law made in this Parliament and available to him, and wins his appeal but apparently, because he has won the appeal, that again has created a further stigma or suggestion that this man is going to beat this bureaucracy which is trying to declare him to be unfit.

* I can say much more about the maintenance provisions which, despite what has been said by some people, are entirely fair to women and protect the **rights** and status of women.

* Australians must retain absolute control of their own soil, their own **rights** and their own future.

* Are traffic **rights** for the Qantas-owned non- IATA subsidiary company being negotiated with Japan (Hansard, 30th September 1971, page 1827, question No.

* Each of the above Agreements will allow Qantas, as the Australian designated airline, the advantage of transit and traffic **rights** to, from and over the other country party to the Agreement along the specified route concerned.

* Has the Commonwealth Government extended to these descendants of the Kanakas the same welfare **rights** given to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the areas of health, education, housing and legal aid.

* The ABC has exclusive **rights** to televise the test matches throughout Western Australia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and in all nonmetropolitan areas in the other States.

* In view of urgent pressures from other Departments for conclusion of agreements between Aboriginal and mining interests, when does he expect to make public details of Government policy on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The acquisition of the land excluded mineral **rights**.

* He had a deep concern for welfare, equality and the **rights** of individuals and he had a great vision of Australia.

* and (6) As a registered organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act the Air Pilots' Guild of Australia has the same **rights** and obligations as any other registered organisation.

* 1 have exercised such **rights** as 1 have as a member of my Party and as a member of the House to procure that some discussion takes place in this the national Parliament, on a matter that I do regard as a very important one.

* Quite obviously the Opposition is more concerned with the interests and the **rights** of manufacturers and the people it represents than in protecting the **rights** of consumers.

* If the Opposition has its way we will have 6 pieces of legislation in the States which have added to the confusion and have affected the **rights** of the consumers in this country.

* I was not surprised that the honourable member for Wentworth came forward with the old States **rights** argument.

* I do not believe that we should be talking about States **rights** or Federal **rights**.

* What we are talking about is the **rights** of the Australian individual.

* It will provide powerful reinforcement for, and give great impetus to, efforts already made to protect consumers and to develop consciousness of consumers' **rights**.

* But more often than not, we are quite ignorant of our **rights** and privileges as consumers.

* What we are proposing in this Bill is a consumers' charter, that is, a bill of **rights** for Australians as consumers.

* To recapitulate, related to this Bill and involved in this Bill are four fundamental **rights**: The right to be safe, as proposed in clause 62; the right to know, as proposed by clause 63; the right to choose, and the right to be heard.

* How can a government appeal to unions for co-operation when it is pushing legislation through the Parliament to restrict their **rights** and freedoms in a way that no other democracy in the world has contemplated?

* There is a fear that evil overseas ownership is going to get hold of our heritage - I think that is the word that is usually used - and squander it and we are going to lose our **rights** to it.

* It is more commonly known as the Bland report which was commissioned by the McMahon Government to look into the protection of individual **rights**.

* These 3 institutions will then be available to Australians in the protection of their liberty and the enforcement of their **rights**.

* The process of putting fiscal policy back to **rights** has to be a continuing one.

* How does the changing of the date for a Senate election, making it conjoint with the House of Representatives election, deny the Senate any **rights** whatsoever?

* The **rights** of the Senate will not be affected in any way whatsoever by the carrying of this legislation.

* The **rights** of the people- and I do not support States **rights**; I think people are far more important than States- will never be denied by the carrying of this legislation.

* In fact, it could be said, and I think quite rightly, that their **rights** are strengthened because on the one day the people of this country will come out and do what the Constitution envisages they will do.

* (a) The next educational programme to inform the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory of their franchise **rights** will be undertaken about August-September next in order to ensure that the greatest benefit is derived from the programme by these people before the next House of Representatives election.

* In what respects do these employees enjoy different **rights** to other Commonwealth pu blic servants in (a) retirement benefits, (b) arbitration, (c) promotions and (d) discipline.

* What was the revenue from (a) air navigation charges, (b) rentals, business trading **rights**, car park receipts, and other revenue, and (c) fuel tax, in the same years.

* What progress has been made with the legislation on public lending **rights** (Hansard, 20th August 1971, page 468 and 9th December 1971, page 4564).

* It is possible for this sort of thing to happen simply because of the arrangements made by the former Government with these employers and of the legislation which protects their **rights**.

* unenforceable in so far as it confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation.

* Is it intended that Aborigines will be recruited to the Australian Electoral Office so that the function of informing and educating Aboriginal people of their franchise **rights** might be more adequately performed.

* He seems to have the wrong impression about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) 
2 ) The Commonwealth did not require the State Government to forgo its **rights** to High Court action, nor did it require that the $10m apply to the labour content only of compensation projects.

* In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended, on motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice; Provided that such motion is carried by an absolute majority of Members having full voting **rights**.

* But effective work can be done from the point of view of human **rights**, civil **rights**, and the liberties of people.

* Here we have disguised thinly but surely another attack on the **rights** of private members of this Parliament.

* Here we have once again the whittling away of the **rights** of private members.

* This is another erosion of the **rights** of the private member.

* As far as I am concerned, the people of Australia do not elect Ministers, they elect representatives and that was an incursion into the **rights** of the individual members.

* From this we should have with proper safeguards for the general public an arrangement whereby individuals will have access to their files and perhaps advocates operating on behalf of individuals may also have access to files with the authority of clients so that there may be maximum guarantee of individual **rights** so far as my Department is concerned.

* The advertising has been placed in print and electronic media and has been directed at informing people about the functioning of Government and the **rights** and entitlements of people.

* I am concerned about the education of all children and the educational **rights** of all children.

* Co-operation is further denied by the stated intention expressed in the Governor-General's Speech to 'assert and establish' the so-called sovereign **rights** of this Parliament over the resources of the sea bed.

* As to off-share minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the 3 mile limit.

* It proposes to legislate-- 
That the Pharmaceuticals Benefits Scheme be amended to allow patients a benefit when obtaining drugs prescribed by a dentist in accordance with his **rights** under the appropriate State legislation.

* There are a large number of antibiotics available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has neither the patent- **rights**  nor the existing facilities to produce.

* So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origins, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the **rights** and duties of citizenship, and intention to live here permanently.

* There is another area where the Minister is, we believe, quite wrongly reducing **rights** and opportunities of unionists, employers and of affected third parties.

* There are other alterations to rules which can significantly affect the **rights** of individual unionists and the section ought not to be limited as the Minister would want.

* I know that Government supporters will not be allowed to vote for our amendment but in the period they are here they should think about the privileges, the **rights**, the role of the House of Representatives.

* Members opposite are the 
1 ) It is unlikely that it could be said that a particular conception of human **rights** has represented the sole determinant of Australian foreign poliCy at any time towards any country.

* That in the opinion of this House the Soviet Union has by its continuing violations of basic human **rights** revealed itself to be unfit to be the host nation of the 1980 Olympic Games.

* Have any **rights** been assigned to the Honeywell Corporation or any other foreign owned company to develop, manufacture or exploit for profit in any way the Mulloka system, or part of this system.

* 1) Were provisions in the Public Service Act relating to the **rights** of public servants to comment on public issues abolished or qualified in 1 974.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* We have been advised that the Revolutionary Government observes the Vienna Convention relating to the **rights** and immunities of foreign diplomatic representatives and that embassy properties would be protected.

* It does abolish present compensation schemes and with them the **rights** and remedies which exist throughout Australia.

* This clause is not designed m some way to take away from the **rights** of Australians or Australian companies.

* Members of the National Country Party would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limited **rights** of country people and to secure for country people something approaching the equality of representation to which they are entitled as Australian citizens.

* They .deal with persons whose contributions to the superannuation scheme have been deferred on their becoming eligible members of the DFRDB scheme, the preservation of **rights** provisions as they relate to persons transferring from one scheme to the other and, in accordance with past practice, the ex-officio appointment of the Commissioner for Superannuation, in lieu of the  President  of the Superannuation Board, as  chairman  of the DFRDB Authority and the DFRB Board.

* Members o the Opposition have some **rights**, and they should have available to them the services of a trained legal officer to put these complicated matters into proper legal form.

* Would the Government be prepared to use the external affairs power of the Australian Constitution to introduce a Bill of **rights**?

* Prevention of child removal is a complex matter involving questions of jurisdiction, dual nationality, citizenship, freedom of travel and **rights** of the child.

* The implication was that if they did not sign they could lose the Northern Land Council, the Land Council could lose some of its **rights**, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act might be amended, or the Government might appoint an arbitrator.

* In any case, any of those outcomes was more likely than the appointment of an independent arbitrator to determine Aboriginal land **rights** in the event of the Aboriginal people not toeing the line and not signing the agreement which the Government felt they should sign within the time specified by the Government.

* I think that the land **rights** issue has been expressed in the policies and platforms of all the major parties as a matter which is vital to the preservation of Aboriginal culture and to the recognition of the right of Aborigines to their identity and to selfmanagement.

* It was designed to enable people to transfer some of their **rights** and not have to pay higher rates because they were going into a new fund at a later age, and so on.

* This organisation is strongly opposed by many groups in Australia, including the East Timor Association, the Aboriginal land **rights** groups, the Campaign Against Racial Exploitation, the Australian independence movement and the Australian Union of Students.

* The honourable gentleman talks about land **rights**.

* He says that there is nothing in the legislation effectively to bestow on people **rights** over their land.

* Has the Government expressed any concern about those violations of human **rights** to either the Polish authorities or the U.S.S.R., which is the real instigator of this outrage?

* Associated with the **rights** of a teacher, which may need precise definition, a professional code of ethics governing teachers' relationships with their students might well be spelt out and made specific.

* Those companies, however, are not permitted to solicit or conduct non-prearranged business at Commonwealth airports as these **rights** were granted at public tender to Avis Rent A Car System Pty Ltd. 
Labor in government has whittled away our international standing, abused our allies, destroyed the framework of our national security, taken steps to tamper with future elections, frustrated civil **rights** rather than protect them, and sought through massive funding of a propaganda machine to mislead the Australian electorate.

* It is seeking to change the **rights** of electors by gerrymandering the electoral system so as to perpetuate the role of a Labor Government.

* We have seen the persecution of minorities by this so-called Government concerned with the **rights** of the individual.

* Has further consideration been given, in the light of the legislation, to asserting Australia's exclusive fishing **rights** over a larger area of the Gulf of Carpentaria.

* Which firm has been granted pink page advertising **rights** for the Western Australia telephone directory in each of the last 5 years?

* Does the Government inform naturalised citizens that they have the full **rights** and privileges of native born citizens when in fact they can be deported?

* This is the essential right of the human person, without which obviously no other **rights** will exist for that person, lt is as valid a legal and human right for the life still hidden in the womb of its mother as it is for the life already born and proceeding with an existence independently of the mother.

* Whatever reasons there may be for drawing legal distinctions between human **rights** and human responsibilities at different phases of life, abortion used as a deliberate means of destroying a life, and not as a means of saving a life, is a grave attack upon the inviolability of human life, and ought to be an unlawful attack on the inviolability of human life.

* The Department is aware that the Queensland Education Department is negotiating certain **rights** in respect to copying.

* It may well be that if that method were adopted we could extend the time available for consideration of legislation without in any way restricting the **rights** of members.

* 1142) 
The appointment of a Judge as Director, or service of a Judge as Director, does not affect the tenure of his office as a Judge or his rank, title, status, precedence, salary, annual or other allowances or other **rights** or privileges as the holder of his office as a Judge, and for all purposes his service as Director shall be taken to be service as the holder of his office as a Judge.

* What action has he taken to ensure Australian ownership of industry and the **rights** of existing Australian industry, in Western Australia.

* I suggest that on reading the amendments and the legislation generally a far more compelling argument could be made that the amendments are to strengthen the role of the individual unionist and to protect his **rights** against certain union leadership.

* They are designed firstly to protect the **rights** of individual unionists.

* The Medibank strike of last year is a perfect example of thuggery in many areas against individuals who stood up for their **rights**- **rights** that every Australian should have- to decide whether they should participate in a particular action.

* There are many examples of the union leadership trying to protect itself and trying to restrict the real **rights** and freedoms of the individual union member.

* These are the sorts of loopholes which are restricting the **rights** of the ordinary unionist to participate gainfully in his union's affairs and to get the leadership which he feels he wants and is really representative.

* Once again I believe that this is protecting the **rights** of individual unionists to see what is happening to their money and, in some cases, even from where it comes.

* Increasingly, it is the title deed to full citizenship, more important than a birth certificate or a passport- an identity card, in fact, the only document which proves a man exists and has **rights**.

* I hope that with these amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act we can restore some **rights** and protection to the individual union man in this country who, I believe, overwhelmingly supports this legislation.

* As well as secretly crusading for the **rights** of the oil companies to drill the reef, the Federal Government has been concocting another scheme by which it will give the reef to the Queensland Government which will allow drilling.

* And  that  this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* In the Seas and Submerged Lands Case, the complete sovereign power and **rights** of the Commonwealth Parliament over off-shore areas of Australia, that is from low water mark outwards, was affirmed.

* I assure the Government that it has a long and impassable road ahead if it persists in pursuing unconstitutional attacks on the **rights** of the sovereign State of Queensland.

* This means that we must take a fresh look at those sorts of things which safeguard individual **rights** and which safeguard a system which provides checks and balances aimed at safeguarding individual **rights**.

* They are healthy disrespecters, as Australian people, of big government, because they are basic respecters of the **rights** of individual people.

* In spite of what the honourable member said about **rights**, and I know what he feels about that matter, I put it to the House that no individual has a right to examine a secret and confidential document which is the property of a government.

* We shall be pursuing our **rights** energetically when such matters come before GATT.

* The States always take great pains to establish their sovereignty, their **rights** to determine their own spending priorities.

* Whilst the problems facing Australia are nowhere near the scale, severity or immediacy that they were during the 
Nor do we want to see a situation in which welfare agencies proliferate and are nationally organised in such a way that there are too many incentives for empire building, demarcation and territorial disputes, and, amongst the personnel, for self-maintenance and career improvement at the possible expense of the **rights** of the people the system is supposed to be helping.

* Instead it is an admission by the Prime Minister that the Bills pose a serious threat to State **rights**.

* Secrecy provisions in the legislation infringe basic civil **rights** and penal clauses for defence purposes are not appropriate for a civilian industry.

* It is in order for the Leader of the Op- position to ride roughshod over the **rights** of back bench members of this Parliament by moving such a motion during question time?

* I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar):  If he is concerned about human **rights** and civil liberties- I confess that it is an area that has never bothered me- how many people have really suffered?

* Did they consider that this infringed human **rights**?

* Where has any company director subject to investigation by either a corporate affairs commission, an insurance office or the Taxation Office, had his civil **rights** infringed?

* Is the area to be excised designed to recognise traditional land **rights** or to establish a viable economic venture.

* Was consideration given to the voting **rights** of shareholders in Industrial Equity to ascertain who controlled this company.

* None of us ever thought it likely that any Government, of whatever political party, would take away **rights** and privileges that had been promised by a previous Government in the days when the community realised that it did have responsibilities towards those whose disabilities were the direct result of war service.

* An offshoot of this was that, because of the right and privilege of full medical treatment for most disabilities, **rights** were not always exercised, and when various disabilities made themselves obvious, we received treatment, but did not take any action to have them accepted as due to war service, because it seemed so unnecessary.

* There has been much argument by experts about the **rights** and wrongs of discharging sewage into the ocean and I believe that there should be a complete examination of Sydney's unique position where there are magnificent beaches stretching for 20 miles south and north of the harbour entrance.

* We respect both free enterprise and the **rights** of individuals.

* When one hears the honourable member for Lalor getting up in public places and saying- 
Since the Minister for Primary Industry has announced that the Government will take into account Japan's reduction in beef imports from Australia when it considers the renewal of Japan's fishing **rights** in Australian waters, I ask him whether there are any arrangements between Australia and Canada, the United States of America, the European Economic Community and Great Britain which could also be reviewed in the same way, in view of the unilateral decisions on minimal notice which those customers have also imposed by way of quotas or even bans on their imports of Australian beef?

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* It has been described as a removal of the **rights** of secrecy.

* In the United States of America, whose Constitution enshrines the domocratic **rights** of the individual to an extent which is almost beyond belief in a modern society and which is the cause of some problems in that country, the **rights** of the individual are totally protected and there is no question that the Supreme Court of the United States would upset any attempt to take away from any individual his **rights** of secret ballot and his **rights** to participate properly in an election.

* I take it that if that sort of thing were proposed here it would be said to constitute a denial of the individual's **rights** and a denial of the **rights** to secrecy of the ballot.

* We have no guarantee, and so I speak about the **rights** of back benchers.

* I want to see something written into the Standing Orders to preserve the **rights** as they should be.

* We are living in a democracy and people do have the **rights**.

* 1 ) The Government is aware of the emphasis placed by President Carter on human **rights** issues.

* If this is so, are not the maximum storage **rights** under the International Sugar Agreement quite meaningless under present conditions in Australia?

* Whether you are the Leader of the House or the Prime Minister, I am here to protect the **rights** of the elected members of this Parliament.

* One of the things we did together was to write a paper on the **rights** of witnesses before parliamentary committees.

* That was an appropriate document for Ivor Greenwood to share in because in it much will be found about the **rights** of individuals.

* My question, which is on a substantive matter, is addressed to the Prime Minister and is subsequent to a number of petitions I have presented to the House concerning human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the Government's attitude towards the Soviet Union's attempts to deny the **rights** and liberties of those of its citizens wishing to exercise the democratic **rights** of free expression and peaceful dissent?

* In paragraph (a) (iii) - I suppose the use of Roman numerals there is somewhat archaic as well - there is reference to the term 'services' including a contract for the conferring of **rights** or privileges for which remuneration is payable - wait for it - in the form of a tribute.

* If so, is the Government prepared to introduce the necessary legislation for these land **rights** in the Northern Territory.

* Has the Western Australian Government kept him informed of legislative proposals to deprive Oombulgurri Aboriginals of self-management, land **rights** and control of mining.

* Another provision recognises the **rights** of single females to own their homes.

* What I am worried about is this: I feel that, as the Minister has said- although this was not quite understood by those who were forcing the point- these **rights** are in fact available.

* I have dealt, of course, principally with the **rights** of migration and I have relied on answers given to me and my colleagues by the relevant Ministers.

* What action has been taken to grant public lending **rights** to Australian authors.

* Firstly, the Government has failed to take sufficient lead in working out a National Information Policy, that is, a comprehensive outline of the **rights** of Australian residents and citizens to access to information in a form which can benefit them.

* Virtually, it is wiping out, from the point of view of effective redevelopment, the **rights** of at least 500,000 people.

* At the same time, I ask the Minister to request the State Planning Authority of New South Wales, which has on it no representative from the area I represent, lo say that it has made an error and to rescind the type of decision that has already been made in respect of the premises in Tunbridge Street, Mascot, lt is incredible that with all the resources and planners that we have nobody has really looked at the problem from the point of view of the people I represent, which is this: They will immediately lose all me **rights** that they now have from the point of view of value.

* It takes courage and money to fight for the **rights** of consumers.

* As the honourable member for Bennelong has said, the proposed consumer protection authority will not work if it concentrates solely on the buyer and not on the seller and if it seeks to protect the buyer without regard for the **rights** of the seller.

* We have these hang-ups about individual violence and we recognise it for what it is - it is horrible - and yet we condone mass violence in the name of all sorts of things, such as **rights** of nations, and so on.

* Further, the Commission shall have regard to Article 26 of the United Nations charter on human **rights** .

* Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* What **rights** do these children have to return to Australia (a) with or (b) without assistance.

* 1310) 
8 ) What action is being taken to protect the **rights** of the employees of the company.

* Consideration of this matter involves die **rights** of individuals as well as the national interest and 1 would not expect an easy or an early solution.

* Australians have **rights**.

* Australians also have obligations, and those obligations are brought about by the fact the people do have **rights**.

* The decision was that the Commonwealth had sole sovereign **rights** in respect of all the resources of the continental shelf right out from low water level.

* We will assert to the full our sovereign **rights**'.

* The Commonwealth has those sovereign **rights**.

* The Commonwealth undoubtedly has these **rights**.

* When the States make their challenge, the sovereign **rights** of the Commonwealth undoubtedly will be upheld.

* Did Article 3 of this agreement refer to the possibility of a further delimitation agreement or agreements being concluded between governments exercising sovereign **rights** with respect to the exploration of the seabed and the exploitation of its natural resources in the area of the Timor Sea, which might necessitate adjustment of the boundary lines agreed to on 9 October 1972.

* I have said in this House, and I did tell a group of people at Perenjori, that there was pot the slightest doubt that members of the Communist Party and communist elements were associated with activist groups among Aborigines fighting for land **rights**.

* Too much emphasis is placed on the irresponsible **rights** of the individual.

* Four or five years ago some university students decided to hold a vigil in connection with the **rights** of Aborigines.

* I think that the Government, which has barged through this whole affair over several weeks in an extremely maladroit way, would be well advised to drop it and to stand by its common law **rights** which have been declared for it by the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory, because the ordinance that it has drafted is thoroughly unsatisfactory.

* When Papuans were called British subjects it was not assumed that the British subjects of Papua had **rights** in Australia any more than the British subjects of India but we changed the terminology for the sake of international window dressing and we called them 'Australian citizens'.

* Co-operation between the 3 levels of government is essential if planning proposals that will both protect the environment in these sensitive areas and preserve the **rights** of residents are to be found.

* Our embassy was also told to do all in its power, to ensure that his civil **rights** were protected.

* In this regard, the present provisions of the National Health Act are designed to ensure effective organisation management and effective protection of contributors' **rights**.

* Examples of the action taken by the Commonwealth to ensure adequate protection of contributors' **rights** include: 
There are also other important safeguards applied to contributors, e.g.

* the Registration Committee, which is constituted under Section 70 of the National Health Act, has a statutory obligation to consider and report to the Minister on proposals submitted by organisations to change rules affecting contributors' **rights**.

* The Committee reports on any matters which, in its opinion, might impose any unreasonable or inequitable conditions affecting the **rights** of contributors.

* The Federal Government refuses to say why it banned Dick Gregory, the American negro entertainer and civil **rights** leader, from entering Australia.

* They do in respect of the ownership of property, they do in exercising property **rights**; they do in exercising certain other statutory obligations and requirements which are set out in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act; but they do not and they should not be seen to be standing in the shoes of the membership in relation to the negotiation of an agreement.

* The honourable member for Lalor suggested also that **rights** were being curtailed by this clause.

* 120) 
Government's land **rights** legislation.

* We will not sell out the constitutional **rights** of this House.

* But the whole objective of including a reunuciation is to ensure that when we present - as we must do in cases of dual citizenship - a case on behalf of an Australian citizen, that we are in a position to say that we do not accept dual citizenship in any way as reducing the **rights** pertinent to an Australian citizen.

* Considering that the restoration ofthe lawful **rights** of the Peoples Republic of China is essential both for the protection ofthe Charter of the United Nations and for the cause that, the United Nations must serve under the Charter, 
Decides to restore all its **rights** to the People's Republic of China and to recognise the representatives of its Government asthe only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations, andto expel forthwith ihe representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organisations relatedto it.

* The Bill contains some very reaonable provisions in the areas in which it protects the **rights** of the Aboriginal land councils and reflects some of the provisions of the agreement with the Northern Land Council on Ranger.

* I still submit that the Opposition in a Parliament has very few **rights**.

* Two of the **rights** that seem to me to remain still are, firstly, the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of public importance where the Opposition literally takes the initiative as against the Government.

* They follow the Commonwealth Employees (Provisions) Act and the amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, both of which cut down on the **rights** and privileges of public servants.

* That is consistent, as I said, with the Government's determination to undermine the basic civil **rights** and individual liberties of workers generally and public servants in particular.

* There is general agreement that visible and effective independence from government at all levels is essential if legal aid services are to guarantee full and effective representation to all citizens whose **rights** are infringed or whose interests are threatened and if salaried lawyers are to be protected against any suggestion of improper pressure or interference in their activities.

* People felt no inhibitions about walking into the ALAO to find out whether they had any **rights**, but they cannot get the same service if they have to walk up to some private practitioner.

* There is no suggestion that in the creation of a legal aid structure we are trying to establish a monolithic creature that will deny the profession of the **rights** as they exist.

* It is important that people be compelled to get legal advice before they sign away their **rights** on documents such as a contract for the sale of land, a hire purchase agreement or a consumer credit book purchase.

* Another provision of importance to the people of this country is inclusion in the Bill of pro forma schedules which would give basic minimum **rights** to policy holders.

* What a strange inversion of argument to defend an indefensible policy by drawing attention to the biggest crime of all, that is this irreversible sellout of the **rights** not only of the citizens of Manly- Warringah but also of the countless thousands of Sydneysiders from all over the metropolitan area who travel to the northern beaches and waters for their recreation.

* During his speech the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  mentioned that all sections of society have both **rights** and responsinilities The air traffic controllers' strike, and perhaps the mail strike at the Redfern exchange, are illustrations of the way in which a minority section within the trade union movement is prepared to demand its **rights** within society, while failing to respond to its responsibilities to the rest of the people in the community.

* I should like all honourable members to take an interest in it on the merits of their **rights**.

* Its aim should be that all our citizens may enjoy the security and peace of life that stems from the knowledge that in every eventuality the **rights**, well being and dignity of the frail, the sick and the aged will be upheld and properly safeguarded.

* The first criterion is that any scheme be simple and understandable, and the scheme which is coming in is certainly an improvement on the one it is replacing with regard to simplicity and being understood, but because of the confusion in the general public's mind with all the changes it is most important that the Government has an educational advertising scheme so that people are aware of what the new scheme is, what they may have to do, what their **rights** are and so on.

* Despite the introduction of special drawing **rights**, this method continued to prevail.

* In the same way we would not favour a mandatory requirement for conversion to special drawing **rights** without some degree of flexibility.

* In general, we favour the move to reduce the role of reserve currencies to enable special drawing **rights** to become the primary reserve asset of the future.

* It provides for greatly increased spending on education - another area where Labor would impose class distinctions by downgrading the place and **rights** of independent schools in the education system.

* Foreign Students in Australia: Rights 
b) foreign students in Australia have full civil **rights** while in Australia; 
the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare; and 
I withdraw the word 'hyprocrisy'.

* Now we may argue whether Australia ought to have been involved or not, and we have so argued in this House, but when it comes to defending the **rights** of those who serve there then I intend not to be behind anyone in this Parliament in making my stand known.

* The plain fact is that if the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Moreton accept our propositions, if they believe that in common justice this country can now afford to extend the benefits of the war service homes legislation to all those who serve in the armed Services in this country, as we did for those who served during the 1939-45 war, and as we did again after the 
-The support of this Government for basic human **rights** is second to none, whatever field of activity one might like to examine, but especially in relation to our own areas of responsibility.

* The teachers in the Australian Capital Territory also raised with me the question of the preservation of existing and accruing **rights** of State teachers joining the Commonwealth Teaching Service.

* The Opposition felt that the Bill, as it stood, did not consider the full **rights** and the full needs of Queensland's involvement in the exercise of powers within the Park itself.

* It must be remembered that at the Government's insistence aged donors can receive no contractual or other legal **rights** to their accommodation.

* I shall indeed be the guardian of the **rights** of all members.

* I want to respond to a few comments made by the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  particularly when he challenged the Opposition to state whether it thought primary producers should have equal **rights** with other citizens.

* The idea that we in any of our committees or commissions have ignored the States, trampling States' **rights**, is quite erroneous.

* An opportunity is being given to people to come forward and to regularise their status in Australia so that they can live a full and complete life, and in the fullness of time become citizens of Australia with all the **rights** and privileges that that involves.

* Does the report also recommend that (a) entry permits the Aboriginal land be granted by Aboriginal representatives instead of by Government proclamation as at present and (b) disposal of crown mineral **rights** should be publicly debated.

* - Mr Speaker, my question is directed to you and it concerns the **rights** of members of the Parliament.

* Are not such threats a serious infringement of the **rights** and privileges of members of this House?

* What action can you take,  Sir, to  protect the **rights** and privileges of the members of this House from intimidation by the Prime Minister?

* Its removal in no way advances the very basic and serious question of a woman's role and her **rights** which must be pursued, and pursued as a matter of urgency.

* It boasted continuously both before and during the election period of how it would soon set the economy to **rights**.

* Let me quote a couple of statements made by the leader of the LiberalNational Country Party coalition- the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-  during the election campaign in November and 
What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that (a) traditional and State law entitling indigenous people to take traditional foods for their private use is respected,  (b) prima facie  baseless charges are not placed or (c) penalties are applied for insult to the **rights** of minority ethnic groups, including repeated discriminatory practices of Queensland officials documented by the Commissioner for Community Relations.

* I am amused to hear the honourable member for Kingston  (Mr Chapman)  say that as a Liberal he is interested in women's **rights**, particularly as just 2 nights ago the Liberal Party had a woman jumping out of a cake in Parliament House, demeaning not only the status of women in this country but also the status of the Ministers and members who were there.

* Let us find out from the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Liberal Party which Ministers and members were at the party so that we can know which Ministers and members of the Liberal Party are interested in the **rights**, dignity and status of Australian women.

* We now find that, with the appointment of a Minister specially involved with women's **rights** and with the Prime Minister's glib talk about bis interest in the dignity of women, senior Ministers are party to this kind of charade in Parliament House.

* One of the things about which they are really upset is this redistribution which attempts to take away some of their **rights**.

* All they are interested in is a system that will disadvantage country Australians and help the Labor Party no matter what violence is done to the real political **rights** of the people who live outside the capital cities.

* It certainly has no real respect for the democratic **rights** of the Australian people, especially those who live outside the great cities.

* Yet he is prepared to close his eyes to the unfairness and the injustice of these proposals in his determination to do everything that he can- and he has boasted about this often enough- to disadvantage and to hurt country people and to trample on their **rights** in the desperate effort and, I must admit, need to try to bolster the position of the Labor Government at the moment.

* We have been through this argument time and time again because of the Minister's stubborn attachment to his objective of damaging to the maximum extent possible the **rights** and opportunities of country people.

* We oppose these proposals because they are unfair and unjust and have no place in a country which claims to have any real interest in the **rights** of all of its citizens, including the nonmetropolitan citizens.

* People are worried, particularly in Queensland, where the fulfilment of State responsibilities by a government capably led by  Mr Bjelke-Petersen  and  Sir Gordon  Chalk has thwarted the efforts of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and guaranteed the preservation of State **rights**.

* Their stand has been a critical one for the defence of the people's **rights**.

* If this is done then we can be quite sure that there will be no riding roughshod over these people, denying to them their **rights**.

* 1 am not seeking in any way to take away any of the **rights** of honourable members to use the forms of the Parliament.

* I ask the Minister: Will he assure the House that the safeguards provided for the **rights** of Aboriginal people will be at least those proposed in the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill 1975, namely, either the joint consent of the Minister and of a land council representing the Aboriginal people to the granting of the mining interest, or the declaration by the GovernorGeneral, by proclamation, that it is in the national interest that such a grant be made, with this Parliament having the right to disallow the proclamation?

* The Indonesian Government would permit such a service if certain reciprocal **rights** were granted to it in relation to Australia.

* I regret to say that these reciprocal **rights** involve much more than just a simple service from Bali to the honourable member's electorate.

* Insofar as some State Premiers have criticised the local government legislation as being centralist, they fail to understand that it is legislation to determine the **rights** between spheres of government.

* This limitation of time, we were told, was a denial not only of justice, decency, democracy and free speech, but also of the **rights** of generations dead and not yet born.

* The Treasurer was able to state to the Committee of Twenty at the International Monetary Fund in Washington that Australia was not in favour of allocating special drawing **rights** to underdeveloped countries, nor of an automatic adjustment process based on objective indications.

* It also does not include certain administrative expenses such as the provision of superannuation **rights**, long service leave etc.

* Meanwhile, the **rights** of Aboriginal people in Queensland continued to be violated by official Queensland Government policy.

* Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 we gave Aborigines **rights** over their properties, we ended wage discrimination, we established their **rights** to have legal representation in courts and we ended the odious permanent entry system onto reserves.

* The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal welfare and **rights**.

* The situation now is the product of a fickle Government commitment to the **rights** of Aboriginal people in the face of bluster from the Queensland Premier.

* While the Prime Minister was giving those assurances his representative in Aboriginal welfare matters, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  was going about the community conveying the impression that he was an unyielding, dedicated defender of the **rights** of the Aboriginal people in the community.

* They would have given Aboriginal people land **rights** and they would have ended the sweeping, intrusive and coercive powers of the Queensland Director of Aboriginal Affairs- powers, intrusive and coercive in their nature, which no white person would tolerate.

* It is a very difficult matter for Aboriginal people to assert their **rights** if they resent that.

* It is in conflict with the basic principles of so many international conventions which this country has signed upholding human **rights**, human dignity and self-respect.

* Eighteen months ago the Prime Minister gave a secret assurance to the Queensland Premier that there would be no land acquisitions for the purposes of establishing land **rights** for Aboriginals in Queensland.

* But most importantly the legislation fails squarely to confront the land **rights** issue for Aboriginal people.

* What are honourable members opposite going to do about the Aboriginal land **rights** in the Northern Territory?

* Yet the honourable member for Hunter  (Mr James)  entered the chamber today and defended the role of Russia in world affairs, defended similar actions involving interference and intervention in violation of the **rights** of others- such as the events in Vietnam and Kampuchea- and the support and encouragement of the actions of Cubans in the continent of Africa.

* People named Allen wished to pursue the honourable member because he was a partner and therefore personally liable for the debts of the partnership, but when they sought to pursue their legal **rights**, which they would be entitled to do, they were met by an injunction instituted by Jamison preventing them from doing so because of the deed of arrangement.

* When Allen, a creditor, sought to enforce his **rights** on the basis that Baume was different from the others, because he had said that he was not a member of the partnership and therefore Allen could attack that issue in the court, he was prevented from so doing.

* As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the 3-mile limit.

* Will the Minister request the AttorneyGeneral to initiate proceedings against New South Wales police for breaching the Commonwealth Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 and show by example that we are not prepared to sit by idly while the **rights** of individuals are trampled upon?

* Two features of it will protect any **rights** of the Ministry and the **rights** of the Parliament  itself.

* All we have heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that the **rights** of the shareholders are protected.

* We are told that all that matters is the **rights** of shareholders, but surely what is significant is the national interest.

* On the other hand I am fully conscious of the **rights** of others in these areas.

* Personally I can see no reason why Ranger should not go ahead and provided that the claims of Aborigines are protected with respect to both compensation and **rights**, I can see no reason also why Nabarlek should not go ahead in those areas with those qualifications.

* There inevitably will be a shortage of standard ward beds for many years, and poorer people, who in some States - for example, Victoria - have had special **rights** to beds in public hospitals, will now have to compete for these beds with richer elements in the community.

* The Government states that the consultation that will go on between the parties involved will preserve the **rights** of the individuals or class of employees of a department who may be involved.

* Honourable members say 'All the appeals are there; all the preservations of **rights** for the public servants are there'.

* We believe that some sections of this Bill go some way towards achieving that end, but we are not prepared to accept the arguments that have been put forward by other speakers or by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  that the **rights** of the public servants are preserved when the Government introduces a provision into the Bill such as clause 7(b) (iii).

* I appreciate that what I have proposed is some intrusion into the **rights** of private members but I hope that the common sense of honourable members and the co-operation that the Opposition has already shown in these matters will prevail.

* The time already taken in investigation of these proposals and particularly in investigation of the proposal of land **rights** for Aborigines has been  very great, and there can be no question that the inquiry into land **rights** carried out by  Mr Justice  Woodward was one of the most thorough and searching inquiries which has been seen in this country in recent years, yet the Opposition is anxious to see this legislation referred for yet another inquiry.

* What the Australian Government is doing is protecting Australia's **rights** to participate in international air services.

* It appears to me that, in the community at the present time, we suffer time and again from the encroachment of great organisations upon the ordinary **rights** of simple citizens.

* I recall that, when the former Administration introduced its land **rights** Bill and councils and associations Bill, it sought to have a joint debate, which was proceeding at the time of the dissolution of the Parliament.

* They want to know what **rights** and what conventions are being broken by State Liberal governments in appointing people to the Upper House.

* A quick reading of this Bill has shown that it raises many grave questions in the constitution field, in the area of State **rights**, and even of its own validity as a viable piece of legislation.

* If the criteria for a right to stay in the wheat industry is simply to be who can produce a bushel of wheat at the lowest cost, then let us go straight out for collective farms on the Russian pattern or communes on the Chinese pattern or huge state farms and be done once and for all with this hypocrisy of pretence for the **rights** of the common man.

* I was talking in that debate about **rights** only being as strong as when protected by might - by the State and I said that once a State had conferred that right, it must use its might to protect it from then on.

* For, once the right to life has been conferred, life should not be taken unless by consent or when it can be proven beyond doubt that the taking of life was essential to protect the equal **rights** of another.

* The doubts that have arisen are legal, technical matters and the Government feels that  Mr Justice  Fox's **rights** should not be left in any doubt.

* The position was quite clear under the 1977 Act in relation to his original term of appointment and the amendments will merely put beyond question that those **rights** continue to apply, and have continued to apply, in relation to the extensions of his term that have already taken place and to any future extension that may be approved by the Governor-General.

* -The violation of the natural **rights** of people, wherever it happens, is something to be deplored.

* They get special **rights** because they are students.

* There are those, of course, who say that because they have special **rights** then the community has a right to impose special obligations upon them.

* So I am trying to highlight the difficulties that the whole system imposes, the continuing contradiction between values, human **rights** and the power of the State and the mystiques that have developed around the national service system.

* In doing so, however, the **rights** of members of unions and employer organisations must be fully protected.

* 1 ) A contract in restraint of trade or commerce that was made before the commencement of this sub-section is unenforceable in so far as it confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation.

* The price of a high detection rate would be dear, if in  its  place we had to endure an arbitrary police force, with unrestricted **rights** of interrogation and arrest.

* On the balance of the evidence available we have tended to put the **rights** of property too far ahead of the fundamental **rights** of human beings in a society which essentially should be constructive and should operate to serve the needs and the aspirations of human beings.

* what his economic or social standing is, or whatever differentiation there is about him, if he is a human being on the face of this earth he is important and we should be concerned about him above property **rights**.

* He is an individual, he has special problems, and he should attract certain fundamental **rights** and certain recognition of his special problems in our  society.

* At the same time, in answer to the argument that the States should perform these duties or that it is a deprivation of States' **rights** for the Grants Commission to perform these duties, it needs to be remembered also that State Ministers have the right to approach the Grants Commission- their approaches are welcomed by the Commission- in respect of any submission or application that has been made by a local government unit in their State.

* Section 10 of that Act provides, in effect, that all persons regardless of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, have equal **rights** in law, notwithstanding that a law, or part of a law, of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory might provide to the contrary.

* The next matter I want to refer to concerns the provisions of the Act which relate to what might be deemed the **rights** of the individual against an injustice which could be perpetrated by a denial of natural justice.

* The decisions which have now been made by the Government in this area, following decisions made in the last three years, have restored the legal system to a position where one's legal **rights** are related directly to one 's capacity to meet the cost.

* They will have no opportunity to take the necessary legal action which would enable them to obtain their legal **rights** from the financial institutions and those who, as part of their normal business practice- I say that quite clearly- defend unethical and sometimes illegal practices by forcing the maximum and excessive use of the courts so as to raise the cost of challenging those practices beyond what the ordinary person can reasonably risk in case he loses the legal point.

* Such **rights** are considered basic to any people working in any area of the Public Service.

* Therein lies danger, not only for innocent people 's **rights**, but for democracy itself.

* Perhaps best of all, the expression of his attitude to freedom and his attitude to the **rights** and wrongs of society appears in a paper he delivered on the role of dissent in a free society, again in September 1971 when, as Attorney-General for the Commonwealth, he said: 
But in a free society individual freedoms belong to all and not to the few.

* The exercise of the power to dissent should never be allowed where it operates to deny the equal **rights** of others.

* This goes a long way towards informing the average citizen of his **rights** to the additional benefits to which he is entitled.

* In fact the whole area of technology will be further explored between the two countries and I have put in hand the possibility of some special technological and science agreement, particularly a technological agreement, with China to protect the patent **rights** of Australian manufacturers and suppliers should they enter arrangements with China.

* 1 ) and (2) The Government was committed to recognise the **rights** of Aborigines to the lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory' and gave effect to that commitment by the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.

* Our attitude in relation to sovereign **rights** over the continental shelf is somewhat different from that of our predecessors in office.

* Over the last two and a half years we have discussed land **rights** and the formation of Aboriginal councils.

* It was decided that the Indians ought to have their **rights** in the land preserved.

* That would include land **rights** and all manner of things.

* The whole battle in this Parliament for land **rights** for the Aboriginal people has been accepted by both sides of the Parliament.

* We would not have passed the Northern Territory land **rights** legislation if that were not so.

* We would not have established select and standing committees on land **rights**.

* When I concluded my statement I enumerated a series of points of principle which ought to be adopted to protect the **rights** of these people.

* The Bill makes provision for protecting the **rights** of former South Australian Railways employees who are transferred to the Australian National Railways Commission.

* The main provisions in this Bill relate to the superannuation and compensation **rights** of former South Australian Railways employees.

* They believe that they are paying for **rights** of retirement in the Public Service that so exceed those that they themselves are so-called enjoying that - 
I am becoming very curious about this business.

* If we have sovereign **rights** in the area about which we are talking we have sovereign **rights** over all things, oil and minerals, and 1 am pleased to see that the honourable member for Farrer is nodding approvingly at what I am saying.

* It is a forum within which everybody's sovereign **rights** will be protected.

* Yet it is to change those sovereign **rights** that I see some of the consequences flowing from this amendment.

* It is a very grave infraction of basic civil **rights** as the law stands at the moment and it is a much more grave infraction of the legal authority of the Narcotics Bureau to function.

* But until it was provided there could be no justification at all for such illegal incursions taking place- incursions which took place in circumstances about which we know nothing and which may have been a very serious infringement of the basic **rights** of perfectly honest people going about legitimate activity.

* These, with existing provisions of the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928-1969, the Superannuation Act 1922-1971, and the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act 1943-1968, will preserve or improve existing **rights**, and terms and conditions of service, of the present locally engaged High Commission staff who, at present, will all continue in employment.

* The clause preserves existing **rights** under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928-1969 of persons who have such **rights** by virtue of having been officers of the Public Service immediately before they became officers under the High Commissioner (United Kingdom) Act.

* Consequently, the Council requested that the Minister- and I emphasise this point- try to negotiate with the Queensland Government on behalf of the Yarrabah Council a form of land tenure for Yarrabah Community Council similar to that legislated for Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory with the addition of timber **rights**.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  has noted from a statement that I made to the House some time ago that the Commonwealth is committed, as it has been committed in the past, to obtaining for Aboriginal communities in Australia the right of selfmanagement, and with it a form of land tenure which in particular would secure for them their traditional, **rights** and the usage of their traditional lands.

* Of course it is well known that by an Act of this Parliament land **rights** by means of a particular form of land tenure were granted to Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory over which at that time the Commonwealth had exclusive constitutional control.

* It is well known to this House that both self-management and land tenure were achieved by the Commonwealth for the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island under an Act of the Queensland Parliament, but one which specifically entrenched the **rights** of the Aboriginal people in those two communities.

* I think a government which in the future sought to take away from those two communities the entrenched **rights** which they have achieved under that legislation would be a government which threw fear and caution to the wind.

* However, I can inform the House and I can positively inform members of the Yarrabah Council, through this House, that the twin **rights** which my colleague is seeking to negotiate on their behalf, as requested by them in January, are to obtain self-management of their community and their reserve lands.

* The States have constitutional **rights** and jurisdiction within their own territories.

* My understanding of Press reports is that the ABC will no longer be broadcasting television coverage of the Olympic Games and that if it is to give any television coverage of the Games, the Commission will have to buy it off one of the private companies which has purchased the broadcasting and television **rights**.

* The actions of this Minister in refusing to intervene significantly, despite a range of requests, to defend the **rights** of the Aboriginal people in this area is a national calamity and disgrace.

* Of course, the State of Queensland has sovereign **rights** which must be observed and acknowledged by this Parliament.

* If the Government believes in law anil order, surely once a law has been ruled to be invalid there is no obligation on people to obey it and they are within their constitutional **rights** in not paying the tax.

* I stress that these amendments are not aimed at curtailing the **rights** or the autonomy of universities.

* Australians must retain absolute control of their own sou, their own **rights** and their own future.

* There have been comments and criticisms on particular items of the legislation, on the consequences and the provisions relating to individual **rights** in particular, and the Minister himself has acknowledged that.

* There were very few **rights** for employees.

* However, whilst that implies that trade unions and trade unionists have **rights** protected by the law, it also implies that they have responsibilities and obligations.

* So a need exists to protect individual **rights**.

* I refer to the **rights** of individuals to disagree with the actions which their union executive has determined the union should take.

* This points up the fact that, because of the size of unions and their involvement in an increasing range of non-industrial areas, individual **rights** can be in jeopardy and they need further protection than is provided under existing legislation.

* I am concerned that the Government must legislate in the area of individual **rights**.

* I have already outlined one area in which I believe individual **rights** demonstrably have been curtailed.

* All Australians who were concerned to ensure that there was a development in our industrial legislation to provide for the assertion of the public interest and the protection of individual **rights**, and who wanted to see that achieved without massive industrial dislocation, will be pleased with the agreement that has been reached and which the Government is bringing into this House today in the form of amendments to the legislation before us.

* We have come far beyond the point where anyone can pretend that the denial of **rights** to minorities, or of basic **rights** to majorities, is not a matter of international concern.

* He said that the owner does not have any **rights**.

* The clause deems the  Chairman  to have resigned on the last day of the Authority's existence thus safeguarding his **rights** as a public servant.

* Work done by teachers at this level is important to the future success at higher levels of schools, and greater support is necessary not only from the Federal Government but from State governments which also must recognise the **rights** of our young children to pre-school training.

* same statutory **rights** as other Aboriginal people to freely enter any land in the Territory under pastoral lease and take game and use natural waters on such lands.

* If the changes are made, will the present **rights** and privileges be retained to protect the non-official postmaster, and will his duties remain the same?

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* He tried to draw a parallel which it is impossible to draw by saying that the House of Representatives and the Senate should enjoy the same **rights** and privileges.

* Australia has reciprocal **rights** with Garuda - the Indonesian airline - to operate services twice a week between Djakarta and Sydney with occasional landings at Den Pasar.

* I believe the thought is being given to reciprocal air **rights** in this direction.

* Clause 43 deals with family provisions, the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage, the need to give the widest possible protection and asistance to the family, the need to protect the **rights** of children and the means available for assisting parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation.

* The criticisms made by the honourable member for Gellibrand indicate that he, and I assume other honourable members opposite, have not read the Minister's statement, which was a balanced statement with an eye to reasonable administrative efficiencies and carefully considered safeguards for human **rights** and dignity.

* There has been a progressive deterioration of our **rights** and our tendency to protect our **rights**.

* We must realise that the right of the House to exercise an effective control over the public purse is as precious as any of the **rights** we so often defend.

* In accordance with the Government's policies, it provides that the powers of the Council should be used in ways which will 'respect, uphold and promote the **rights** of artists to untrammelled freedom in the practice of their arts.'

* I am rising tonight to protest at the deliberate attacks that have been made by this Government on the interests and **rights** of country people.

* But Aborigines throughout Australia received voting **rights** at different times.

* For instance, they received voting **rights** in Queensland only in recent years.

* I do not hesitate to line myself up with those who object to the denial of human **rights** involved in such a situation.

* The people of Australia will not back this sort of denial of the **rights** of the ordinary Australian to see and to absorb what he wishes.

* The question of minerals and mineral **rights** in areas in which Aboriginals are living would be put at issue.

* The Commonwealth and the States would fight for years over what they saw as their respective **rights**.

* Particular provisions are to be amended to give to individuals **rights**  vis-a-vis  their trade union and the trade union movement generally.

* So when we come to the companies Act and company ordinances we do not see honourable members opposite balking at the proposition that the **rights** of minority shareholders ought to be protected  vis-a-vis  the company or the board of directors.

* In other words, what is all right in legislation dealing with other organisations is not all right when dealing with a monopoly organisation in the form of a trade union in which individuals have no **rights**.

* Yet in relation to other people in the community, other organisations and bodies where minority and individual **rights** are involved, honourable members wish and ask and by past performance legislated for harsh penalties.

* But when we wish to treat all people equally honourable members opposite seek to deny those same **rights** to individuals.

* Worker participation in the fruits of expansion are recognised as a right and certain tax concessions and social concessions are available to the companies for their participation which does not interfere in the **rights** of management in the decisions of development of the company involved.

* In 20 months the Australian Labor Party has behaved like an octopus spreading its tentacles to clamp down on the freedoms that have been our **rights** as Australian citizens.

* In the meantime it is important that the union members involved should be aware of their **rights**.

* But, in addition, members who are fined or disciplined under the union rules have **rights** under section 140 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which provides, amongst other things, that rules of organisations shall not hinder members from observing the provisions of an award.

* It will also provide for full disclosure of relevant information to incoming franchisees, **rights** for franchisees to continuation of supplies, without discrimination in the event of any shortage, and **rights** of assignment of their franchises.

* The Government has consistently deplored denials of civil liberties and violations of human **rights** wherever they have occurred, and it will continue to do so.

* It is our earnest hope as a government that in the interests of peace, stability and, indeed, economic and social development in that country as well as in neighbouring countries this apparent campaign of brutality and repression will be checked and that the exercise of all basic human **rights** will be restored swiftly to all Ugandans.

* Questions of human **rights**, especially in regard to southern Africa, will continue to seek the centre stage at the United Nations and elsewhere.

* There are a number of other situations on the continent, especially in the Horn of Africa, where the **rights** of minorities are not being protected adequately and where significant interest is not being shown either by the members of the Organisation of African Unity or of the United Nations in these matters because of their unwillingness to interfere in each other's affairs.

* Being faced with an application from these people, knowing their long standing **rights** and knowing the relatively stringent conditions which the Queensland Government was imposing I was faced with the situation as to what I ought reasonably and fairly to do.

* On 21 August it was announced that  Mr Allahbux  Brohi, a Karachi lawyer, had agreed to act as counsel with full **rights** of defence.

* I believe that there can be an effective relationship between our 2 countries provided that Papua New Guinea does not grant **rights** that are too easily won, or should I say that do not involve reasonable conditions and restraints on those who might want to go into ventures that the Government of Papua New Guinea may propose or that others may propose to it.

* However, as I stated in this House on 11 February 1975, I regard the Senate's rejection of the provisions in the Bill relating to the supervision of health insurance organisations as representing a severe setback in the attempt by this Parliament to establish the protection of people's **rights**.

* Accordingly, there is a bounden duty incumbent upon the Australian Government to ensure the protection of the community's **rights** in the operation of those funds.

* The first is that the **rights** of the widow will be  protected.

* Has the Government stressed how divisive it would be in our region if the United States blocked the admission of Vietnam in the way she for so long blocked the restoration of membership **rights** to the People 's Republic of China?

* It abrogates the **rights** of workers to decent standards of industrial life.

* It will vest in the Commission functions under other Acts, such as the Racial Discrimination Act, relating to human **rights**.

* At an international level, human **rights** issues have been and continue to be of great significance to Australia.

* On the domestic level, human **rights** questions are obviously of concern to the whole of Australia.

* Both the Commonwealth and the States have their own areas of interest and it is important that there should be collaboration and co-ordination if human **rights** activities are to be carried out in the most effective manner.

* It is important that the human **rights** which Australians enjoy should be defined in such a way by the respective governments that the people in each State and Territory have substantially the same **rights**.

* I do not suggest that identical laws need to be formulated but a basic aim which we should have in this area is to ensure that the human **rights** enjoyed by all Australians are substantially the same.

* One fundamental issue which has arisen in this area is whether the protection of human **rights** should be by way of a Bill of Rights.

* It is extremely doubtful whether the confusion and friction which this would produce is justified in the public interest particularly if there are other methods available of protecting human **rights**.

* Furthermore I believe it is fundamental in a democracy that our basic human **rights** should be defined by Parliament and not by judges.

* What is needed in a community such as ours is a basic commitment to human **rights**.

* The forces that intrude on basic human **rights** can of course be the very forces that serve the individual in other respects- the Public Service, large corporations, trade unions and the like.

* The Government is committed to preserving human **rights** in this country.

* It does however believe that there should be administrative machinery, such as that involved in the establishment of a Human Rights Commission, through which our commitment to human **rights** can be demonstrated and constantly pursued.

* In the Government's view, there should be a case by case approach to human **rights**.

* This approach would deal with areas where human **rights** in Australia are not basically recognised or which need clarification or codification or would deal with instances where it is demonstrated by the complaints of individuals that existing laws or practices fail to observe basic human **rights**.

* It is clear, I think, from the provisions of Article 2 of the Covenant that, while States Parties must provide effective and enforceable remedies for violations of **rights** recognised by the International Covenant, appropriate measures, other than legislative measures, may be taken.

* Moreover, the debates in the United Nations make it clear that judicial remedies are not necessarily the only remedies to be available for the protection of **rights**.

* It is also important to bear in mind that there are a number of mechanisms, safeguards and procedures, both general and specific, direct and indirect, that have important implications and influences on the provision of remedies for human **rights** of an administrative or executive character.

* The safeguards involved in Australia 's system of representative and responsible government, the independence of the judiciary and the procedures adopted by our courts, the freedom of the Press and the possibility of parliamentary or ministerial investigation or other inquiry are important factors in the maintenance of human **rights** in this country.

* These are examples of the pressures that exist within our society to ensure that infringements of human **rights** are provided with a remedy.

* In addition, increasing attention is being given to the inclusion in legislation of qualifications and safeguards, where possibilities of intrusions into human **rights** may arise.

* Clause 3 of the Bill defines 'human **rights**' to mean **rights** and freedoms recognised in the International Covenant or in any other relevant international instrument specified by the Minister.

* The main functions of the Commission will be as follows: The Commission will report on laws, acts and practices that may be inconsistent with the International Covenant and on laws that should be enacted or other action that should be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to human **rights**.

* When requested to do so by the Minister, the Commission is to report on action that needs to be taken by Australia in order to comply with the provisions of the International Covenant or any other international agreement relating to human **rights** specified by the Minister.

* The Commission is also to have functions relating to the promotion of human **rights** and the coordination of programs of education and research undertaken by the Commonwealth.

* It provides that the Commission is to inquire into and report on an act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to the **rights** and freedoms recognised in the International Covenant when a complaint in writing is made by an individual to the Commission, when the Commission is requested to do so by the Minister or when it appears to the Commission to be desirable to do so.

* For example, where an investigation takes place on complaint by an individual it may be thought desirable to vest in the Commission conciliation functions in respect of alleged infringements of the **rights** recognised in the International Covenant.

* The procedures will establish a yardstick against which intrusion into basic **rights** can be measured, but will at the same time preserve the parliamentary role of determining matters of policy and settling the content of the law.

* The Bill will thus evidence the commitment of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament to the introduction of practical measures for the maintenance and promotion of basic human **rights**.

* One of the matters which I hope will be discussed is whether a declaration of human **rights** based on the Covenant and the principles already embedded in our common law could be drawn up for adoption by all governments and parliaments in the Commonwealth and whether, based on such a declaration, a system to enforce human **rights** can be established in every State and Territory of the Commonwealth.

* Mr Deputy Speaker, the espousal of human **rights** can have a very hollow ring about it especially in the mouths of people like politicians, social scientists and would-be demagogues.

* It is very easy and a great satisfaction to the individual and community conscience to make lofty speeches and engage in spirited demonstrations about human **rights**.

* What is difficult is the pursuit of those **rights** for the benefit of the individuals for whom they are intended.

* The squatters, feeling they had made their stand for human **rights**, for principle, then moved on leaving these people to fend for themselves.

* Bill Crews, Director of the Wayside Chapel's crisis centre, has written this: 
It is time the hollowness of much that it proclaimed in the cause of human **rights** is once more exposed.

* What these people need is not the empty proclamation of human **rights** by radical squatters but the care of a society and individuals in it committed to the practical application of those **rights**.

* The problem of our time is not our incapacity to proclaim or understand basic human **rights**.

* It is surely obvious to the most reluctant conservative that the winds of change are blowing in the trees in every field of human endeavour, challenging us all to a fresh appreciation and a stronger devotion to basic human **rights**.

* I might say by way of preface that my right and qualification and all the **rights** of the Opposition in relation to this measure have been challenged by members on the Government side and by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair).

* The Bill ignores State and individual **rights**.

* The Authority will be able to disregard completely State mining legislation and the existing **rights** acquired under it by private citizens.

* It will have power to interfere with exploration or mining activities already being lawfully carried out to the extent necessary for the reasonable exercise of the **rights** and performance of the duties of the Authority.

* This Bill further asserts powers that conflict with the **rights** and the laws of the States.

* I believe that it is time that this House began to assert some **rights**.

* I refer to the human **rights** legislation which says that everybody must by free to do what they want, and if they are not free to do what they want the Government will go to court and ask the court to decide whether they ought to be free to do it.

* I wonder what would have been the consequences for  Senator Murphy  if we had had the human **rights** legislation on the statute books before he invaded ASIO.

* Arising from the Government's decision to appoint a judge to head the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, this Bill ensures that such an appointment of a judge does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other **rights** and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office.

* Section 13 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973, for example, enables a judge to be appointed as a commissioner and retain his judicial status and the **rights** which attach to that status.

* The provision in this legislation which gives the ex-serviceman the same **rights** as would be available to him if he resided in Australia, as I have said before is to be commended, for this in some small part shows that the ex-serviceman is recognised for the service that he gave to this country and that this service is appreciated.

* Of course the use of statutory drawing **rights** may be the alternative.

* Not only that, but also when they get down to basic electoral matters they want to abuse the **rights** of the electors of Murray by offering a $1,000 bribe to the 
The emergence of Portuguese Timor from this 4 centuries of colonial vassalage presents something of a challenge to Australia.

* Australia cannot therefore connive at the denial of these **rights** to the Timorese people.

* Will the Minister now accept that many of the accusations levelled against Israel at international conferences regarding its practices in occupied territories should not be regarded so much as human **rights** issues but as Middle East issues, recognising that Israel has been subjected to hostilities on a continuing basis for many years from neighbouring countries?

* Any honourable member who genuinely believes that the power of the Executive should be restricted or who believes in the **rights** of individuals should stand firm and say that this proposed new section 57 ( 1) has within it an incentive for poison pen letters, tittle tattle, hearsay and backstabbing attacks on members of the Public Service.

* I do not quarrel with the principle of the **rights** of a Prime Minister and leaders of a government to travel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations  of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the Australian people through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences.

* What are the accepted principles which ensure the **rights** to individual privacy are preserved.

* Perhaps the start of the liberating influence was at the end of the seventeenth century when John Locke proclaimed the right of the individual to his person and to his property and proclaimed the role of government to be limited to protecting those **rights**.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* As a matter of fact it is further government interference with the **rights** of the individual and it would, in the end, create a condition that would cost the individual or the taxpayer more.

* Honourable members will observe in  Mr Cope  a gentleman who has the highest regard for the Parliament and its **rights** as well as for the **rights** of honourable members who sit in the Parliament.

* We do not mind whether it be in this Parliament or outside the Parliament, whether it be in the parks or in halls or in any forum, our position on electoral reform, our position on the **rights** of voters, our position on the **rights** of citizens and civil liberties, stand head and shoulders above anything that honourable members opposite have stood for since Federation under whatever given name they took to themselves in that period.

* There are some who occasionally make criticisms about the work both here and in the Senate, but I assure honourable members in this chamber and I assure those people that the House is here now and will be here always as the guardian of the **rights** of the people of this nation.

* In 1968 he, along with the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, finally gained full voting **rights**.

* The fact that 3,500 men then stood to lose their jobs could only have obscured, in the public mind, whatever justification the State might have been able to offer as part of its stand on the protection of States' **rights**.

* I would be much more impressed if members of this Parliament had been equally concerned to protect their **rights** in this sort of situation.

* Our amendment will cover the civil and criminal **rights** and liabilities of persons purported to be arrested on 20th and 23rd July under the ordinance which was not operative at that time.

* a law conferring the power to make determinations by way of the ascertainment of **rights** or obligations conferred or imposed on persons by law; or 
freed and discharged from any restriction, dedication or reservation made by or under any enactment (not being an interest to which sub-section (6) applies), to the intent that the legal estate in the interest, and all **rights** and powers incident to that estate or conferred by the  Lands Acquisition Act  1955 in relation to that estate, are vested in the Commonwealth.

* External affairs, defence in some aspects at least, and customs tariffs are obvious cases, but others might need to be added, such as coinage and legal tender as well as, of course, the major matters of Aboriginal land **rights**, uranium and related matters.

* In other words, what the Labor Party is seeking to do is to have elected to the Senate people who will not be given the same opportunity to express a point of view as other senators because they are to be constricted in their voting **rights**.

* Some people believe that it should stay out of the area of what are deemed to be State **rights**.

* State **rights** position; but the reality surely is, as was put by the honourable member for Deakin, the honourable member for Griffith and the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  on the Opposition side, that much needs to be done to improve the situation.

* Those who are supporters of States **rights**, like the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  forget in their hysteria clause 41, which requires the government of the day to try to reach agreement with the States to have the States set up their family courts.

* Another example is that Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd has had **rights** to fly into Melbourne since 1963 and has never taken up its option.

* Jat- Jugoslav Airlines has had **rights** to fly into Melbourne and has never taken up its option.

* There would be a lot of interference with the mail and with the human and civil **rights** to which people are entitled.

* Under this legislation these **rights** can be infringed on the basis that people at some stage in the future might be likely to commit violent action.

* When he does not deserve it, we will stand up for our **rights**,  Mr Speaker,  in just the same way as  I  indicated to you this morning we would stand up for our **rights** when you are in the Chair.

* -The first point I make is that since it took over the functions of the old Arbitration Inspectorate, the Industrial Relations Bureau, as part of its normal day-to-day ongoing functions, has been carrying out thousands of inspections of a routine kind, and has been giving advice to companies, individual employers, unions and unionists on their **rights** in relation to industrial legislation, the observance of organisations ' rules and things of that kind.

* Again, in the Patents Act, the administration of which has now passed to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the provision made in section 129 of the Act for the vesting of **rights** in respect of certain inventions and patents in the AttorneyGeneral has been changed so that the **rights** will be vested in the Commonwealth, thus avoiding any need for change in the future should ministerial responsibility for the Act change.

* It would appear that if it is possible for the Irish to negotiate in this manner on landing **rights**, it should be possible for us to take a stand on safety.

* These powers would include **rights** of entry and inspection for consistency of product or animal against contract specifications, **rights** to take samples for purposes of analysis, and recommending a method by which disputes relating to product standards arising between overseas buyers and Australian suppliers could be settled.

* To my mind in the final analysis politics is about people and the **rights** of people.

* There should be a definition which does not allow people who have never been to the Territory to go there and claim **rights** from people who were born and bred there or who have lived there for many years.

* It could cause great strife among traditional Aborigines when the matter of sacred sites or traditional land **rights** is dealt with.

* It follows the last answer which he gave during this Question Time when he gave a noble and impartial display of concern about abuse of civil **rights** in Czechoslovakia.

* However, would he extend that noble and impartial declaration to other areas, such as areas within our own region, and condemn the quite nasty abuses of civil **rights** which have been documented in a number of reports such as those from Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists in relation to countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, as well as many other countries which are in our region but are a little further away?

* My Government will submit to the Parliament a number of measures designed to reform the laws under which Australians live and to protect the **rights** of all Australians under those laws.

* The Australian Government is convinced that the High Court of Australia must become the final court in all matters pertaining to Australia and to the legal **rights** and obligations of its citizens.

* My Government has accepted in principle the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission and following consultation with Northern Territory Aboriginals will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land **rights** to these Australians.

* It should be our effort to see that we are tutored by them and that we do not have to go back and fight for the right for those **rights** to prevail.

* Every newspaper editor in this country is on trial, because one must remember the great occasions in the past when men and women fought for great **rights**.

* Has this country lost its capacity to get indignant about a proceeding in camera when a man's **rights** and his reputation can be put at risk?

* We are beckoned here today not merely to adjudicate on the **rights** or wrongs, whether real or imaginary, of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister.

* Anybody who pretends that by giving the Aboriginal people equal drinking **rights** with us we are benefiting them is, I think, ignoring the facts of life.

* Anybody who thinks that by giving them equal **rights** in social services with the white people we will automatically improve their position is ignoring the facts of life.

* We should guarantee in all circumstances an opportunity for the preservation of the **rights** of the unborn because the law recognises the **rights** of the unborn.

* All too often we hear about States **rights** and Federal **rights** in this area and community needs.

* Social responsibility does not mean **rights** in the hands of some people; it means that the privilege about which I speak is available.

* The honourable member for Burke made a passionate plea about entrenched **rights** and the infringement of entrenched **rights** by this proposed section.

* Has his attention been drawn to assertions in that document that (a) the economic downturn has been used to justify the cutting of expenditure and the breaking of election promises, (b) land **rights** are an urgent issue of national justice, (c) mining in Arnhem Land could be as destructive of societies and produce the same long-term effects as the dispossession in the rest of the continent, (d) even more threatened are communities in Western Australia and Queensland who have neither land **rights** nor the Northern Territory Act's protection, (e) if contracting parties are too unequal, consent does not guarantee justice and the rule of free agreement remains subservient to natural law, (f) traditional owners are opposed to Ranger mining but feel oppositon is futile, (g) many government institutions apply assimilationist pressures, and (h) predators grant liquor licences against the objections of community leaders and Councils.

* He will know that after newspaper articles and parliamentary questions which showed that electoral officers had given incorrect advice to ctizens of Commonwealth countries, particularly Cyprus and Malta, on their voting **rights** in Australia, the Chief Electoral Officer sent a circular to all divisional returning officers saying that Commonwealth nationals who have resided in Australia for six months are eligible to be enrolled as voters.

* Will the Chief Australian Electoral Officer take further steps by notices and advertisements to inform Commonwealth nationals of their **rights** and duties in Australia?

* Just as that process is unacceptable to the Liberal Premier of Victoria and to almost every other State Premier, it ought to be thoroughly unacceptable to all those members of this Parliament, particularly the so-called small '1' liberals, who continually harp about State **rights**, but when it comes to a situation of allowing this Minister and this Government to override those **rights** in a very real way they are not prepared to speak on behalf of the States.

* One has, at the same time, to ensure that the **rights** or corporate bodies and the **rights** of individuals are properly safeguarded.

* The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill will ensure that the appointment of a judge as Director-General of Security does not affect his tenure of office as a judge, or the salary, allowances and other **rights** and privileges that he has by virtue of his judicial office.

* Section 13 of the Law Reform Commission Act 1973 similarly enables a judge to be appointed as a Commissioner and to retain his judicial status and the **rights** which attach to that status.

* Is the Opposition to be criticised for contending that lands vested in the States or the Commonwealth should be retained for public purposes and that private **rights** to such land should be limited to leasehold?

* The Government does not have to dictate anything to the States, which have sovereign **rights**.

* The Bill provides also that a permanent officer can receive pay while on such leave only if she has accrued leave owing to her on account of sick leave, furlough leave or recreation leave **rights**.

* It is important to note that the Commission's report recommends that future development **rights** should from a base date be reserved to the Crown; that is, to the public.

* If the Australian Government accepts the recommendation of the Commission that future development **rights** be reserved to the public, I propose to recommend to Cabinet that the base date be the date of presentation of this report to the Parliament, that is, 4 December 1973, or at the very least that the relevant legislation provide for transactions to be investigated back to that date to prevent any artificial inflation of prices.

* I said that if the Government were honest in its proclaimed view- that is, of supporting States' **rights**- it would postpone this legislation while it had the discussions that have been sought.

* As a general comment I think the clause will still as presently drafted create some serious practical difficulties so far as it affects companies' **rights** and capacities to raise funds on the open market.

* Companies making a **rights** issue, for example, have to register the prospectus with the Commission as required by this legislation, and the possibility of an extended delay due to the fact that sub-clause (3) requires the Commission to investigate and satisfy itself that the requirements have been comphed with will make it very difficult for companies to pitch the terms of the issue to meet the requirements of the Commission.

* At the end of the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, in a very moving statement he said: 'It is time somebody stood up in defence of the **rights** of the ordinary people of Australia'.

* When has the Labor Party stood up for the **rights** of the ordinary people of Australia in the last seven years?

* All members of this Parliament will be fully aware of my longstanding concern for the welfare of the people of East Timor, not merely because of Australia's debt of gratitude to them for their stalwart and loyal support in the dark days of World War II, but because I believe, and all Australians believe, in the sanctity of basic human **rights**, including self-determination and, of course, all of us would be concerned about the threat to Australia's integrity and national security posed by the continuation of major military action involving all forms of conventional warfare in an area that is less than half an hour flying time from Darwin.

* I believe that we are trespassing into an area in which the Parliament, instead of being prohibitive, inhibitive and restrictive, ought to be protecting people's **rights** as my friend from the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  and my friend from Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  said.

* We should not be trying to restrict those **rights**.

* I think one of the saddest things about the campaign for Aboriginal **rights** has been the emphasis which so many professional Aborigines have put on drinking **rights**.

* At the same time, in the process, it would want to be quite certain that it protected the **rights** of all Australians, obviously including the Torres Strait Islander-the right to their traditional way of life, to the islands that they inhabit, to the seas that they fish and to the way that they live.

* Each Bill establishes a commission service which will have **rights** equivalent to those of the Public Service in relation to retirement, promotion, superannuation and so on.

* Has the honourable member heard of the factors in our law which protect the **rights** of the individual?

* Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Lalor suggests it is impossible to introduce a police state in this country because we do have protection of the **rights** of personal freedom emanating from wrongful detention.

* The right of public assembly means that people may meet together so long as they do not infringe the laws designed to ensure public order and the recognition of the **rights** of others.

* It cannot be argued that people in this country have no **rights** because they are not written into a constitution, for what that is worth.

* Our **rights** are in fact something that we can exercise day by day by way of actions for damages.

* I think that the special drawing **rights** were an improvement.

* Over centuries we have designed the way in which parliamentary business should be handled, particularly matters which determine people's **rights** and freedoms, so I do not think that we ought to do this.

* It is interesting to note the patent **rights** that are applied for and granted on the discovery of drugs.

* One could perhaps not object if it were going to be regularised as from now, but the fact that it has been made retrospective means that there will be a denial of **rights**, particularly in Western Australia, to a constituent who established those **rights**, I would think, by taking action in the High Court.

* Has the Government investigated these instances of intolerance and has it examined the lease given to King Ranch in the light of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation?

* Finally, what does the Government intend to do to enforce a proper respect for the **rights** of Aborigines at Lake Nash and to restore the credibility of its Aboriginal Affairs policy which has been sadly tarnished by its neglect of the intolerant attitudes of King Ranch?

* Let us have none of the absurd nonsense that was used for so many years to justify the Vietnam commitment - that we were fighting for the **rights** of a people to have a choice in the form of government it wished.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* I am not sure whether the question infringes  Mr Burchett's  **rights**.

* Will he restore the **rights** of Queensland students and save the needless cost and delay of this intermediary system by allowing schools approved by regional authorities to borrow direct from the library?

* An amendment to the existing legislation would give organisations with existing **rights** 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels.

* The omission of sub-section (3) of section 6 of the principal act is consequential upon clause S. 
In general, the intention is that the deficiency payment will be paid along with the proceeds of the wool and there will be the same legal **rights** in the deficiency payment as in the sale proceeds unless there is a separate agreement between a producer and a creditor covering the direction of a deficiency payment.

* Accordingly it is necessary for the legislation to provide who is to get the payment and what are the **rights** of persons for the payments.

* We hear a lot from Government supporters about State **rights**.

* As the guardian of immigrant children, the Federal Minister for Social Security has the same **rights**, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian.

* However, I would take up the point he made about the support for the **rights** of the people by the Queensland Government.

* He insisted at all times that the **rights** of the people must be protected.

* We have not only some **rights** but also some responsibilities.

* 1 ) do all in its power to inform the Australian people as to the extent to which civil, political, social and religious **rights** continue to exist in South Vietnam, 
What airlines were granted charter flight **rights**.

* Pakistan, a Commonwealth country, has deprived the people under its jurisdiction of the ordinary democratic **rights** to which people in Commonwealth countries ordinarily are accustomed.

* And that thisis an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* The 10 000 Islanders would strongly oppose any agreement or solution which does not continue to recognise and preserve their status as Australians and Queenslanders, their islands as Australian territory, and their traditional fishing **rights** in the waters of Torres Strait.

* Equally, the traditional fishing **rights** of the coastal Papuans must also be preserved.

* The honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  made the very important point that in today's society the Government and the community should be turning their attention to the **rights** of the less privileged people in the community.

* I think that the community as a whole has accepted the fact that there is a great responsibility on all our shoulders to ensure that the less advantaged people in the community are given their **rights** by both governments and the community.

* Most honourable members would agree with me that, in respect of the duties imposed upon us, the member for Wills has the same responsibilities, duties and **rights** to carry into legislation the aspirations of his constituents as the Right honourable member for Wannon  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the honourable member for Corangamite  (Mr Street).

* Having regard to the above, it is realistic to say that contributors, who may or may not have voting **rights** in the election of boards of management, can be regarded as the owners' of the registered benefits organisations, to the extent of their benefit entitlements under the rules of the particular organisation and the fact that under the provisions of the National Health Act dealing with the winding up of a medical and/or hospital fund, the Federal Court is required to make such order as it considers to be most advantageous for the' interests of the contributors '.

* Equality of political **rights** is inherent in any truly democratic system and these **rights** must be safeguarded by the legislature.

* Are officers whose duties involve the keeping or handling of personal records obliged, upon request of the person concerned, to inform that person (a) what records are held on him or her, (b) the purposes for which such records are kept and (c) of any **rights** of access and amendment.

* Surely, if we have a completely democratic approach to any problem, the citizens have their **rights**.

* We do not own this forum just to decide, here and for all time, the **rights** in respect of the codes about which we are talking or the **rights** of citizens.

* They could go off to a State court, but if they have to find a federal court to deal with the matter- it could be only the High Court- it would be a most expensive one and one which is likely to prevent them from exercising any of their normal judicial **rights**.

* It is normal drafting, based fairly and squarely on what we would expect to find in any normal legislation creating the **rights** of enforcement and remedies.

* has effect in relation to nuclear activities to the extent that the order is necessary or convenient for carrying out the obligations of the Commonwealth under, or the exercise by the Commonwealth of **rights** under, agreements or arrangements between Australia and other countries, agreements or arrangements between Australia and international organisations or decisions of international organisations; and 
The principle of payments from the Grants Commission will be the same as now applies to the States, that is, it will enable the local governments, if they undertake reasonable revenue raising efforts themselves, to provide a standard of services and amenities comparable with that enjoyed by other communities elsewhere.

* However, the Liberal Party speakers at the Constitutional Convention did not seem interested in the **rights** of the people.

* They were more concerned with what they called the **rights** of State governments.

* The second part, consular protection, arises from international practice of sovereign states recognising an obligation to protect the civil and legal **rights** of their citizen when abroad.

* We must ensure that an Australian arrested overseas knows his **rights** under local law and how to obtain legal assistance if he wishes it.

* Protection services also include assistance arising from the deaths of Australians abroad, including funeral arrangements, return of remains to Australia and the protection of estates and property willed to 
If so, what action will be taken by the Government to ensure that their **rights** under section 41 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth will be protected in the event of a by-election in South Australia for a vacancy in the House of Representatives or for the next House of Representatives election.

* This was a select committee to inquire into Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Mr Speaker, you will recall that the Labor Government was anxious to upgrade the Commission, to deal not only with the **rights** of the States as to what money should be allocated to them but also with the **rights** of local government.

* They are members of the Party which, when in government, produced a statement on land **rights** on Australia Day 1972.

* That is how their pronouncement on land **rights** was received by the Aboriginal people.

* We are being asked to deny the people of South Australia their legal and just **rights**.

* The Bill reflects the Government's expectation not only that the Office will provide legal aid in significant cases affecting the **rights** of people in need but that it will also contribute to community awareness on matters of **rights** and obligations, community education and assist the process of law reform.

* We favour an early return to peaceful development and deplore breaches of human **rights**, terrorism and atrocities wherever they occur.

* However, I do not believe that it would assist the process of an early return to peaceful development in Cambodia if we were to withdraw our recognition of the Cambodian Government The reports from Cambodia are accounts of almost total deprivation of human **rights** and dignity.

* No distinction is being made in this legislation between the **rights** or entitlements of small and large manufacturers.

* No less ardent a defender of State **rights** than the Premier of Queensland has exposed the central flaw in the new federalism.

* However the States considered the Minister's attitude to evicting people from their homes as against the **rights** of the people of Australia.

* Development of the concept that people have **rights** which deserve no less protection than property has also been a radical approach brought by this Government, radical only in that it conflicts hard with the conservative line of the previous Government The promises which have been made have been either carried out or will be carried out.

* Electoral reform has been promised on 2 broad grounds - equality of voting **rights** for all our citizens and the need to disclose funds and to say from where the money is coming.

* He has the experience to speak on these definitions with great clarity because he was one of the leading figures in the land **rights** case in 1970.

* In this answer I do not want to argue the **rights** or wrongs of the matter.

* So far as the hypothetical situation of a decision under our own guidelines is concerned, I would mention that these guidelines will be subject to clear enunciation in - 
The Government has sought to protect the **rights** of individuals in relation the cancellation or suspension of licences by providing the qualifications in clause 7.

* At the same time, it considers that those provisions are necessary for proper management of the fisheries and for protecting the **rights** of law-abiding fishermen.

* Accordingly I would suggest to people who genuinely want to know the details about Medibank, its operations, and their **rights** and entitlements under this scheme, that they ought to go right to the horse 's mouth.

* All people have equal democratic **rights** and they should be treated accordingly in electoral redistribution.

* If one's long term view of the **rights** and position of Parliament is dependent on whether or not at the time one has a majority, Parliament itself has no real role to play.

* The Opposition, as a matter of tactics, has moved a vote of censure and has been loud in its demand foi State **rights**.

* Therefore, it is almost a comedy to hear members of the Labor Party standing up and supporting State **rights**.

* 4593 and (b) adheres to its obligations under land **rights** law.

* The nub of the problem is that the community does not agree on precisely what so-called **rights**' should be accorded to a woman and the foetus she might be carrying.

* The problems are far more complex than that Association acknowledges and the foetal **rights** it claims have never been recognised by law in that simple manner.

* 1 would ask that the Prime Minister should use another form of communication by himself to the 6 State Premiers asking them to expedite the legislation which all of them have promised to give votes and adult **rights** to men and women at.

* I think that one of the important factors in relation to the law of the land is the **rights** of the individual.

* As the  Deputy  Leader of my party, the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  said, our allegiance to the Crown exists not because of our association with the United Kingdom but because of our individual **rights** as Australians.

* I must say that I was grieved somewhat by the cavalier fashion in which the previous House of Representatives was prepared to vacate what I think are its historic **rights** because of a chance difference in the political constitution of the upper House as against the lower.

* -I believe that this House has to defend its **rights** as a House.

* Our Government suffered continual harassment in another place, not about the **rights** of the States or anything else but simply because of the political numbers the then Opposition could not get its way in this place but was able occasionally to combine its numbers to get its way in another place.

* Arbitration is something that is entered into voluntarily by 2 parties who are in conflict as to their effective proprietary **rights** or obligations, where they agree in fact to bypass normal legal procedures, where they agree in fact to submit to an umpire and to accept his verdict.

* Particularly as a Liberal I would urge him to do so because I believe that we, as a Liberal Government, should support the **rights** of individuals to have their opportunities expanded to undertake a career of their choice.

* The honourable gentleman will have noticed the high proportion of migrants among the dead and injured, and I trust he will recall that I have had 3 questions on the notice paper, one for more than 6 months - longer than all but 9 of the questions still on notice for him from the honourable member for Hindmarsh - about the **rights** of overseas dependants of workers killed or injured in industrial accidents.

* I ask the honourable gentleman: What are the  **rights** of the overseas dependants of the victims in this case?

* I have no other contribution to make than to say that the Chief Australian Electoral Officer becomes a Permanent Head with all the **rights** of a Permanent Head.

* The **rights** of the officers themselves, who are transferred, are protected.

* If so, were the New Guinean and European workers told of their common law **rights** to sue for damages.

* By any standards they are now entitled to be regarded as adults and to be given the **rights** and privileges as well as the duties and responsibilities which adulthood entails.

* There is a growing recognition of the need to accord these young adults the **rights** they are entitled to have.

* There is only one thing to do in the question of land **rights** and that is get on with it.

* I expect that the first battles were joined around the Yirrkala people and their **rights** to their land back in 1963.

* The right honourable member will be aware that it is the policy of this Government that public servants should have the maximum possible freedom to exercise the social and political **rights** enjoyed by other citizens.

* If so, is it also a fact that every Australian citizen is entitled to the same **rights** in the election of his or her government?

* If so, will the Prime Minister state whether consideration has been given to sending military forces north to ensure that Queenslanders enjoy the same **rights** as the South Vietnamese, having regard to the attempt by the Country Party Premier of Queensland to introduce in that State the greatest electoral gerrymander in the world?

* He made the point tonight that honourable members on this side of the House are opposed to this clause of the Bill and demand that an individual ought to have further **rights** in regard to a charge and the right to be tried by his peers.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* We are talking about public **rights**, not privileges, which have been consolidated by Government legislation for these private health organisations.

* Look at domestic reforms: The public lending right, insurance deposits, Aboriginal land **rights**, Aboriginal councils and associations, the maritime college, the family allowances and the simultaneous elections referendum.

* That overseas interest in oil from coal is substantial is indicated by the current activity of international oil companies seeking **rights** to the black coal deposits in Australia.

* As a matter of principle however, the Australian delegation will press for international recognition of Australia's flag **rights**.

* The Australian Labor Party knows where truth and justice lies in South Africa in assisting the blacks to economic security and political enfranchisement and dignity to where they can exercise their human **rights**.

* More than any other piece of legislation that has come into this Parliament over the course of the past 20 years, this Bill will change fundamentally the **rights** of every individual Australian.

* We seek this because we believe that we cannot fundamentally change the **rights** of the Australian citizenry without permitting those who are the elected representatives of those Australian citizens to deliberate adequately upon the measures which are provided in this Bill.

* I believe that every honourable member on the Government side, if he is honest to himself and honest to the charge which his electoral **rights** bestow upon him, would also support it.

* Notes the initiatives undertaken by its Acting  President  with regard to respect for the fundamental **rights** and liberties of Greek parliamentarians and citizens and for the re-establishment of parliamentary democracy in Greece; 5.

* It has had removed from it **rights** which people's houses, including the House of Commons, have had for 700 years.

* First, takeovers covered by the 1972 policy measures, that is, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral **rights**.

* These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting **rights** attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to broad representation **rights** and **rights** to participate in the management or profits of a business.

* This opposition was clearly stated by representatives of Northern Territory Aboriginals during the Woodward inquiry on Aboriginal land **rights** and again during the Fox inquiry on the Ranger project.

* In the light of his recent promises, will the Minister inform the House when the Government proposes to introduce the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation?

* In relation to the three areas- the **rights** of individual trade unionists, the authority and reach of the Industrial Relations Bureau and demarcation disputes in particular- the changes enormously strengthen industrial law.

* One can be excused for advancing the argument that this Commission is another 2-pronged attack on the constitutional **rights** of the States and private enterprise.

* He was justifying State **rights**.

* So far as we are concerned it is important that the general principle of **rights** to land not be confined simply to those that happen to be reserves at this particular moment.

* Our committee met all Monday to examine these - 
The Opposition believes that there are already adequate safeguards for individual **rights** in court procedures.

* The matter we are now debating deeply concerns the **rights** of this Parliament.

* The honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner)  - colleague and friend of us all - is a man who has constantly stood up for the **rights** of this Parliament.

* An that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Whilst the explanatory memorandum is fairly specific in pointing out that the purpose of this amending clause is to preserve the **rights** of those users of South Australian rail to any advantages that they were enjoying with freights at the time of the transfer, I draw the attention of the 
 1 address my question to the Minister for the Interior.

* Following upon my correspondence with him regarding the **rights** of 18 to 20-year-old persons to vote in Federal elections under section 41 of the Constitution, what is the reason for the Government's refusal to allow 18 to 20-year-old persons to vote in Federal elections in States where they have the right to vote for their State parliaments?

* At this time it has no aircraft organised and no traffic **rights**.

* But even the most starry-eyed and optimistic traveller would grant that this  is  difficult when Fiji had advised that no traffic **rights** will be granted.

* I am sick and tired of the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  using her sanctimonious approach about the people's **rights** and how her socialist Government has a mandate.

* People's **rights** are better protected when the people themselves are involved, particularly in policies for their own welfare.

* If that is called a States' **rights** or a centralist argument, so be it.

* 223 I gave certain details of the powers of officers, the **rights** of persons detained for search in accordance with the provisions of Section 196 of the Customs Act, and the procedures followed in relation to these matters.

* The honourable member said that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly has an unhappy record, but it introduced legislation granting land **rights** to Aboriginals long before this Parliament ever did.

* It is quite clear that in the 1950s and 1960s and in the early 1970s attitudes in Australia towards land and towards Aboriginal **rights** for land had a way of being quickly ventilated in the United Nations.

* Of course there is an exquisite difficulty and that difficulty is in representing 2 cultures and in synchronising the **rights** of those 2 cultures.

* A recognition of legitimate **rights** to land, not by European tradition but by Aboriginal tradition, are enshrined in this legislation.

* The final paragraph of this Press statement states: -If Calder and Kilgariff have any courage then their campaign on behalf of rnining and pastoral interests will cause them to vote against the land **rights** bill.

* The Northern Territory is moving towards Statehood and it would be ludicrous to deny the Territory legitimate **rights** of legislation in areas which, it is understood, would be controlled by the Territory.

* The Australian Government has not made any formal protest to the Spanish Government concerning these matters, but its strong opposition to any deprivation of basic human **rights** and fundamental freedoms is well known.

* He will be aware that the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts said in answer to a question on Aboriginal land **rights** addressed to him on 9th November by the honourable member for Prospect that the matter was one for an announcement by the Prime Minister.

* Will the Prime Minister therefore say whether the council of Ministers he established in May to inquire into land **rights** reached a decision on this matter some weeks ago?

* Of course, there must be proper Executive power to any Government, but our British, our English idea, in a special sense, has always been a system of balanced **rights** and divided authority, with many other persons and organised bodies having to be considered besides the Government of the day and the officials they employ .

* We also welcome the recognition in the Camp David agreements of the legitimate **rights** of the Palestinian people, including their right to participate in the determination of their own future.

* The Bill as I have indicated before deals with traditional land **rights**.

* I hope that this short contribution tonight will be recognised as one in which a member of this Parliament is speaking out not only for the **rights** of the individuals but also for the **rights** of a nation.

* I think it was Sombart who said that the state is a unity in which the individual has no **rights** but only duties.

* It is rather strange to hear members of the Opposition who belong to a party which attempts at all times to push on the individual the views that that particular party holds- 
-I ask the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts whether the Council of Ministers established by the Prime Minister in May to inquire into Aboriginal land **rights** reached a decision on this matter some weeks ago.

* When the Minister told the Leader of the Opposition on 27th October that the Council was still examining the question of land **rights**, did he mean that its original recommendation had been referred for reconsideration?

* 1 )  Mr Justice  Woodward, in his second report, concluded that 'the Aboriginal people themselves must be fully consulted about all steps proposed to be taken' in relation to land **rights**, even though this would involve some delays.

* I agreed with this conclusion and accordingly deferred the introduction of land **rights** legislation until I had had an opportunity to consult personally with Aboriginals.

* The Opposition takes the view that the **rights** of individuals, which are so fundamentally touched by any method of telephone tapping, as it is commonly known, by any method of telecommunications interception, ought ideally to be within the responsibility of the Government's first law officer; that is, the Attorney-General.

* Matters which affect the individual **rights** of citizens are matters which ought to fall within the province of the Attorney-General.

* This question affects fundamentally the **rights** of citizens.

* We believe that a matter affecting the **rights** and privacy of individuals ought to be under the control of the principal law officer of the Government, and we are unenthusiastic about the Government deciding to effect this transfer.

* The other significant aspect with which I want to deal is the question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* This Government through legal tricks amended the Labor Party's draft land **rights** legislation to override the Aboriginal right to veto mining on Aboriginal land.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* If they are given to the Opposition next Wednesday to be debated next Thursday I think that would be a substantial denial of the **rights** of the Opposition because - 
The ABC's inability to obtain **rights** to permit television coverage of the matches would no doubt have caused disappointment to soccer followers in Australia.

* The ABC was disappointed also that its negotiations for television **rights** were unsuccessful.

* Honourable members have been deprived of their **rights** to ask questions.

* It wants the **rights** of honourable members to be recognised.

* I ask the Minister for External Affairs whether Australia's representatives at the United Nations are continuing to express our concern for the millions of people in Europe and elsewhere, who, through ruthless and oppressive Communist action, have been deprived of their basic human **rights** completely against the principles of the United Nations Charter.

* This arrangement of Special Drawing Rights is not a cloak cup- board affair like the ordinary drawing **rights** of the Fund where no more comes out than is put in.

* Yes, on the same grounds as my colleague the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Simon)  which related to the attendance at the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which is investigating human **rights** in Russia.

* The Leader of the Country Party knows his **rights** and, if he has been misrepresented, he can follow that course after question time.

* Existing documentation, for example the Board's General Orders includes information on the **rights** of staff.

* 1 ) What is the extent of compliance with the provisions of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders ( Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 that an Aboriginal or Islander shall not be convicted of an offence by a court established for a Reserve unless the Aboriginal or Islander, if convicted of the offence, would have the same right or **rights** of appeal against, or review of, the conviction as he would have if a Magistrates Court established under the law of Queensland had jurisdiction with respect to the offence and he were convicted of the offence by the Magistrates  Court.

* I want to say quite clearly now that I consider the processes of this Parliament, its right to the proper scrutiny of legislation and the duty of its membership to examine every piece of legislation which affects the **rights** and freedoms of citizens as much more important than defeating Westinghouse.

* There have been no offers and I am not aware of any overtures by Honeywell or any other foreign company for the acquisition of **rights** to the Mulloka system.

* What disadvantage of international significance would occur if sovereign **rights** to the off-shore minerals and other aspects of controls required to regulate fishing, navigation, pollution and all the other '**rights**' - I place the word in inverted commas - were invested in the States and the Commonwealth as full and equal partners, as against the proposal to pass legislation which will put Commonwealth and State relations on a masterservant basis?

* In the exercise of the **rights** referred to in subsection (1), the Commission and the Minister shall have regard to the interests of persons who are the owners or occupiers of land through or past which waters from the Googong Dam area flow, and shall not act in a manner that interferes with the exercise and enjoyment by such persons of **rights** expressed to be conferred on them by or under a law of the State of New South Wales except to such an extent as is reasonably necessary for the purpose of - 
This Bill to amend the Trade  Union  Training Authority Act 1975 is the result of the Government's nearly total lack of understanding of the nature and aims of the Australian trade union movement.

* Because of that lack of understanding the Government has been led into this misguided assault on the **rights** of the trade union movement to manage its own affairs.

* Let me, as a trade unionist with some 23 years experience, stress that any dedicated unionist would see the purpose of trade union training as a means of improving his or her ability to fight for the **rights** of the people whom he or she represents, not as a means of creating a better or a smoother industrial relations situation for the benefit of the employers.

* It would deny the traditional right of Australians to choose their own home sites and it would deny the personal **rights** of Australians which they have always exerted in these areas.

* The Opposition has mentioned that it is anxious to preserve the **rights** and privileges of members.

* The **rights** of people who wish to see members also should be preserved.

* Have we not reached the stage where, in effect, we are finding excuses for the rapist and forgetting the **rights** of the raped?

* I merely observe thatI hope the House will take note of the priority of its **rights** in this matter.

* I have taken this opportunity merely to repeat what I think are the significant and important **rights** in this House in relation to money Bills.

* at what point in terms of time does he consider a migrant has really, contributed to the prosperity and progress of Australia and has qualified for portable pension **rights**.

* Has the Minister for the Interior conferred recently with representatives of the Vestey company regarding its offer of land **rights** to the Gurindji people?

* If the Minister has conferred with representatives of Vesteys may we look forward to an early announcement in the House that land **rights** will be granted to the Gurindji people?

* Why trench upon basic **rights** further?

* Why trench upon **rights** in that fashion?

* if, in his opinion, the name- 
All along we have recognised that the results of the extravagance of our predecessors could not be put to **rights** within 6 months.

* One central element in putting things to **rights** must be the restoration of budgetary responsibility through rigorous restraint on expenditures.

* If so, what action can he take to preserve the growers' legal contractural **rights**.

* Hitherto the strength of the combined force of those who are so concerned, so justifiably concerned - teachers and parents, educationists - has been dissipated by futile and sterile arguments about the twin shibboleths of Stare aid and State **rights**.

* In other words, we are concerned not only with the **rights** of people, but in this case also with the **rights** of members of Parliament.

* In the name of morality they do not have the right to go around Australia saying that they are the upholders of the **rights** of individuals in this country.

* Mr Adrian Parmeter, a United States authority on land **rights** matters, has given advice to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and to my Department on aboriginal land **rights**.

* The Government would obviously take no action to prevent any member exercising his **rights** in the correct way in accordance with the Standing Orders.

* I must say to you that we would hope that in this coming parliamentary period you will be able to see that this is a volatile place, that people, on occasion, will want to defend their **rights** as strongly as they know how, and that you,  Mr Speaker,  have a responsibility to ensure that every member of this House has his **rights** assured through your agency.

* I might mention that if the right honourable member for Bruce is to protect the **rights** of individual members of this House he should cease making the very heavy imposition that he has made on the research services of the Parliamentary Library, especially the legal research service.

* Government to introduce legislation to give the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island land **rights** in accordance with the principles already established for Aboriginals in the Northern Territory?

* Finally, did any discussion take place on the land **rights** question during the recent meeting with the Premier of Queensland?

* I heard one honourable member in this chamber defending the **rights** of certain railway employees to take certain action.

* Under this proposed legislation they could be dismissed instantly, with loss of all **rights**, for taking that action.

* The Government's policy towards the entry of refugees is governed by its obligations as a party to the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees and its acknowledgement that as a member of the international community it must accept a share of responsibility in refugee and quasi-refugee situations which often involve personal danger and loss of human dignity, basic **rights** and means of livelihood.

* If a group designed to protect the **rights** of patients was formed, would solicited donations for such a group be tax deductible?

* Under the present law, a partly secured creditor has in relation to the unsecured portion of his debt the same **rights** as any other unsecured creditor.

* A fully secured creditor can, at present, exercise all his **rights** under his security, or alternatively, surrender his security for the benefit of creditors generally and proceed as if he were an unsecured creditor.

* The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  who will be speaking next in the debate, led the van in demanding that Aborigines have grog **rights** when he was the  Deputy Chairman  of the parliamentary committee concerned with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.

* Can the Prime Minister yet say whether local government is to be represented at the coming constitutional convention with full voting **rights**?

* Does it remain his view that the Australian Government should not be represented at the convention unless voting **rights** are given to local government?

* We have been inundated with people suggesting that their **rights** are going to be infringed and all the evidence points strongly to that fact.

* The right honourable member for Lowe has said, and all of us who have been in government know, that mistakes are made on many occasions and they can affect the **rights** of people.

* Everybody in the country could improve on this legislation from the point of view of his **rights**.

* Is it a fact that  Mr Dracup  is acting within his **rights** by not joining the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union?

* Is there anything that the Minister can do to see that this man's **rights** as an individual will be safeguarded?

* The Board 's views on the **rights** of public servants to comment on public issues are set out in Chapter 4 of the Guidelines on Official Conduct of Commonwealth Public Servants.

* Part of the reason for this Bill is the need to reassure the public that their **rights** are being protected.

* Because development **rights** ensue from government action, it is the community generally and not individual land holders who should reap the benefits accruing from such **rights**.

* Will he take some substantive action in this case to support his statement to the United Nations General Assembly of September 1977 that Australia takes human **rights** seriously and without action talking of human **rights** is wasted.

* We have a very bad Government in Western Australia when it comes to the question of human **rights**.

* The issue for this national Parliament is to look at its responsibilities in respect of legislation to protect the **rights** of Australian citizens.

* If such legislation is allowed to persist in this country which means that people can be incarcerated or fined simply because they have expressed their democratic **rights** it will lead to a very fascist-like domination of the trade union movement and many other movements.

* In this particular case the people involved held a meeting to discuss the **rights** of their fellow trade unionists, an action which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act well encourages.

* It is wrong in law and it is important that the Australian people, the trade unionists and particularly the people of Western Australia know that the laws in Western Australia contradict the principles of human **rights** and the principles upon which the laws of public assembly should be based.

* Article 19 of the covenant clearly states: 
It is essential that this be done not only because of present industrial matters in Western Australia but also because it would help in Queensland in regard to street marches, and it would help in Western Australia from the point of view of Aborigines having equal voting **rights**.

* The Prime Minister should also state that, on the basis of ordinary democratic **rights**, they are entitled to hold a meeting and should not be refused those **rights** because somebody grabs hold of a law and says: Look, you have to get permission but we will not give you permission; so if there is a meeting, you will be arrested'.

* It has come to light because there has been a connivance and collusion between the Premier and the Government of Western Australia and the Police Commissioner to deny Australians their **rights**.

* I claim to have been misrepresented and I take the point that it is within my **rights** to state the extent to which I have been misrepresented.

* The total direct cost, excluding overheads, of televising the recent 7 Test Cricket Matches was $205,180, of which $58,000 was for the total cost of the **rights** to telecast the matches; $141,652 for  the  cost of relaying the matches through interstate lines provided by my Department; and $5,528 for the cost of fees, fares and travelling allowances for commentators and programme staff.

* If a person can say of anyone, 'I heard him call someone a so and so Kraut' or whatever might be insulting to some other person, if it is reported to the Commissioner and proceedings are instituted, the person who is accused has no **rights** at all.

* You talk a lot about freedom of speech and the **rights** of individuals, but you are taking away from the members on this side the right to express an opinion on why you have put a means test on pensioners over seventy.

* I issue this threat: If we do sit through, I will see that every rule is pulled out of the Standing Orders in order to frustrate this Government in its efforts to take away the **rights** of members on this side of the House, the members of the House of Representatives, who truly and properly represent the people of Australia.

* The Government recognises the previous Government's commitment to preserve trie existing long service leave **rights** of persons who were recruited from the private funds to the Health Insurance Commission.

* For the information of honourable members  I  present a statement on the Government's actions and attitudes on human **rights** which  I  made yesterday on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* In addition to his assistance in actual court proceedings, the Public Solicitor advises indigenous persons generally as to their legal **rights** and obligations and as to ways and means of enforcing their legal **rights**.

* Was the Minister correctly reported in the recent publication of the Australian League of Rights as suggesting that communists were behind the agitation for Aboriginal land **rights**?

* The statement of the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts  (Mr Howson)  deals with Aboriginal land **rights** alone.

* However, before I proceed to speak about that, 
Both side were agreed on the need for any settlement to take account of the legitmate **rights** of the Palestinian people, and of the right of all states in the area to exist within secure and recognised boundaries'.

* Is it a fact that there are known cases where persons who are not Aborigines have obtained prospecting **rights** over large areas of Aboriginal Reserves and subsequently sub-let these **rights** to others.

* All these **rights** can be vetoed by a white manager who has nothing in common with the Aboriginal people, who is not chosen or employed by them, and cannot be sacked by them.

* Not only is there a lack of self-determination in the matter of where Aboriginals are entitled to live or with whom they can communicate, but also there are many other human **rights** denied Aboriginals in Queensland.

* The need for this House to uphold the principle of human **rights** and freedom for all people and accordingly to condemn any nation which denies human **rights** to its people or to any individual.

* The **rights** for Mulloka have not been sold or leased to any foreign power.

* Any application for such **rights** will be judged on its merits by the Government.

* The Government's failure to fulfil its obligations to protect the human **rights** and the right to self-determination of Aborigines in Queensland.

* The Government's failure to fulfil its obligations to protect the human **rights** and the right to self-determination of Aborigines in Queensland.

* When I was a member of the select committee which inquired into Aboriginal voting **rights**, one expert after another from the Attorney-General's Department in Darwin or anywhere else said: 'You cannot devise a tribal title'.

* When the report on voting **rights** for Aborigines was being debated in this chamber I did not believe that the first thing that should happen to Aborigines was that drinking **rights** should be extended to them.

* The first **rights** which they were given by the Commonwealth and the States were fornication **rights**, so that it was no longer a crime for a white man to cohabit with an Aboriginal woman.

* Then they were given drinking **rights** and voting **rights**.

* 107 and that the Aboriginal land **rights** claim is adversely affected as a result.

* If so, what are the terms of the communication, and has the League requested the United Nations to intercede in the question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Which of the Australian States have agreed to give effect to the Convention and in what manner has such agreement affected the Aboriginal land **rights** claim.

* Clause 6 (c) refers to the Australian coastal sea and clause 6(d) states: for purposes related to the **rights** (including sovereign **rights**) and obligations of Australia in relation to the continental shelf of Australia; 
Obviously those objectives are designed to take whatever benefit can be obtained from the **rights** of the Commonwealth, whatever they may be, in relation to the territorial sea and the continental shelf.

* Clause 6 (e) states:  for facilitating the carrying out by Australia of obligations under, or the exercise by Australia of **rights** under, agreements between Australia and other countries; 
The final paragraph I am referring to here now, because of time, is in section 128 -  in view of the language of the early part of the section it can hardly be questioned that that paragraph may itself be altered or eliminated so that what would be necessary to deprive a State of the **rights** there mentioned, would be to hold one referendum in order to alter the paragraph, and after a proper interval, a second referendum in order to alter the relevant section of the Constitution.

* There are in fact to be many other changes to the rules that can affect individual members and the **rights** of individual members of a union.

* Again it is an indication of a lack of regard for the **rights** of individual members of a particular organisation.

* The Government has been able to send and commit servicemen to war at hs discretion but when it comes to the question of providing for those servicemen their basic **rights** and entitlements the Government always shirks its responsibilities.

* In fact, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  straightened it out when he said that the resolution condemned the onslaught against human **rights** by any authoritarian or totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of the Left or the Right.

* The proposal in clause 9 enabling beneficiaries under the Act to decide whether to insure their homes with the Corporation or with another insurer is, of course, subject to the Corporation retaining the normal **rights** of a mortgagee.

* I challenge him to show the type of leadership that Joh BjelkePetersen claims he does not have, to show it by calling upon the Queensland Premier and the  Deputy  Premier, either publicly if he has the courage or at least privately, to protect the **rights** of the people of Brisbane and to preserve the style of democracy which exists in the city of Brisbane for the citizens of Queensland.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority, and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* But before a person subscribes he will know exactly what he is doing, exactly what he is buying, exactly what his **rights** are and exactly what he can do with the stock.

* We have seen the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy)  wanting an FBItype political police force for himself, and now tonight we have the last straw from the last bastion of democracy that I thought we had in this place, the Minister for Services and Property, who when on this side of the House used to make great speeches about the **rights** of individual members of Parliament.

* I commend the non-smokers **rights** movement for trying to mobilise that 70 per cent of Australia's population which does not smoke but which suffers because of the 30 per cent which does.

* By virtue of payment of these charges, operators of aircraft are entitled to use those areas of land within the boundaries of Commonwealth aerodromes which are available for the landing, take off and surface movement of aircraft other than those apron areas which are provided and maintained by individual operators for their own aircraft by virtue of arrangements made with the Department granting such an operator exclusive **rights** in respect of those areas.

* He had certain salvage **rights** and the question of insurance and many other things were involved.

* It is true that we made comments about the restrictions of **rights** in relation to a Bill, particularly in relation to those matters which the honourable member mentioned.

* It violates a very basic principle that I regard as being of paramount importance, the basic principle of human **rights**, of personal freedom, the right of the individual to privacy in personal matters.

* The honourable member for Dawson referred in more general form to the **rights** of mortgagees.

* The Bill that we dealt with a few moments ago does not interfere with the legal **rights** of mortgagees.

* In other words, I am putting strongly and forcibly- I again get back to the amendment proposed at the second reading stage- that there is an interference with a person 's **rights** if he cannot have on his passport what he reasonably wants to have on it.

* I think the principle of human **rights** should be accepted in this situation but not to protect white collar criminals.

* How does the present national service scheme fit in with the **rights** of individuals in accordance with the Constitution?

* I would add one more thing concerning this aspect of the Bill because the honourable member for Melbourne has drawn in a number of other arguments in support of his attack upon the appeal **rights**.

* What this legislation provides is a more extensive range of appeal **rights** to staff affected by redeployment or retirement and, furthermore, sets out more clearly the framework within which decisions are to be taken by the Public Service Board or a permanent head.

* I think that comment, in itself, is a measure of the completeness and the adequacy of the provisions of this Bill and in particular, the completeness and adequacy of the appeal **rights** in this legislation but which are absent in the existing provisions of the Public Service Act.

* What **rights** are to be given to a person who is charged with or has been found guilty of misconduct for something that is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, improper?

* Should the Commissioner decline to issue a tax clearance certificate he is to advise the applicant accordingly and the applicant will have **rights** of formal objection against this refusal.

* In short, there will be **rights** to independent review of the Commissioner's decisions under this Bill, as is the case under other legislation administered by the Commissioner.

* In considering the legislation it also needs to be borne in mind that most non-bank financial institutions are already subject to supervision under State or territory laws which deal primarily with the **rights** of borrowers and lenders and the financial stability of companies.

* It pretends to uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, yet many member nations pay no regard to the human **rights** of the 14 million Nationalist Chinese on Taiwan.

* I take it that the honourable gentleman is referring to the main resolution on the **rights** of the Palestinians on which a vote was taken on 2 1 November.

* In his speech, the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations,  Sir Laurence  Mclntyre, emphasised Australia's adherence to resolution 242 as the only basis for lasting peace in the Middle East, reaffirmed our strong desire that Israel's **rights**, as well as the **rights** of other States in the area to continued existence within recognised and secure boundaries be acknowledged by all parties to the dispute and declared our preparedness to accept the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, provided this is what the Palestinians wanted.

* On the other hand when the same set of rules and the same arguments are advanced by the trade union movement to obtain compulsory unionism or preference to unionists in order that all workers in a particular trade or calling equally share the cost of obtaining the best possible wages and conditions Government supporters completely disregard the principle that they have legislated for in the rural sector and raise the hackneyed cry of conscience and the **rights** of the individual.

* It is important for the **rights** of the individual to be seen and preserved.

* Individually elected Liberal Party members in choosing the present Prime Minister as their Leader were exercising the **rights** and privileges accorded to them by their electors, and it is utter poppycock to deny them these **rights** when so much is said of the necessity for parliamentarians to assert their **rights** within this place.

* This is the policy which, within the ambit of the memories of most members of this House, led, in the immediate post-war years, to the denial of the **rights** of the individual and the removal of the opportunity for progress which the change of government in 1949 brought to this country.

* The function of law  is  to regulate the **rights** of citizens between and among themselves and their relationship to the State - that is to say, to the State in its corporate sense.

* If we are going to determine our law by prejudice, by instinct, by volition, or by spontaneous response, then, as the great Edmund Burke reminds us, we will finish in disaster because man cannot enjoy the **rights** of a civil and an uncivil society together.

* A man or woman goes to court to have his or her **rights** litigated or responsibilities settled, not to have some dry jurisdictional problem settled.

* I assure honourable members that there would not have been an Australian Parliament if the fathers of our Constitution had not agreed to a 2-House parliamentary system, with the second House ensuring that the **rights** of the small States are protected.

* As one who comes from a small State, I am thankful that we have a Senate whose job is to protect the **rights** of the people in the State from whence I come.

* We also wanted to amend another Bill, which dealt with Aboriginal land **rights**.

* In other words, these countries do not support patent **rights** and offer drugs free of patent on the international market.

* The Australian Agricultural Council has agreed in principle to the establishment of a Plant Variety Rights Scheme under which proprietary **rights** would be granted to breeders of new varieties of plants.

* My concern is to restore to this House its **rights**, indeed its constitutional duty under section S3 of the Constitution, to initiate changes in the taxation laws.

* All present residents of Torres Strait Islands and their descendants to retain Australian citizenship and all **rights** of that citizenship.

* Rights of Movement and Access 
Whatever the views of the Australian Government about the **rights** or wrongs of the Papua New Guinea claim for an adjustment to the border, that Government- whatever its political complexion- would have been faced on the one hand by a clear demand for adjustment by the Government of Papua New Guinea and on the other by the unwillingness of the Queensland Government to accept any change.

* It has been clear from the outset that the Torres Strait Islanders shared with the Government of Queensland a general reluctance to see any change in the present location of the border, in the status and **rights** of Torres Strait Islanders as Australian citizens, but that in addition they attached great, perhaps even over-riding, importance to the protection of the total environment of the Torres Strait which they saw not merely as the basis of their livelihood but of their characteristic and independent way of life 
In discussions in January 1973 with  Mr Somare,  then Chief Minister of the Government of Papua New Guinea, I expressed quite clearly the Government's desire to resolve this issue in friendly negotiation and indicated that the Government would be most reluctant to accept a settlement of the issue which was unacceptable to Torres Strait Islanders.

* In a statement following the same discussions,  Mr Somare  also said that his Government was conscious of the existing **rights**, including land **rights**, of the Islanders and intended that these should be safeguarded in any settlement that might be reached.

* I think he was quite within his **rights**.

* It is not right for this Parliament to deprive people of **rights** which have accrued to them.

* The group will consist of experts in the relevant fields of law, computing and civil **rights**.

* While his dedication to the protection of the **rights** of the citizen and the attainment by eligible persons of their entitlements under the law must be indubitable, he can be no policy maker or social reformer in his own cast.

* Perhaps out of the Law of the Sea conference, which will deal with the question of the extension to 200 miles of Australia's fishing **rights**, similar circumstances might arise.

* In negotiating access **rights** and fishing **rights** we will have in mind what sort of an opportunity should be given initially to Australian fishermen and also to other sectors of the Australian economy.

* -In raising this matter of public importance the Opposition is condemning the Government for its failure to fulfil its obligations to protect the human **rights** and the right to self-determination of Aborigines in Queensland.

* The reason why we must discuss this subject as a matter of public importance is that we have not only the power to legislate in respect of Aborigines but also an international obligation to protect their **rights**.

* There is to be no discrimination in granting civil and political **rights**.

* The Premier of Queensland does not deserve any of the covenants that talk about international human, civil and political **rights**.

* There is no question of equal **rights** in Queensland.

* We have this dreadful situation of there being international covenants dealing with human and political **rights** and international covenants saying that there is to be no form of racial discrimination, and yet the Queensland Government thumbing its nose at the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs.

* These people are on the land and we will give them **rights** inferior to the **rights** of every other Australian'.

* Is it any wonder that now when we talk to people from these reserves, or to any Aboriginal from Queensland, we find that he has been denied his **rights**.

* These people now complain to us about all their fishing **rights** being interfered with, about people corning in and taking all their fish out of their rivers.

* He started to talk about the **rights** of Aborigines and about international obligations.

* The Federal submission states: 
It would now be timely to consider that legislation should vest proprietary **rights** to the reserves in the Aboriginal people themselves.

* In short, why does not the Government legislate to take control of all proprietary **rights** in Queensland on behalf of the Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islanders?

* It is a procedure which would open the way to all other sorts of interest groups demanding that their **rights** for representation should also be written into the legislation.

* Our attitude is that we will participate in an examination of the development .of a neutral reserve asset which is currently being called special drawing **rights** (modified).

* As an illustration of our attitude let me say that if the Governor of the Reserve Bank were to send to me a notice saying that we were proposing to transfer our reserve currencies into some form of special drawing **rights**, I agreed, and they were transferred over, the people of Australia would think that the Government was off its head.

* The **rights** that are available to non-Aboriginal people are also available to Aboriginal people who are in dispute about ownership.

* He must know that we have here land ownership of a highly puritanical variety which gives to the Aboriginal people uncluttered, unfettered **rights** which are almost unparalleled and which are as good as the Torrens title system that operates in several of the eastern States of Australia and any other system that operates anywhere.

* They will have **rights** as to who enters onto it.

* They will have **rights** as to its utilisation.

* In every respect we can say to the Aboriginal people in an unambiguous and unequivocal way that they have unfettered **rights** over their land in such a way that few of them would ever have believed to have been possible.

* The Constitution itself certainly gives us **rights** to deal with marriage.

* They have equal **rights**, and equal duties.

* What we want is equality of **rights** for these people.

* We respect them and they should have equality of **rights**.

* I know that the honourable member for Hughes, in calling the attention of the Chair to the state of the House, is well within his **rights**, but I did say earlier, while the honourable member was out of the chamber, that the business of the House has been frustrated today.

* -I preface my question to the Prime Minister by reminding him of the statement he made in this House on 21 Septemberthat the Government had demonstrated its commitment to the Northern Land Council under the land **rights** legislation and that the Government's policies in relation to land **rights** would be maintained and continued.

* Can he supply the House with any relevant sections of the so-called Helsinki agreement dealing with ( a) the protection of human **rights** in signatory countries and (b) any undertakings by signatories not to interfere in other countries.

* My impression is that the ordinary citizens who end up in such  a  position would have no idea of their **rights**.

* Therefore everything must be written into the legislation itself to protect their **rights**.

* It is no good the Attorney-General saying that a citizen can do this or that something else will happen; the **rights** of a citizen have to be written into the legislation.

* The Labour relations code that I referred to should be regarded as a charter of employees' **rights** in 2 respects - the **rights** of unionists vis-a-vis their own unions and the **rights** of employees vis-a-vis their employers.

* They are private members of Parliament with the **rights** that a private member of Parliament should have and with the **rights** of the Parliament that the private members of Parliament should, in turn, acknowledge.

* It will not and cannot inhibit the **rights** that any union has now.

* It will protect those **rights**.

* Can he inform me of the **rights**, if any, of such an Association to charge tourist hotels in this field?

* This covers the situation of a trust that is accumulating money from an overseas source so that the same **rights** exist in respect of trusts as exist in respect of an individual who is accumulating profits from an overseas investment.

* On the other hand there may be a point- this is the matter I have been concerned with- that under the guise of religious freedom and the exercise of religious **rights** young people are subjected to all sorts of things that brainwash and indoctrinate them in a way that is an intrusion into human **rights**.

* The facts are that, for instance, a person travelling overseas after the enactment of this Bill will be able to take his Australian pension **rights** overseas.

* We need, above all, a sense of passionate outrage if we are to end this shocking deprivation of migrant children's **rights**.

* If this Bill becomes law it will mean that existing **rights** will be defeated.

* Some members of the House often talk about the preservation of property **rights**.

* An examination of section 8c of the Acts Interpretation Act will reveal that if an Act of Parliament is repealed the existing **rights** are maintained, but for some reason that will not be the case under this Bill.

* A man or woman who, at the time this Bill becomes law, has suffered injustice for 10 years, for instance, will, immediately it becomes law, lose any **rights** he or she has at present because he or she has not taken out a petition having been concerned to maintain the marital relationship.

* We are concerned about preserving human **rights**, yet I believe that we are going to see a direct injustice in this provision.

* This Bill seeks to put on some basis of equilibrium the **rights** of the people's airline - TAA - which has been such a successful venture.

* The Government's policy on Aboriginal land **rights** has been clearly stated, particularly in my second reading speech on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and my statement of 23 August on the Government's uranium decisions.

* Will foreign airlines not presently servicing Australia be able to apply for landing **rights** provided they produce a suitable fare?

* Will agreement for these landing **rights** be handled on a government to government or airline to airline basis?

* The Government knows very well that in attacking the **rights** of school leavers it is attacking the largest single group and the fastest growing group among the unemployed.

* Has his attention been drawn to evidence of base, cruel and in some cases depraved ill treatment as well as the denial of basic **rights** to political prisoners in Greece, which was disclosed late last year in the 1,200 page report of the Human Rights Commission of the Council of Europe?

* As Ministers of his Government, especially the Minister for External Affairs, have been enunciating passionate concern for the welfare and **rights** of people in other countries, will he extend this with some consistency by now publicly condemning and denouncing the treatment of these political prisoners in Greece?

* Will the Government only apply its Aboriginal land **rights** policies to the Aborigines living in the Northern Territory, since the commission that has been set up has been instructed to consider a land **rights** policy with respect to the Northern Territory?

* Do we assume from his answer that the Government will apply the land **rights** policy not only to the Northern Territory but to all other Territories and the States, including the city of Sydney where Aborigines are living in deplorable circumstances?

* I am sure that I would have the support of my friend, the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  in saying that the Bill in no way interferes with the substantive **rights** of those who have access to the provisions of the two Acts.

* Had they not been caught - there is a totally inadequate staff of arbitration inspectors to police Federal awards, I think the Minister will acknowledge - the employees would have been deprived of their **rights** under their awards.

* There is no reason to suppose that the granting of land **rights** to the Aboriginals will have any marked effect on Aboriginal choices as to place of residence.

* In making inquiries into the manner in which land **rights** should be granted the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission will be consulting closely and carefully the needs and wishes of the Aboriginals concerned.

* 2656, and as the Government is concerned with human **rights** issues, does he consider that the case of Rudolph Hess's release from Spandau Prison is one of human **rights** being grossly deprived and therefore worthy of representation on this issue alone, even if such a representation might not be certain of success.

* Will the Prime Minister insist that similar **rights** be preserved for the Commonwealth in arbiration with doctors?

* That this House expresses its grave concern and regret that Queensland is approaching the status of a one party state, that members of the Parliament have been denied basic democratic **rights** in accordance with Westminster principles of parliamentary democracy and that Queensland Opposition members have been denied balanced facilities, resources and speaking time, and accordingly the House should initiate action designed to established a Bill of Rights describing and protecting basic political and human **rights** of all Australians - 
-I ask the Attorney-General whether it is the intention to apply to laws relating to non-Aboriginal landholders in the Northern Territory similar national interest provisions as have been announced are to be contained in the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation whereby the ownership of land and its usage can be over ridden in the national interest?

* We see in the maintenance of an association with the Monarch a preservation of the **rights** of the Australian citizen.

* It is a tremendously important problem indeed and one that will take a lot of solving because of the various **rights** over the land.

* Their land **rights** are very complicated and their land laws do not coincide with ours.

* Granting voting **rights** to these people was something that the previous government at various times, when challenged by the Labor Party in opposition to take action, mouthed support for, but that Government was never prepared to take forthright action to introduce this very necessary electoral reform.

* Without getting on to the **rights** or wrongs of a change in the boundary between Queensland and Papua New Guinea, I want to make one point on this issue this evening, and I am sure that those who have looked closely at the situation will agree with the point that I make.

* It can therefore be understood that the States have taken a keen interest in the subject of offshore **rights**.

* Article 73 of the Covenant gives limited **rights** to coastal States to pass laws to ensure the protection of their exclusive economic zone.

* Are tenancy **rights** terminated when a Member who is renting a Government home ceases to be a Minister.

* I have indicated before in this House and outside it that the Government believes it essential to protect the civil **rights** of minorities but it believes it equally essential to protect the civil **rights** of the majorities and will not permit organised minorities to go beyond the law and interfere with the **rights** of the majorities.

* But we found that the Government brought in controls on banking and instead of fighting for their **rights** the banks took the easy way out and became partners in finance companies to ensure that the profits from that area would be sufficient to pay for the costly side of banking which they were forced to conduct.

* The Government is partly to blame in this matter, and I would have been much prouder of the banks if  they had fought for their **rights** instead of allowing the government of the day to introduce legislation which controlled them and made them become impotent in regard to the monetary situation.

* The petition also requested payment of $6 billion to enable Aboriginals to achieve economic parity with other Australian citizens, and associated this claim with a claim for land **rights**.

* The Government has acknowledged Aboriginal **rights** to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and has appointed the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission to inquire into means of implementing its policy.

* The whole concept of the environmental impact statement procedure envisages that people's **rights** come first.

* Opposition members are not relieved at all in their expectations of the way in which this Bill will be implemented by the Minister telling us that the person who is roped in at the appeal is going to have the same **rights**.

* One of the **rights** that person is going to have is the right to rope in a few more people, and so it goes on.

* The  Speaker,  entrusted as he is with the responsibility of safeguarding the **rights** and traditions of the House, in my view could do well to consider instituting a process involving the Privileges Committee and of putting all these matters under examination.

* The responsibility with which the  Speaker  has been entrusted to safeguard and uphold the **rights**, dignity and traditions of this Parliament can be adequately fulfilled only if the  Speaker,  in my view, takes the course available to him and has these matters incorporated into comprehensive terms of reference for the attention of the Privileges Committee which would comprise members from both sides of the Parliament.

* It is hypocritical to claim State **rights** and then argue against the States accepting a responsibility in this sphere of education.

* Thirdly, it is hypocritical because to restore - 
adequate measures to safeguard the environment and national parks and protect Aboriginal **rights** and interests.

* The legislation does not restrict the traditional **rights** of freedom of speech or assembly or the **rights** of people to protest.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* I would suggest to the honourable member for Hotham that he not utter a reflection on the Chair regarding the **rights** of members of this House.

* The **rights** of the honourable member have been defended and he knows that his **rights** will be defended.

* If members of the Government feel that Opposition speakers in this debate have railed against some of the more unsatisfactory aspects of the Bill, it is because it appears to the Opposition that there has been an indifference on the part of the Government in drafting the provisions of this legislation to take account of some of the fundamental things, when one is dealing with civil liberties and the **rights** of the individual, which have been known to our law for many centuries.

* He made generalised allegations that members on this side of the House were not concerned about the question of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aborigines or land **rights**.

* It would also be true if he had said that some people, most of them on the Liberal side of politics, care more about promoting uranium mining or changing the Government in New South Wales, at which they are not particularly adept, or elsewhere, than they do about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It is, of course, completely within the **rights** of all honourable members to take the full 20 minutes which they are allowed to make a speech, but a continuation of the pattern established earlier this morning along those lines would lead to very great difficulty in pursuing the second reading stage of the debate as far as we would like to on this special sitting day.

* It deals with the family- the duties of a husband and wife to each other, their children and also their property **rights**.

* With some limited exceptions it is not within the **rights** of this Government to carry out What in fact it is carrying out under a cloak of censorship, thus denying to the people of Australia "the right to express proper' and adequately informed opinions on these' installations.

* Some of the State Ministers behaved almost with frenzy in their attacks, underhand and public, on the Commonwealth for trying to declare that the Commonwealth has the sovereign **rights** over these off-shore resources.

* I am not and never profess to be a lawyer, but one only has to read the evidence put forward by people whose judgment one can respect to come to the conclusion, as it would seem to me, that at no time did the States have sovereign **rights** over the off-shore resources.

* For example, the Commonwealth Government took into account a view expressed 2 years ago by the Past  President  of the International Court of Justice - that apart from inland waters, sovereign **rights** over the seabed and natural resources of the continental shelf vested exclusively in the Commonwealth from low water mark outwards.

* In the High Court judgment in the cass of Bonser v. La Macchia in August 1969 the 2 judges stated firm views that in respect of the sea bed the Commonwealth had consitutional **rights** from the low water mark.

* In the United States of America this was also allowed with respect to some States having **rights** to exploit, explore and develop oil and natural gas resources off their own coastlines.

* So far the Bill has concentrated on supporting the interests of and promoting the **rights** of travellers- and to a degree principals.

* Part LX seeks to protect the **rights** of those persons seeking approval to operate as travel agents and those persons already authorised to operate as such, by allowing them the right of appeal to a tribunal.

* I understand that under the existing Commonwealth superannuation provisions the estate of a deceased person has no **rights** to the accrued long service leave payments as opposed to the situation of persons covered by private worker's compensation.

* I would ask the Minister concerned to look at the long service leave provisions covering Commonwealth employees to ensure that persons who have established **rights** to benefits are entitled to have those **rights** met whether or not the person survives to collect them.

* If it is income earned or **rights** accrued then it must be the responsibility of the employer, in this case the Commonwealth, to meet its obligations.

* The possibility of an equitable exchange of **rights** for an Australian carrier to serve Guam for **rights** for an American carrier to serve Port Moresby was raised with the United States authorities in Washington on 10th November 1970.

* Investigations have also been undertaken to determine the feasibility of an air service between Papua New Guinea and Guam being commenced by an Australian designated carrier if, and when, the necessary traffic **rights** become available.

* As a matter of abstract principle, unions are as entitled to amalgamate as companies are to merge, either by takeover or by winding up procedures, but it should be on the same essential condition - that the individual proprietary **rights** of members are safeguarded.

* When we speak about the **rights** of employees to appeal, we are talking about individual employees only.

* He was prepared to stand up for his **rights**.

* Not only have the **rights** of the accused to be protected but the **rights** of the community must surely take some place in the judge's mind.

* We have moved a motion of dissent from your ruling not so much because we are trying to discuss the detail involved but rather the **rights** of a member in moving a motion of dissent.

* All we wanted was for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to be able to continue to speak within his **rights** in the grievance debate.

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide merely wanted to exercise his **rights** but he was not allowed to do so.

* We have no objection to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  - 
Other aspects of the scheme which require clarification relate to supposed mandatory requirements for the payment of royalties to the Commonwealth, and for the acquisition of the **rights** to grant-assisted research and development when a company decides to terminate a project.

* When he comes into this chamber it is his duty to protect the **rights** of every member in the House.

* What sums were paid by the Commonwealth in grants in the Electoral Divisions of (I) the Northern Territory, (2) Canberra, (3) Kalgoorlie, (4) Perth, (5) Swan, (6) Sturt, (7) Kingston, (8) Ballarat, (9) Bendigo, (10) Deakin, (II) McMillan, (12) Isaacs, (13) Henty, (14) Holt, (15) La Trobe, ( 16) Hotham, ( 17) Bass, ( 18) Franklin, ( 19) Braddon, (20) Wilmot (21) Denison, (22) Wide Bay, (23) Herbert, (24) Fadden, (25) Dawson, (26) Lilley, (27) Bowman, (28) Brisbane, (29) Leichhardt, (30) Calare, (31) Eden Monaro, (32) Cook, (33) Lowe, (34) Barton, (35) Macquarie, (36) St George, (37) Phillip and (38) Macarthur under the (a) Child Care Act and children's services program, (b) Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, (c) Aged Persons Hostels Act, (d) Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, (e) Homeless Persons Assistance Act, (0 State Grants (Home Care) Act, (g) delivered meals program, (h) welfare **rights** program, (j) personal care subsidy scheme and (k) Australian Assistance Plan during (i) 1975-76, (ii) 1976-77, (iii) 1977-78, (iv) 1978-79 and (v) 1 July 1979 to date.

* I thank the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Yates)  for making the point that he, like all members on the Government side of the House, can tell public servants that the Opposition would deny them the very real **rights** that will be provided to them under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Bill by way of voluntary retirement and the real protection which this Bill will give to them in contrast to the existing provisions of the Public Service Act in a case of redundancy.

* Once that becomes the practice- it appears that this Government has decided that it will be the practice- then the House itself loses control of its opportunities to fix the Standing Orders which not only protect the Government's right to govern and to have its business conducted but also affect the Parliament's right and the **rights** of members of the Parliament, including the members of the Government who passively have agreed to this change in procedure over the last few years.

* It affects the **rights** of members of the House to protect their own **rights** vis-a-vis the Standing Orders and the chamber itself.

* This Government is the first Government since I have been a member of this House and, I think, the first Government in the history of this Parliament, which has sought to impose Standing Orders on this House which have been predetermined, without taking into account the **rights** of individual members of the House to consider and make private decisions on those Standing Orders.

* The Government has predetermined that members of parliament will abrogate both their responsibilities and their **rights** as members to determine how the House will function.

* Consistent with the Government's commitment to promote respect for human **rights** as set out in international instruments such as the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement and the UN Covenants on Human Rights, the Minister has in the past expressed the Government's concern to the Soviet authorities about questions of human **rights** and will continue to do so.

* I believe that the Minister's statement as well as the publicly expressed concern of the Australian people at the treatment of  Dr Orlov  will demonstrate to the Soviet authorities the strength ofour commitment to basic human **rights**.

* Secondly, and fundamentally, it will preserve the **rights** of those presently employed in the Australian Legal Aid Office operation throughout Australia who transfer to State or Territory commissions and who may at some future time wish to transfer back into the Commonwealth Public Service.

* In the remaining time available, I wish to mention the **rights** of those people at present employed in the Australian Legal Aid Office and what will happen to them.

* Let me take him to task on one thing: 
the denial of human **rights** and civil liberties in the U.S.S.R. is of more urgent consideration than development of cultural exchanges between the U.S.S.R. and Australia.

* Both' Cabinet and a Cabinet committee have been looking at the problem of land **rights** for Australian Aborigines.

* If you said that they had to hold their elections simultaneously, you would be taking away a measure of the **rights** of senators'.

* To that proposition, I answer- and I say as strongly as I can- that there is something more important than the **rights**  of  senators; there is something more important than the **rights** of members of this great House &lt;?f ^preventatives: I refer to the **rights** of the people  of  Australia.

* I do not want to attempt to justify the **rights** or wrongs of the Rhodesian situation.

* But I do not accept the proposition put up now that anyone who opposes ZPG is in fact attacking women's **rights**.

* But on the same basis I also object to the proposition that to oppose the principle of ZPG is somehow an attack on the **rights** of women.

* The first approach was through an increase in 'unconditional' reserve assets by activating the proposal for special drawing **rights**.

* The special drawing **rights** scheme came into operation on 1st January 1970.

* Under this scheme, a total amount of$US9.5 billion in special drawing **rights** will be allocated to member countries of the Fund over the next 3 years and will constitute an addition to the first-line reserves of those countries.

* The second approach to the problem of increasing international liquidity has been that of increasing the 'conditional' reserve assets of members countries in the Fund by increasing their quotas - or ordinary drawing **rights** - with the Fund.

* But the Fund decisions on special drawing **rights** and the quota review  have done much to restore confidence in currencies and to provide a favourable climate for the readjustment process.

* In brief, for a subscription of $US41m or$A37m, returnable in the event of the winding up of the Fund, we would obtain an increase in our fund drawing **rights** of $US41m, available automatically, and of $US165m, available in case of balance of payments need.

* We have first-line reserves consisting of gold, foreign exchange, 'gold tranche' position with the Fund and special drawing **rights** of around $ A 1,400m.

* I have seen many contributions to that debate and to what Australians might have to discuss in the future and about which parts of the Constitution may have to be amended to safeguard the **rights** of this House.

* Although the Premier of Western Australia,  Mr Tonkin,  has shown some desire to retain control over the constitutional **rights** of the States, he has obviously wilted under the pressure of the centralist Government in Canberra.

* They are an attack on individual **rights** in a democratic society.

* This not only attacks the **rights** of the individual but also could stifle the development of land.

* But I see this as a back door way for the Australian Government to take over the constitutional **rights** of the State governments to control the land resources within their States.

* I believe that we must vigorously oppose legislation superimposed upon a State which threatens the **rights** of the individual and establishes the centralist control of land in the hands of Canberra.

* The fact of the matter is that, under a Labor government, Australian members of Parliament would be given the same **rights** that members of the United States Parliament have had but which so far have been denied to members of the Australian Parliament.

* and (2) In individual cases, and where appropriate, the difference is explained to the worker concerned and he is also informed that advice about his common law **rights** to damages is available from the Public Solicitor.

* The only regions to which the Government appears to be paying a little attention are the Burdekin basin, Pilbara in Western Australia, the Bowen basin in Queensland, Mount Isa in Queensland and the Kimberleys in Western Australia, and the attention paid to some of these appears to be becoming a little dulled by this Government's attitude to foreign investments and to State's **rights**.

* We should be endorsing that principle because we, as government supporters, know that the **rights** of the individual must be preserved.

* What greater **rights** can there be than for that individual to go about his business to determine his life in his own manner with a minimum of interference from anyone else.

* What we are discussing is not whether the island is to be more closely integrated into or to become a more remote part of the Australian scene, but how we can preserve the **rights** of the people of Norfolk Island, the environment of Norfolk Island and the security of Norfolk Island and still retain it as part of the Australian scene with the advantages which that bestows.

* These officers have made orders with respect to such matters as maintenance payments, property **rights** and access to children.

* The two decisions I have mentioned have made it clear that many other similar orders are of questionable validity, and it is most desirable that the doubts that at present exist in relation to the **rights** of persons affected by such orders be removed.

* These **rights** are of vital importance to the individuals affected.

* The enfor ceability of such important **rights** as these plainly cannot be left in doubt.

* The present Bill will remove the doubts that have arisen by providing that the **rights** of such persons  aTe  to be the same as they would have been if the orders had been validly made - that is, made by a judge of the supreme court.

* The effect of this provision will be that, in the case of an order that an officer of the court has purported to make in accordance with the long established practice to which I have referred, the **rights**, liabilities, obligations and status of all persons will, by force of the Act, be the same as if the purported order had been made by a judge.

* However, in the many cases to which the Bill will apply, it will provide for the **rights** of persons to be as it was intended that they should be when the purported orders were made, and will place the persons affected in the same position as they believed themselves to be in before the High Court decisions which I have mentioned.

* Foreign Students in Australia: Rights 
foreign students in Australia have full civil **rights** while in Australia; 
I take the opportunity to make a submission in this debate.

* It is that, although we gave the natives in New Guinea drinking **rights** - which I think all members of the House favour - we have overlooked the fact that in New Guinea, if not now then in the years ahead, there will be a high incidence of alcoholism, as we know exists in the European countries, and no provision is being made to create a fund by which to give treatment to the alcoholics in New Guinea when such a situation arises.

* "(4) In exercising his **rights** under sub-section (3), an Aboriginal is not entitled knowingly to disregard any reasonable requirements of the lessee of the pastoral lease in connexion with the bore waters on the land.

* "(6) A person who, without just cause, proof of which lies upon the person, prevents or obstructs, or attempts to prevent or obstruct, an Aboriginal from exercising his **rights** under this section is guilty of an offence against this section punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $1,000.".

* There will certainly be no erosion of these **rights** as a result of amalgamation.

* The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the 1 964 legislation which created the Bureau of Roads and I particularly draw honourable members' attention to the fact that in conformity with the Government's policies the **rights** of officers and employees of the Bureau will be safeguarded.

* I bring them to the attention of the House because I find it incredible that Australian citizens living in Australia and ostensibly enjoying the individual freedoms which that citizenship conveys, including the right of free association, the right of assembly and the right to practise one's religion, are having their **rights** interfered with by the consular officials of another country.

* Those Yugoslavs in Australia who wish to maintain dual citizenship **rights** can do so.

* I stress that this is not a question of backing any faction; it is one of backing human **rights**.

* We think that as fair minded small '1' liberals, honourable members opposite would understand that people have **rights**.

* By imposing the sales tax of 15 per cent on overseas gold coins, did the Government anticipate or intend any interference with the **rights** of Australian citizens to use freely gold coins minted in Australia for any purpose seen fit by the owners of those coins.

* It is in this context, and in the context of those words, that I pay tribute to the pioneering work on the subject of Aboriginal land **rights** which has been undertaken over the years by the Northern Territory legislature.

* Apparently members opposite do not know that many of the principles governing land **rights** were considered initially in the Northern Territory Legislative Council in the 1960s by people familiar with the needs and traditions of the Aboriginals, developed over many years of direct association with those people.

* I believe that it was from those debates that the first recognition of land **rights** for the Aboriginal people emerged.

* I do not believe that sufficient recognition has been given by the Opposition and critics of the responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature to the question of land **rights**, especially in earlier years when the subject was less fashionable than it is now.

* I have said many times, and quoted examples, when mining projects have impinged on Aboriginal **rights**, that the Government seems to give first priority to appeasing and co-operating with the States and to getting the consensus of the States even with a State like Queensland where the relevant Ministers are, frankly, totalitarian in these matters and have no intention of putting Aboriginal **rights** ahead of their philosophies.

* As the great  Mr Burke  wrote: 'Men cannot enjoy the **rights** of a civil and uncivil state together*.

* I believe that the Government would do a great service to all contributors if it took the trouble to explain more fully to them what it is doing and what their **rights** are.

* The new Migration and Settlement Agreement has the following principal elements: lt describes the facilities for settlement of Maltese citizens, lt records the **rights** they enjoy and the obligations they undertake in common with Australian citizens and other citizens; it affirms that Maltese citizens resident in Australia will receive social service arid health benefits which Australia provides to Australian citizens, and that both Governments will make efforts towards reaching agreement on reciprocity in payment of each other's corresponding social security benefits.

* The Agreement provides for advice to Maltese migrants on the acceptance of vocational qualifications in Australia and records that the Australian Government will endeavour to advance the acceptance of Maltese qualifications within the framework of Australian laws,' regulations and practices; the **rights** of Maltese settlers as residents and as workers are set out, and that Australia undertakes" to extend to Maltese workers and their families the facilities available in Australia ' for migrants to learn English.

* Every organisation will also contain people who, before acquiring pension **rights**, decide to quit, whether out of dissatisfaction or because of the attraction of alternative employment, or for any of dozens of other possible reasons.

* Every citizen has **rights** and every State has duties rather than **rights**.

* As governors and governments they have no **rights**.

* People who talk about State **rights** are incipient fascists.

* But the fact is that to talk about the **rights** of governments is to deny what we are here about.

* Organisations have indicated voluntarily - because the Government has not reserved any **rights** to demand this co-operation - that they will offer this information.

* I am not buying into the **rights** or wrongs of any of these people.

* I am giving the **rights** sentiment or what the honourable member might regard as the right sentiment.

* I am sure that even the honourable member who interjects would place the demands of humanity, the **rights** of people to freedom and liberty above any questions of the legality of one radio set.

* The major part of it concerns, first, the quest for dictatorial power for the Minister over the health insurance funds; secondly, matters relating to increased nursing home subsidies; thirdly, the correction of anomalies with the handicapped children payments; fourthly, the widening of the provision with respect to hearing aids to enable the supply of other surgical appliances by ministerial regulation; and, fifthly, the extension of full approval **rights** for certain friendly society dispensaries.

* The Committee recommends that in the event of the Commonwealth approving any expansion of the **rights** of contributors to friendly society dispensaries to receive rebates for national health scheme prescriptions, other organisations should also be approved to provide similar benefits at private pharmacies on payment of a similar contribution.

* It is likewise not realised that section 142 A of the Act can give to one union the exclusive **rights** of representation in industrial matters in a particular industry or part of an industry.

* It must be a system which gives **rights** also to those who do not want to join unions and who object to joining unions on the grounds of conscientious objection.

* Not only should there be some preservation of the **rights** of people who do not want to join unions but likewise there must be a recognition that people who are members of the organisation have **rights**.

* I suggest that he should look at what are the **rights** of government to intervene in industrial disputes, where government is restricted and how rigidly it is restricted.

* After all, his colleague, the  Deputy  Leader of 
As the legislation itself was a consequence of a Treasury White Paper, it was interesting to note that that White Paper showed that, in terms of foreign ownership in the oil and extractive industries, the proprietary **rights** which are owned by overseas interests amounted to 62 per cent, and yet the control exercised by those **rights** was 83 per cent - a disparity of 21 per cent on the basis of control over proprietary ownership.

* It has served notice on the people of Victoria not only in relation to the nationalisation issue, but also in relation to the question of dissidents and human **rights** for all those those within Victoria who might have come from Eastern Europe as well as members of religious communities who are not given adequate **rights** within the Soviet Union at the present time.

* The conference refused to condemn the actions of the Soviet Government on the ground that the Soviet Government knew better what was happening than the proponents of human **rights** around the world.

* On how many occasions has the Administration told a New Guinean of his or her common law **rights** to sue an employer for damages.

* The Government now upholds the **rights** of so-called conscientious objectors.

* We do not say that all the **rights** are on one side and all the wrongs are on the other side.

* The Treasurer rather blithely seems to think that yesterday was another famous victory for democracy, the **rights** of the States and so on.

* There is nothing like an impending election to flush out a little action from an otherwise tardy Government when the **rights** and entitlements of sections of the community are concerned.

* Our Government is doing the best it can to hold stable our friendship with Indonesia while supporting the **rights** of the anti-communist East Timorese to a fair and equitable recognition.

* The same erosion of established **rights** that is occurring in Queensland is going on in a more subtle way right across the nation.

* One needs to look at the amendments set out in clause 36 within the context of the whole range of measures that this Government has brought in to restrict the **rights** and freedoms of people involved in industrial action.

* Great as our legislative program has been, the Government has never curtailed or disrupted the smooth proceedings of the House or trespassed on the **rights** of members.

* I do not stand behind him on every issue, but when it comes to the **rights** of the people I believe that he has a particular gift in recognising what is going on in this country today.

* I have consistently said on this matter that Australia will meet its international obligations as determined by the Security Council, but in meeting those obligations I will not trample over the **rights** of individual Australians to participate in political matters and express a particular view about Rhodesia.

* If honourable members opposite want it bluntly, as far as I am concerned in meeting that obligation I will not jeopardise the **rights** of those people one iota.

* It may well be reasonable for such matters to be reported to the Minister and for somebody to keep an eye on the system to make sure that no civil **rights** are transgressed.

* I am one of the people who, in some ways, has doubts about absolute **rights** being vested in municipalities, particularly concerning personal, freedoms and things of that nature.

* I grant the necessity for people to be protected against infringement on their civil **rights** in situations such as this.

* Qantas may thus exercise traffic **rights** granted by the Japanese authorities to serve Port Moresby on either of these routes (and in fact does so on its present Far East service between Sydney and Tokyo via Manila and Hong Kong), and to serve Guam on the second of these routes.

* It is understood that the United States Government has not granted traffic **rights** for the Japanese designated* airline to operate services on a route beyond Guam to either Port Moresby or Sydney.

* We must take into account the effects of mining on the **rights** of Aborigines, on the environment and pollution and the **rights** of those people who work in and around the mines.

* The **rights** and interests of Aboriginals are recognised in arrangements that may be made under these proposed sub-clauses by providing that such arrangements shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of any law, including, of course, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, nor with any agreement between the Commonwealth and an Aboriginal land council.

* Those people who were ingenious enough to think of this operation in the first instance did so on the clear cut issue that they wanted some recognition by the people of Australia through their Government on land **rights**.

* That the Minister for Foreign Affairs be censured and the Prime Minister call for him to resign because of his indifference or negation of human **rights** in Australia as exemplified by his actions in the matter relating to Georgi Ermolenko, the Russian violinist who, being an adult, while in Australia subject to the full protection of Australian law made known to the Rev.

* I think one of the first things that the Minister for Supply, who stated that he had received and read a report on the proposed merger, should do is to tell the employees of these 2 organisations that their superannuation **rights** and existing conditions of employment will be protected.

* While it is the view of the Government that no Minister should be unreasonably debarred from the ordinary **rights** of ownership of shares or other property by virtue of his position as a Minister, it is the practice of Ministers in my Government to disclose to their Cabinet colleagues any, interest they have which may be regarded as likely to colour the judgments they are required to make on matters of Government business.

* Anybody concerned with land **rights** in Queensland could have told the Government what was about to happen.

* provided, however, that such measures do not, as a consequence, lead to the maintenance of separate **rights** for different racial groups and that they shall not be continued after the objectives for which they were taken have been achieved.

* Here again there would be no difference between the Government and, I think, the Oppositioncertainly myself- in relation to the intention, but I am worried as to the interpretation that might be placed on this proviso in a court of law if it had to take it into account in relation to an appeal under clause 10 of the Bill by a person of a non-Aboriginal race who was claiming the special **rights** that are given to the people of the Aboriginal race under legislation.

* In money terms this would mean that a single pensioner would receive all the **rights** of public hospital treatment and specialist treatment for nothing and he would receive all the **rights** of private treatment in hospital and outside for an insurance contribution of about 65c a week.

* In order that this could happen my Government would ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth conceives to be its legal **rights**.

* If we go to the international conference and the territorial sea boundaries are changed from  3  to  12  miles, from  3  to  20  miles or whatever it may be, we must know that our representatives who are at that conference are speaking for this nation with the authority of national law to back them up in what they say and that there can be no question of whether they have or have not the **rights**.

* Percentage returns offered to the Department by tenders for concession **rights** are based on the tenderers' own business judgment of the turnover the business will achieve over the period of the concession.

* Under public tendering procedures, the 
Department exercises no influence on the business judgment of tenderers as to the percentage they should offer for business trading **rights**.

* When we speak about freedom of choice and people's **rights**, we must look at what the vast majority of Australians want.

* Fundamentally, the Government's aim is to have one Australian society in which all Australians - including Aboriginal Australians - will have equal **rights**, responsibilities and opportunities.

* Aborigines already enjoy, by law, these **rights** on lands covered by pastoral leases off reserves.

* the Government is going to consult with any Aboriginal communities which might be affected by such mining activities so that their welfare will be taken into account when applications for exploration and mining development **rights** are being considered.

* Exploration **rights** will be granted on the basis that the granting of development **rights** will be deferred if, in the Government's view, they would be detrimental to the interests and well-being of an Aboriginal community in the area.

* Far from achieving its stated objectives of stopping tax dodges by the Pitt Street farmers  -  I do not at this stage debate the **rights** or wrongs of this group of producers - the plain fact is that this group will be the main one which will be able to afford to take advantage of the minimal concessions which remain.

* You,  Sir, as Speaker,  are the custodian of the **rights** and privileges of all honourable members.

* Well, in some respects this is one of our remaining **rights**.

* If honourable members do not support the motion it will mean that they are not seized' of the importance of question time, and the **rights** and privileges of this Parliament will become a whited sepulchre.

* We have looked for a treaty settlement which will have the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances on matters of day-to-day significance while at the same time retaining a durable certainty about the distribution and nature of the **rights** of the parties concerned.

* Thus, whilst there has been preoccupation with the Torres Strait as an area of special significance to both countries, the question of the delimitation of seabed and fishing **rights** throughout the whole area running some 1,200 miles from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea has also been of major importance.

* I am sympathetic to this problem, and in proposing for consideration this motion in relation to the adjournment I have tried to ensure that the **rights** of private members to put a viewpoint on a regular adjournment debate are protected.

* They have a little more feeling about their sovereign **rights** than does this Minister and this sloppy slap-dash Government.

* The Government was so anxious that in the first place, it produced a Bill which ran absolutely roughshod over State's **rights**.

* in return for Australian television **rights** while the producer - the ABC controls the actual content of the programme - pays for the writing, the actors and other incidental cash costs.

* As a result stations have discontinued the use of British and Australian recordings, the **rights** of which are held by the manufacturers concerned.

* It lends support for my belief that under this Government the Department of Health has had its functions narrowly circumscribed within the ideological dogmas of the Government; that is, the Department does very little to examine and improve the health care of the nation, because it is preoccupied with making the Government's health insurance scheme stave off failure and because it is afraid of cutting across Liberal dogmas about State **rights**.

* I think that the **rights** of individuals are subject to the danger that the information gathered by departments could be abused.

* Therefore, I believe that it should be an offence for Customs officers to disclose information gathered by them except where Parliament gives them authority to disclose it and it should be made a criminal offence for which they can be charged in order that the **rights** of individual citizens cannot be abused by the wrong use of the information that is properly collected for the purposes of the administration of the Customs and narcotics laws.

* The draft resolution urges the Assembly to restore to the People's Republic of China all its **rights** and to recognise the representatives of its Government as the only law ful representatives of China at the United Nations.

* All of these are to be heaped together including the people who are now taking up the cudgels on behalf of the Gurindjis who are seeking land **rights**.

* The question of Aboriginal **rights** came up.

* Just the establishment of that Commission was a major Australian achievement, in the face of the kind of States **rights** nonsense with which Federal governments are always beset.

* This agreement superseded a similar agreement entered into in 1949, the year after the Australian and New Zealand governments acquired the mining **rights** from the Christmas Island Phosphate Co.

* Some 12S0 appear to have clear **rights** to go to Singapore, Malaysia or Indonesia through their possession of the citizenship of those countries.

* I do not think that such a system is an infringement of individual **rights** of privacy, unless it is linked or is capable of being linked by computer to taxation records, Medibank records, bank accounts, driving records, etc, or unless unreasonable demands are made on its use.

* The, Restrictive Trade Practices Act protects the **rights** of efficient Australian flag operators to enter our overseas trades.

* The way in which the Australian* Labor Party attacks doctors is vicious, unfortunate and in extremely poor taste, but not as callous and unfortunate as the Labor Party's disregard for the freedoms and **rights** of patients in its obsession with controls and commissions.

* The tragedy of the nationalised scheme is that the **rights**, the freedoms and the humanity of patients are sacrificed to suit the inhuman tidiness of the doctrinaire and bureaucratic mind.

* Basically, what we are talking about is something which goes to the basic **rights** of every Australian.

* I suggest that that provision will cut away the **rights** of thousands of citizens in States in Australia which are not prepared to use bugging devices as a means of investigation.

* But,  Mr Speaker,  it needs to be pointed out that to defend the **rights** of homosexuals is not to endorse or advocate homosexuality; it is simply to recognise that, as long as homosexuals abide by laws to which all citizens are subject, they ought equally to be free to express their sexual preferences.

* BHP-Esso and WoodsideBurmah on the North- West Shelf cannot even get an extension of their exploration **rights**.

* Pension **rights** were in jeopardy.

* They have been greatly frustrated by being unable to understand exactly what their entitlements are under the Act and exactly what their **rights** are in the event of some malady or disability overtaking them.

* One can always find public servants who know their **rights** and entitlements and who have no confusion about them whatsoever.

* This circular states: 
1 ) Air Niugini, Lufthansa and Olympic Airways applied for new or additional landing **rights** in Australia during 1976.

* None of the applications involved traffic **rights** at Brisbane International Airport.

* lt should be put on record that by asking that the second reading of this Bill be proceeded with today in this House the Labor Party once again has illustrated its disregard for the normal traditions of the House and the **rights** of honourable members to have a reasonable time to consider the contents of Bills presented to them.

* However, as I read the Bill- I am subject to correction in this respect- the preservation **rights** apply only on movement to other public employment.

* By adopting the special drawing **rights**, which are sometimes blithely described as paper gold as 1 have said, we have accepted the fact that there can be international creation of credit.

* As I understand it, the difficulty with the SDR system - that is, the special drawing **rights** system - or the paper gold system, was experienced in providing the greatest potential credit availability not to those who needed it most but to those who needed it least.

* I am sure that my colleagues were just as surprised as I was to find that this preliminary essay in terms of the special drawing **rights** was much more adventurous than was initially thought.

* Although my friend, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Collard),  is not present I think I must say that the ominous signs are that if special drawing **rights** become more extensive - personally T hope they will because it simply shows the extension on the international plane of what is done in internal banking - gold will become a less and less important element in terms of international trade.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to widespread condemnation of ( a) Queensland 's totalitarian Acts and administration which restrict the **rights**, initiatives and opportunities of Aboriginals and Islanders and (b) the current investigation of attitudes to those Acts.

* What steps have been taken by the Commonwealth and each State, to (a) abolish laws which breach international conventions, the Racial Discrimination Act and announced Commonwealth policies, and (b) to implement outside the Northern Territory the Woodward Commission's recommendations on land **rights** as legislated for the Territory.

* Sometimes people on this side of the chamber are presented as being raving radicals who, when they argue for the **rights** of the unemployed, for example, are somehow taking a position which cannot be defended on rational grounds, a position which is not supported by groups which have status and standing and which represent all the welfare interests in Australia, certainly in the voluntary sector and partially in the government sector.

* If the then Minister for Trade and Industry,  Sir John  McEwen, had not taken the initiative in bringing in the Book Bounty Bill of that day it is quite safe to say that the industry would have passed the point of no return and that the quite considerable body of book publishing which is generated in this countrythe works of Australian authors, the works of authors from overseas for which **rights** are bought by Australian publishers- would all have gone on outside Australia.

* In other words, we are not a policy making or governing body at all, these **rights** being invested in the executive government - that is Cabinet - which, of course, must have the support and confidence of a: majority of mem b- rs of the Parliament.

* Those proceedings can be taken in a court of common law when civil **rights** are involved, so why should not it happen in the case of industrial law?

* Firstly, personal liberty and individual **rights** disappear.

* Let me take just two cases, chosen pretty much at random, which I believe indicate the practical effect on the **rights** of applicants.

* But the problem that one is dealing with here is that one is dealing largely with a group of people, many of whom are unaware of their **rights**.

* This is the price one has to pay, because with **rights** go responsibilities, and I for one would have it no other way.

* When a House starts to invoke in 1975, and carries into 1 976, powers that were discarded nearly 200 years ago in the Parliament on which we model ourselves I think it is time that this House asserted its **rights** against the other place.

* 2) provides for total expenditure on the capital account, and if I may say so, separated again only for the reasons that the Senate has been more strenuous in defending what it thinks are its **rights** against the House of Representatives in that it separates what are called ordinary annual expenditure and capital expenditure.

* As to the protection of civil **rights**, we have seen the appointment of the Ombudsman and the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

* In the area of the protection of civil **rights** against a large and, as some would see it, an increasingly powerful bureaucracy this Government has done more than any in the history of Australia to protect the **rights** of average Australian men and women against bureaucratic decisions of one kind or another.

* complete lack of perception and sensitivity towards the **rights** and aspirations of this newly emerging country.

* If one looks through the 13 'A pages of this statement on industrial relations, it is incredible that one sees the accusation that the Labor Party is one-sided, that it speaks on behalf of the trade union movement or the wage and salary earners of this country, but it does not look after, protect or stand up for the **rights** of employers.

* The second reason is that the effect may be to implement provisions by regulation that could well affect vested **rights**, such as State interests and so on.

* There is a principle that needs to be understood, that is, that regulations that could arise having far-reaching consequences affecting foreign policy and human **rights** as they might relate to Australia and to the international scene can only be disallowed; they cannot be amended.

* In a weak moment, Australia could find itself, in the euphoria of a conference, involved in some international agreement that could well limit the freedom and the **rights** of an individual within a community or society, for the sole purpose of trying to preserve the environment as such.

* Implicit in that compact that was made between the Australian Colonies, as they then were when they federated to form Australia, was the surrender for all time by the 6 colonies of Australia of any claim that they might have to sovereign **rights** in the world community.

* Members of the Institute will have no **rights** about when and where they will meet.

* It ought to be conducting research into the whole concept of group **rights** under the law- an important contemporary transcultural concern.

* As I have pointed out, the members of the Council have no functions at all unless they are called together by the Council, They have no **rights** to call a meeting themselves.

* It sanctimoniously reiterates: 'A Federal Government cannot interfere with State **rights**'.

* It is one of the tragedies of our society that the people who need a comprehensive knowledge of their **rights**, who need a thorough understanding of the process of the law, are the very people who are denied this knowledge, that those people who are most likely to have their **rights** usurped and trampled upon are the very people who, because of their background, their education and their environment, are the most helpless when it comes to asserting those **rights**.

* It is these people who need an acquaintance with the law and who are, in the main, ignorant of their **rights** under the law.

* The vast majority of Australians are unaware of their **rights** and privileges under the law.

* It is the aim of the Australian legal aid program to make people aware of their **rights** and to place them on an equal footing with the more affluent members of the community.

* For what purpose and on what terms does the Government propose to secure land **rights** over 7,500,000 acres of Queensland-held Aboriginal 'and.

* In the last 3 years, industrial and professional organisations in this country which have taken up the strike weapon as their only means of defending their **rights** and putting forward their just demands have never previously gone on strike.

* I would prevail upon him, having regard to the particular state of that industry at the moment, measured in terms of the number of men required on the waterfront today and the number which may be required in the future, to ensure that his Government does not interfere with the **rights** of the trade union and the employer to negotiate in a right and proper manner for the interests of the people and the humans in the industry and the interests, of course, of the whole community.

* We have a Federal system with sovereign States which have sovereign **rights** in respect of many matters.

* Over the years he has gained for himself an enviable reputation as a fighter for the servicemen and their **rights**.

* This is especially so if what needs to be done has something to do with people's **rights**.

* One honourable member has already referred to the **rights** of fisheries in these areas.

* Fishermen's **rights** have to be taken into account.

* In case there be any doubt I suggest that one of our efforts in the law of the sea discussions should be to achieve a situation where coastal States have either a right or an obligation to preserve the marine environment around their shores, not unrealistically and not without regard to the **rights** of fishermen, traditional or otherwise, but having regard to the fact that it is part of the heritage of Australia and indeed of the world beyond.

* The concept of adultery, the concept of bestiality and all the other grounds are nothing but symptoms, I would suggest, of some malaise that has overtaken a human relationship- a relationship that forms expression in conjugal **rights**- a marriage.

* We are handicapping ourselves by not giving local government constitutional **rights** in Australia.

* I propose to deal briefly with 3 points - Firstly, coking coal reserves; secondly, the environment; and thirdly, the Commonwealth **rights** in relation to the seabed.

* 1 should like to refer to statements made in relation to an alleged infringement of Commonwealth sovereign **rights** over the seabed.

* There is no infringement on Commonwealth sovereign **rights**.

* This matter has gone far beyond any question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Here is a law - a delegated piece of legislation - which was made on a Thursday morning, when people could not obtain copies of it, and which affected fundamental **rights** without Parliament being given any opportunities at all to discuss it'.

* It goes far beyond the question of Aboriginal land **rights** and becomes an abuse of this Parliament.

* People have had their civil **rights** determined on the basis of that law making process.

* They are making a political point beyond the point of Aboriginal land **rights**, which originally brought them there.

* -The Attorney-General said that Miss Morosi 's work was extremely important in the field of human **rights**.

* In it  Senator Murphy  said that Miss Morosi 's work was extremely important in the field of human **rights**, yet within a week she is to leave this job.

* If any honourable member desires to oppose this Bill on the grounds of States **rights** then I refer that member to the leading article in the 'Financial Review' in July last year which suggested that such an argument would be 'the last refuge of scoundrels'.

* We have **rights** the same as he has.

* It stands as a watchdog between the actions of the Government or the Parliament and the **rights** of the people.

* It will go down in the history of our country as one of the great declarations on human **rights** insofar as it relates to migrant tradesmen.

* Following a meeting between the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby),  the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and my good self, together "with the executive officers of the Australian Council of 
The unions, far from being racist, are determined to see that the skilled tradesmen who have not had the advantage of being born in this country and therefore who are not in a position to understand what their **rights** are under the law, are not exploited.

* Honourable members seem to be under a misapprehension as to the **rights** of the Chair at question time.

* The **rights** of the Chair on answers to questions are those **rights** which are provided to the Chair by the Standing Orders of this House.

* Sir, if you look at May's  Parliamentary Practice  and particularly at the practice of the House of Commons you will see that what you have said conflicts with standing order 1 because the  Speaker  of the House of Commons does exercise authority when Ministers abuse, as Ministers have done in this House, their **rights** in answering questions.

* But it is also stupid because people's **rights** are interfered with because of this sort of thing.

* When one gets into this area of complete ridiculousness which affects the **rights** of the people in the community, then one must pose a grave question about the censorship which exists in the community.

* By 1928 the complete list of banned works of literature was made up of 3 books: Balzac's 'Droll Stories'; cheap editions of Boccaccio's Decameron', and cheap editions of 
The basic philosophical issue for our democratic society is that there are **rights** for minorities, lt Ls no: a democracy that is run by a majority which believes that a decision made by the majority must at all times bc upheld, even whore it arises as a result of moral standards which become somewhat osified in a conservative environment because they have not been subjected to critical scrutiny as frequently and as intensively as should be desirable in a liberal society.

* There are also philosophical values of the **rights** of minorities in a free society.

* Registration is basically to establish nationality and grant flag **rights**, however, I would point out that the critical factors are not the conditions of registry but rather the subsequent control of seaworthiness, safety and manning aspects exercised by 'open registry ' countries.

* For the first time in Australia's history, as a result of this legislation, Aboriginal people will have land **rights**.

* It might have been all right to ride roughshod over the Aborigines in bygone times but the whole purpose of this legislation is to grant land **rights**.

* The Opposition is moving amendments to delete a number of words which would have the effect of giving Aborigines **rights** in this particular matter.

* The amendments are designed to ensure that mining interests with options and other **rights**, interest in land and the like, must seek consent from Aboriginal people in their corporate state when land becomes Aboriginal land.

* I do not regard the Minister as having an antipathy to the best interests of Aboriginal People and their quests for land **rights**.

* With the aim of ensuring continuity of supplies and uniformity of price, the Authority will have trading **rights** to buy and sell hydrocarbons.

* Is it a fact that the ASIO officer concerned has none of these **rights**?

* The people see these and other **rights** of self-determination being swept away before their very eyes.

* The Government therefore last month took action to try to prevent abuses of this benefit without in any way affecting the **rights** of those genuinely seeking work.

* I emphasise that the new guidelines in no way impair the **rights** and protection of those genuinely seeking work.

* We may have many and varied ideas and many and varied thoughts on subjects, but we have one basic principle- the **rights** of the individual.

* Why does it not allow members to exercise their **rights**?

* If we ignore the Prime Minister's ideological rantings about centralism, big government and State **rights**, there are 2 central questions to be asked about these Bills.

* No less ardent a defender of States' **rights** than the Premier of Queensland said on 8 April: 
Are the **rights** and obligations of public servants as governed by legislation, convention, regulation or precedent available in codified form and have they been brought together in consolidated form.

* My colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr N. H. Bowen),  who represents the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in this House, indicated clearly that in some respects legislation is already in operation in a number of States and in the Commonwealth Territories to protect a company's shareholders **rights** in relation to takeovers.

* The **rights** of the Commonwealth in relation to these loans are not affected adversely by any takeover of ATI.

* I have received a large number of representations from members and the general community concerning the granting by the Australian Cricket Board of exclusive television **rights** to cricket coverage to a commercial network.

* Where exclusive **rights** rest with a commercial operator the ABC cannot unilaterally ignore such an agreement and proceed with coverage.

* Pension **rights** were not achieved for some considerable time after.

* No **rights** of appeal, in the real sense of the term, existed.

* The burden of proof was with the individuals concerned, the trade union organisations and in every direction other than those who were intent on this stupid idea that they would destroy the militant action of waterside workers and would deny to them their **rights** to set about winning further conditions for themselves, by application of this most vicious system of discipline.

* The Party occupying the Opposition benches today will be the Government, lt is the only Party which recognises the industrial **rights** of wage and salary earners generally, and it will take care of them because it understands people.

* The Whitlam Labor Government introduced a national scheme and it was sabotaged by the LiberalNational Country Party dominated Senate in the name of States **rights**.

* This conference recognises the support for human **rights** and dignity is a fundamental principle of Labor foreign policy and that the ALP is opposed to all forms of authoritarian and totalitarian government whether based on the ideologies of the Left or the Right.

* The Senate is a protector - as it has proved on numerous occasions - of the fundamental **rights** and liberties of citizens.

* Human **rights**, political **rights** and civil **rights** do not exist in a number of countries.

* Unless we establish the **rights** of the people, unless we give them the right to talk about their governments, we will continue to get all the tragedies that we have had in the past.

* At no stage were the Presiding Officers making a wage determination as to permanent staff of the Refreshment Rooms who are not subject to the disabilities associated with irregular work as are the sessional staff and who have especial **rights** such as superannuation, etc.

* The purpose of this Bill is to amend the present Bankruptcy Act so as to create a common investment fund, to provide for a more equitable adjustment of the **rights** of both debtors and creditors, and to improve the administration and effectiveness of the Act.

* What it was trying to do was take away from the pensioners and other persons on fixed incomes the opportunities and **rights** which persons should receive from a government which runs the economy properly.

* The wage employee had a seniority system which did give him some **rights** of appeal.

* I would finish on this note: I hope that the challenge to the **rights** of the Commonwealth to levy payroll tax is successful because I think it is inequitable and improper for the Commonwealth to levy payroll tax on organisations such as local government authorities which can raise revenue only by the levying of taxes.

* "(3) Where a person, other than an approved body, received, or became entitled to receive, grants in respect of eligible expenditure incurred by him during any 3 or more grant years preceding a particular grant year, a grant is not payable to him in respect of eligible expenditure incurred by him during that grant year unless the amount of his export earnings in that grant year exceeds $25,000 or, if the whole of that amount consist of consideration for the disposal of eli- gible industrial property **rights** or eligible know-how, 10,000.

* His **rights**, including income and equity, will be set out in the contract he has with AIDC and he will know exactly what his position is.

* Instead we have seen a Government that is already using the gag and restricting the **rights** of private members in this Parliament more vehemently and viciously than any Government since 1945, certainly any government since the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has been in the Parliament.

* It is by-passing the organs of this Parliament and is reducing the **rights** and prerogatives of members of this Parliament.

* Apart from that, in those days the Federal Parliament was truly a Federal Parliament and did not believe in interfering where the **rights** and responsibilities were obviously those of the States.

* There is no procedure to allow the Minister to move a motion to do something with a petition- particularly something that would affect the **rights** and privileges of any member of this House- unless the House agreed by unanimous decision.

* I think it was equally the intention of parliament simply to ensure that the **rights** and wrongs of the matter which had led to a strike should be fully dealt with by discussion at a conference.

* I refer to the **rights** and the powers of the Parliament and exactly where this Parliament stands in relation to the Executive.

* So, from the point of view of being a worthwhile addition to the existing legislation, it is quite a devastating negation of the **rights** of the ordinary citizen.

* I hope that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  will be able to develop a system whereby people are made aware of their **rights** in these circumstances.

* The community health programs, the community information bureaus, the welfare **rights** and the area improvement programs all directly  affect our ethnic communities.

* The Australian Legal Aid Office offered to many migrants the only hope of justice, the only protection of their **rights** as citizens.

* He told us that  Mr Urbanchich  had the same **rights** as the six million Jews who were killed in Europe in World War II.

* The Committee, while conscious of States **rights** in this matter, feels it should register its belief that the interests of handicapped children would be best served if responsibility for their education were placed in the hands of State Education Departments.

* My Government, on receipt of the report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission which is expected shortly, will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* The **rights** of the individual citizen will be the subject of a group of proposed laws on human **rights** and the prevention of racial discrimination.

* My Government believes that the High Court of Australia must become the final court in all matters pertaining to Australia and to the legal **rights** and obligations of its citizens.

* I inform honourable senators and members that I have decided not to refer to the Privy Council petitions addressed to me by the State of Queensland and the State of Tasmania concerning **rights** to the seabed.

* The point has never been put to these people that there are alternative forms of legislation which would give them land **rights**, which would give them title to their own reserves and which would enable them to determine their own destiny.

* This Government very shortly will introduce legislation to give land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* I think we have to get away from playing politics about these things and get back to the much greater degree of common ground which exists but which many of us are not prepared to admit exists and certainly the 
If so, will this belated recognition of human **rights** be eroded by (a) persistence of slow worker permit laws and (b) imposition on wage-earners of new levies for rates, rentals, etc., on reserves.

* What action has the Australian Government taken to provide human **rights** and land **rights** in Queensland in accordance with (a) international conventions, (b) national policies and (c) anti-discrimination laws.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Nobody has really yet given a definition of land **rights**.

* The other matter with which the honourable member for Griffith and other Opposition members must deal is how they will assert their **rights** through the democratic processes available to them.

* I take it that his Party has a Caucus procedure and that in that Caucus he does have some democratic **rights**.

* If the vendors do not accept the offer of compensation they have their normal **rights** in law as does every other citizen.

* Yet, on 2 occasions, the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who is sitting in the chamber now, moved motions to interfere with private members' business day, at the same time talking about what was wanted and what **rights** members should have in this Parliament.

* I am glad that the former Minister for Labour and National Service is in the chamber tonight because I propose to refer to some correspondence that he addressed to me in regard to the **rights** of people to obtain a deferment of their military service on compassionate grounds.

* It is essential therefore that the Premier of Queensland be encouraged in his statesman-like approach to preserve the **rights** of the Queensland beef producers initially.

* Clearly, if the time for casting a vote, the availability and number of polling booths and the way in which postal votes can be lodged are restricted the **rights** of the people are restricted.

* A similar situation applies with respect to education and all other things that go to make up State **rights**.

* But we are not proposing to interfere in any way with his **rights** to ask the Committee to act on his behalf and report to him privately and confidentially.

* When all is said and done he is only one of many, the voice of a Ministry elected on a spoils-to-the-victor basis, and if he does not obey the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  in his every whim, irrespective of the effects on our **rights** in this Parliament, honourable members know as well as I do that he will be replaced almost overnight.

* The honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  an outspoken advocate in this Parliament of the **rights** of members, well knows that he has been harshly treated by former Leaders of the House.

* We expect fair treatment from the Minister who is now responsible for the task of running the Parliament and we expect him to recognise the **rights** of an Opposition.

* One would hope that as an up and coming nation we would evertually develop a national spirit to the stage where we want an anthem of our own and not be just exercising some sort of discretionary voting **rights** as to a tune for a national song.

* I am pleased to note that the people in the Territories will at least get a chance to exercise some **rights** in this matter as they will not be able to do in respect of the 4 major referendums which will be dealt with on the same day.

* He said:  in recognition of the Government's policy relating to human **rights** and the view that the Passport Act should neither be used as an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose, this practice will be discontinued.

* The purpose of this section is to ensure that the unmarried minor is not issued a passport without steps having been taken to protect the **rights** of the child and the **rights** of persons who have custody or guardianship of or access to the child.

* However, the encompassing of the **rights** of all those with custody, guardianship or access can draw in many people and can make the work of the passports office very complicated.

* The principles of the Fox report were sold out by the land **rights** legislation, which was emasculated in 1976 by the change of government.

* The people who sold them out, the people who leaned on them, are the people who sit on the opposite side of the House and talk great pious hypocrisy about land **rights**, human **rights** and Aboriginal culture and then torpedo it whenever there is a mineral, pastoral, State government or Northern Territory government interest which says: 'We cannot afford those blacks; we want the minerals at any price'.

* Mr O'Malley  and I assured them that their interests and the **rights** of all Australian citizens and overseas visitors were best protected by a full disclosure of the facts so that the public can be fully informed of just what is going on in this country.

* The Prime Minister promised to 'introduce land **rights** legislation based on justice for all'.

* 107 in order to smother the issues of land **rights** and land acquisnon which that Convention raised.

* Cabinet has decided to oppose the land **rights** of Aborigines at Borroloola in the Northern Territory without consulting the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

* 1 regard you as the custodian and the keeper of the **rights** of the House.

* In blatant breach of the United Nations declaration and of the International Labour Organisation conventions, the indigenous people of this country have been deprived of their land and any administrative **rights** over their reserves.

* While mining **rights** have transcended human **rights** we are extracting mineral resources and disregarding the human resources that are available.

* I would now like to say a few words about land **rights**.

* In 1834  Sir Thomas  Buxton,  chairman  of the Aborigines Committee of the British House of Commons said: 
Your Committee believes that a direct monetary compensation should be paid for any loss of traditional occupancy, even though these **rights** are not legally expressed.

* The land **rights** claim is specific.

* If the type of behaviour that was displayed in Adelaide is any indication, one can see that at future major hearings representatives, whether they be of commercial television stations, commercial radio stations or indeed the public broadcasting sector, will have to have legal counsel to work out their **rights**.

* Prompted by somebody in the background he then included Thailand in the description of the countries that he felt could be occupied by the North Vietnamese without violating international **rights** in any way.

* My Government will carry out a continuing program of law reform, particularly with a view to protecting civil liberties and enhancing civil **rights**.

* Constant vigilance is required to ensure that the **rights** of individual citizens are not eroded or ignored.

* We want to give them **rights** in the maintenance of law and order in their cities and local authorities.

* The Australian Embassy has given all the assurances in the world that we do not wish to interrupt the course of justice and the hearings in Austria, but we have certainly said, through all the means that are available to us, that the mother and the child should be able to get together and I would hope that the representations that are being made in a continuing way to the Austrian authorities will persuade the Austrian authorities to recognise the **rights** of this Australian mother in this situation and also to act in the best interests of the child.

* Certainly in Australia the **rights** of the mother are sacrosanct, and we would hope that this would also apply generally to Australian citizens around the world.

* What has happened lends impetus to the efforts that are being made by the Government to achieve some agreement with overseas countries that court orders made in Australia should be recognised in other countries and that the **rights** of Australian citizens in relation to children of dual nationality should be properly appreciated.

* I would hope that the best traditions of Austrian administration would recognise the **rights** of an Australian mother in relation to her Australian child so that the mother and child can be reunited quickly.

* The particular point is the need to ensure that in this country there is a proper remedy whereby people who, in a particular class, have suffered in general from some impediment of their **rights** are able to have an action brought on their behalf.

* It can cover civil **rights**, environment, welfare, consumer protection, anti-trust, security law and the like.

* People do not matter as people and **rights** do not matter as **rights** so long as Government members have their small-minded way with legislation which typifies their attitude.

* One is the national nature- not the State **rights** oneand the greater scope of control which is exercised.

* The Government is going to override all the **rights** of people in this House.

* It has been given **rights** of inspection of operations and documents and is entitled to information so that it may assess whether environmental conditions are being rigidly enforced.

* Indeed, instead of promoting the substance of change towards a republic of which even the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to his discredit has spoken, I believe that this Bill will preserve the monarchy and ensure that through the GovernorGeneral there is continued opportunity for us to preserve a system that is written into our Constitution and which so effectively has protected the **rights** of every citizen of this country though the years since Federation. 
)

* as  to  whom the Minister is satisfied that they have traditional **rights** in relation to the land; and 
after consultation with the Aboriginals, if any, as to whom the Minister is satisfied that they have traditional **rights** in relation to the land - 
This matter was brought to my attention quite forcefully by the Committee.

* While we often squabble about land **rights**, they in many ways could be said to be far more civilised than we are.

* Over the aeons of time they have established who owns the land and whose **rights** to the land should predominate.

* Because of this situation, we wanted if possible to find the Aborigines whom other Aborigines would concede have the traditional **rights** to that land.

* If it is not possible to do that, the sub-clause then goes on to provide: 
We have cast the sub-clauses as widely as we could to ensure that we did not clash with traditional Aboriginal land **rights**.

* This Bill gives adult **rights** not only with regard to suffrage but also with regard to marriage.

* What an example we set of law and order, of decent procedures and of the **rights** of individuals.

* In these circumstances we will not vote against the second reading but we will move an amendment in Committee to preserve the **rights** of persons who were affected by the proceedings outside this House on 20th and 23rd July.

* However, I would hope that no Minister ever again will overlook the **rights** of citizens to resist arrest if the arrest is being made without authority.

* A citizen has **rights**.

* A policeman is a citizen too, but he has no greater **rights** than another citizen unless the law expressly gives him those **rights**.

* We should also ensure that those persons retain the **rights** which they would have had to seek redress.

* If he has been arrested falsely, if he has been prosecuted maliciously - although this might not be the case in this instance - he has **rights**.

* He should not be deprived of his **rights**.

* I would imagine that that is what the AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Greenwood)  meant when he said in answer to my colleague  Senator Cavanagh  yesterday afternoon: 
As to whether any compensation may be payable, I feel that the Government's attitude would be that if people considered that their **rights** had been infringed they, like everyone else, have access  to  the courts of law to assert those **rights**.

* I should explain that we will not vote against the second reading because it is important that people who have acted under ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory and other territories, who have acted under regulations under Commonwealth Acts, and who have acted under instruments made by Ministers, should have their **rights** confirmed.

* If persons find that they were able to escape liabilities or were able to enjoy benefits under laws which everybody thought were valid up until now and now find that that is not the case, the matter should be promptly put to **rights**.

* The High Court of Australia has upheld the **rights** of members from the Territory to be here and to vote in full.

* The terms of the inquiry gave both parties certain **rights** in the event of disagreement.

* As I see it not only has the pharmacist in community practice not been paid his just **rights** in the past 3 years but now, because the entitlement is being paid- or more correctly 2 years of it is being paid in the tax year- the Government will reap back a substantial amount of the payments in extra taxation.

* That is hardly the record of a government which is neglecting the basic **rights** of and its basic obligations to the people of the Capital Territory.

* One could almost say that the unstated presumption of what he was talking about tonight was States **rights**.

* Let me just make this point, and I think it is appropriate: The Party opposite is not a party that has ever understood State **rights**.

* It is a party which, particularly in financial matters, is completely devoted to the abolition and the denigration of States **rights** altogether.

* Having recognised their **rights** on the one hand and their particular relationship with the land on the other hand, the Government said to them: 'Although you, as communities, are reluctant to have mining companies cutting a swath across your land and plundering it for whatever mineral wealth is there, whether or not you like it the only thing that is open to you to negotiate is how much compensation you will get. '

* But the adoption of them in terms of Aboriginal communities- most of which are struggling and deprived communities- is another example of a swindle being performed on Aboriginal communities by a government which, while talking about Aboriginal **rights** and sensitivity in understanding their problems, is prepared in the final analysis to give with one hand and to take away with the other.

* He will also remember stating on 14 November that if the Territory legislation was considered unsatisfactory the Government could refer it back to the 
Is it a fact that the Territory of Papua New Guinea holds 20 per cent of the equity in the project; if not, what equitay is held bv the Territory, and what **rights** has the Territory to possible new share issues?

* Very briefly, I think that the Parliament would understand that if the legislation committees are to operate successfully, and we are trying to co-operate as much as possible to ensure that they do work successfully, it must be accepted that the Opposition does have some **rights** as to what legislation it feels ought to be presented to legislation committees.

* The prime reason for incest prohibition seems to be the necessity for preventing society from becoming snarled in its own web: every person has a complex set of duties, **rights**, obligations, and statuses with regard to other people, and these would become intolerably complicated or even contradictory if incest were freely permitted.

* Let us remember that it is said that while there are federal powers to talk about custody, maintenance and property **rights**, they are not as wide as one would think.

* Surely it is a fiction to think that under the Constitution we have the power to deal with marriage- as we have- with divorce, matrimonial causes and parental **rights** and that those powers have to be interpreted, as the High Court has legally said, but those matters are limited to the aspects of the family which I have mentioned.

* Property questions can be discussed only if they are ancillary to the matrimonial cause and the question of parental **rights** cannot be extended to include children who are not children of the marriage of both parties.

* My colleague the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  will tell the House about a recent case in South Australia where the State court made a decision for the sale of the matrimonial home exercising the property **rights** under State law.

* It is quite clear that that court ought to be the court to discuss these **rights**'.

* The question of property **rights**, that is an estate in fee simple, should not be determined by a State law, as they normally would be, overriding or in any way contradicting the **rights** of a wife or husband to a matrimonial home.

* The divorce has taken place and the former wife is facing eviction on the basis that she has no matrimonial **rights** there.

* We must guarantee that these solutions are available virtually at the time the Family Court is involved in order to avoid the situation in which, although we can solve the problem of separation, the very burdensome problems of custody, maintenance or property **rights** are not solved for a period of up to two years.

* It is important that when people can cross from State to State or State to Territory without a visa they should not have the problem of different interpretations of law when a judicial interpretation of their **rights** is required.

* I remind the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett)  of the former Minister's visit to Queensland in the early days after his assumption of office when he tried to interfere with the **rights** of the Torres Strait islanders.

* But to summarise, these are our objections: Firstly,, that the aim of the Government in this is to minimise taxation; secondly, that there may be a dichotomy of interests between the equity shareholder, the person who has borne the brunt of the battle, has run the risk and is entitled to the legitimate rewards; thirdly, that the fixed interest holder ought properly to get priority only for his interest and his capital - he should have no proprietary **rights**; fourthly, there is the absorption, as I suggested, of the original company and the transferability of option **rights** to another associate company; fifthly, there is the danger of the high gearing of borrowings to capital, and high gearing is a besetting evil today in company operation and in company manipulation; sixthly, there is the inflow of overseas capital which can only provoke further ultimate control of Australian assets; seventhly, the favourable terms and the flexible rates of interest which are to be made available to overseas lenders; eighthly, the competition of rich overseas companies with Australian firms on the local capital market; and ninthly, better use can be made of deferred dividend shares.

* Butler loaded his voting strength by issuing some 80,000 new voting **rights** to his employees to try to outvote the Ansett group.

* The possibility of segregating portions of the Department of Health's Central Office in Canberra, so as to protect the **rights** of the non-smoker, is being studied.

* They feel that they are being denied their **rights** of quiet enjoyment and access to their homes.

* The people would have been consulted and the council would have exercised its legal **rights**.

* I say that with great sincerity, because this Government has for some years now talked to this Parliament about the **rights** of those who have served this country in Vietnam.

* In the words of the honourable member for Hawker - probably some excuses ought to be made for the Minister for Repatriation - it is quite obvious that the Government has no regard for the **rights** of those who served this country in Vietnam.

* Generally, the public is becoming increasingly aware of its **rights** and remedies under the Act.

* The legislation promised a dramatic change in consumer **rights** and a dismantling of agreements and conduct in restraint of trade.

* Is it a fact that 3 Japanese companies, Marubeni Corporation, Okura Shoii and Nipon Kohan and Kaisha (Japan Steel and Tube Corporation) have been negotiating with an Australian company, Magellan Petroleum Australia Ltd, which owns natural gas concession **rights** in Palm Valley, south-west of Alice Springs, to develop the natural gas resources of the Northern Territory and export natural gas to Japan.

* If they are persons who will disregard entirely the **rights** of their children and if it is the husband who is at fault, I would venture the view that the wife is well rid of the wretch and the sooner she can get separated from him the better and any talk of limiting the separation period before a divorce may be obtained to 12 months or 12 days is really superficial comment.

* Fourthly, he seemed to say that the Government should rush ahead, declare the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and totally ignore the complex constitutional issues involved and any **rights** and interests that the Queensland Government might have in the matter.

* Above these limits, any excess constituted a direct reduction of the pension to the full extent of the excess, so that all pension **rights** cut out at $7.25 per week single and $14.50 per week married couples.

* Legislation for the merged means test was enacted in 1960 and gave some pension **rights** to those who had a modest amount of property.

* I suggest that if it had been used at the time against the air traffic controllers there would have been a national strike for the very simple reason that the Government says in the Bill: 'We will dictate to you where you wil work and if you will not work we will sack you and you will have not **rights** at all'.

* The Government is not going to settle industrial disputes by the use of force or threats, particularly when a person's livelihood is at stake, because immediately the sympathy of fellow workers is encouraged and they act in unison to protect that man's **rights** or that woman's **rights**.

* A despondency has settled over some of these Aboriginal communities as a result of the curtailment of funds and also because of the undermining of the most important matter concerning Aboriginal people, land **rights**.

* When this legislation is read with the Nothern Territory land **rights** legislation that has been introduced into this Parliament, with the new proposal to hand back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the power to regulate sacred sites, and when the record of that Assembly is viewed by the Parliament, we will see why the Hope Committee of inquiry was so definite in recommending that this area be placed under Federal control.

* It is five years since the Labor Government appointed a Royal Commissioner to look into land **rights**.

* I remind honourable members of the fate of the land **rights** legislation which was passed by this House and which was then sent to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* If Government supporters think that acting after 21 years or 1 1 years or five years is acting too quickly, they might turn to the prescriptions of George III- not a notable revolutionary- who set out in 1763 the **rights** of the Indian people to the lands of Northern Canada.

* It is proper and desirable that a new settler who has become an Austraiian should not be treated differently from any other Australian with respect to voting and other **rights**.

* They wanted to concern themselves about things such as Aboriginal land **rights**.

* We would not then have the reverse situation which had prevailed for so long under which they had no **rights** at all.

* These people should have their own entitlements, **rights** and standards.

* It says that shares held in excess of 15 per cent under this special arrangement will have normal voting **rights** and their holders will be able to participate in any new general share issues by virtue of their holdings in these shares.

* If the whole purpose of the Minsec exercise was to keep the value of the shares at a realistic level then the Government should not have allowed the debt reconstruction of Minsec to take place at the expense of permitting foreign equity in the two companies mentioned in the Ordinance to exceed the stipulated 15 per cent with full voting **rights** on holdings over the 15 per cent.

* Why should the foreign companies have voting **rights** on the additional 6 per cent?

* On top of that, major decisions could be made in this period on the power vested in the voting **rights** on the extra 6 per cent.

* If the Government were sincere about this matter it would allow companies to hold the equity in the 6 per cent but would deny them voting **rights** on the 6 per cent.

* I think the Minister should recognise this, by amending the ordinance so that foreign companies can have the 6 per cent but not have voting **rights** on the 6 per cent.

* However, if he is a 1914 War veteran, an ex-prisoner-of-war or a Service pensioner who qualifies for fringe benefits, he will retain full free medical treatment **rights**.

* We know that there are ever-changing social attitudes - social values even - questioning constantly in our community such issues as, for example, the age of majority, equality of opportunity - which is an extension of the already achieved right of equality of **rights** - and freedom of individual expression.

* Has his attention also been drawn to indexed item 20- Office of Aboriginal Affairs proposals on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* That principle was embodied in a very famous speech by Edmund Burke to the electors of Bristol when he pointed out to them what has become and what has been referred to by many scholars and political scientists as a classic assertion of the **rights** of an individual member of Parliament to do what his conscience dictates.

* In extending jurisdiction over a 200-mile fishing zone Australia gets certain **rights** but also has to assume certain obligations.

* I raise this matter because, whatever we may personally think about the situation in Vietnam, I want to make it perfectly clear that we on this side of the House always have adopted the principle that while our servicemen are there we would not deny to them the benefits and **rights** to which they are entitled.

* The significant point is the very important consideration that a returned from active service badge gives to an ex-serviceman two **rights**.

* All the eccentrics about the **rights** of ex-servicemen can get their teeth into this subject.

* The Labor Party will not accept this open ended proposition whereby apparently the States can add to the criteria already laid down by somebody in the Commonwealth Treasury or the Commonwealth Cabinet whereby there is an air of uncertainty regarding the **rights** of creditors, the **rights** of State water authorities, the **rights** of mortgagees, the **rights** of other people who happen to be owed money by the farmers and the **rights** of war service land settlers.

* I would imagine that there is very little State **rights** sentiment in Australia in regard to companies legislation.

* There can surely be no justification for a State **rights** attitude on companies laws.

* Consistent with this Government's great interest in human **rights**, including the human **rights** of the individual in time of armed conflict------- 
What the libertine proponents of abortion on demand may refuse to regard as an important side issue is: how far should abortion be a matter of serious concern to people other than the woman herself, and how are the lives of her parents, husband or future husband and past or future children affected?

* It is these consequences and the **rights** and lives of these innocent bystanders that we must also safeguard.

* In the Committee stages I will move an amendment to add simply the words 'or otherwise' which will make it quite clear that we should take into account or protect the **rights** of economic wool producers and other organisations.

* In view of the Government's recent blunder in the purchase of Everard Park and in view of his policy statement on Aboriginal land **rights**, will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to the Parliament that all documents and details of financial transactions relating to the purchase of Everard Park will be tabled in this House for consideration and debate?

* The Opposition is devoid of any initiatives on human **rights**.

* Unemployment, reduced living standards, increased pollution and the restriction of our hard-earned industrial **rights** will continue to be eroded.

* They are intimidatory threats to the **rights** of people to defend their interests through assembly and industrial action.

* If it is good enough for the United States Government to subsidise factories in that country in order to retain employees in their jobs, surely this socialist Government that purports to be so dedicated to providing full employment would be quite within its **rights** to subsidise our munitions factories to the extent of maintaining jobs for employees there and also the jobs of employees in private factories which supply extra parts.

* On 25th September 1969, which is 20 months ago, in the period preceding the general elections the then Prime Minister first gave notice of his Government's intention to facilitate the preservation of superannuation **rights**.

* One wonders what the Government's underlying philosophy is on this question of transferability of superannuation from one employer to another - a process known as the preservation of superannuation **rights**.

* Certainly, no person who believes in democratic **rights** and civil liberties or who feels that it is the right of an individual to practise religion, politics or such other acceptable social activities as he sees as being within his interests, thinks that those **rights** should be denied.

* Those **rights** are not available to people in more than two-thirds of the countries in the world.

* There are persons within this continent for whom the Parliament has responsibility who lack full access to civil **rights** and who are treated in abominable circumstances because of laws discriminating against them.

* -Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking to the report on human **rights** in the Soviet Union which has been presented today.

* They do not indicate that there is not a denial of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* My concern is that in undertaking an inquiry of the magnitude of this report into human **rights** in the Soviet Union no funds- I repeat, no funds- were made available for the Committee to enable it to ensure it had available to it those witnesses whom it sought in order to carry out its inquiries or inspections.

* Certainly, we as parliamentarians profess to represent a country in which respect for human **rights** and civil liberties is paramount although we do have certain blind spots of our own where we choose to ignore repression of the **rights** of individuals.

* Such inquiries in almost all cases would bring to the attention of the Australian people, at least temporarily, the extent to which civil liberties and the **rights** of people to act freely and to practise freedom as they believe in it exists throughout the world.

* I believe that those who are responsible for those conditions should look in their own backyard before they talk about the **rights** or civil liberties of persons outside their own backyard.

* When the proposition is put around this country that a quick divorce will no longer be available under the proposals of this Bill and that those who are otherwise the innocent parties will be condemned to serve out time, it is appropriate for this Parliament to say: 'We will intervene in that situation and preserve the **rights** of what may be an innocent party'.

* The Americans have come to look at those countries which observe most rigorously or at least most decently human **rights**.

* The Bill will safeguard the **rights** of existing officers and employees who are transferred.

* These provisions are designed to protect the **rights** without inhibiting by legislation the ability of the Northern Territory Public Service Commissioner in his actions in relation to the newly formed Service.

* It is proposed that promotion and appeal **rights** of existing officers will be continued in substantively the same manner as was provided for staff transferred to the Postal and Telecommunications Commissions and a regulation making power for this purpose is included in the Bill.

* We will ensure, through legislation such as this Bill and the new Northern Territory Public Service Ordinance, that the **rights** of officers who enter that Service are fully protected.

* The Government believes that these two immediate decisions relating to the report of the Commonwealth Administrative review committee will be taken as a tangible demonstration of the significance it attaches to the protection of the **rights** of individuals at a time when governments exercise extensive powers on their behalf.

* It was a compromise constitution because State **rights** were just as strongly held then as they are now, perhaps more so.

* Further to our north, Queensland Premier Bjelke-Petersen has resisted Australian Government initiative to give land **rights** to Aborigines.

* She finds that she is ineligible for deserted wives' **rights** because the de facto husband was the last to leave her.

* It has gone on with all this rubbish about State's **rights** and put impediments in the path of sound proposals and the offers of money to improve the lot of the people in Victoria.

* The Government has announced its intentions in regard to a human **rights** Bill.

* I appreciate and recognise the fact that other speakers have their **rights** as well.

* This is a statement that well could have been ommitted 
Houston Oil and Minerals of the United States-80 per cent-and R. W. Miller (Holdings) 20 per cent- have received prospecting **rights** from the Queensland Government for the Oaky Creek coal field.

* And that thisis an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* The honourable member d:d not tell the House that it would be unconstitutional to interfere with State matters and **rights**.

* I note, in particular, the recommendations on the **rights** of franchisees, the liability of financiers for breach of consumer conditions and warranties, and the application of the Act to professional activities.

* This is the man who got up as the great proponent of the **rights** of the honourable members of this House.

* I also ask whether the Government has under consideration the restoration of the right of officers of the military forces to direct appeal to the GovernorGeneral not while making similar **rights** available to non-officer ranks.

* That is if the law has something to do with lands, **rights**, people and so on.

* The AttorneyGeneral, who was then just the honourable member for Wentworth, went on to say that of course a Federal Parliament which passes laws creating **rights**, duties and obligations, has a real consideration in relation to those citizens who are enforcing those **rights**.

* All the legislation gives him authority to do is to preserve officers' **rights** declarations.

* At the moment, of course, there are no **rights** possessed by anybody but the hope is that this Parliament eventually will create **rights** for social security beneficiaries and if that does happen the enforcement of those **rights** will become a special area of law.

* If democracy is whittled away the door will be open for the manipulation of criminal proceedings by the bureaucracy whose regard for the **rights** of the individual and the rule of law may, by the mere development of that bureaucratic system, end up being less than that which we have today.

* Certainly it was an interesting case and it does have implications for both employers and employees and the **rights** of the individual.

* As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition would know, the Bureau's work is primarily concerned with protecting the **rights** of individuals and protecting the status and **rights** of organisations where such **rights** and status are infringed.

* I have referred already to the protection of the **rights** of individuals.

* During the Labor Government's term of office, the **rights** of individuals were ignored and economic stability crumbled to meet the demands of the trade union movement.

* It is a procedural device to bolster the position of the Leader of the Opposition who realises not only his lack lustre performance during the past 12 months but also that the clouds of ideological differences within his own party, as illustrated by the motions on human **rights** of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party and the resolutions of other sections of the Labor Party, will come home to haunt him.

* The Government believes that education should aim to make good citizens, loyal citizens and able citizens - to make men and women who appreciate the need in our society of high moral values, respect for each other, respect for the **rights** of others and for the dignity of the individual.

* They are concerned that they will not have access to it and will not have the **rights** that they believe they should have in relation to the control of programs, the decision as to what should be put on, how it should be put on and who should put it on.

* Indeed, it will serve the function of educator of the people in relation to legal aid and legal **rights** and part of its function will be the researching of areas where social change for the benefit of the Aus.tralian disadvantaged can be effected through reforms in law and other legal means.

* Anybody looking at the provisions of section 5 1 of the Constitution will see that it is contemplated that the Australian Government will establish an Australian Government bank and an Australian Government insurance office, because the Constitution safeguards the **rights** of State government banks and State government insurance offices.

* The Prime Minister talks a lot about the obligations of the workers, their **rights** and their conditions.

* This legislation is vital if we are going to get anywhere in trying to make sure that the **rights** of ordinary people are protected.

* The Minister's statement does raise some serious and, we would say, possibly contentious questions which we can enumerate as follows: Firstly, public accountability of government in all of" its areas; secondly, freedom of information; thirdly, the **rights** of public servants; fourthly, Crown privilege; and fifthly, parliamentary privilege.

* Indeed to single out the spouse in this way surely must be offensive to those who are taking an interest in such matters as International Women's Year and in the **rights** of women and their position in the Australian community.

* I would emphasise the remarks made by the honourable member for Parramatta when he said that there was a need when considering this legislation to have an appreciation of the **rights** of the States.

* Icelandic flishermen claim a certain area which they say should be reserved and over which they should have fishing **rights** and the United Kingdom fishermen say that under an international agreement the waters claimed by Iceland as belonging to that country are international waters.

* The Commonwealth has no **rights** to interfere in the areas of local government or the many other services and facilities that are necessary for industry.

* The provision of statutory protection for trade marks used in respect of goods has assisted the traders involved by providing sufficiently easily enforceable proprietorial **rights** to discourage unfair trading.

* In the absence of statutory protection, such businesses have been forced to rely on their common law **rights** based on the reputation achieved by their marks.

* It should not be exercised to the detriment of the **rights** of Opposition members or back benchers.

* Parliament has certain **rights**.

* Those **rights** ought to be preserved.

* They have no guarantee of property **rights** or repatriation capital.

* The considerable body of scientific and technological expertise now existing in Australia has much to contribute to the achievements of acceptable balances between the needs and **rights** of consumers on the one hand and the problems of manufacturers on the other.

* The Australian Press on occasions seems to disregard the **rights** of private citizens.

* Not a word of protest was raised even though there was a statement in black and white - in all probability innocently written - admitting to an infringement upon the **rights** of the individual.

* But what worries me about the discretionary **rights** is highlighted in the Galston proposal.

* Turning to a more serious aspect of this subject, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Macquarie  (Mr Gillard)  who pointed out that the Government is not stripping away the **rights** to take leave of women in the Public Service who fall pregnant.

* This is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the **rights** of many citizens who only want to go about their own business.

* For a generation and more Australia shared with her Pacific partners a great delusion about our **rights**, our interests, our obligations.

* Those who acted for Australia as the government mistook entirely the nature of Australia's interests and obligations and her **rights**.

* By subclause (1) all contracts in restraint of trade or commerce are declared to be unlawful - insofar as that contract confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation.

* The people in the north have just as many **rights** as have those who travel between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane and generally in the southern area.

* In his view the business community can raise their prices while the rest of the community has no **rights** at all to raise their voices in opposition or indeed to organise themselves against the rises.

* This law is designed to deny **rights** to unionists.

* It does not give **rights** that do not already exist.

* The Bill then refers to the personal **rights** of people to join or not to join unions.

* In the second reading speech the Minister says: 
One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both **rights** and obligations: Those **rights** must be protected and the obligations must be met.

* There is another section of the Charter which speaks of the **rights** of the unborn, and that is an extremely mandatory section of the Charter.

* That is what the Bureau will be there for; not to make sure that the unions have their **rights** enforced, as an ombudsman is supposed to do.

* A power is given to the Industrial Court to order suspension of the **rights** and privileges of union officials, of the union itself or of its members.

* The **rights**, privileges or capacities of the organisation or any of its members can be suspended.

* The Court will have the power to give directions as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities and to restrict the use of funds or property of the organisation or a branch of the organisation.

* If you suspend the employment **rights** and privileges of the SEC workers who are all on strike- they are not covered by the award while they are on strike, anyway- how are you going to suspend any privileges which they have not virtually suspended for themselves?

* The only basis 1 can see on which we can do away with this requirement of renunciation in taking an oath or affirmation is a resolution of that problem with each of the countries which today fail to recognise what we see as the privileges and **rights** of an Australian citizen.

* He made an emotional plea for the **rights** of individuals.

* He spoke about the way in which these **rights** are being negated or neglected by the trade union movement.

* He has told us about **rights** which he believes are enshrined in these clauses of the Bill which are to be deleted.

* The **rights** about which he spoke are already enshrined in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* In the same way that the majority shareholders he mentioned are protected by rules, so are the **rights** of individual unionists.

* Also, I will be working in the closest consultation and co-operation with the Queensland Government to see that the terms of that special lease adequately secure the tenure of the people in those two places for the **rights** of occupation and use which they previously enjoyed.

* I submit to the Committee that in taking this legislation to the stage at which it is now before the chamber, the Government is merely providing for a punishment for persons for being members of a trade union, of a protective association for their **rights**.

* In that case action was taken to take away the accrued **rights** of a very prominent businessman,  Mr Gordon  Barton.

* I suppose he is looking after the **rights** and the role of the trade unionists.

* The **rights** of staff who may be members of the Commonwealth Public Service are protected and preserved.

* It is true that, while Part II relating to sovereignty and sovereign **rights** has been before us previously, the other Part relating to the mining code and setting out the details and specifications upon which recovery of minerals should be exercised is entirely new.

* As my colleague, the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  has outlined, there have been significant discussions in respect of Part II on the question of sovereignty and sovereign **rights**.

* Clause 7 requires the Commission to pay particular regard to the need for preservation of individual **rights** and liberties as far as practicable when proposals for reform are being developed.

* Of course, in the implementation of the socialist platform of the Labor Government, the powers and **rights** of the individuals of this country will be eroded.

* For if it makes sense to talk about **rights** at all, they can only be attributed to an individual which has certain characteristics, namely, those characteristics which make a person a person.

* But nothing as superficial as a shape or heart beat can be used in deciding the question of whether or not a foetus is a person who has **rights**.

* Thus a person is a moral agent with intelligence, aims and goals; who has the capacity for reasoning, willing, desiring and loving; who has the capacity to relate to and respond to others, lt is the existence of these characteristics which gives rise to **rights**, that is, a person has **rights** just because he has his own personality, because he is a mora) agent.

* In the current debate, the attribution of **rights** to a foetus has been thought to be justifiable on the grounds that a foetus is potentially a person.

* Thus unborn children have been recognised as acquiring **rights** or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, but the existence of these **rights** is contingent upon the child being born alive; that is, these **rights** are retrospective **rights**.

* Thus, if the foetus dies, it can have had no **rights** as a person and thus no right to survive.

* The Constitution does no: give the Commonwealth any power in this area and it remains one of the sovereign **rights** of the States to control production and to determine prices.

* They have no **rights** to our trade between Europe, Italy and Greece.

* The recognition of the **rights** of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way, free - 
Our National Estate is worthy of our cooperative actions to preserve and to protect for future generations.

* Confrontation can be avoided in CommonwealthState relations by genuine consultation, by a genuine respect for the **rights** and powers of others.

* The Government has said that if the Cocos (Keeling) Islands are under the control of the Australian Government it will, amongst other things, give the islanders land **rights**.

* We have heard in this place a tremendous lot about land **rights**.

* It is also said that we will do away with token currency and give islanders many other **rights**.

* Already we have foisted land **rights** legislation upon various people dwelling within Australia but are now finding that the land **rights** which were demanded ostensibly by the people concerned were not in fact demanded by them but by the organisations which were supposedly representing them.

* Those of us who live in the areas affected find that as time goes on it is becoming obvious that the people for whom the land **rights** legislation was passed are not being advantaged to the degree that many people in the south and elsewhere would have wished.

* I noticed in the  Sydney Morning Herald  of 22 June it was said that Australia will control the Cocos (Keeling) Islands within the year and there is mention of the islanders having land **rights** and so on.

* Nevertheless, I would like to see this Government not rush headlong into it in the way in which the Labor Government, and also the LiberalNational Country Party Government when it came to power, did with the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation without getting to the grass roots and taking notice of the opinions of those people whom that legislation is supposed to benefit, the Aborigines in the spinifex and in the bough shade miles away in the sticks.

* Ever ready to denounce the denial of human **rights** in Russia, China, North Vietnam and other communist countries, the former Government was noticeably reluctant to apply the same yardstick to South Africa, Rhodesia, Greece, Spain, Portugal and the Philippines.

* You have done nothing for the **rights** of back-benchers,  Mr Speaker.

* In addition, the Fund could be an excellent mechanism through which foreign investors, interested in investing in Australia but not seeking voting **rights**, could participate in Australian investments without diminishing the degree of Australian control in areas where that might be an important policy consideration.

* Firstly, I want to pay a tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  who, as a Minister in a former government, did more than any Minister in this place, before or since, to open up the whole question of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Having examined the record of the honourable gentleman's political colleagues,  Mr Justice  Woodward was quite emphatic in stating in his report that the future of Aboriginal land **rights** certainly did not rest, in terms of political judgments or the so-called compassion of members of the National Country Party, in the Northern Territory.

* Having had a look at the record, all I want to say is that honourable gentlemen opposite have discovered land **rights**.

* If it had not been for some of those members of the Labor Government speaking eloquently, passionately and almost with a minority voice in this Parliament, the granting of Aboriginal land **rights** would be 50 years away.

* The record condemns honourable gentlemen  opposite  who in 1972 were prepared to let their Prime Minister tell them, as he did on Australia Day- a symbolic day- that, as far as he was concerned, there would be no granting of Aboriginal land **rights** in Australia.

* I see this motion of the Leader of the House as a complete denial of the **rights** of individual parliamentarians.

* Let us leave this matter to be dealt with according to the law and the **rights** of the people rather than point to some nebulous scheme to solve a problem about which Opposition members have no knowledge.

* That is, if the Republic of Korea withdrew from the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty and from the safeguards regime, and if it further declined to accept the full scope safeguards required, Australia would have the capacity to exercise its safeguards or retrieval **rights** only in respect of, say, 40 per cent of the nuclear material.

* It will not consider the **rights** of the people who live in that area one bit.

* I also agree with the honourable member for Wentworth on the proposition that if the elimination of common law **rights** is not upheld constitutionally as being one of the powers of this Parliament, then the whole Bill has little point to it.

* The first question may be about Aboriginals, the next on the special drawing **rights** created by the International Monetary Fund, and the third question may be on skeleton weed in the Mallee.

* They are based upon deep professional experience and they evince a greater concern for the needs of the student than for the **rights** of the teacher.

* The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment for the simple reason that what is not required, particularly in dealing with matters of this nature which require compassion, understanding and a certain amount of flexibility, is putting down in legal terms what will be the strict limitations of a person's **rights**.

* I think that is an unnecessary curtailment of the **rights** of the Aboriginal people to form an Aboriginal Council even though a local government exists in the area.

* So, while the Minister talks about selfmanagement and the Prime Minister talks about turning points and **rights**, their ruthless actions make a mockery of their rhetoric.

* I find it repugnant that 124 men in this House- no women- are passing judgment on women's **rights**.

* It will enforce consumers' **rights** by examining unsatisfactory trade practices and taking legal action when necessary.

* This Bill provides the greatest step forward so far taken in protecting the **rights** to which we as consumers and as members of the Australian public are entitled.

* These benefits will be available under legislation being prepared to implement the preservation of pension **rights**.

* In regard to education, the Leader of the Opposition would set up a huge commission in Canberra to control all education in Australia, taking away all State **rights** - that is what it would mean with control in Canberra - and indeed the inalienable right of parents to send their children to whichever school they choose.

* We have to start to stand up for our **rights**.

* One could never have expected that so much destruction of individual and States' **rights** could have been achieved in such a short time.

* By handing over to the Queensland Government the three-mile offshore territorial waters, as the Prime Minister will do within the next three months, he is virtually handing the Gulf Oil Company the mining **rights** to the Great Barrier Reef on a gold platter.

* The Gove judgment, which did not accept Aboriginal sovereignty over the Gove Peninsula, has given rise to land **rights** claims based on moral justice.

* The Government has now established the Woodward Commiission to inquire into land **rights** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* non-alienable non-transferable **rights** vested in the Aborigines in respect of the land which they have traditionally occupied.

* I noted with some interest the final paragraph of the second reading speech by the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland),  on behalf of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  in which he commended the Bill to the House and drew our attention to the desirability of early approval of the Bill in order to enable the Treasurer to exercise the proposed increased voting **rights** for AustraUa at the next regular election of executive directors of the Fund and the Bank in September.

* The second and perhaps the more important for a country such as Australia is that it determines the number of voting **rights** that we have in the Fund.

* We are fighting for the **rights** which belong to every human being - the right to be left alone, the right to grow and develop in the way we choose, the right to give our people the chance freely to select the government they want.

* The second fact is that in the past there has been a denial of student status and student **rights** by some university administrations around the country to those students who refused to pay the compulsory student union levy.

* It is to safeguard students' **rights**.

* It has been the usual thing in the past for the ABC to televise this event, but this year the country dweller was denied the privilege of seeing it because metropolitan-based commercial interests were able to obtain exclusive **rights** to the event-.

* In relation to that point I refer to the Australian Broadcasting Commission annual report in which some comments are made on this matter of sporting **rights**.

* The report states: 
The rising cost of **rights** to provide coverage of major sporting events on television continues to concern the Commission.

* For this reason, the ABC's ability to secure the **rights** to televise major national and international sporting event, to an Australia-wide audience is at growing risk.

* The effect of this process is that the ABC is subject in, for instance, the case of the 1978 Wimbledon tennis championships to criticism for not televising events in some States and many country areas not covered by the commercial television networks when they purchase exclusive Australian **rights**.

* House, the supposed guardians of the **rights** and privileges of the members of this Parliament.

* As was said elsewhere, and I think said well: 'The **rights** and privileges of members of parliament are peculiarly matters for the Parliament to consider and there should not be an infringement of these **rights** and privileges, whatever that infringement might be, without proper consultation and discussion with the members of the Parliament'.

* We are in great danger in this House of drifting into a situation whereby the incantation of the word 'terrorism' will serve the coalition to stifle **rights** and liberties, even **rights** and liberties of members of this Parliament, just as the incantation of the word 'communism' was used in the 1950s and 1960s to stifle **rights** and liberties.

* The Government is determined to relegate migrants, in particular migrant women, to the role of factory fodder, to the role of second class citizens unable to communicate their needs, unable to demand their **rights**.

* In implementing the Galbally Report on Post-Arrival Services and Programs for Migrants, the Government is committed to improving information services to migrants to enable them to take their place in society, partake of its benefits, exercise their **rights** and discharge their duties.

* The Bill before us takes away a little of what **rights** existed before.

* It was a pretence of the former Attorney-General that one of the purposes of the Bill was to define **rights** a little more clearly.

* In no way does it enlarge or protect any **rights**.

* It is always assumed by governments like the McMahon Government to be disorder or subversion although all the **rights**, privileges, living standards and money that most Government supporters enjoy have been won in the past by other people, by earlier generations, with precisely this kind of action.

* In some countries, unlike the common law countries of which we pride ourselves to be one, the **rights** of free speech and assembly are protected.

* That is the slender thread upon which the inalienable **rights** to free speech and assembly hang in Australia.

* Such an authority could ensure that the public was fully consulted, that the **rights** of the community and of individuals were upheld, and that land values were regulated so that some individuals did not gain unearned windfalls from taxpayers' money.

* It is extremely important that that sort of assistance be given by the Australian Government and that environmental impact studies and public inquiries be carried out if all people in the community are to have their **rights** observed and the community **rights** observed.

* I therefore think it appropriate to state at the outset the total commitment of the Opposition Parties to the development and maintenance of laws which effectively protect the **rights** of consumers in a society in which consumers are being increasingly offered a wider range of goods and services and are increasingly confronted with sophisticated sales techniques in both design and promotion.

* We believe that such conditions of free choice can exist only where a consumer has been adequately informed as to the choices available to him and is not influenced in his decision to purchase products by coercive or misleading conduct 
The Opposition will support and facilitate proper and reasonable legislation to protect the **rights** of consumers throughout Australia.

* At least I hope it will never be made more restrictive in respect of the **rights** of Aboriginal people.

* The third claim of a commitment fulfilled related to land **rights**.

* We all know what this Government did to the Labor Government's achievements in the area of land **rights**.

* The Labor Government was pressing negotiations for full land **rights** and equal land **rights** in the States.

* There have been no achievements in that area, except the watering down of the Labor Government Bill, making less broad land **rights** harder to obtain.

* Let the Minsiter tell the people of Borroloola about bis Government's achievements in land **rights**.

* Surely there is an alternative way of safeguarding the interests and the **rights** of the Japanese beef producer.

* I recognise that he has these **rights**.

* There is no point in talking about the **rights** of States in education if the States are coming begging to the Commonwealth for assistance and if the Commonwealth is prepared to recognise its obligation to provide that assistance.

* I ask honourable members opposite to stop resorting to stone age concepts of State **rights** and State obligations and to recognise that here is a situation where the States have actually asked the Commonwealth to sit down with them, .work but their needs and give them the money.

* From discussions with people involved in the land **rights** issue and from discussions with people in the Northern Territory, when I visited there recently to look at matters concerning Aboriginal affairs, I know that he is highly regarded for his consultative approach and his sensitive appreciation of the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal communities.

* Under that Bill its members had **rights** to workers compensation, weekly payments, lump sum payments and recognition of compensation for specific injuries or disease, none of which is now recognised because of the delay in dealing with this legislation which was passed unopposed in this House 2 months ago.

* The action they should be encouraged to take is to teach a lesson to those members in the other place who are prepared to deny **rights** to others.

* Again I repeat and I will repeat it for the next 3 years, if this Government goes that long, that not for a moment do we on this side of the House fail to recognise the **rights** and entitlements of people in the cities and provincial areas.

* The Bill* ensures that the existing **rights** of administrators to contest decisions of the Commissioner before a board of review, a valuation board or a court, where those decisions affect the liability of the estate for duty, are available in relation to the allowance of the proposed rebate.

* No Bill should be pushed into law unless it is clear to the average person what is meant by it and unless the business people who must carry on commerce and trade and matters of that kind know precisely what are their legal **rights** and obligations.

* With the delay that has taken place in having such authority enacted, one must be concerned as to whether the **rights** of the survey parties and the landowners have been protected during this somewhat twilight period for this Bill.

* 1 sincerely hope these **rights** have been safeguarded and I would welcome clarification on these points from the Minister about what will happen to departmental officers against whom action may be taken in a court of competent jurisdiction.

* If these repetitive activities are to move on smoothly and efficiently the originally marked stations must also be preserved intact for continuing use by surveyors who must therefore also have reasonable **rights** of access to these sites.

* Hitler decided that all Jews did not have the right to life and so they were disposed of, with even less **rights** than animals.

* However, of course, in Australia today the father has absolutely no **rights** at all and has absolutely no say in whether his unborn baby will live or die.

* I have heard arguments over the years about women's **rights** and all sorts of **rights**.

* It has **rights**.

* Until you can guarantee to the particular group its right to particular land you have not given them land **rights** at all.

* That is in a sense a mere matter of form so far as land **rights** are concerned.

* But there is nothing in the measure that gives **rights** to particular groups, to particular traditional owners.

* They have no **rights** at all in this legislation as far as I can find.

* I only add that not to bore the Committee but simply to explain what I meant and why I feel that these provisions, which are really the whole basis of the land **rights** question, need further consideration.

* I acknowledge the need for informal proceedings but there are certain basic **rights** like the right to be heard, the right to know that there is a hearing, the right to bring some evidence, for instance.

* There are certain basic **rights** that we all think are important, and they are just as important to the Aboriginal people in the context of giving them land **rights** as they are to us.

* We have **rights** over it'.

* However I believe there is immense lack of dignity in the situation of half a million migrants who live in this country without the vote because nobody has bothered to go and talk to them, to explain what their **rights** are and to help them take out citizenship if they decide they want to.

* Why can we not have an advertising program on ethnic radio and in the ethnic Press to inform people of their **rights** and, indeed, in the electoral field, to inform people from Commonwealth countries of their obligations.

* Unfortunately, most people look upon their own **rights** as being divine and on the **rights** of other people as being unnecessary or wasteful.

* There have been abuses in the past in respect of **rights** of individuals unfortunately from people who occupy very senior positions in this Government.

* The scheme aims to encourage Australian exporters to seek out and develop overseas markets for products, services, industrial property **rights** and know-how which are substantially of Australian origin.

* In the case of earnings derived from eligible industrial property **rights** or know-how, a lesser amount of $10,000 has been determined.

* I know that the Opposition, with its typically centralist approach, ignores the sovereign **rights** and responsibilities of the States and the lack of jurisdiction by the Commonwealth.

* Labor would favour the **rights** of unionists above non-unionists.

* There was one thing which came ringing through the speech of the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  that State **rights** transcend human **rights**.

* We do not have much concern for the protocols and precedents of the constitutional situation here; we are concerned with the **rights** of people.

* It is one of the principal **rights** of an Opposition to move such motions.

* At one stage the company was granted **rights** to operate flights between Adelaide and Melbourne, Melbourne and Sydney, Sydney and Brisbane and Brisbane and Rockhampton.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* However, the wilful misuse of paragraph (b) could mean that the democratic elected **rights** of the people of the Northern Territory, in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, could see themselves without any responsibility to make laws for the order and good government of the Territory.

* I believe that the clause could be redrawn in a form which would ask but not instruct the Legislative Assembly to reconsider the appropriateness of a Territory law in view of the Commission's functions and activities and recommend that the Territory consider either repeal or amendment, so as to help the Commission but in no way impinging on the democratic **rights** of the people of the Northern Territory.

* We seek to preserve the democratic **rights** of the citizens who will be affected by the operations of this Bill.

* I know that it can be argued, probably successfully, that towards the end of a session honourable members have always taken the opportunity - indeed they have been forced to take it - to protest at the Government's attitude in curtailing the business of the House, thus restricting the **rights** and opportunities of honourable members to speak.

* I believe, as the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  has so often said in this House, that the **rights** of honourable members are being denied to them by the Government.

* The Government pays this money in this hope and with this intention but the legal **rights** in respect of the surviving partner are not determined by this Government and are not under its control, 1 will, however, have a look not only at the particular case mentioned by the honourable member but at the principle involved and although I do not think any legal action is available to me, I will see what can be done, without a great hope of being able to accomplish anything.

* Because of the Government's recognition of the **rights** of the States, however, legislation regarding off-shore industry vessels and collision regulations has been excluded from this Bill.

* The finder may acquire salvage **rights** under the Navigation Act, the United Kingdom Merchant Shipping Acts, or at common law before the wreck is declared historic.

* As salvage **rights** or liabilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic are to be preserved, clause 26 also makes express provision for this purpose.

* It will be open to a person whose proprietary **rights** are affected by the operation of the Historic Shipwrecks Act to claim under the compensation provisions of that Act.

* The policy underpinning the legislation is a firm recognition that Australia has vital interests at stake in foreign takeovers and the ownership and control of Australian industry and that those **rights** should be protected.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* This Parliament can operate only if each of us understands that every honourable member has **rights** even if that honourable member is not a member of the Government Parties.

* the right, in the form of an option, to acquire property or the right for a repayment of a loan or **rights** attendant on shares which the deceased had at the time of his death.

* Has the Australian Government studied the purpose of the levy; if so, does it intend to emulate the action already taken by other bauxite-producing countries, of compelling the multinational corporations, which now share a joint monopoly over alumina and aluminium production, to make a greater financial contribution to the Australian people for the benefits they derive from their exclusive **rights** to exploit Australian bauxite resources?

* If the Regent Theatre, as a consequence of the National Trust classification, is designated as a Historic Building in the terms of the recent Historic Buildings Act 1974, the amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act 1 96 1 set down in the Act make it possible for the Minister to permit the unused plot ratio or development **rights** on the site of a designated building to be transferred to another site and sold in order to bring about the preservation of the designated building.

* The last two of the Horbury Terrace nos 171-173 Macquarie Street have been preserved with a covenant that requires the owner to restore and maintain the facades and the balance of the development **rights** have been transferred to an office building in Put Street.

* The amendments to the Town and Country Planning Act provide for the approval of a building of a greater than normally prescribed height and size where the application for the permit is made with the consent of the owner of other land in the City of Melbourne on which a designated building is situated- that is the unused development **rights** are transferred  from  the designated building to another site.

* The sale of the development **rights** would compensate the owner of the designated building for his inability to develop his site to the maximum and help make it possible for him to preserve the designated building.

* 7.30 Although the principle may be clear and is given the public seal of approval in the Historic Buildings Act there are, however, difficult detail problems not yet solved in this system of transferring and selling development **rights**.

* The Town Hall is a Classified Building and is on the list of buildings proposed to be designated under the Act but it is not proposed that the unused development **rights** at a Floor Space Ratio of 10 to 1 on the Town Hall site should be available for sale!

* The method of valuation is complicated enough if the development **rights** are transferred to a site with the same square foot value in an area with the same Floor Space Ratio or Plot Ratio.

* Development **rights** bought would be cheaper in one sense than land if held over a period as presumably municipal rates and taxes would not be levied on them until used.

* On the other hand it is doubtful if transferred development **rights** would ever be worth the maximum equivalent in land value.

* At 50 per cent of the equivalent land value corresponding to this area of space the value of the development **rights** available for transfer is in the order of $8.5m.

* If the amount of the Star Insurance Co. settlement of $ 1 ,050,000 and the lower estimated amount of $1.4m from the sale of development **rights** are both put towards the equity required there would be insufficient equity by the normal standards of the market place to raise a sufficiently large mortgage to carry out the development.

* However, the proportion of mortgage to equity is not fixed in heaven but dependent on the investor and could be varied to give the Council a larger mortgage perhaps in return for the sale of the development **rights** to the investor at a discounted price.

* 7.34 The most likely and logical purchaser of any space available for transfer, the T &amp; G Mutual Life Society Ltd, raised the question of purchase of development **rights** during discussion with us and expressed interest but as stated earlier they have no intention of redeveloping their site for 8 or 10 years.

* If the T &amp; G are keen to secure an option to purchase the available developments **rights** they could be approached to provide all or pan of the finance required for the development in return for such an option.

* The option could be to purchase any or all of the development **rights** at a price to be fixed at the time of purchase on a valuation formula to be agreed.

* The Developer would pay the Council a Ground Rent calculated on the basis that the excess development **rights** would be transferred to other developments being carried out by the same Developer.

* The oppressive operation of rent controls has for a long time transferred property **rights** in housing from the owner who financed it to the tenant.

* I would be among the very last in this place who would want in any way to cut down, truncate or minimise the **rights** of members.

* States' **rights** are overridden.

* States **rights** are completely overridden.

* The Bill must clearly establish that it is not attempting to encroach upon an individual's **rights** or privilege to be, if we care to use the expression, 'frivolous'.

* Similarly clause 10 of the Bill, which concerns the **rights** to equality before the law, is I believe somewhat confusing in its drafting in that it appears to discriminate in favour of a minority.

* I want water conservation plans updated to ensure the **rights** of the municipalities and the people within them and a guarantee that there will be no retardation of their natural growth.

* In the view of the Government it will, when it comes into operation, provide a generous and modern scheme of workers' compensation for Commonwealth Employees; one that will remedy many defects of the present legislation and clearly define and protect the **rights** of employees.

* -As I have suggested there are, tragically, many countries where the standard of human **rights** on which we insist in this country are not observed and, tragically, some of those countries are in our own region.

* We cannot, nor should we, impose our system on other countries but I must, as an individual and as a member of the Government, say that we would hope that the statements that have been made by, in particular, the  President  of the United States of America with respect to human **rights** might be observed by those countries which at this stage do not observe our system relating to the rule of law and the protection of the **rights** of the individual.

* In 1 977 the Council of the Australian National University adopted new fee rules which provided for exemption from compulsory membership of and payment of fees to approved student bodies and gave **rights** of appeal to any students dissatisfied with decisions on these issues.

* Did Australia at the recent meetings of the International Monetary Fund indicate any firm view on the following matters: Expansion in the amount of special drawing **rights** and their allocation; variations in the price of gold; the floating of the Australian exchange rate, either managed or freely determined, sometimes described as dirty or clean; the removal of the surcharges on American imports; and control over capital movements?

* It should seek to embody and to express the highest values and aspirations within the communityrespect for the dignity of individuals and the **rights** of nations, a concern for the peaceful and just resolution of conflicts and the impulse to cooperate with and to assist less fortunately placed countries.

* In fact in recent testimony on human **rights** in Kampuchea the conclusion of a United States State Department official as to the estimate of the number of people who were thought to have perished in Kampuchea was that, while there was no way to confirm a precise figure, the number of deaths appeared to be in the tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands.

* We condemn in the strongest possible terms such cruel and unnecessary actions wherever they may occur and appeal to the Government of Kampuchea to respect international human **rights** principles.

* His  Honour wrestled with the question as to the nature of the **rights** which Aboriginals should have to minerals that might be found within Aboriginal land.

* For example, if we look at a number of awards and agreements we find that there is a great area where nothing is said, where the intent is left in some doubt, where there is no clear definition of the **rights** or responsibilities of either party.

* The recognition of the **rights** of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way free from government and judicial interference and at the same time expanding the role of the Industrial Registrar in advising on matters relating to rules so that unions will have access to information and independent advice which will allow them - 
The question was raised on a matter which took place a long time ago on the matter of the riots amongst the Mataungans on the Gazelle Peninsula.

* Gazelle Peninsula and police had been moved about to prevent squatters from taking up government kind, to prevent **rights** between rival groups of Mataungans, to prevent civil disorder generally.

* Hand in hand with these negotiations must go a beginning to the task of reforming the world currency system - a move, perhaps, towards something in the nature of an 'SDR standard" or special drawing **rights** standard - if some measure of stability in exchange rates, albeit with a greater flexibility than now, is to be achieved.

* The effect of this liberalisation over the years has been considerable, to the point where today a married couple can have an income of up to $46.50 a week or can own property worth $24,580 before they lose all **rights** to a pension of any kind.

* We are saying that certainly the Aborigines have land **rights**, but that the land should be allocated in a fair way and in accordance with what the real Aborigines believe and want.

* This constant attack upon States **rights** may continue, but I think it is about time that the people were made aware that these bloody-minded attacks are being made merely for political purposes.

* Let there be no mistake; by giving transit **rights** to the New Zealand Rugby team, the Fraser Government is deliberately condoning sporting contacts with South Africa.

* For the past two weeks,  Dr Kissinger  has been working to avert racial conflict in Africa and impress upon the regime in Rhodesia and the Government in South Africa the need for toleration and respect for the **rights** of the African people.

* No one, except the National Country Party, is prepared to say that the **rights** of people, the interests of people, should come before theories based on numbers and an irrational attachment to an allegedly sacred principle- a principle which, in practice, is not applied.

* They started before the election and demanded **rights** equal to those which had been given to the ALP members who had been allocated the relieving typing pool to help them in their bid for re-election.

* The same thing would have happened in South Australia except for the outspokenness displayed by the honourable member for Boothby and  Senator Jessop  and their preparedness to stand up for their **rights**.

* I ask him: How long would it take to include these younger citizens on the electoral rolls for any State where they are given adulthood **rights** and a vote for the more numerous house of the State Parliament and where, under section 41 of the Constitution, they cannot be prevented from voting at elections for either House of this Parliament?

* Against that background, it ought not be forgotten that the law in this field is a social instrument by which **rights** of parties during marriage and upon divorce are established.

* Therefore, when legislation is introduced in the name of social reform, it is proper to ask these questions: What new **rights** are created?

* What old **rights** and responsibilities does it remove or lessen?

* I hear them saying: 'Everything was fine until you started to talk land **rights**.

* Let me tell honourable members opposite on their behalf that they are not going to deter them from their objectives, from their **rights** and from the Government's objective of giving effect to the Woodward principles.

* Unreasonable obstruction' means an act or thing done by a person that constitutes, or contributes to, an obstruction of, or interference with, the exercise or enjoyment by other personsof their lawful **rights** or privileges (including **rights** of passage along the public streets) where, having regard to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and nature, it constitutes an unreasonable obstruction or interference, and 'unreasonably obstructs' has a corresponding meaning.

* 1 refer specifically to the announcement by the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Senator Cotton)  on 17th March that Australia had granted landing **rights** to World Airways for the purpose of bringing 21 special inclusive tour charter flights from the United States to Australia.

* We all know that last year New Zealand authorities lost faith with the Australian policy and granted World Airways landing **rights** in their country.

* I am all for this attitude and hold the view that the United States would be unreasonable if it was to withhold these **rights** from our country's national airline.

* I am eager to campaign even more strongly for the **rights** of Qantas in this respect than I have in the past for permission to be given to American based charter operators to come to Australia.

* Another topic that the Prime Minister has raised from time to time as an issue of some compassionate concern to him is that of human **rights** in countries within our region.

* There is not one country in the South East Asian region where serious and extensive breaches of fundamental human **rights** do not take place.

* I recognise the limitations on a country such as Australia seeking to lecture developing countries on the issue of human **rights**.

* The International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International have documented the extent of the repression of human **rights** in these various countries.

* It draws attention to the fact that we must safeguard the environment of the national parks and in particular we must protect Aboriginal **rights**.

* That is one of the most important **rights** which should be guarded by all men and women.

* Then there was the suffragette movement, the movement for women's **rights**.

* The basic human **rights**- to work, to establish a family and to enjoy the benefits of creative leisure- are not privileges for the few although there are those who think they are.

* One of the tragedies of parliamentary life is that so few people are interested in the intrusion into the **rights** of the individual.

* I wonder whether, despite the provisions of the legislation, members of the Australian Federal Police will be able to resist the temptation to pass on to their State counterparts information which they have accidentally gathered as a result of the special **rights** now being given to them to assist them in their pursuit of narcotics dealers.

* There is great concern not only on my part but on the part of the trade union movement about this legislation because it does infringe upon the **rights** of working people in this country and other countries- **rights** that were fought for 100 and more years ago; **rights** that people believe are entrenched.

* The Government's approach in the preparation of the legislation has been to strike a balance between the need to regulate insurance companies and the preservation of the **rights** of those companies to carry on business in a free enterprise environment.

* Other provisions deal with the responsibilities and **rights** of company officers and report by the inspector to the Treasurer.

* at the relevant time, the affairs or business operations of the company were managed or conducted without proper regard to the **rights**, powers or interests of a natural person who was, or natural persons who were, at the relevant time, capable of controlling the voting power in the company, either directly or through one or more interposed companies, trustees or partnerships.

* "(3) Paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) applies notwithstanding that the income referred to in that paragraph was derived by the company in the course of ordinary family or commercial dealing, but that paragraph does not apply in a case where the natural person or natural persons who had shareholding interests in the company immediately before, and immediately after, the time when the income was derived will benefit from the derivation of the income to an extent that the Commissioner considers to be fair and reasonable having regard to voting, dividend or capital **rights** attached to the shares in respect of which that person or those persons had shareholding interests in the company immediately after the time when the income was derived.

* "(4) Paragraph (f) of sub-section (1) applies notwithstanding that the loss or outgoing referred to in that paragraph was incurred by the company in the course of ordinary family or commerical dealing, but that paragraph does not apply in a case where the natural person or natural persons who had shareholding interests in the company immediately before, and immediately after, the time when the loss or outgoing was incurred will benefit from any profit or advantage that has, or might, arise, directly or indirectly, from the incurring of the loss or outgoing to an extent that the Commissioner considers to be fair and reasonable having regard to voting, dividend or capital **rights** attached to the shares in respect of which that person or those persons had shareholding interests in the company immediately after the time when the loss or outgoing was incurred.

* On the other hand the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  the conflicting names of honourable members and electorates is terribly confusing- spoke about the question of land **rights**.

* The only piece of legislation that I can think of that does this at the present time is the Commonwealth Bank Act which spells out the duty of the Board as follows: 
I expect that somebody with a flair for English could express in similar terms what land **rights** are about, and that could be written into the preamble of the Bill.

* In regard to compensation for injury, is the Corporation required to give proper notice to its employees as to their **rights** such as is required by Workers Compensation Acts.

* I particularly want to put a case on behalf of the **rights** of consumers of air services.

* He further considered that if people pay rent they have tenant **rights**, and the Press should never have a tenant right in this place.

* Not one constructive proposal has been put forward by them as to how this legislation could be made better in respect of the **rights** of ownership of Aboriginal people.

* I make this kind of speech -I know that my colleagues support me - to register our protest at the interference with the **rights** of the next Government of this country in not letting it legislate properly in accordance with the accepted practice of all democratic parliaments.

* People must realise their **rights**.

* Customs officers only have **rights** bestowed upon them by a parliament.

* I would not be at all surprised if it went to that point because I believe, and I know that the honourable member for Hughes believes, that the **rights** of the ordinary individual must be protected by honourable members of good will on both sides of the House.

* The Act was introduced following an announcement by the former Prime Minister of the introduction of a scheme for the control of foreign takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares or assets, including mineral **rights**.

* I do not intend to pursue a discussion on the Constitution or a discussion as to the **rights** of governments or lower houses under the Constitution; I intend to deal with what I believe is the one overriding, pervasive requirement imposed on governments in this place.

* Let it be said that this package of measures at least attempts to lay down a charter for ASIO and a definition of its functions, the extent of its powers and the **rights** of citizens with respect to the Organisation.

* These agencies have been used by at least one American President to deny American citizens their democratic **rights**, and in fact used by him to corrupt the electoral process which is surely at the heart of the democratic system.

* What has to be kept secure is not simply a physical entity; the society which exists within Australia is one with standards and principles which secure **rights** and freedoms as well as obligations.

* That society is not to be safeguarded by a repudiation of those standards or those principles with the consequent erosion of **rights** and freedoms.

* Moreover, the Ranger Inquiry's recommendations have been made on the basis that the Government's recognition of Aboriginal land **rights**, through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, is, in the Inquiry's words, 'a uniquely favourable factor'.

* Let me remind the honourable member for Port Adelaide of what  Mr Munro  said in his appendix to the report of the royal commission when dealing with the **rights**, obligations, grievances and remedies of and against staff.

* I also hold the view that, because there have been events within our country and elsewhere, one should not simply abandon for all times the **rights** of all individuals.

* They have a lot of intestinal fortitude and they do not give up their **rights** and privileges easily.

* The draft called for the voting **rights** and WHO services to Israel to be suspended until Israel complied with the resolutions of the Organization and relevant international conventions.

* If so, will this eventually entail acquisition of land and some share in mineral **rights** from the States by the Commonwealth Government.

* When will Aboriginal people in Western Australia and Queensland have the same land **rights** as those in the Northern Territory.

* Apart from that, of course, we have to consider the **rights** of males.

* If we look at places like Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen, Sachsenhausen and Ravensbruck and visit the memorial to these places in Jerusalem today - because it was mainly Jews who suffered - we can see the prime importance of not allowing ourselves - in certain circumstances - to be down-trodden and deprived of our **rights** by a law, but I maintain that there is nothing in Australia today which can be remotely compared with the situation in Nazi Germany.

* The operating **rights** of companies whose planes insist on violating the noise limit should be cancelled.

* The purpose of the proposals contained in this Report is to strike a proper and fair balance between the needs of a disciplined force and the **rights** of the community it serves.

* Complaints do occur and are likely to increase with growing knowledge of and sensitivity to **rights**.

* His  authority is original not delegated and is exercised at his own discretion by virtue of his office: he is a ministerial officer exercising statutory **rights** independently of contract.

* "(3) The provisions of this Division, in so far as they confer **rights** on persons with respect to action taken by a police officer- 
he has been, for a period of not less than 5 years, a legal practitioner. "

* ( 1 ) The appointment of a person as a member, or the service of a person as a member, does not affect his tenure of ajudicial office or office under an Act or his rank, title, status, precedence, salary, annual or other allowances or other **rights** or privileges as the holder of a judicial office or office under an Act and, for all purposes, his service as a member of the Tribunal shall be taken to be service as the holder of his judicial office or other office.

* It has been suggested that it is wrong to interfere with the freedom of individual Australians, that perhaps we should not prevent them from engaging in activities overseas, that it would be contrary to their individual **rights**, but if we consider the question we realise that we are talking about the right to engage in hostile activities of the nature described.

* Surely if we are talking about the **rights** of those people whom we are anxious to protect in that regard, we must look at the **rights** of the rest of mankind who will be on the receiving end of that hostile activity.

* They have **rights** as well.

* Might I take the opportunity also to counsel people who are commenting on Aboriginal affairs policy in Australia and claiming that in the area of land **rights** there is a suggestion of separatism.

* I might say also that if anyone suggests that the land **rights** policy, particularly the kind of land **rights** which this Government has introduced in the Northern Territory, is a policy of separatism he might just as well say that the policies of all governments, both State and Commonwealth, for the past 60-odd years which set aside special areas as reserves are policies of separatism.

* I think that when the land **rights** policy of the present Government, as shown through the land **rights** legislation, is properly understood it will be seen that it not only acknowledges the Aborigines traditional relationship with land but also can provide the Aborigines, on a basis of equality, with a firm economic foundation for their future development.

* It has been pointed out in this place that there is some constitutional doubt as to the validity of this Bill and that if the High Court decides that the Bill does not abolish common law **rights** and clauses 92 and so on of the Bill are therefore invalid, very grave consequences will occur to the Australian economy.

* If they were brought out to listen to the Minister speaking in defence of individuals like the honourable member for Moreton, it would be legitimate for people to defend their own **rights** in considering what they had to consider in terms of legitimate union business.

* I am raising a question which is of great interest to you,  Mr Speaker,  and that is the **rights** of honourable members to alter their speeches in Hansard.

* No doubt you,  Mr Speaker,  as the custodian of the **rights** of this House, will look into this.

* Then a site was found about 20 miles from 
I might also add that most of the non-bank financial institutions are subject to supervision under State or Territory laws concerning the **rights** of borrowers and lenders and the financial stability of companies.

* In the United States there were race riots at Watts and Newark, racial murders, the burning of towns and portions of towns, massive civil disobedience and' civil **rights** riots in Chicago at the Democratic Convention.

* I do not intend to debate the **rights** and wrongs of what is happening in the United States.

* I well recall the speech last Thursday evening by the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Yates),  who pointed out to the House that we cannot allow to persist such a practice as is being pursued at the moment  by  the two front benches, otherwise the private members of the Parliament will lose all place in this Parliament and will have no **rights** whatever.

* In the light of Soviet Russia's minimal human **rights** obligations under the 1975 Helsinki Accord, what assessment has Australia made of the genuineness and sincerity or otherwise of Soviet Russia following the fake trial and savage sentence of imprisonment imposed on  Dr Yuri  Orlov?

* -I would have thought that the Australian Labor Party would have appreciated the fact that people in the Northern Territory have **rights**.

* They are the **rights** which the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory recommend should be conferred on the people of the Northern Territory.

* Whilst he is entitled to that view, he is not entitled to deny Territorians their **rights**.

* This is a tyranny of the majority - a complete denial of the **rights** of the minority within a democratic society.

* After all, what I am talking to honourable members about tonight are the **rights** of individuals in the Australian society.

* that a Bill of Rights for Norfolk Islanders be included in the Bill, ensuring, in particular, the recognition of the island as the historical homeland of the Pitcairners and the protection of their remaining **rights**; 
The Executive Council has no defined Cabinet role.

* But it is necessary that there be a special provision for the people of Norfolk Island, as an Australian Bill of Rights would fail to take into account the special **rights** of the descendants of the Pitcairn Islanders who were given the island by Queen Victoria in 1865.

* These special **rights** are principally land **rights**.

* that a Bill of Rights for Norfolk Islanders be included in the Bill, ensuring, in particular, the recognition of the island as the historical homeland of the Pitcairners and the protection of their remaining **rights**; 
I say this to those gentlemen who talk about a democratic society: Ask the oppressed peoples who sometimes have to survive in a democratic society; ask the Aborigines about a democratic society; ask those who are getting angry at being denied their **rights**.

* If these mineral **rights** are to be taxed and the Aboriginal people are to suffer some deprivation in not receiving enough money for their social work, schools or anything else they require, then of course it is a matter for regret.

* The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human **rights** and democracy in this nation.

* Many electors in the outer suburbs of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, in particular, are clearly not enjoying anything like equality of political **rights** with electors in many other divisions.

* Companies holding current onshore petroleum exploration or mining licences, permits, leases, **rights** or interests therein are issued and registered under State mining laws will be able to take advantage of the concession.

* The United States and some other maritime states however have expressed opposition to Canada's action in legislating unilaterally in such a way as might deprive other states of what they assert to be their established fishing **rights** under international law.

* The fishing **rights** to which Australia is.

* The Liberal Party has always believed in the protection of State **rights** because we believe they are essential in the best administration of government and the promotion of the **rights** of individuals.

* We have accepted in principle the report of  Mr Justice  E. A. Woodward on land **rights** for Aborigines.

* Australia has been prominent in expressing concern about violations of human **rights** and upholding the right of all peoples to live in dignity and freedom.

* Australia had made known her attitude towards the detention of political prisoners and supported United Nations resolutions condemning the violations of human **rights** in Chile.

* We shall mark the 26th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights next Tuesday by becoming a party to 2 significant international conventions on the civil **rights** of women, the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women.

* Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Court, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews ' and 'Communists' were no longer full citizens entided to rely on **rights** previously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act.

* by omitting from sub-section (1) the definitions of 'services' and 'share' and substituting the following definitions:- ' "services" includes any **rights** (including **rights** and interests in relation to real or personal property), benefits, privileges or facilities that are to be provided, granted or conferred in trade or commerce and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes the **rights**, benefits, privileges or facilities that are to be provided, granted or conferred under- 
the conferring of **rights**, benefits or privileges for which remuneration is payable in the form of a royalty, tribute, levy or similar exaction; 
1 ) Omit from the proposed definition of 'services' all the words occurring after the word 'includes' and before paragraph (a) of the proposed definition, substitute 'any **rights** (including **rights** in relation to, and interests in, real or personal property), benefits, privileges or facilities that are, or are to be, provided, granted or conferred in trade or commerce, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes the **rights**, benefits, privileges or faculties that are, or are to be, provided, granted or conferred under-'.

* I stand as far as possible from that position of spineless pity in which our humanitarians take such pride, in which values and responsibilities change places, all crimes become equal, and innocence ultimately forfeits all **rights**.

* An even more despicable action by the Minister has been the abolition of the concession on the sale of mining **rights** allowed to those prospectors who, once in a lifetime, discover an economic mining project.

* It seems to me to be imperative, considering the makeup of our economy, that when we are dealing with manpower programs and trying to monitor the work force we involve the largest of the pressure groups exercising their **rights** in the economy.

* I think that that is critically important to a parliament that believes that one of its fundamental missions is to look after the cause and the **rights** of the individual and to treat them as the supreme ideal of parliamentary government.

* The provision of better roads and bridges and other long term development projects would give worthwhile employment to people in the country until such time as the position **rights** itself, as it undoubtedly will, if we do not retain the better type of worker in the country, as the revival comes - it is coming in the rural areas: it will come there more quickly than it will in the city areas because generally country people know how to work - we will not have these workers when we need them and the whole nation will suffer.

* The people of South Vietnam have not been given any **rights** to self determination.

* Surely the controllers of these funds, as controllers of public money, should protect the **rights** of the public.

* On 24th August 1971 in the Senate in reply to a question asked by  Senator Carrick,  the newly arrived senator from New South Wales, the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  said:   all my endeavours are designed to ensure that the privacy and the **rights** of individuals, subject to law, are protected and preserved as far as possible.

* He has many times- in almost every second sentence- expressed his determination effectively to destroy the **rights** of non-metropolitan residents to reasonable and acceptable representation.

* The special circumstance relates specifically to a test case which is looming and on which an approach will be made to the Commonwealth for assistance in respect of certain legislation of the State of New South Wales which transgresses upon the Commonwealth's constitutional **rights** and sovereignty over the continental shelf.

* I am just giving warning that the approach will be made and it will be on a matter that concerns Clutha Development Pty Ltd and legislation which has been enacted by the New South Wales Parliament and the validity or otherwise of a contract already entered into which gives certain **rights** to Clutha Development Pty Ltd.

* What I find to be tragic is the way that those of us who sit in Parliaments have allowed the Press to take over from us the predominant role in safeguarding the **rights** of people in the modern community.

* It is a matter of the **rights** of people; it is a matter of bringing people back into the democratic process.

* All Australians should interest themselves in what is happening in Western Australia because they could be the next to lose their democratic **rights**.

* Where else could it happen but in Australia that the Attorney-General of the national Government and the SolicitorGeneral of New South Wales tiptoe like mice into court in a case that was itself a test case as to Commonwealth sovereignty and ask the court not to proceed to give a verdict as to the **rights** or the sovereignty of the Commonwealth and the States?

* This is what was said by no less a person than the Chief Justice: 
The Commonwealth believes that, except In respect of internal waters as they existed at federation, the States have no such **rights**.

* I was in the Northern Territory when various people, who were members of the Committee for the Rights of Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders - the former Minister was one - and various other interested bodies were ramming very hard for Aborigines to have equal **rights** with Europeans to drink alcohol, to go into bars and so on.

* Land acquisition and the **rights** of and responsibilities of the Legislative Council are two of the most important and most urgent matters which should be discussed by the Government and considered by the Minister for the Northern Territory, whether he is the Minister now sitting at the table, the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, or the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  who is in Japan or on his way home from there.

* Australians - from receiving pension **rights**.

* The question of my **rights** as a member of this place- they are no greater and no less than the **rights** of other members- has been raised.

* With great respect to you, sir, it is your prerogative and your duty to uphold those **rights** and to uphold them in terms of the traditions of the Westminister system.

* I believe that whatever security measures have to be taken ought to have full regard to the very important privileges and **rights** that are attached to this Parliament.

* I am fearful that we may allow those **rights** to be eroded, with the best of intentions and with the best of attitudes.

* Those **rights** had to be fought for over many years and over many centuries.

* I would ask you, sir - 
I am talking about the **rights** of all honourable members to enter freely this place and to move around.

* There is an understandable struggle for human **rights** and self-determination.

* - Compensation to be assessed by the Mining Warden having regard to the damage to surface and improvements, severance of land from other land, loss of surface **rights** of way and all consequential damage.

* Surely to goodness the **rights** to privacy of the individual donors must enter into the arrangement.

* We ought not to forget that what the Family Law Act will do, as the Matrimonial Causes Act which the Bill intends to replace already does, is establish the legal **rights** of parties to a marriage upon the dissolution of that marriage.

* The law must also establish the grounds upon which those new legal **rights** are to be created.

* I think particularly of the innocent husband or wife who, at the whim of the other spouse, finds that the marriage is put at an end and, at the whim of that other spouse, the innocent party's legal **rights** can be broken.

* It is said that that person's **rights** are protected by other provisions of the Act.

* What I feel has happened amongst the protagonists for the provision for 12 months separation is that in their pursuit of the admirable goals of simplicity and cheapness of removing wrangling and legal complexity from divorce they have denied to persons what ought to be regarded as some of their fundamental personal **rights**.

* I cannot think of anything more illiberal than to deny to that innocent person the right to go to law to dissolve the marriage and to re-establish his or her legal **rights** under the provisions of the law.

* In accordance with the Pulpwood Products Industry (Eastern and Central Tasmania) Act 1968-71, the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has granted TPFH a Special Licence conferring on the company exclusive **rights** to obtain up to 508,000 tonnes of pulpwood annually from a large pulpwood area situated along the east coast of Tasmania, and bounded by Dunalley, Colebrook and Gladstone.

* Under the 
A Special Licence has been granted to APPM by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, under the Wesley Vale Pulp and Paper Industry Act 1961-67, conferring on the company exclusive **rights** to pulpwood from a pulpwood area and a reserve area in northern Tasmania, and extensive water **rights**.

* They were prepared to forgo their **rights** tonight so we could get the Bill through.

* Those principles are: Each member of our community has both **rights** and obligations; individual **rights** must be protected; equally, obligations must be met.

* Industrial relations affect all of us and we, as Government, accept that it is our responsibility to develop an industrial relations framework in which the **rights** of individuals are protected, for example the right to choose employment and to join, or not to join, industrial organisations; labour and management can communicate and settle differences in a manner which recognises the **rights** and responsibilities of both; and the community at large is protected from harsh and disruptive effects of industrial disputation.

* Individual Rights 
The Government regards the protection of individual **rights** as fundamental and inalienable.

* There is one further amendment relating to this important issue of individual **rights**.

* These provisions are designed to ensure that the basic **rights** of individual members of organisations are enhanced.

* In particular it will provide a focal point for non-English speaking workers to obtain assistance when they are concerned about their **rights** as employees and union members.

* The Government believes that its amendments to a number of sections of the Act not only provide a more effective way of assisting individual union members in maintaining their **rights**, but also will cut out excessive legalism.

* In clause 15, it is proposed that, in dealing with such cases in the future, the court be enabled to fix a monetary penalty, to deregister an organisation or to suspend all or any of the capacities, **rights** and privileges of an organisation or its members.

* In conclusion, I would again reiterate that the Government is pledged to protect individual **rights**, and the **rights** of the community, in industrial relations matters, and ensure the observance of the obligations labour and management have to each other and the community at large.

* The Government proposes the strengthening of provisions relating to the protection of the **rights** of individuals against unfair actions by employers and organisations; the establishment of an Industrial Relations Bureau as a focal point for securing the observance of the industrial laws; and the extension of the range of consequences available to the court in dealing with breaches of industrial law.

* I support the introduction of land **rights** for Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* I believe that a real effort has been made by this Parliament to find the right solution on land **rights**, so that the traditional owners may control their land.

* All Aborigines welcomed land **rights**; but they did not understand in the first place the land councils as envisaged in the Bill.

* Hence the very real danger is that the setting up of a council or advisory group to decide land **rights** will bring bloodshed and decimation of Aborigines here.

* The Kutungula (manager) for that land will say, 'This man (irrpalterama) is trying to usurp our **rights**; you go and kill him.

* Deregistration can work only in situations such as we saw when the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia was deregistered and the carpenters and joiners came in and picked up the constitutional **rights** which the deregistered union previously had.

* It is possible that, in different circumstances from those which apply now, in the metal trades industry if the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union were deregistered, the Australasian Society of Engineers and the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia could move in and pick up the registered **rights** which the AMWSU now has.

* The fact is that, by legislation, **rights** and obligation are created.

* It is not in the interests of democracy that those **rights** or obligations should be created without the closest scrutiny.

* This requirement would apply even if no land **rights** claim were made.

* If a land **rights** claim were upheld and the Director refused to surrender his interest in land within a park the Minister could use the power of direction which he has under the Act.

* I pay tribute to him for his work in restoring the **rights** of tuberculosis pensioners and bringing in many other improvements in benefits for veterans.

* It is true that New Zealand is one of the few countries that has retained appeals to the Privy Council, but even that country would probably reconsider its position if we went ahead and abolished all existing **rights** of appeal.

* The Government in fact has no appreciation whatever of the importance of the State governments, of their constitutional powers and of their **rights**.

* How can Godfearing democracies maintain effective intelligence services without compromising civil **rights**?

* Should a child be denied some **rights** from his father because the child might have earning capacity?

* Have any doctors so excludedhad their previous **rights** restored.

* What is clear is that our society today has a much more sensitive regard for personal **rights** with respect of privacy and confidentiality of personal information provided on trust and in confidence to official bodies.

* An authority or person to whom information is divulged under the last preceding subsection, and any person or employee under the control of that authority or person, shall, in respect of that information, be subject to the same **rights**, privileges, obligation and liabilities under subsections (2) and (3) of this section as if he were a person performing duties under this Act and had acquired the information in the performance of those duties.

* The Australian people endorsed this Government and its policy proposals because they did not want those boycotts; they did not want that sort of malicious conduct from people like the honourable member for Burke, who spoke before me in this debate and who made it clear that the unions want to be able to hold other people to ransom, that they want to be able to deal in a harsh and unconscionable way with other people's property and the **rights** of the individual.

* It is of fundamental importance in this legislation that there is the protection of minority interests, that there is the protection of the **rights** of individuals and that there is genuinely equality before the law.

* No doubt the prospects of their gaining **rights** over their own tribal land which is being facilitated by the Government could have some bearing on these matters.

* But there are all kinds of **rights** that have to be acknowledged in the Northern Territory.

* This is yet another reflection of the Government's commitment to the sacred **rights** of free enterprise taking precedence over all, particularly over lucrative areas of public enterprise.

* When are those members on the other side of the House who take a stand for democratic and individual **rights** like the honourable member for Holt  (Mr Reid),  the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown),  who pretends to have some legal background, and the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who has mostly background, going to really deal with matters that are of significance right here and now?

* Nothing in this Act affects in any way the **rights** and liabilities in civil and criminal law of persons charged with offences arising out of incidents outside Parliament House, Canberra on Thursday, 20th July 1972 and Sunday, 23rd July 1972 where those charges or incidents arise out of or are related to the purported notification in the Gazette of 20th July 1972 of the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance 1972.

* We recognised that a great need existed for legal services, whether those services be required to defend a person charged with a criminal offence, to assist a person to assert his legal **rights** in a civil cause, or to enable a person to defend himself against some charge brought against him by some other citizen.

* But when it comes to the poor man wishing to go to court and to assert his legal **rights** nothing was done by the former Government to assist him.

* The Liberal and Country Parties believe in State **rights** to such an extent that they believe the States should be the only parts of Australia to have their own company laws so that those people who are inclined to exploit the system can take advantage of the fact that this country has 8 different sets of company laws- including the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.

* If honourable members care to take the time and look at our platform which is in a written, published form- we began publishing our platforms and policies long before the Liberal and Country Parties did- they will find pages dealing with the importance we attach to civil liberties and to human **rights**.

* If he has received a report on the trial, does it indicate whether the trial accords with the Soviet Union's claim to be taking human **rights** more seriously in accordance with its minimal Helsinki Pact obligations.

* In the meantime, I wish to make it quite clear that no Australian citizen will be deported, and that there will be no abridgment whatsoever of the **rights** of any Australian resident in the execution of deportation orders.

* Bill represents one of the most significant attacks ever made upon the **rights** and liberties of individuals, parties and bodies.

* The Australian Labor Party is fond of prattling about **rights** guided steadily, it states, by the stern philosophy that there should be a minimum invasion of privacy, yet embodied in this Bill, which seeks to amend the Electoral Act, is a savage, singular and sweeping invasion of privacy.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
Clearly section 23 of the Land Rights Act has not been complied with, but any legal action would have to be taken by the traditional owners at Oenpelli, and the Aboriginal people are tired.

* The referendum to grant people living in the Territories voting **rights** for the purposes of referendums is a small step towards recognising them as full Australians.

* While I can see no logical argument against it, I can see some emotive State **rights** argument which I believe does not have any weight.

* We support as a proper comparable condition the superannuation **rights** affecting the federal civil servants by virtue of the Government's introduction of this Bill.

* The finder may acquire salvage **rights** under the Navigation Act, the United Kingdom 
Merchant Shipping Acts, or at common law, before the wreck is declared historic.

* As salvage **rights** or liabilities under the Navigation Act acquired before a wreck is declared historic are to be preserved, the Bill also makes express provision for this purpose.

* What is definitely not is that they are pressing Aboriginal land **rights** only and exclusively in support of their own campaign against the mining companies and the Government's uranium export policy.

* 1 again ask any honourable member in this House to test what we, as a government, did in August 1977 and have done since then pursuant to the provisions of the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation against the second reading speech of the then Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

* Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of reports of statements made in another place that the Government's decision to extend de facto recognition to the Indonesian takeover of East Timor was in consideration of arrangements for oil exploration **rights**?

* I want to emphasise that I do not deny women the right to choose their lifestyle in the community provided that their choice does not impinge on the **rights** of others.

* He showed how this libertarian society involves not merely a claim for absolute **rights** to live according to one's own desires but also a demand for facilities for that lifestyle.

* We faced issues relating to sovereignty and sovereign **rights** and special legal and humanitarian problems which involved important national interests for each country.

* The Treaty will establish clearly the division of sovereign **rights** over resources between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the whole area between them- from the Arafura Sea to the Coral Sea.

* This, as distinct from the provision in the Bill, means that the matter will have to be placed before Parliament and that Parliament will have **rights** in respect to the appointment.

* 3 ) How do State interests including mineral **rights** in land acquired by the Federal Government for Aborigines differ from their interests in land acquired in the States for other purposes, such as Shoalwater Bay Training Reserve.

* It is sufficient to say that it has had a major role in promoting the acceptance and application of human **rights** in such areas as abolishing forced labour, promoting freedom of association and removing discrimination in employment.

* He indicated that priority attention was being given to those conventions dealing with fundamental human **rights** which Australia had not ratified at that time.

* Of the other 2 amendments adopted in 1964, one provided for the suspension from participation in the International Labour Conference of any ILO member State which had been found by the United Nations to be flagrantly and persistently pursuing by its legislation a declared policy of racial discrimination such as apartheid and the other for the expulsion from the ILO or suspension from the exercise of the **rights** and privileges of membership of the ILO of any member which the United Nations had suspended from the exercise of the **rights** and privileges of membership.

* It is only if we all try to have an end to hostilites that any of the other things can be achieved; that is, the sovereignty of Israel, the rectification of the borders and the **rights** of the Palestinians.

* Delegates voted that 'support for human **rights** and dignity is a fundamental principle of Labor foreign policy and that the ALF is opposed to all forms of authoritarian and totalitarian Government whether based on the ideologies of the Left or the Right'.

* The House may be assured that I and other spokesmen of that Branch- I am the  President-  continue to be concerned at any erosion of human **rights** or liberties.

* We are concerned to see that they get all the **rights** that should accrue to them as members of the work force.

* Looking ahead, this could mean that we face the prospect of a retreat into trade blocs, with snowballing restrictions on trade, with clear economic loss to every country in the long run, with the little nations no longer able to look to the rule of law to obtain their trade **rights**.

* But we should seek to ensure that the contractual **rights** of other countries to fair treatment are recognised and the principles of trade liberalism survive.

* These are balanced by certain contractual **rights** that are required by their membership. '

* We will insist on our protective **rights**.

* Therefore, any stand Australia takes must be on the ground of impairment or threatened impairment of our **rights** under GATT.

* 1 believe our **rights** have already been impaired by the policies of the EEC in respect of both predatory dumping and the proliferation of special preferential deals with many other countries not really part of the Common Market or members of its customs union.

* Furthermore, our **rights** are threatened with even more serious impairment from the likely terms and conditions of the proposed enlargement of the Common Market.

* It is this that has brought me to the conclusions which I most strongly hold: Only by a confrontation in GATT where we and other third countries similarly affected have clear **rights** could there be any chance of getting such modifications of the Common Agricultural Policy and other practices as would preserve fair trading opportunities.

* We must make it clear that those of us who have submitted ourselves to obligations within GATT are determined not to have our trade **rights** eroded away.

* I suggest to the Government that we should establish a citizens **rights** committee.

* I can see nothing wrong with establishing a standing committee of this Parliament to protect the **rights** of citizens in cases where they might believe that an injustice has been done, and particularly where the local member himself believes that his constituent has suffered an injustice.

* The High Court has got itself into a mental gymnastic situation because in the first, say, 10 or 20 years - certainly until the engineers case - it believed that all the **rights** were with the States.

* It then got around to saying that there were other **rights** as well, and that change of thinking arose because of an industrial dispute.

* One aspect of the new federalism which has made many local government observers uneasy is that the emphasis on the **rights** of the States could serve to confirm some of the centralist policies within individual States which have operated very much against the interests of local government.

* It said that it is a flagrant violation of human **rights**.

* This could resolve, for what it is worth, the abstract question of who has sovereign **rights** off-shore.

* That we, the undersigned protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising **rights** for the Victorian Pink Pages Telephone Directories to an American company, General Telephone and Electronics Corporation U.S.A., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.)

* Pty Ltd. 
Whilst one would hesitate to interfere with the **rights** of commercial television channels to decide what types of programmes they wish to present, how much they should spend on the programmes and where they should acquire the programmes, I believe that there is a good case to be made for the proposition that Australian television stations should present a balanced total programme which not only presents material portraying the life, customs and cultural mores of other countries, but which also presents material which reflects similar aspects of Australia's national ethos.

* The Press evidently sees it as the duty of the Press to inform people of their **rights**, to inform people like  Mr Stonehouse  of the various loopholes that exist in the law that might enable them to make plans to fit in with the loopholes.

* The Labor Party has encouraged a contempt for law and order and the **rights** of individual citizens.

* Indeed, as a former Minister for Housing, Minister for Construction and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I naturally maintain a keen interest in the development of the Territory and in the **rights** of the people who live there.

* In this article, which is headed 'A matter of choice', the editor of the  Canberra  Times said: 
The communists in Vietnam are engaging in a grievous and systematic violation of human **rights**, including the detention of an estimated 300 000 people in so-called re-education camps, the suppression of cultural and political expression and the stifling of non-violent dissent.

* We wanted to believe desperately- so desperately- the pledge and the promises of respect that would be shown (by the Communists) towards human beings and human **rights**.

* Housing and Community Development will be consulting also with the Public Service Board as the study develops because of the Board 's special concern for the **rights** of staff.

* No decisions have been made on the issue of devolution: but if it were to be proceeded with the **rights** of the staff would be fully preserved in consultation with the Public Service Board.

* I believe that this is the key to the situation and the method we should adopt because not only will it be effective, if anything will be effective, in achieving this objective, but also we will be able to apply it to any other health hazard that faces this country without infringing on the **rights** of anybody in any other field.

* It is a democratic power, and the **rights** of the Minister who is responsible through this Parliament to the Australian people should be safeguarded.

* If this Parliament loses the control and hands over complete power to any statutory corporation we are denying the democratic **rights** of this Parliament, and that is why I have moved the amendment.

* I should also make it clear to the House that the issue involved here is not whether mining will proceed but, pursuant to the terms of the land **rights** legislation, that the terms and conditions of mining must be agreed between the Northern Land Council and the companies involved in the mining.

* It is true that some people, most of them on the Labor side of politics, care more about stopping uranium mining or changing the Government in Darwin or Canberra than they do about Aborigines or land **rights**.

* What I want to put to the House is that all the questions that are being asked here by members of the Opposition seem to indicate that they have no regard for the **rights** of the people of the countries to determine their own future.

* As a member of a Party that talks about State **rights**, the honourable member completely ignored the activities that have been carried out by individual Australian States in this area of reform.

* In our present way of life our community planning, the developing interrelationships between individuals and between the individual and public bodies, the standards we enjoy could not have been achieved without giving powers to certain public bodies or to have certain controls and **rights** to protect the community but which of necessity affect individuals.

* People have come to accept that in certain circumstances their private **rights** may have to be subordinated to the claims of the community at large.

* However, it is important to ensure that a citizen who believes his **rights** have been unduly infringed has the opportunity to have his grievance considered.

* It has been properly pointed out that there is a substantial body of government programs which provide **rights** and benefits both to organisations and to individuals which do not arise with the backing of specific legislation.

* History clearly demonstrates the need to have measures in the legislation to protect the democratic **rights** of union members.

* In that definition we create the right by saying:  unreasonable obstruction' means an act or thing done by a person that constitutes, or contributes to an obstruction of, or interference with, the exercise or enjoyment by other persons of their lawful **rights** or privileges (including **rights** of passage along the public streets)- 
I stop there to say: Excellent.

* The Bill has touched on one person's **rights**, the right of free passage along the streets.

* The Government then says that anything left after that, to a perhaps non-political person or a person who attaches little importance to these **rights**, is left over for the person who wants to persuade people that his point of view is right and who wants to exercise his full **rights** in a modern democracy.

* A decision as to the **rights** of parties should not be made on extraneous factors or on the basis of undisclosed policy.

* For those of us who are concerned with human **rights** around the world it is a matter of grave concern.

* I think that this Parliament and other parliamentary forums around the world can be quite justifiably accused of hypocrisy for the way in which we condemn one form of denial of human **rights** and then ignore what is happening in countries like Uganda.

* It is important to realise- and I have discussed this at great length with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, who agrees with me- that if the Aborigines were to get all the money in the world from royalties, or all the power in the world through the land **rights** legislation, it still would not do them the slightest good if the rapport between blacks and whites were destroyed.

* We hear them talking about the traditional **rights** of Aborigines and of the pressures being placed on them.

* However, I want to place on record the fact that I think selfdetermination does not include **rights** over other people in this area.

* But the fact is that there are opportunities for infringement of ordinary; fundamental human **rights** implied in the present situation and in the points that have been put by some of the members opposite who have spoken in the debate.

* This Bill protects the long service leave **rights** of persons who were in public employment in Papua New Guinea prior to independence, who worked for the independent state of Papua New Guinea after independence and who then entered, or in the future will enter, Commonwealth employment.

* We are advising them of their **rights**.

* Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 47E of the Public Service Act to protect the sick leave **rights** of persons who were in public employment in Papua New Guinea prior to independence, remain there after independence and then enter Commonwealth employment.

* I realise that to ratify conventions, the Commonwealth Government must obtain the approval of the State governments because they have sovereign **rights**.

* I think that many honourable gentlemen opposite who are smiling at this idea of women standing up for their **rights** might find that they will lose either their smile or their seat after the next election if they do not pay proper heed to what women are thinking.

* While the matters subject to direction are specified in the Bill as a clear indication of the Government's intention to preserve contributors' **rights**, I am hopeful that organisations will administer their rules in a manner which will result in the activation of the ministerial powers of direction being required only in exceptional circumstances.

* In the course of his address, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  dealt with the **rights** of private members and the need for private members to be given the opportunity to participate in an effective way in the work of the Parliament.

* Today, we find the Leader of the Opposition taking away the **rights** of private members and then saying in the course of bis speech that private members ought to be given more time for speeches in this Parliament.

* My responsibility as the Leader of this House is to protect the **rights** of all private members, Government and Opposition.

* Having said so, in accordance with the policy of this Government of maintaining the **rights** of private members, I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he might debate this subject at a more appropriate time, and I move: 
-The conflicts and allegations over the proposed development of uranium in the Northern Territory have brought the hypocrisy of this Government squarely before the Australian people.

* It has denied Aboriginal **rights** to traditional lands in the Borroloola land **rights** claim.

* I remind the House of the letter sent today to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs by  Dr H.  C. Coombs, one of the most experienced and compassionate supporters of Aboriginal **rights** in this country.

* The Opposition rejects the argument that it is no good to do something right because people will want more than their **rights**.

* We should do the right thing first and then argue if they want more than their **rights**.

* To refuse to do so would be, as  Dr Coombs  rightly points out:  a confession that the Ranger agreement has indeed been concluded under duress, and that the Australian Government rates the immediate profits of mining companies more highly than the deeply-felt anxieties for their ancient way of life of those Australian citizens whom we have, over the last 200 years, continuously robbed of what was theirs by plain and sacred right 
The Opposition calls upon the Government to heed the sort of sentiments that are echoing through this country, not only from  Dr Coombs  but also from practically every Aboriginal organisation that has ever expressed its voice on land **rights**.

* The **rights** of private members have been ignored.

* Sub-section (2) (a) states:  after consultation with the Aboriginals, if any, as to whom the Minister is satisfied that they have traditional **rights** in relation to the land; 
-The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  seemed to labour the point about the protection of people's **rights** by the introduction of this Bill.

* It seems to be the call of the Government all the time that it is the champion of the people's **rights**.

* As I see it, if this Government remains in power the people will have no **rights** at all.

* In 1970, the then Leader of the Opposition- the present Prime Minister- tried again, out of a recognition of the pretty fundamental and basic fact that a large number of people in the Northern Territory and in the Australian Capital Territory are without their democratic **rights**.

* In order to stop the passage of our measures, every action must be invoked to prevent the democratic **rights** of the people being enacted.

* Whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government's objectives for defence, the environment and conservation, urban and regional development or the preservation of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* What the judge of the Arbitration Commission was saying is that security of employment is basic to the **rights** of employees and that to abrogate those **rights** by obtaining stand-down clauses there must be very substantial grounds indeed and the Arbitration Commission must be persuaded by argument that that is the case.

* The Government is abrogating the fundamental **rights** of Commonwealth employees.

* It cannot expect to introduce legislation like that, which abrogates fundamental **rights**, without there being a reaction.

* It abrogates the fundamental **rights** of Commonwealth employees.

* As permanent local officers  of  the Papua New Guinea Public Service they have the normal tenure, career opportunities and retirement benefits applic  able  in that Service and these **rights** continue while their services are made available to the Commonwealth Service.

* Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the **rights** and well-being of the Aboriginal people.

* We are speaking in this debate about the **rights** of hundreds of thousands of people.

* It is true to say that those **rights** are now a fading vision.

* Because of the changing circumstances in the general community, the decisions we make concerning the benefit **rights** of servicemen in relation to the rest of the community may well be irrelevant in 5, 10 or 15 years time.

* the United Nations declaration of the **rights** of a child which states that the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth, and 
It is the policy of the Federal Government that there should be full consultation with Aboriginal communities in respect of activities which are likely to affect their well being.

* There was no mention of Melbourne or Melbourne streets or any other particular locality, but whether one approved of freedom of association, and the answer I gave I will now have pleasure in repeating: That we do approve of that, that we do believe that ought to be supported by ali members of Parliament, and we equally believe that when the false claim is made that there is a right for people to associate to interfere with the **rights** of other citizens or to break the law then every member of Parliament ought to resist that, and these are the principles to which I gave an answer on a question of principle.

* Hitler burnt the Reichstag and used the incident to justify the introduction of laws that violated all human freedom and **rights** in the name of law and order.

* I think that that practical interpretation in the minds of many of the leaders of this so-called moratorium is not that it should merely be a gathering to express beliefs or to express desires in a peaceful way without infringing the **rights** of others because if that were all it was then every member of this Parliament ought to defend that right.

* But rather it is an intention to have gatherings to go beyond exercising that right and to infringe upon the **rights** of others, and to sit down in the streets and to bring to bear the wish to break a law because they dislike something which a government has done after being elected by a majority.

* The operating **rights** of airline companies whose planes persist in violating the noise limit should be cancelled.

* At the same time it should provide funds to enable the States to establish consumer affairs bureaus to advise consumers of their **rights** and to provide them with legal aid in appropriate cases.

* So none of the **rights** no matter how limited enjoyed by those in the first 3 categories are enjoyed by those in the fourth category.

* The German citizen who becomes an Australian loses all his **rights** in Germany.

* freed and discharged from any restriction, dedication or reservation made by or under any enactment, to the intent that the legal estate in the land or interest, and all **rights** and powers incident to that estate or conferred by the  Lands Acquisition Act  1 955 in relation to that estate, are vested in the Commonwealth.

* Although the Labor Government introduced last year a Bill along similar lines concerning land **rights**- I feel it went a lot further- this BUI will have far-reaching effects.

* It has been claimed that in the early days of the settlement of the Eyre Peninsula, which is in my electorate, when the Aboriginal people were defending their **rights** and standing up to the settlers, the settlers had a big drive on horseback and drove a large group of Aborigines towards the cliffs and forced them over.

* However, with the dispossession that had taken place, the matter of land **rights** for Aborigines became of great importance.

* That decision was based on white man's law and in it the traditional **rights** of the Aboriginal people were completely ignored.

* It was a decision made within the very limited framework in which he had to work- the European law, the white man's law, under which the **rights** of the Aborigines were given short shrift.

* Emphasis was given at that time to the need for a law to cover this aspect of Aboriginal life; that is, a law to establish land **rights** for these people.

* I think everybody recognised the need for this land **rights** legislation.

* Following the establishment of the Woodward Commission and the presentation of its report in about 1973, the Labor Government in 1975 introduced its land **rights** Bill.

* The Woodward report recommended that the land **rights** legislation 'should be protected in such a way that its provisions cannot be eroded by the effect of any Northern Territory legislation'.

* We have had correspondence from the Central Lands Council and from the Aboriginal legal **rights** organisation in the Northern Territory.

* Whilst we have the principle of absolute equality of citizens before the law - with everyone, no matter what his station, subject to the law - whilst we have the independence of the judiciary and whilst we have the right of freedom of speech and assembly so long as the freedoms of other people are not infringed, the **rights** of individual citizens are protected.

* In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended, on motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice: Provided that such motion is car ried by an absolute majority of Members Having full voting **rights**.

* A motion of this nature may be moved by any member without notice, but to 'bs passed must be carried by an absolute  majojrity  of members having full voting **rights**.

* What might be called the enlightened - if that is the word - movement is towards making pensions more portable and for individuals to be able to carry their **rights** from job to job during their working lives and either collect benefits in separate funds which are actually assessed and which will support them eventually in their old age, or to move from one pension fund to another.

* God forbid that we should ever come to a stage in this country where, just because the bully boys in the Labor Party with their friends in the media attempt to wield this sort of big stick, people working independently - whether they be in the medical profession or anywhere else - should not stand up for their **rights** and attempt to retain the way of life which they are used to and which they believe is good.

* I am not only concerned with doctors' **rights** in this matter.

* Shortly after the Whitlam Government received the political count from the Australian people exercising their democratic **rights** at a free election, the Fraser-Anthony Government, in an honest endeavour to repair what in many cases was irreparable damage to Australian primary producers, as a matter of urgency extended the subsidy at the rate of $78.74 per tonne nitrogen in order to allow a close examination of the whole area.

* Yesterday in this House we heard Opposition speakers talk about the **rights** of conscientious objectors.

* I do not intend to argue the **rights** or the wrongs of the case put by the Opposition.

* How hypocritical does it make the cries of the Opposition for the **rights** of conscientious objectors against particular laws when they raise no cry of protest for the **rights** of conscientious objectors to joining a union.

* Peter Hocking's father has asked me to ask the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  to see whether a provision can be incorporated in the Graphic Arts Award to this effect: 
The individual has **rights**, and in a world increasingly indifferent to liberty and individualism, a man's remaining **rights** must be respected.

* How do we proceed to expand human **rights** and how do we overcome the obsession with sovereignty which, of course, stops us from acting over most of the world?

* I believe that question time is the one way in which we can protect the **rights** of the people whom we are here to represent.

* The Seat of Government Acceptance Art 1909-1973 gives the Australian government paramount **rights** over the waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers and the right to undertake such construction works as are required for the use of these waters.

* The amendment proposes an additional term of reference to include in the Committee 's functions oversight of exploration and exploitation of Aboriginal lands by mining interests, including those grants made under the proclamation sections of the land **rights** Bill where Aboriginal consent to mining was mandatory.

* It is not without coincidence that it has become a byword at the same time as the question of Aboriginal land **rights** has been raised again.

* It is what has guided the Government in respect of its agreement to introduce land **rights** legislation for the Northern Territory.

* I am quite sure that my announcement in the House yesterday of the Government's decision to introduce legislation in this Parliament for the giving of land **rights** in the Northern Territory will be a watershed in Australian history.

* We know we have a long way to go because community understanding of what is involved in land **rights** still leaves much to be desired.

* That is why it is a matter of high priority for my Government that not only must things like land **rights** be recognised; programs for bicultural understanding must also be implemented, reach a high level and pervade every section of the community from the children to the elderly, because only when the Australian people understand Aborigines, their traditions, their culture, their spiritual affinity with land, can they understand what is involved in the granting of land **rights** and why.

* These words were used in a speech only a few weeks after the Terrigal conference of the ALP during which, as I understood it from the great splurge of publicity that came out, the States **rights** question was paramount in the mind of every Minister.

* He thinks that land **rights** are little more than a slogan and that claims are made- I quote from his address to the Frankston Uniting Church- 'without regard to the legal and political realities of the Australian Federation'.

* Nor should I have to spell out again that a referendum in 1967 overwhelmingly gave the Commonwealth the responsibility of ensuring the welfare and **rights** of Aboriginal Australians by giving it power to make laws concerning those **rights**- a responsibility which this Governnent continues to evade, with the excuse that the States also retain such legislative powers.

* The Federal Administration has subscribed to international obligations to protect human and minority **rights**.

* We are not being selfish but we have equal **rights** so why is everyone trying to stomp on us, put us in corners with pressure and telling us to keep our mouths shut?

* From 1966 to 1969 the contract for advertising **rights** in the Western Australia telephone directory was held by R. H. Cook Pty Ltd trading as Pink Pages Publicity (W.A.).

* I think that I have said enough to indicate that there is genuine opposition on the part of honourable members on this side of the House, particularly at this early stage of the new sessional period, to the dictatorial attitude adopted by the Government in setting aside what, after all, are the traditional **rights** of honourable members in this Parliament.

* We have sought to safeguard individuals' **rights** to express their opinions.

* What we ought to get from the Government, if it treats this seriously, is a firm statement that in the future if any Australian citizens are arrested in Yugoslavia, brought to trial in Yugoslavia, sought to be punished in Yugoslavia, this Government ought to be informed immediately that takes place so that it can take care of the **rights** of those people according to Australian law, so that they are properly represented, so that they are not railroaded to the kind of death to which these 3 men have been railroaded.

* They interfered with his **rights** as a citizen by invading his home- 
Has the Minister forgotten that on 15th January the  Chairman  of Overseas Containers Ltd,  Sir Andrew  Chrichton, revealed 'the revenue on the United Kingdom - Australia trade that we had anticipated achieving in the first 2 years was achieved in  7i  months'?

* Does he feel that the Leader of the Country Party had undermined him by asserting the **rights** of the overseas owners of the wool to negotiate as they wished with the overseas shipping interests, and by discounting the **rights** of the producers of the wool to take part in the negotiations?

* 1 ) Is he able to say whether in the past when important visitors have gone to the USSR, such as President Nixon in 1972 and 1974, the Soviet Government has placed in custody a large number of persons who may have protested against Soviet violations of basic human **rights**; if so, has this included recall of other dissidents for further psychiatric treatment in political hospitals.

* If the position is as stated, will he seek assurances from the Soviet Government that it will cease to place in custody the large number of persons who may protest against the Soviet Government's violation of basic human **rights** during the forthcoming 1980 Olympic Games.

* We have seen many examples of the way in which he stood for his principles and the way in which, despite his public image, in a private sense he pursued the **rights** and liberties of the individual.

* Yet we believed that this matter was one of primary importance for Australia as a member of the region and as a government which was prepared to accept, as we do, the **rights**, the duties and the responsibilities towards our close neighbours, Indonesia and East Timor.

* The main points in that statement- renewal of the mandate of  Mr 
Once again let me draw attention to the very real difference between the policy of this Government and the policy of" the previous Government- a government which put so much store on the **rights** of the United Nations, a government which believed so strongly, in words if not in deeds, that it was to the United Nations that the world was to look for better, more peaceful and more logical and reasoned solutions to problems.

* The **rights** and interests, of employees are an important aspect in this consideration and they will be carefully examined.

* This is no way in which to behave in a parliament of free people where minorities have **rights** like anybody else.

* There will certainly be no erosion of these **rights** as a result of amalgamation.

* Combining transportation with other development programs through the use of air **rights** over highways is also a means of supplying needed space at economical prices and of overcoming the unwanted environmental effects of expressways.

* Foreign Students in Australia: Rights 
b ) foreign students in Australia have full civil **rights** while in Australia; 
Two points need to be made in relation to that claim.

* I do not want to debate at this stage the **rights** or wrongs of that situation.

* Maybe we should and maybe we should not, but before we limit the discussion of constitutional reform to what the **rights** of the States ought to be, surely we should debate whether we want to preserve the federal system at all.

* Nonetheless, we believe we can still work with these amendments and strive to protect the contributors' interests and at the same time, as we indicated was our intention at the time we brought the original Bill into the House, preserve the **rights** of the funds.

* Contributors' **rights** were not being properly attended to.

* The Bill incorporates significant amendments to the earlier Bill in the area of appeal **rights** following discussions with staff organisations, as I have outlined.

* Bill, if he uses the option to take out additional pension **rights** with his lump sum he can retire at 55 on a pension of $8,062 per annum.

* In many cases, there would be direct termination of employment and there would be no **rights** of appeal or guarantees of compensation which are provided for under this Bill.

* Before retirement can take place, alternative employment opportunities must be thoroughly explored and all staff have **rights** of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation.

* It modifies the other provisions which have been described in the past as being of too summary a nature by providing a more extensive range of appeal **rights** available to staff affected and by setting out more clearly the framework within which decisions are taken.

* Those officers who might be affected by these provisions have very extensive **rights** of appeal and in many cases they will obtain extensive additional benefits which are not available to other officers retiring voluntarily or to people in private industry whose employment is terminated for various reasons.

* This may, indeed, serve the short term aim of securing your re-election, since 'the great silent majority' (which used to be known as the 'mindless mass') is still apathetic about human **rights** in South Africa.

* -Tonight I welcome the opportunity to raise with the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  who with characteristic courtesy is in the House as a result of my advising him that I would raise these matters, the **rights** of serving members of the defence forces to participate in political parties.

* Very shortly, my request to the Minister is: Can he give some sort of an indication as to the position and his thinking about the **rights** of serving members of the armed Services to have membership and participate actively in political parties.

* We affirmed and we continue to believe that the best prospect for an enduring peace in the Middle East will flow from an agreement freely arrived at between the parties, an agreement which fully recognises the **rights** and the status of both Israel and the Palestinians.

* The report under consideration, comprehensive as it is, contains, I am bound to point out, a striking omission and opacity on the matter of human **rights**.

* The denial of equal political and social **rights** to this population represents a continuing source of tension and conflict.

* Members of the new generation of young Palestinians, better trained, more highly qualified than their parents, are even more determined than their parents to assert their claims to the lands of their forefathers and to assert their political and social **rights** further.

* The proper course for the friends of Israel and for the Government of Australiathe Foreign Minister  (Mr Peacock)  has acknowledged that this Government follows the policy established by my Government- is to urge and encourage all the parties towards negotiations based on a mutual recognition of the **rights** of both Israel and the Palestinian people to their independence, their sovereignty and their self-determination.

* For more than 30 years the Palestinians, like the Israelies before them, have sought **rights** to a state of their own.

* I do not wish to canvass the **rights** and wrongs of that, but I tend to agree with the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman).

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report in the  Canberra Times  of 8 March 1978 by Frank Cranston where he stated that a proper sharing of the Torres Strait waters between Australia and Papua New Guinea leave within the Port Moresby administration the Queensland islands which lie to the south of the Papua New Guinea coast, that a regime is being sought with Papua New Guinea which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing **rights** of the people on the disputed islands without circumscribing the generality of Port Moresby's prerogatives down to an agreed median line and that although the Governments have agreed in principle over the issue, the drafting of the legislation giving force to it is expected to prove difficult; if so, is there any substance in the report.

* The issue at stake is the basic constitutional **rights** of this House.

* The whole tactic of the Leader of the Opposition has been to bypass this House, to undermine its established **rights** and authority- **rights** and authority which have never been challenged since Federation and would not be challenged in any other country with a comparable system of government.

* Not the least extraordinary and reprehensible aspect of his conduct is that he would sell out the **rights** of this House.

* And, of course, in so doing he would sell out the **rights** of the Australian people by the selling the people 's House down the drain.

* But when one considers the lengths he is apparently prepared to go to damage Australia, to cause harm to innocent people, to delay or even destroy the chance of economic recovery and in particular, the role he is playing in attempting to undermine the **rights** and powers of this House- this House of Representatives, this people's House- he is unfit to be Leader of the Opposition.

* Before he makes charges of the kind he made tonight he should look at the sorry and deplorable record of the former Government for attending to the **rights** of members of the Opposition in the Parliament.

* I say to honourable members opposite - and I see them sitting in various corners of this Parliament - that whatever they may say great improvements have been made in the **rights** of private members.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* This was entirely within their **rights**.

* The Family Court will, of course, determine legal **rights**, which it is bound to do as a court, but it will do much more than that Here will be a court, the expressly stated purpose of which is to provide help, encouragement and counselling to parties with marital problems, and to have regard to their human problems, not just their legal **rights**.

* Actions for judicial separation, restitution of conjugal **rights**, annulment of voidable marriages and damages for adultery are abolished as being anachronistic.

* The constitution, rules and regulations of the Buyers' Association give power to a committee to refuse membership to any buyer, to call upon any member to resign, and to expel any member for any reason that the committee thinks fit, and the member has no redress or any right to take legal action in defence of his **rights**.

* People's **rights** will be determined and assessed under this Bill if it becomes legislation.

* It is therefore more restrictive than the present **rights** as at present there is not that confinement in all cases to Austraiian citizenship as the criterion.

* Income from the sale of mining **rights**, other than any derived under preBudget contracts, is no longer to be exempt.

* I believe that a fundamental civil right is involved, that the **rights** of some people are involved very deeply and the **rights** of others are involved indirectly.

* We believe that each side has its equal **rights** and neither of them shall be transcended by the **rights** of the community in this instance.

* I appeal to the Attorney-General  (Mr Hughes)  to apply to the industrial area some of the civil **rights** principles that I often hear him enunciate, and see whether for once we cannot set up a standard for the rest of the world to look at in this area, instead of getting out the knout, the whip or the sanction.

* But, in order to preserve the **rights** of both competitors and the public, the Bill limits the initial term of a petty patent to 12 months from the date of grant.

* Inventors will now have the same **rights**.

* adequate measures to safeguard the environment and national parks and protect Aboriginal **rights** and interests.

* What is the present position regarding the introduction of plant breeders' **rights**.

* Is it proposed to amend Pan X of the Bankruptcy Act so as to give secured creditors the same **rights** at meetings as unsecured creditors where a deed of arrangement is proposed.

* I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual **rights** and freedoms of Australian citizens.

* This Government knows, as did  Mr Chifley  and the Menzies Government before us, that in this area there is a delicate balance between those individual **rights** and freedoms and the security of our nation.

* We know also that at times it presents dilemmas to us - 
I have had in mind throughout my inquiries that a balance between the **rights** of individual persons and the preservation of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve.

* Kevin Cairns) spoke, I believe, very eloquently about the need of this Parliament to preserve the **rights** of the innocent party in any marriage dissolution.

* I refer to civil **rights**.

* I want to make it very clear that the Government has a tragic record in enhancing and protecting the **rights** of Australians and their civil liberties.

* How did the Government protect and enhance the **rights** of Aborigines in Queensland suffering from trachoma when it co-operated meekly in depriving them of urgently needed treatment to feed the paranoia of the Queensland Premier?

* How did the Government protect and enhance the **rights** of Aborigines in Western Australia to vote without being subjected to degrading public tests of their literacy?

* In what way has the Government protected and enhanced the **rights** of migrants to equal opportunity, equal education and equal access to social justice?

* What has the Government done to clearly define and give effect to the **rights** of all Australians to provide a Bill of Rights?

* In the context of talking about human **rights** and basic civil liberties he referred to incentives for the arts, assistance to the film industry, the protection of the whale and of helping the world wildlife fund.

* They are all meritorious aims, but they hardly fall within any recognised definition of human **rights**.

* It becomes hypocrisy when the conservatives talk of concern for the **rights** of the individual.

* One of the most blatant acts of hypocrisy and expediency by the Fraser Government has been its expressed commitment to human **rights** through the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

* Last September the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  struck a high moral stance on human **rights** to the United Nations General Assembly when he said: 
Australia takes its human **rights** seriously.

* The question of human **rights** is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture, too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations.

* In a Press statement on 17 January this year the Minister reiterated these sentiments and stated that Australia would seek through the Commission the promotion of universally recognised human **rights** in practical, effective terms.

* What else has the Fraser Government done in concrete, demonstrable terms to back up its words on human **rights**?

* The Government's record of inaction during the last year showed that while it was anxious to strut on the international forum in espousing the cause of human **rights** it was doing nothing to advance that cause in Australia.

* Even that proposal has been watered down because of the complaint after the Premiers Conference that the Premiers want to determine what sort of **rights** ought to be available to the Australian people.

* She raised a question of the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* As a parliamentarian she was effective; as a leader of women's **rights** and movements in Australia, she was more than effective.

* The Government recognises the **rights** of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which and the pace at which they come to identify themselves with that Australian society.

* After discussion with the Australian Council for the Arts, APRA agreed that should the winning composer be a member of the Association, and should he so request, APRA will assign to the Government all **rights** held by APRA in the winning anthem.

* She is a person of very considerable experience and achievement in the field of women's **rights**.

* Whatever controversies there may be about the assimilation or integration of Aboriginals or about Aboriginal land **rights**, there ought to be no controversy about their health, especially the health of their children.

* I have stood, I do stand, and I always will stand in this chamber to support the **rights** of organisations to put their point of view - 
The question of land **rights** has already been dealt with.

* Land **rights** can be given in this quite affluent society of  ours  to the Aboriginal people living on reserves and in significant communities without causing a violent confrontation with the pastoral industry or with anyone else.

* With application of the best current techniques to ensure safety for the workers, environment protection, regard for Aboriginal land **rights**, and an obligation to rehabilitate areas damaged by mining, one can accept the (Fox) report's conclusion that there is no adequate reason why Australian uranium should not be mined and supplied at the world price to those countries that have elected to develop nuclear power and can be trusted.

* The Government is very silly and very trite if it believes that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, despite its antidemocratic track record, is going to be a better judge of national security and the people's democratic **rights** than those who have been elected to serve the national interest.

* -Is the Prime Minister concerned about human **rights** in Australia?

* Is it not a fact that, under Commonwealth legislation and the Constitution, the Commonwealth has **rights** to protect human and civil **rights** in Australia?

* In view of those circumstances, will the Prime Minister undertake to introduce urgently in this House legislation to guarantee that the **rights** of the people of Queensland are the same as should apply to all Australians, that is, to march peacefully, in accordance with Article 2 1 of the International Covenant?

* This political industrial action sponsored substantially by the left and by the Communist Party is ensuring that the Labor Party and the Communist Party together are derogating from the maintenance of the **rights** of the individual worker.

* I believe that the individual worker is being prejudiced in the same way as the rule of law and the maintenance of the legitimate opportunity to dissent to the point where I hesitate not to foreshadow that those **rights** to dissent will be curtailed by the very actions of those who seek to express dissent.

* rise to speak in this debate with some sorrow because in the 12 years that I have spent in this Parliament I have found, whether it be on the eve of the 1959 Melbourne Peace Conference when the Attorney-General,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, who is now the Chief Justice of Australia spoke, or on the occasion of the conference in Sydney in 1964 when  Sir Robert  Menzies spoke, that on each occasion a statement has been made in an attempt to smear certain citizens who stand up for their inalienable **rights**.

* That by 18 most young people are ready for these responsibilities and **rights** and would greatly profit by them as would the teaching authorities, the business community, the administration of justice, and the community as a whole.

* This is one of the sovereign **rights** of the States and, therefore, it is a matter that concerns not only this Government but also the State governments.

* Under this highly beneficial legislation the Minister for Social Services has been negotiating the terms of agreement because there is an element of reciprocal **rights**.

* He said that we must reduce inflation by imposing consistent and restrictive fiscal, monetary and foreign trade measures, with all industrial nations cooperating; end inflation-oriented thinking; recognise the simple truth that we must put something into an economy to get something out of it; gear wage and salary increases to productivity; curb excessive demands for wage increases, greater social benefits, shorter working weeks, and so on; and avoid creating more special- International Monetary Fund- drawing **rights**, raising the price of gold, imposing import restrictions, or forcing trade among industrial nations in a bid to correct the balance of payments problems.

* The honourable gentleman is perfectly correct in saying that this piece of legislation cannot alter existing property **rights**, whatever they may be.

* I want to assure the honourable member that we are not opposing this legislation simply for the purpose of opposing, but rather we are opposing it as the protectors of the people's **rights** and the preservers of the decision of the people.

* It wants to topple the sovereignty and independence of the Senate, the House of State **rights**.

* One has to admire the Premiers of the free States for their united effort in organising a secretariat in Canberra to protect their **rights**.

* ALP policy is for the abolition of federalism, the Senate and States' **rights** re the Privy Council, Queen's honours lists and Agents-General, and for the refusal to allow people to decide whether 'God Save the Queen' should be the national anthem.

* The Labor Party seeks the take-over of the people's **rights**.

* But we will oppose this legislation, reinforce the arbitrary decision of the Australian people and force the Prime Minister to walk the tight rope of people's **rights**.

* He is now making his second head-on attack on the **rights** of the Senate to amend, delay or defeat the Government's legislation.

* I endorse the remarks of the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  who by interjection said that to try to do away with the State's House, which is the preserver of the democratic **rights** of the States and through the States the citizens who live in them, was a most despicable act of the Prime Minister.

* We submit that it is both unnecessary and unwanted and we ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to accept the democratic vote of the Australian people, who told him in no uncertain manner that they do not want a bar of this type of legislation and they will not stand his meddling in the affairs of substance in a way which interferes with their basic **rights**.

* They are unable to exercise their normal **rights** and the Federal Government is tame and afraid to stand up to the State governments.

* If we go back briefly to the question of human **rights** it will be seen that we have no appropriate Federal legislation because the Premier of Queensland said to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that he would not have a bar of that legislation.

* Therefore people in Queensland who want to exercise their **rights** are gaoled if they demonstrate.

* The real purpose behind removing the control of the Church and affecting the **rights** of these people is to grant mining leases.

* It gives them no **rights** at all and I am advised by my colleague that the Queensland Government is prepared to give **rights** to the freehold title of part of that reserve to the mining company concerned.

* So, under the power that has been exercised already, **rights** are vested in the Aborigines.

* They are **rights** of residence and **rights** of conduct- in other words, normal **rights** that one would expect to be given to anybody who is almost an owner of the land.

* This is what the Government must do to protect the **rights** of these people.

* It has been made clear by concerned people that unless the Government does this it will be denying these people their **rights**.

* When we talk about responsibility to the Aboriginal people we mean responsibility to protect them, to give them their **rights**, to give them ownership of their land and to give them their entitlement to the profits therefrom.

* Surely when State administration came into being there was an obligation upon the States to respect the **rights** of these people.

* shall not, without reasonable excuse, obstruct or hinder the exercise of the powers or **rights** of the Authority under this section.

* It is to have the power to apply to a Supreme Court to enforce these **rights**, the same way that the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service can under a related Bill.

* 20 per cent of the profits from mining certain prescribed minerals, and income derived by prospectors from the sale of mining **rights** are exempt.

* Income from the sale, after today, of mining **rights**, and dividends in the categories I have mentioned which are declared after today, will not be exempt.

* We believe that this clause makes an unnecessary and unwarranted intrusion into those **rights**, if in the administration of those lands we are really interested in Aboriginal land **rights** and Aboriginal priorities.

* When these people are painting a critical picture with a wide brush they should remember that they are causing embarrassment and ridicule to many thousands of decent and gallant exservicemen without whose efforts in war these people would not enjoy the freedoms and **rights** of criticism in Australia that they do today.

* It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the **rights** or equality of women in that situation.

* I further hope that any such legislation concerning handicapped people will be accepted by the States and that we will be faced not with another States' **rights** wrangle but rather with an acceptance of people's **rights**.

* What has this to do with the concept of civil **rights**?

* We have heard much about civil **rights** in this House.

* The Minister is also very concerned that people do not see any move by the Federal Government to give self-management to Aboriginal communities as being some kind of separate development, as being the creation of a semi-autonomous Aboriginal entity, or as encroaching on State **rights**, whatever they may be.

* I thought we were talking about human **rights**.

* It seems that in this case the Minister is giving priority to State **rights**.

* He is not concerned with the **rights** of Aboriginals or of Australians but with State **rights**.

* He hopes thereby to quell any disquiet, any complaint, any demur by the people of the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves in particular so that he and the Premier of Queensland and his Ministers can in some way wriggle out of any intrusion by the Federal Government in its responsibilities for Aboriginal affairs, Aboriginal self-management and Aboriginal self-determination, into the sovereign **rights** of the State to control all local government matters.

* The powers that were spelt out in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-Management) Act, which was passed last week ostensibly for the purpose of overcoming the intrusion of the State into the legitimate **rights** of Aborigines to determine their own rate of acculturation into the western culture, are identical to those spelt out in the 1976 Act which deals with Aboriginal councils.

* been tender to the claims of minorities and to the **rights** of free association.

* I hope that the great defender of the **rights** of this House against the Senate, the member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  will give his advice on this question.

* The fact that a person is born in this country ought to give him some entitlement no matter where he goes, no matter what he does, no matter how long he is away from this country and that ought to be part of the general acceptance of our citizenship and **rights**.

* Therefore those **rights** which flow to a person while he is resi dent in this country ought in ordinary circumstances apply when he is away from this country.

* A banker, like anyone else who deals with property inconsistently with the **rights** of the true owner, is liable to the true owner in an action for conversion.

* The Bill contains two proposed provisions directed to that end: Proposed new section 88c, which is intended to preserve the value of paid order cheques as evident of receipt of the amount of the cheque, and proposed new section 88b, which is intended to preserve the **rights** that a collecting banker now has as a holder for value under section 32 in respect of indorsed order cheques.

* The purpose of new section 88e is to ensure that a collecting banker who at the present time has the **rights** of a holder for value in respect of an indorsed cheque will not be prejudiced by the proposed change in the law to do away with the necessity for indorsement on cheques payable to order that are paid into the payee's account.

* In order that a collecting banker will continue to have the **rights** of a holder for value in respect of cheques that will not in future be indorsed because they will be collected for the payee, new section 88e provides that the banker will have the **rights** of a holder that he would have had if the payee had indorsed it in blank.

* In particular, this Bill makes provision for the long service leave and workers compensation **rights** of the railway employees transferring from those State railway services to the Australian National Railways.

* I do not quarrel with the principle of the **rights** of a Prime Minister and leaders of a Government to travel overseas to ensure that they are up to date with trends and expectations of other nations, but what I do comment on is that on their return it is the right of the Australian people through their Parliament to know what the Prime Minister and the Ministers have learnt by their experiences.

* If that is the case, what action will the Government take to overcome unilateral action by some Canberra doctors to limit the freedom of choice of patients in Canberra and to deprive patients of their **rights** under Medibank?

* I hope that some of these proposals will be recognised for what they are- expressions of concern for the preservation of the **rights** of the individual.

* I am not one who goes overboard in that particular area but when we start to transgress on the **rights** of individuals to their privacy our steps must be considered most carefully and most properly.

* Territory on 3 1 December 1976, as evidenced by motions recently passed at the Northern Land Council and at the land **rights** meeting in Sydney attended by Aboriginal delegates from all over Australia.

* The Minister for Defence referred to the inviolability of human **rights** and quoted the United Nations Charter.

* This statement of American purposes is unexceptionable and the case for the American action of recent days is based on the aim of shortening the war and achieving a negotiated settlement, which would establish and maintain the **rights**  of  the South Vietnamese people, and deserves sympathetic Australian understanding.

* and a beginning of support for the human **rights**' revolution, around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* The Government does not care that the Marcos regime, with which it is making bilateral arrangements, has already demonstrated total disregard not only for the protests of people of the Philippines who live near the reactor site but also for the democratic and constitutional **rights** of the entire population of that nation.

* Labor people will not be satisfied with some shifty footwork by the Government on Aboriginal land **rights** or so-called safeguards against proliferation.

* By conducting uranium mining under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act the Government has the power to deny ordinary industrial **rights** to workers and unions associated with the mining, handling and transportation of uranium.

* The Act denies basic civil **rights** to any persons, including workers and union members, who hinder uranium mining in any way.

* All told, the use of this piece of legislation to cover commercial uranium mining ventures in a climate of growing public hostility to uranium mining and export, poses a serious threat to civil liberties and to the industrial **rights** of a significant section of the Australian work force.

* The Ordinance contained provisions protecting from its operation **rights** that had accrued before its commencement.

* This result has been achieved by amending certain provisions in the principal ordinance which ensured that it did not operate against **rights** that had already accrued before the principal Ordinance came into operation.

* This protection has now been extended to cover **rights** that had accrued under transactions entered into before the announcement which was released at midnight on 15th March 1972 Australian Eastern Standard Time.

* Shares held in excess of 15 per cent under this special arrangement will have normal voting **rights** and their holders will be able to participate in any new general share issues by virtue of their holdings of these shares.

* The scheme is to cover exports of manufactured goods, some bulk farm and agricultural products, services provided overseas, value added industrial services provided in Australia performed on overseas owned items subsequently re-exported, and the sale of industrial property **rights** and know-how that are substantially of Australian origin.

* I simply point out that the amendments originally proposed by the Government, which are now incorporated in this Bill, are more restrictive of the **rights** of mining companies holding mining interests which contain a right of renewal than the original provision in this respect in the Bill which I introduced on 4 June.

* The point is that the only **rights** of renewal which are protected are statutory **rights** in existence prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land.

* Without elaboration I refer the Committee to paragraphs 274 and 328, item 9, of his report, and remind the Committee that the legislation deals exclusively with traditional land **rights**.

* What steps has the Minister taken to ensure that (a) Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are trained to take over management of their communities in Queensland without inhibitions due to control by others of their domiciles, movements, transport, communications, employment, political activity or equal access to public amenities, ( b ) Aboriginal and Islander communities have similarly unfettered **rights** to (i) negotiate terms of entry to their land by mining interests, (ii) expand Federal Government grants with responsibility to Federal sources of State intervention and (iii) acquire joint ownership of pastoral or other leases or freehold land directly or through a Land Council or Federal authority as freely as other Australian or foreign interests do or to have reasons for refusal given to them or Federal authorities and (c) those aspects of Queensland law which breach Federal laws or international conventions on human **rights** are overridden and State Officials who breach these laws or conventions are punished.

* We in Australia must remember that as citizens we have both **rights** and responsibilities.

* This Bill has to do with the **rights** of Territorians.

* The other question posed at that referendum concerned the voting **rights** of Aborigines.

* The people of the Northern Territory, who were probably more concerned with the **rights** of Aborigines than were people in any other community in Australia, were denied the right to vote at that referendum.

* I bring this Bill forward now demanding that the **rights** of Territorians be recognised.

* Instead of restricting the Bill and the subsequent referendum questions to the **rights** of people in the Territories to vote at referenda, the Government added a third question which had heavy implications which the people of the States just could not possibly accept.

* The fact is that it is not interested in giving and has really made no effort to give Territorians their full **rights**.

* The fact is that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory has been given no **rights** or powers despite the recommendations contained in 2 reports by that Joint Committee.

* This is why I am bringing to the attention of the House the fact that people of the Northern Territory are being denied their **rights** in respect of voting at referendums.

* I urge the Government to consider this Bill and listen to the cries of the people from the Northern Territory to have the same **rights** as people in the rest of Australia.

* (a) All states have enacted legislation  concerned  with the protection of certain **rights** of the consumer.

* The Australian Government has some power to protect certain **rights** of the consumer under legislation such as: 
There are other aspects of the noise menace of aircraft.

* Surely the **rights** of little people have to be protected.

* They are the very basis of the principle of separate development and distinct **rights** as between people.

* We desire to remain friendly with countries without surrendering basic **rights**.

* Therefore, if a foreign policy attitude is adopted on account of a conception of basic **rights** and there is evidence of attempts to alter those **rights** there is a consequent obligation on a country to take those attempts into account.

* However, through constant harassment and the imprisonment of several of the National Leaders, they are denied of their human **rights** and deprived of freedom by the Brazilian Government.

* It attempts to deal with a question of major social importance - a matter with a wide range of associated questions of medicine, social welfare, the physical and mental health of mothers, basic human **rights**, and the **rights** and freedoms of doctors, nurses and hospital staffs.

* The Royal College of Obstetricians, in paragraph 20 of its evidence to the Lane Committee, notes proven cases of duress on doctors, nurses and theatre staff - and Britain's law is more restricted than that which is proposed here in respect of doctor's **rights**.

* The official South Australian Statutory Committee examining the operation of that State's Abortion Act note that the law did not provide adequate protection for doctors' **rights** and convictions but that it was, in practice, coercive of doctors.

* It is, after all, the duty of this national Parliament and its members to determine an issue in which civil **rights** and the welfare of the mother are involved.

* Even when she does have an abortion, she automatically involves the **rights** and consciences of a large number of other people - her doctor, the gynaecologist, the nursing staff, the theatre staff, the anaesthetist, and many others.

* These are people who are personally involved and whose **rights** must also be recognised and protected.

* What is at stake in this issue is also the **rights** and civil liberties of everyone in this nation.

* And because it is the basic right in a democratic society, all other **rights** and the exercise of our civil liberties rest on that fundamental proposition.

* What use are our other **rights** and civil liberties if we cannot be assured of the basic right on which they all rest?

* Yet that, I believe, is what we are being asked to do, to shake the whole structure of **rights** and civil liberties by agreeing to the erosion of that basic right.

* It is contrary to the human **rights** and humane values which must be the fundamental concerns of a democratic society.

* Under the pretence of appealing to indi vidual **rights** it attacks the whole structure of **rights** and civil liberties.

* With the three years that you now have ahead of you, you can make a real contribution to the **rights** and privileges of members of this Parliament.

* Knowing your interest, I trust you will continue during this Parliament to fight for those **rights** of members and impress upon the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  the needs which have arisen.

* I do not think it would do any harm if the Government were to give a very firm undertaking to the people working in the industry that their **rights** and conditions would be protected in any merger arrangement, especially pension **rights**.

* I think the Government could give a clear indication to those persons employed in the Government Aircraft Factories that they will not lose the **rights** and privileges which have accrued to them merely because the Government wants to get out from under in the aircraft industry.

* There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the **rights** and interests of the Australian people protected.

* A halt must be called somewhere along the line, because what is happening to him could easily be the first step in the erosion of the democratic **rights** of all Australians, which are the same **rights** that thousands of Australians went away and fought for, and in support of which many were either killed or maimed.

* If any person in public life acts improperly in respect of the **rights** of nations or the **rights** of people, sooner or later he is brought to book.

* What action is available to individuals who suspect their privacy and civil **rights** have been infringed and who wish to protect themselves from this infringement 
If so, can he say whether they have come in the belief that their social security **rights** earned in  Germany  can be transferred to Australia.

* The disposal of water **rights** by any State falls within its own responsibility.

* This means that if landing and uplift **rights** are not available these persons will simply travel on charter flights to different destinations.

* That which results from Aborigines not know their own **rights** or having the power to apply them, so that in the courts of the North many more Aborigines are arrested and charged with drunkenness and appear before the courts without adequate legal representatives, say, than is the case with the white community.

* They have no **rights** whatsoever.

* The Public Service Board; but provision of such statistical information will be strictly in accordance with accepted principles which ensure the **rights** to individual privacy are preserved.

* When it is desirous to have people conciliate one can inform them of their **rights** and inform them that certain facilities are available.

* The Country Party joins with the Government and the Liberal Party in supporting the proposed amendment of the River Murray Waters Act to safeguard the superannuation **rights** of present officeholders of the River Murray Commission and to encourage staff recruitment from other sources, including transfers from Commonwealth employment.

* It allows people who wish to break the law to understand exactly what is front of them so that they cannot claim that they acted in confusion and cannot claim **rights** which existed under the old law - not because they were entitled to such **rights** but because of the inadequacy of the legislation.

* Clause 8 seeks to require that the value of benefits received under a stock option or share purchase scheme be measured at the time of the exercise of the option or on the transfer of the shares rather than, as at present, when the **rights** are acquired.

* It will prevent the abuse of the system by offering options at absurdly low market values in relation to their ultimate realisation value and, in some cases, protect those employees from unjustified taxation where **rights** have declined in value prior to the exercise of an option.

* He is exercising a judicial role in the same way as a judge and I believe that in this situation, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case and having regard to the serious question of ministerial responsibility, you ought to find for the Parliament being able to deal with those issues of ministerial responsibility but being able to deal with them in a way which cannot and should not affect the **rights** of any person charged before the courts.

* I repeat: In my judgment- and this is a matter of judgmentthe equating of 12 months separation with the irretrievable breakdown of marriage is indeed arbitrary and unreal to the point of being unjust, in particular in depriving persons of **rights** now available to them.

* the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare; and 
The fact is that the International Atomic Energy Agency has no authority to take action against any violations other than simply to announce them.

* After all, the United States has traditionally insisted on the same veto **rights** as the Minister now asserts Australia will have, but the United States found that these **rights** were violated in 19 cases between 1971 and 1974.

* 1 ) Has he registered the Australian Medical Association (NSW) Health Fund Ltd as a registered medical and hospital benfits organisation; if so, does that Fund provide that each contributor have full voting **rights**.

* Does the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia provide any voting **rights** for contributors; if not, why not.

* Of course it wants the money, but the Victorian Minister is putting up a fight for certain **rights**.

* I thought this was a rather odd consensus coming from members of the Australian Labor Party who are supposed to champion the **rights** of the working class.

* One would have thought that from the self-confessed champions of the working class, the beer drinkers, that at least some mention would have been made of the **rights** of the beer drinker.

* It is laudable to be concerned for the **rights** of the consumer.

* The maintenance of consumer **rights** may be stated as an objective of the Prices Justification Tribunal but only the Bill will show whether it is a reality.

* I appreciate his idealism but I find it hard to accept the notion of a prices justification tribunal as upholding the **rights** of the consumer by pillorying the major supermarket when it increases the price of bargain basement items but leaving without scrutiny every shopkeeper whose turnover last year was less than $20m.

* I am fully aware of the need for the **rights** of the consumer and I am most concerned with the present galloping inflation, as would any Australian be.

* It should be borne in mind that the kangaroo should have some **rights** in this country of ours.

* If he had received a report on the trial, I asked him whether it indicated that the trial accorded with the Soviet Union's claim to be taking human **rights** more seriously in accordance with its minimal Helsinki Pact obligations.

* Consistent with the Government 's commitment to promote respect for human **rights** as set out in international instruments such as the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement and the UN Convenants on Human Rights, the Minister has in the past expressed the Government's concern to the Soviet authorities about questions of human **rights** and will continue to do so.

* I believe that the Minister's statement as well as the publicly expressed concern of the Australian people at the treatment of  Dr Orlov  will demonstrate to the Soviet authorities the strength of our commitment to basic human **rights**.

* I believe that if there are any people in this community who are prepared to stand up and be counted on the issue of human **rights**, they should now be prepared to stand up and be counted on the basic and fundamental question whether or not Moscow is entitled to hold the 1980 Olympic Games.

* I take considerable support from honourable members such as the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Simon)  and others in this Parliament who for a long time have been concerned about the question of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* I am absolutely convinced that those who say it is something on which we cannot make a stand, that those who say that we should not bring politics into sport, and that those who can come up with 10 1 reasons why we should not put ourselves out, should think again because no less a person- I should say no less a hero- than  Dr A.  K. Sakharov, in his book  My Country and the World,  made a statement which I believe should be the clarion call to those in the free countries of the West who believe in individual human **rights**.

* I draw attention to the fact that this week the parliamentary committee inquiring into the question of human **rights** behind the Iron Curtain will be taking evidence from a man who until six months ago was a prisoner behind the Iron Curtain.

* The table shows some of the countries that have extended voting **rights** to citizens 18 years of age.

* If honourable members look at the human **rights** provisions set down by the United Nations they will see that they clearly show that a person shall not engage in acts of violence that will endanger the lives of others.

* Other people have human **rights** also.

* In the Angolan situation before these people were executed  Mr Jack  Dromey, a former  Chairman  of the National Council for Civil Liberties, said: 
a ) power to suspend, to the extent specified in the order, any of the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the organization or of all or any of its members, as such members, under this Act or any other Act or under awards or determinations under this Act or under any other Act; 
power to give directions as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities that have been so suspended; 
The proposed new clause relates to the use of parks and reserves by Aboriginals, in accordance with law, for their traditional use of the area of land or water for hunting, food gathering and so.

* Certainly we will have national parks where obviously we will have to observe the **rights** of the Aboriginals to use them in a traditional fashion but, of course, not to destroy the purpose of the park.

* matters arising out of the **rights** (including sovereign **rights**) of Australia in relation to the continental shelf of Australia; 
Back in the old days of the 1 890s trade unions had to be formed to get some **rights** for the workers and back in the Industrial Revolution in the early 1 820s something had to be done to get children out of the mines.

* The competitive granting of mineral exploration **rights** on absurd terms in the name of progress has resulted in the States, in many cases, being allowed to usurp national functions.

* There is only IS per cent Australian equity in the consortium holding off-shore exploration **rights** on the North West Continental Shelf of Western Australia, where 142,000 square miles of one of the world 's largest potential natural gas areas are held by it- an area beyond the full capacity of even the largest company to intensively explore.

* We have refused applications from it to agree to the transfer of its obligations by 'farm-out' to other companies on a 50-50 basis, ignoring the **rights** of Australian sovereignty.

* The second matter relates to the extension of the present provision covering false recommendations- this is section 53- to misrepresentation or false or misleading statements concerning the composition, history or previous use of goods, the price of goods or services and the existence, exclusion or effect of **rights** or remedies of consumers.

* make some brief comments on the points raised by the honourable member for Banks  (Mr Martin)  and to assure him that the matter has been brought to my notice and that interest has been taken in the matter of plant growers' problems in terms of patent **rights** and so on.

* But in a third area, the second manufacturer has no **rights** whatsoever.

* The achievement of these objectives requires a tax system in which the **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded by: 
This amendment inserts a new proposed section to substitute for the original proposed new section 82v.

* I believe that it is a proper provision which will safeguard the civil **rights** of occupiers of premises.

* It is a provision which protects the **rights** of people to that extent.

* The general policy is that the Australian Government, in accordance with its constitutional **rights** in relation to property used for Australian Government purposes, does not pay rates on such property.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or binder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Such frustrations are natural and must build up pressure within the armed forces for action, irrespective of the **rights** or wrongs of the conflict.

* 1 ) Has the West German airline, Lufthansa, or its charter subsidiary, Condor, applied for landing **rights** at Brisbane International Airport.

* Has he made a decision as to whether approval will be given for landing **rights** for the company.

* At times when business became too big it developed its own bureaucracy and the bureaucracy of big business, big unions or big government often militate against the **rights** of individuals.

* He gave himself away when he said that the **rights** of the trade union movements must be preserved and any form of industrial action should be preserved as the province of the trade union movement.

* This is a pluralist society in which checks and balances have to be found between the **rights** of various groups and the **rights** of individuals.

* That is a complete denial of the **rights** of housewives to purchase bread at reasonable prices.

* But, instead, what the Fraser Government has decided to do is to rush into a decision just three months after the publication of the second Fox report and thereby to sacrifice the democratic **rights** of the Australian people on this vitally important issue.

* The Prime Minister and his Government are so keen to please the multinational uranium producers that they are not willing to allow the Australian people the chance to exercise their democratic **rights** to decide on the future of uranium mining, because of the risk of the Australian people deciding on a moratorium.

* Firstly, it had the advantage of disciplining unions, because if there is a large army of people waiting for a job at the factory door it is less likely that those inside the factory will want to change their jobs, it is less likely that they will want to go on strike and, indeed, it is less likely that they will even fight and stick up for their **rights**.

* The honourable member for Lilley, who has just spoken, was himself a victim of the callous disregard evidenced by the former Government for the **rights** of people to have a job.

* Under this Bill the employee also has **rights** of appeal to an independent tribunal against decisions taken under the legislation.

* We are providing the **rights** of appeal that are not there now.

* The issue of land **rights** goes to the very heart of the Aboriginal situation.

* Ever since, we have had to drag land **rights** into this House and the other place against the wishes of honourable members opposite to keep the issue alive.

* If we take the analogy of Aurukun and transfer it to the Northern Territory situation what guarantee do we have that the Aboriginals will have permanent **rights** and security of tenure of their land?

* There are not many people in Australia, even among honourable members opposite in the Liberal Party, who would place any faith in the Premier of Queensland when it came to the preservation of human **rights** or anything else.

* The fact is that it is pretty clear throughout the community and to Australians generally that unless we strengthen this land **rights** legislation almost everything we do for the Aboriginal people will be brought into disarray.

* UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, the 1LO Convention of 1958 concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, the International Covenants on Human Rights, and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
adequate measures to safeguard the environment and national parks and protect Aboriginal **rights** and interests.

* adequate measures to safeguard the environment and national parks and protect Aboriginal **rights** and interests.

* Labor has evolved a practical program to ensure our basic civil **rights** and freedoms- to reshape our laws to meet the needs and aspirations of the seventies.

* Hospital planning on a regional basis and insurance coverage on a universal basis are the keys both to Labor's health programme and to relief of that disastrous predicament to which all our public hospitals have been reduced by Liberal parsimony and the Liberal rhetoric of States' **rights**.

* It is understood that Refuse Conversion Pry Ltd obtained the **rights** to use in Australia a process developed by Herr.

* Is it necessarily desirable that Aboriginal people who are not completely fullbloods should not participate in some way in these land councils and be given some land **rights**.

* In view of the Prime Minister's keen and stated interest in the representations on public lending **rights** from the Australian Society of Authors, I ask him whether the Government is currently examining the proposition by authors .

* Can the Prime Minister give our authors any encouragement that public lending **rights** will become law?

* The rest relate to the procedures to be pursued by the Trade Practices Commission, the **rights** of parties before the Commission and the way in which business firms must conduct themselves in the marketplace.

* This policy was aimed at denying China its **rights** and recognition as a great power.

* It is for that reason that I would like to see their **rights** recognised.

* in the 1960s there was serious trouble between India and China, India nevertheless has maintained the view consistently that it should continue diplomatic relations with the Chinese and should continue to press for the granting of legitimate **rights** to the People's Republic of China.

* On 20th November 1970 the Indian representative on the United Nations said: 
Our support for the restoration of the **rights** of the People's Republic of China is based on the principles of the universality of our Organisation as also on the provisions of the Charter.

* That shows what people can do if they stand up for their **rights**.

* I hope that a lot of other people will take notice of the result achieved by the cherry growers in standing up for their **rights** and will follow their example.

* That is not bad going and again illustrates what can be done when people stand up for their **rights**.

* That is claptrap and I think it is an infringement of the **rights** and privacy of the individual.

* As I said earlier, this legislation is a vicious intrusion into the **rights** of the individual, of the little peoplenot just the big people, not just the multinationals.

* It must be very careful that it does not bring down laws that will ultimately work against the principles upon which this society of ours is based- the freedom and the **rights** of the individual.

* In international relations, for which the Federal Government alone bears responsibility - for example the International Labour Organisation, maritime and human **rights** conventions - the States stagnate and obstruct.

* a statutory member of the Office has all the **rights** and privileges of a solicitor; and 
a member of the staff of the Office has all the **rights** and privileges of a solicitor employed by a person practising as a solicitor on his own account.

* The proposition that the Minister is putting before us is that there should be automatic **rights** of renewal even in respect of the new legalised Aboriginal ownership.

* If, for example, any of those companies that I have mentioned presently developing the rock phosphate deposits in Queensland, presently developing the north-west shelf gas finds, presently developing nickel fields in Western Australia, sought to move into their own areas for which they have been granted title and exploration **rights** under State law, to carry on the work that they have been doing for years, they could be liable, pursuant to clause 51 of this Bill, to a fine of up to $2,000 or imprisonment for 2 years.

* It is good politics, but it is a very blatant and cynical way to treat two electorates which are supposed to have the same **rights** and privileges as any other electorate in Australia.

* They are really not interested in giving to the people of Canberra the **rights** that other people enjoy.

* Has he stated that the Government does not recognise traditional Aboriginal land **rights**; if  so,  what is the explanation of, and what are the reasons for, this policy.

* Does the Government have any alternative to the granting of land **rights** to Aboriginals.

* To this we should add the recognition of the contribution of the staff of the Corporation whose **rights**, as I have pointed out, will be protected under this Bill.

* provision of adequate **rights** and means  of redress; 
provision of information and education  to facilitate sound choice and the  proper exercise of consumers' **rights**; 
by leave - This is not a statement on the control of off-shore minerals or on the need to decide where proper legal authority for that control should lie.

* In February 1969 Cabinet decided that the Commonwealth should legislate to assert total **rights** over the seabed outside the 3-mile limit.

* As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the three-mile limit, lt proposes to legislate in pursuance of this position.

* Foreign Students in Australia: Rights 
foreign students in Australia have full civil **rights** while in Australia; 
The honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  has some endearing characteristics and mannerisms, and I am sorry that tonight I do not have his spectacles to wind up my argument in the way he twirls them to wind himself up.

* Tonight we are talking about representation of a population half as large as that of Tasmania, which has long been carried by one member for the ACT, a member for many years denied full representation **rights** and the opportunity to vote on issues affecting the Commonwealth of Australia.

* We need to have a proper recognition of people's **rights** in this place tonight.

* I ask this individualist laissez-faire Liberal Party which pays such tribute to the **rights** and privileges of Australian citizens: Where is this great thing tonight?

* Even if we accept the proposition that we should have a fraction of the representation that Tasmania has, the request that 4 people should represent the **rights** of the people of the ACT is a very mediocre request when we are confronted with 609 representatives for twice the population of the ACT.

* I see no sound reason why honourable members opposite should vote against this amendment unless it be that they are completely inhibited not by the demands of committee work but by the discipline of their Party and their failure to assert their **rights** in it.

* My colleague from Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  for instance, has often been noted and quoted as having a very high regard for parliamentary democracy, for the **rights** of private members and for the necessity for us to remove from the Executive some of its transcendental authority.

* What we are after is that the political activity of the Aboriginal people and their political **rights** be guaranteed by a program of education, enrolment, and so on, to ensure that when elections are held, the Aboriginal people take their place in the community as such.

* It makes me sick to hear some of the hypocrisy that comes from the mouths of men about the **rights** of women to control their own bodies.

* I think my friend erred a little when he said that this move is an attempt to disturb the traditional **rights** of private members.

* I yield to no person in this place in seeking to preserve the **rights** of private members.

* I do not know how this Government can rectify the situation but I do ask the Minister to use all his influence, knowledge and sympathy for the people of the north to put this matter at **rights** because from November until the rainy season sets in it is sheer hell living and working in Darwin.

* Whatever party they belong to it is time the Government looked to safeguarding the ordinary **rights** of students to hold political opinions of their own without fear of discrimination at the academic level.

* I ask the Government to move to protect the basic liberty and human **rights** of these students who are undoubtedly being intimated and to ensure that they are not discriminated against.

* But I think we ought to have some **rights** of privacy.

* In conclusion 1 say that children of the outback have equal **rights** with children living in the elite areas of the capital cities to a good education.

* The second Convention accords sovereign **rights** for the purpose of exploring and exploiting natural resources to each country over a continental shelf to a depth of 200 metres or to where the superjacent waters admit of the exploitation of natural resources.

* There is a very real civil **rights** belief that to require finger-printing on passports might well transgress the general form of our community requirements in this area.

* Its only difficulty is that it intrudes to far too great a degree on the **rights** of individuals.

* The first relates to a disgraceful episode in which a pig-headed and stupid government set about deliberately victimising a small but significant group of trade unionists who wished to stand up for their **rights** and the protection of their jobs.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition closed his eyes to breach after breach and of course this meant that migrants who could not speak English and did not understand their **rights** were being exploited.

* The Commission therefore will have the same **rights** and obligations under the National Health Act and regulations as other registered organisations.

* Their recommendations will long be remembered as major reforms leading to the establishment of a practicable and workable system of supervision of government activities which can serve only to preserve and advance the **rights** and liberties of the individual citizen.

* I conclude by repeating the substantial point which I made at the beginning, and that is that this proposal for a Commonwealth Ombudsman is a very forward step and one which can help to guarantee the **rights** and liberties of the individual citizen in the continuing confrontation that the citizen has these days with government in all its ramifications.

* My colleague the present Minister for Repatriation and Compensation  (Senator Wheeldon)  has taken up the **rights** and privileges of and our duties and obligations to the servicemen with a vigour which certainly transcends that of his predecessors on the other side of the fence.

* They are limited to a maximum of two years and will not entitle either foreign or Australian participants in them to any exclusive or preferential **rights** in any fishery that may develop.

* Apart from certain direct financial benefits, such as access fees, which will flow to the community from the AFZ, the Government anticipates that other benefits will flow, for example, to the Australian fishing industry as it increases its share of the total allowable catch; to the fish processing industry, which may handle a portion of the foreign catch as well as the expected increase in domestic production; and to traders and local authorities in ports to which licensed foreign boats are granted entry **rights**.

* During the course of my remarks I shall give honourable members some details justifying this statement and explaining how a decision was made as to what was the status of freedom and what the political and civil **rights** were like in a particular country.

* Each country receives a score for political **rights** and a score for civil **rights**.

* One is a perfect score and seven represents a complete absence of civil and political **rights**.

* I shall read to honourable members the countries which, according to the authors of this table, have complete political and civil **rights**.

* It received a perfect score of one for political **rights** and a score of two for civil **rights**.

* The organisation makes the following points: 
A democracy requires civil and political **rights**.

* Civil **rights** are the **rights** of the individual against the state, **rights** to free expression, to a fair trial; they are what most of us mean by freedom.

* Political **rights** are legal **rights** to play a part in determining who governs or what the laws of the community are.

* Of course, to a degree the two kinds of **rights** are interdependent: civil **rights** without political **rights** are apt to be lost and political **rights** without civil **rights** are meaningless.

* The organisation's account of its methods of deciding political **rights** is as follows: 
When a country's standing in political **rights** is analysed, attention is first directed to general elections.

* To be ranked (1) in political **rights** it has to be assumed that the great majority of persons or families in the state have both **rights** and opportunities to participate in the electoral process.

* The publication goes on to discuss civil **rights**.

* It states: 
Turning to civil **rights**, we are interested first of all in freedom of the Press.

* With a high level of civil **rights**, **rights** are safe for nearly everyone and nearly everywhere against violence or arbitrary action by police or mobs.

* 1 think that to be ranked one in civil **rights** means that the rule of law is unshaken.

* On the other hand, when we get down to the bottom end of the civil **rights** scale the publication states: 
In states ranked (6) there are no generally accepted civil **rights** that are higher than the **rights** of the state.

* Citizens have no **rights** vis-a-vis the state.

* It is a depressing table in that so many countries all over the globe are ruled by regimes which prevent the majority of the population having any significant political or civil **rights**.

* It was quite depressing to me when I was attending the United Nations to find that so many of the resolutions coming forward criticising other countries for an alleged lack of democracy and of political freedoms were often sponsored by countries which almost never exceeded the six or seven ranking, which represents the bottom of the possibilities for both political and civil **rights**, and that countries where the people obviously have no political or civil **rights** were continuously ranting about alleged interference with freedom in other countries that admittedly also had relatively poor rankings but which certainly were no worse off than the people who were criticising them.

* He can feel part of it only if he is given equal **rights** on the Committee and equal **rights** to say where research will take place.

* It intends to deny basic civil **rights** and hard won industrial **rights** to meet the interests of the corporate rnining sector.

* If therefore the Government proceeds to act on the basis of an agreement made under duress, by the Northern Land Council or by an arbitrator, without it being subjected to the processes required to develop a consensus, the Government and its partners in the ventures are likely to encounter situations in which individual Aborigines or groups of Aborigines who feel their **rights** are being infringed will, in all good conscience, act in conflict with the terms of that agreement Such situations can be productive of grievance, hostility, and, potentially, violence and will damage further the already eroded confidence of Aborigines and their friends among white Australians in the Government's expressed concern for Aboriginal welfare and undertakings to protect their interests.

* They would replace reserve currencies with special drawing **rights** as the major asset of the future.

* They would impose upon the United States an obligation to convert other countries' holdings of dollars into special drawing **rights** whenever the United States ran into deficit.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Could I suggest .... there is a duty upon you, from the Chair, to protect him using your **rights** and prerogatives.

* In the pursuance of our own legal **rights** we can be denied legal assistance on the basis that we are deemed to have means.

* The great proportion of the Bill talks about protecting the **rights** of officers- the Officers Rights Declaration- when they become State officers.

* They are happy to give to the fourth arm of government power to introduce through legislative and arbitrative processes decisions which affect the **rights** of every individual in the community.

* As  I said before, at one time acts of God were used to stop workers from receiving their just **rights**.

* This is what the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  had to say in his second reading speech in regard to the question of the Commission having to pay regard to economic consequences: 
1 ) It is assumed that the report referred to is the Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 'Human Rights and Scientific and Technological Developments; uses of electronics which may affect the **rights** of the person and the limits which should be placed on such uses in a democratic society', dated 31 January 1974, and presented to the Thirtieth Session of the Commission on Human Rights.

* The Report is a study of problems in the area of human **rights** and personal privacy arising from the development of computerised personal data systems.

* It suggests that certain points be taken into account in the drafting of international standards relating to the protection of the **rights** of the individual against threats arising from the use of computerised personal data systems.

* Mr Speaker,  you would not even allow a full and proper examination of the **rights** of one of the members of this House because you wanted to shelter and protect the Prime Minister who, I believe, then commenced an operation which highlighted the lack of integrity standards and principles of this man.

* Of the total amount, that well known company and protector of the people's **rights**, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, receives an annual rental from the Government of $5,189,000; the National Mutual Life  Association of  Australasia Ltd receives $2,503,000; and the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Co. Ltd receives $3,172,000.

* To sum up, these great protectors of the people's **rights** are doing pretty well out of a socialist government.

* We are penalising people throughout Australia largely on a class basis in relation to their **rights** to vote for the upper House.

* Thousands and thousands of voters throughout New South Wales were denied their **rights** not because they did not want to vote formally, not because they did not want to understand for whom they were voting- they wanted a Labor Government, which they returned in the House of Representatives- but because people were exploiting the system, the old archiac system by which if there are 73 candidates one has to vote one to seventy three.

* A man and his wife who are both pensioners may each receive an income and still retain their **rights** to pensions.

* I recognise perhaps more than many people that States' **rights** are involved and that there are arguments for and against such a proposition.

* Payments to sporting bodies for the **rights** to televise sporting events amounted to $137,904.

* On 16 May 1975 I referred to the Law Reform Commission for inquiry and report the question of the appropriate legislative means of safeguarding individual **rights** and liberties in relation to the law enforcement process by the Australia Police.

* The Commission's second report is devoted to the difficult issue of the proper balance between police powers which respect the **rights** of the individual on the one hand and the community's need for practical and effective law enforcement on the other.

* Part VIII provides transitional provisions in relation to the appointment and preservation of **rights** of police officers automatically transferred to the Australia Police.

* What about the **rights** of the individual?

* Not only do they cut directly across the **rights** of individual workers, but they introduce dangerous practices that can subvert the time honoured system followed in these matters where there have been no allegations of abuse.

* I make it very clear that legislation is not drafted in this way by those who are interested in the **rights** of people.

* He has not been informed of his **rights** so far as rehabilitation is concerned although he laid for months on a sick bed.

* Clause 2 1 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* They can order that a particular employee or group of employees shall forfeit all legal **rights** to accrued annual leave, to accrued long service leave or sick leave, no matter how much this leave might amount to.

* In Executive Council they could also deprive particular groups or particular named employees of their **rights** to claim the rates of pay prescribed by an award or an agreement.

* It seems to be virtually impossible to control except in cancelling landing **rights** of an international airline coming into Australia.

* I have said before that I feel that the greatest threat to that national unity - the one spark which may cause an explosion - is the fear that exists in some areas that the central government in Port Moresby will sweep away their land **rights**.

* The Minister recently made a speech in which he said that it was not the Government's policy to recognise traditional land **rights**.

* Abschol the National Union of University Students, many university people, trade unions, Aboriginal **rights** organisations and of course many individuals have taken an interest in them.

* The change in the sessional orders is designed to protect the **rights** of private members.

* Unfortunately, the Labor Party has not been wont in the past or in the present to have any concern whatsoever for those **rights**.

* Yet he stands in this House and dares to talk about the **rights** of people to express a view.

* I can only comment that 1 could not agree more with the Minister for Social Services when he suggests that fair is fair in relation to these matters and if one is to take a stand on the **rights** of people to express an opinion in this or any other community one should be consistent and say that coercion and threats should not be allowed to stop people speaking.

* What  1  refuse to accept is that workers in a particular field, such as miners at Mount Isa or drillers at Kambalda, should feel that they have exclusive **rights** to bonuses for success and that the benefits should not go also to the teacher who trains their children, the policeman who guards their security, the postman who delivers their mail and, if you like, the income tax clerk who assesses their two returns.

* I believe that the **rights** of members of this Parliament to such information as can, and should be made available are just as great.

* These terms of reference will allow Ministers collectively to have the fullest opportunity and the responsibility of maintaining an effective and efficient intelligence community, responsive to the needs of government and the **rights** of citizens.

* I have had brought to my notice in my time things which I regarded as very dangerous to the **rights** of individuals and their future.

* The Opposition is totally dissatisfied about the protection of the **rights** of individuals under this Bill.

* This practice also occurs with regard to statements made by Ministers but Ministers have **rights** in this House which are not available to ordinary members, that is, the right to table documents.

* While we will continue to use the appellate system to protect the **rights** of the individual, we also will expect the Appeals Tribunal to be more realistic and effective in the task before it and not simply to pass people just because an appeal has been made.

* Under that requirement, of course, Australia is at liberty to negotiate for some advantageous position by way of trading fishing **rights** within the 200-mile zone.

* But trading presupposes that a country has something to sell, and because we have demonstrated historically our lack of capacity to develop those resources, I am not convinced that we can persuade foreign nations to advance a consideration to us for fishing **rights** within the area described when they know full well that, if we persist with our present inefficient and ineffective measures, in some brief time international opinion will direct Australia to make available to foreign nations those waters within the 200-mile zone.

* Before 1972 we took the very old fashioned and traditional view that governments had **rights** and prerogatives which were the property of the elected government.

* Was South African Airway granted (a) extra flights and (b) **rights** to concession fares on this route; if so, why.

* What was the net revenue to Qantas from this route in each of the 2 financial years prior to the withdrawal of Qantas ' **rights** to operate these services.

* It is impossible to make an accurate assessment of these figures, let alone authenticate them but they all point to a gross violation of human **rights**, perhaps in relative terms infinitely more serious than the situation in any other country at this time.

* It is a wholly unjustifiable claim of right which amounts to an unjustifiable denial of the **rights** of others.

* The case is then dealt with in court and the person can exercise his civil **rights** in the court to challenge the evidence given by the police.

* He could forget about the procedures of drawing up and serving summonses and **rights** of appeal and all the rest of it.

* As I understand it, there is no question but that they will enjoy full, normal **rights** of promotion from Darwin into positions elsewhere in the Commonwealth Public Service throughout Australia.

* So, as a matter of fact in law their **rights** are preserved.

* I could not agree more about the need to reassure Commonwealth public servants presently working in areas which will be delegated to the Legislative Assembly, that their **rights** and their futures will be fully preserved.

* What **rights** will we have in this field?

* I believe that we must fight for those **rights** now.

* The **rights** of individuals in industrial relations have been protected.

* At its Adelaide Conference, the Labor Party committed an ALP Government to repeal immediately 'all penalties for strikes against arbitral decisions of the Commission or a conciliation committee and the prohibition of action by the Commission to insert or register clauses in awards or agreements excluding the **rights** of workers to resort to industrial action*.

* The Labor Party has also given a commitment to recognise 'the **rights** of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way free from Government and judicial interference'.

* Under a Labor Government, unions would be positively encouraged to trample over the **rights** of individual workers with a genuine conscientious objection to union membership or to engaging in industrial action.

* The Government will have no part of policies which grant any section of the community extraordinary, unjustifiable privileges which can be used to deny others their legitimate **rights**.

* For years now the Aboriginal people of Australia have been demanding an absolute land **rights** situation.

* It has been an accepted principle of law almost since the first colonial settlements by the British and by the Spanish that no government has ever taken land **rights** seriously.

* I think the time has come when we should not surrender basic human **rights** to such things as mining for material advantage and to what is apparently the even more sacred right- State **rights**- which is implicit in attitudes towards the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* We might ask why legal **rights** transcend moral **rights**.

* They spoke about democracy, human **rights** and all the rest, yet they represented some of the most repressive governments in history.

* We are confirming the **rights** of the possessors of power in the form of wealth and the mining companies over the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* This piece of legislation comes at the endperhaps it is only the beginning- of a long series of negotiations and campaigns for Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I suppose the campaign about land **rights** was generated in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

* Land **rights** became an issue to Aboriginal people of Australia.

* The campaign for land **rights** flowed from there.

* From such humble beginnings the great movement for Aboriginal land **rights** has grown.

* We recognise the serious challenge that land **rights** makes to our whole legal system and our whole land property system.

* The Government must not continue to hide and refuse to recognise the importance of this subject, simply saying that it is going to overcome the problems of the people of Australia by establishing a committee on tourism, or on Aboriginal land **rights**, or on foreign affairs, or on expenditure.

* It does not matter what **rights** are curtailed, whether they are State **rights** or individual **rights**.

* It is, of course, the sort of inevitable process which will develop under a government such as this Government and under a Prime Minister who is so arrogant that he is not really concerned about the **rights** of the Parliament, just as he is not concerned about the **rights** of the States.

* The difficulty about the clause of the Bill that I put last season was that once we include a provision in the Act that decrees that an agreement automatically expires at its termination date, we immediately create at that moment a hiatus which cannot be filled until the agreement is renewed or replaced and during that period of hiatus there is a situation in which at law employees would not be entitled to claim any of their accrued annual leave or sick leave **rights** or long service leave **rights**, if long service leave happened to be a feature of the agreement.

* It is the only system which can safeguard the **rights** of the individual within society and prevent us all from becoming servants of an omnipotent State ruled by the few and served by the many.

* The new clause 98a now provides similar **rights**, in all circumstances, in the one clause.

* In one sense deterrence is a complete negation of justice and individual **rights**.

* It is true that people may be able to go to these Aboriginal areas and talk themselves into **rights** to which they are not entitled.

* These forms and procedures must be respected if we are not to lose, one by one, the **rights** and freedoms which have been built up in this country and if we are not to see them whittled away.

* The Australian Embassy in Laos has had a number of discussions with Lao Government leaders which have embraced such questions as human **rights** as well as cultural and academic exchanges.

* Discussions with Kampuchean representatives have covered the Australian Government's concern regarding human **rights** questions in Kampuchea.

* This is my thought and the other Aboriginal men stop we are not satisfied land trusts go to anyone I am land trust myself according to my law stop Please we want you to come to us on Thursday to talk about this matter stop We want to see you come and talk with us stop  Mr Eli  Rubuntja and we other men stop We are leaders of Aboriginal people stop We want to see our land **rights** in our own land stop 
Last night the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  in an emotional speech- I appreciate his particular point of view- drew the attention of honourable members to the great traumas associated with a certain instance.

* I submit that abortion must never ever be granted the mantle of legality, of respectability and of acceptance because, in the final analysis, I hold very dearly the consensus and the point of view that man can only protect his own **rights** by conceding the same **rights** to everyone else, particularly to those unable to defend themselves.

* We do not have any tendency at all to abrogate the contract of the company at Grotte Eylandt but what we emphasise is that in this situation, like all other situations, we ought to accept that there is a new land **rights** deal.

* I certainly hope that, despite our differences, with the passage of time the initiatives which were instituted as a result of the election pledge of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  when he was leading the Labor Party into the 1 972 election, to give land **rights** to Aboriginals, will come to fruition.

* We will not see it while there is this interminable argument about an injured person's legal **rights** in the States and whether the Commonwealth is intruding.

* Does it matter what a person's legal **rights** are?

* I stand here this morning and say that the cities of Sydney and Melbourne have problems which need to be redressed by the Government but that other cities, communities and States also have **rights** and needs. ]

* Fourthly, following the passage of the Historic Shipwrecks Bill it is necessary that reference be made to its provisions concerning compensation when **rights** to a shipwreck are altered.

* Basically, the philosophy of the current and previous Governments in relation to organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is that they are voluntary organisations and the Government should not interfere in their affairs unless it can be demonstrated that there are or are likely, to be dishonest practices which would prejudice the **rights** of members or groups of members.

* It is also undisputed, however, that material success alone does not guarantee community satisfaction and the deficiencies of the previous Government of the Republic of Korea in representing what we would generally regard as basic democratic **rights** have been the cause of a great deal of dissatisfaction in the Republic of Korea.

* In recording our sadness at the manner of the late President's death we also feel a need to observe that perhaps the new government might find it timely to initiate a program aimed at establishing broadly and comprehensively the democratic **rights** of the people ofKorea including the basic **rights** of the members of its National Assembly under a new constitution to reinforce the impressive material gains which have been made in its economy.

* As consumers they have certain **rights** and certain sovereignty given to them under Medibank and they are exercising them and displaying beyond any doubt where they want to go.

* Most of the organisations that sought a statutory corporation also sought restoration of the **rights** of employers of compulsory redundancy, but that is totally opposed by the Waterside Workers Federation and is not proposed by the National Industrial Council which instead put forward a proposal for early retirement.

* On the question of land **rights** for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, the Labor Government introduced its legislation but because of what happened in December 1975 the legislation did not come before the Parliament for a decision.

* The Country Party opposes this legislation and will continue to oppose it and the steps which will follow it because we believe it is our duty to fight to protect the limited **rights** of country people and to fight to give them at least something approaching the equality of representation to which they are entitled.

* It follows that perhaps something should be done quickly to ensure that there are some statutory **rights** for members of Parliament.

* I undertake to the honourable member that we will look at this matter as one of urgency to ensure that members of Parliament are no longer deprived the **rights** which are applicable to other members of the community.

* This legislation is creating the opportunity for those persons to enter the Australian Public Service with all their **rights** preserved.

* Where a company receiving assistance fails to proceed with commercial exploitation of the results of a project, or decides to terminate the research and development program, consideration will be able to be given to the Government acquiring the **rights** to any results of the research and development that has been undertaken.

* The Budget also upheld States' **rights** so that the States could get record rake-offs from the Commonwealth this year in real terms.

* Assistance to Governments and United Nations organs, especially the regional economic commissions, to prepare systematic programs and series of projects to increase the involvement of youth in national development and in the promotion of human **rights**, with particular reference to the implementation of the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade.

* Exchanges among bodies having special social and scientific knowledge of concerns related to youth, and the establishment of research projects on youth and eduction curricula on human **rights**, particularly in the UN University.

* The Commission on Human Rights 
There have been many meetings of a ministerial kind to discuss and make decisions about the problems of Aborigines as a whole and I think we have now got to the position where with one exception, and that is associated with land **rights**, all outstanding problems have been decided and I believe they have been decided to the satisfaction of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs.

* Yesterday I received a report from the Commonwealth Solicitor-General dealing with this problem of land **rights**.

* So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origins, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the **rights** and duties of citizenship, and intention to live here permanently.

* Let us stand up for the **rights** of those pensioners and put it here in the legislation.

* As part of that policy the Government is now arming itself with a far more extensive array of powers to suppress the incomes and the **rights** of the wage and salary earners and their trade unions than any Government has ever contemplated in the history of this country.

* The proposal to establish an industrial relations bureau and the legislation now before the House in relation to the Trade Practices Act, which in fact would cover about 95 per cent of trade union activity, are the most extensive powers that any government has ever sought to control unions and employees in this country or restrict their **rights** to organise.

* This Bill is to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and it refers to the Northern Territory, so we will scrub - 

 Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Drummond)Ruling on the point of order, I believe that this debate is a free-ranging one that could encompass most arguments regarding Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Unfortunately, some weeks elapsed before it was definitely established that we in Australia could not exclusively undertake to guarantee sole publicity **rights** to that Japanese company.

* The major issues- trade, investment, industry development, human **rights**, migration and refugee matters and defence co-operation- are the responsibility of as many Ministers.

* The same can be said of public concern in Australia about human **rights** in some Association of South East Asian Nations countries and about their use of military power.

* As this will conflict with the wishes of the local Aboriginal community and is contrary to the provisions of the Commonwealth land **rights** legislation, will the Minister indicate whether the concern he expressed for Kimberley Aborigines prior to the recent Kimberley by-election extends to taking action to prevent the State Government disregarding the wishes, in particular, of the Oombulgurri people?

* The Government has deprived the pensioners of **rights** they had under the Whitlam Labor administration.

* Among other things, this has the effect of restoring to any seamen involved, all **rights** accruing under the Act, including the **rights** to have their cases referred to a compensation tribunal or to make application to a prescribed court for judicial review of their claims.

* If Qantas does not fly from Australia to the west coast of the United States, then to the east coast of the United States and from there to London, other international operators likewise have no **rights** in Australia to fly from America to the east coast of Australia and from there on to Hong Kong or to Thailand.

* Air Ceylon has come into the field and is now demanding reciprocal **rights** with Qantas.

* Of course, when the Opposition proposes that federal responsibility should be assumed for matters such as this the Government is ever ready to grasp the old argument and say that while it would be most anxious to take action this is really a State or local government responsibility, and as such must be left alone for fear of an infringement on States' **rights**.

* But by way of the ill-informed land **rights** Act the development has been frustrated.

* They are confused if they believe that their **rights** have been preserved any more than have the **rights** of the people of Victoria, South Australia, Queensland or anywhere else.

* It is true that constitutionally the Queensland and Western Australian governments have the primary **rights** and responsibility for developing their own States, the Commonwealth being directly responsible only for the Northern Territory.

* They deal with persons whose contributions to the superannuation scheme have been deferred on their becoming eligible members of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme, the preservation of **rights** provisions as they relate to persons transferring from one scheme to the other and, in accordance with past practice, the ex-officio appointment of the Commissioner for Superannuation, in lieu of the  President  of the Superannuation Board, as 
But it is pertinent to observe, in the light of that remark, that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, by which the Government seeks to assert and establish its sovereignty over the off-shore areas of this nation, is presently the subject of litigation before the High Court of Australia.

* Of course, the situation is that, if the High Court holds that this Parliament did not have the power to pass that legislation, then this Parliament has no authority in terms of sovereign **rights**, to quote the Minister's phrase, over the off-shore area in relation to mining activities.

* Litigation is still going on in both of those countries in respect of the **rights** of the central government as against the provincial or State governments over off-shore areas that have not yet been explored.

* So whatever might be the design or desire of the present Government to exercise what it sees to be the sovereign **rights** of this Parliament over off-shore areas, there are very good practical reasons why it should approach the exercise of those sovereign **rights**, if it is shown by the High Court to have them, in a co-operative way rather than in a destructive way.

* It seems to me that too much of the discussion by the Premiers and others proceeds on an unsupported assumption that in some undefined way the interests of the nation will be better served by a return to greater States' **rights** and reduced Federal powers.

* The first alternative is to attempt to correct the imbalance by reinforcing and renewing States' **rights**.

* There are many **rights** for all citizens of Australia.

* Has his attention also been drawn to indexed item 19- Commonwealth Solicitor-General's report on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The Uganda regime, whose suppression of the exercise of basic human **rights** and civil liberties is well documented, cannot avoid responsibility for that.

* They result inevitably from situations in which people are denied the exercise of basic human **rights** and freedom of expression.

* In Uganda, as in other places where violations occur, the Government urges the speediest possible restoration of these basic **rights**.

* There is a series of incidents taking place in this country which must be worrying persons who are concerned about the **rights** and civil liberties of citizens.

* However, the performance in this House today does not display any great civil liberties in respect of the **rights** of members of Parliament in a democratic institution where there should be freedom of expression.

* Secondly, the Committee foundered upon special drawing **rights**- known as SDRs- which were concerned with transferring real resources from the wealthy to the poor.

* Some honourable members might be interested to know why we are speaking on this Bill which prima facie appears to deal with the entitlements and **rights** of South Australian Railways employees who have now transferred to the ANRC.

* To honourable members who query why I am speaking at all on this Bill let me simply say that the very **rights** of South Australian railwaymen which are protected under this legislation have already been taken care of in respect of Tasmanian railwaymen.

* The SBS will be empowered to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by the charging of provisions and facilities and by the sale of programs and **rights** or interests in programs.

* A reading of these will show that whilst the coastal State has sovereign **rights** over the living resources of the zone it has, in turn, certain obligations with respect to management of the resources in that zone.

* Right through these documents we see the consequence of that devaluation decision where any payment has to be made abroad in foreign currency or something like special drawing **rights** to the International Monetary Fund.

* A new assessment will of course carry with it the **rights** as to notification and appeal provided in the Bill.

* A further amendment moved by the Government in the Senateinsertion of clause 40- will require the Organization to furnish assessments intended or likely to be used by a State for prescribed administrative action only through a Commonwealth department or authority, thus ensuring that the person concerned has the benefit of the **rights** as to notification and appeal provided in the Bill.

* The statutory procedures for notification of security assessments and for **rights** of appeal in large part implement the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Hope.

* They therefore represent one of the most important steps taken in this Parliament for many years directed to the protection of the **rights** of individuals.

* The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual **rights** and freedoms.

* It will equip ASIO with the powers essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the **rights** of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions.

* There are a wide range of tools available to achieve the sort of society which we aim at achieving - an equalitarian society based upon the assumption that people have equal **rights** and that these equal **rights** ought to be available to all people from birth.

* Some 250,000 Arabs stayed and live today in Israel as first class citizens with equal **rights** with the Jewish community.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Landing **rights** in any country are subject to the sovereignty of the country concerned.

* It will be recalled that during his speech he referred, among other things, to the 'inalienable **rights** of all people to freedom and independence'.

* When I think of the previous calls in this Parliament and elsewhere by Labor regarding the **rights** of nations and people to selfdetermination I realise how utterly hypocritical those calls become when viewed against the bowing by the Government to the pressure of Soviet colonialism in the case of the Baltic States and its pre-judging the free expression of the Timorese.

* Bible, a family photograph and camera which she hid behind a log and recovered later; (i) the Manager and or Sergeant refused  Mrs Ray,  who had travelled all night from Townsville for the funeral, a lift into Woorbinda 'to hear the singing for her brother' but offered to hold up the funeral until another vehicle picked her up; (j ) the funeral service in fact finished before she arrived; (k) a crowd gathered outside the office to demonstrate their anger, causing the Sergeant to send for police reinforcements; (1) the Manager requested a number of Woorabinda people,  Mr Ray  and a Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs liaison officer, who has since left the settlement, to sign a statement exonerating him; (m)  Mr Dooley  signed such a statement which he did not fully understand; (n) others signed and some refused to sign these statements; (o) the Woorabinda community is so oppressed by the Queensland laws and settlement regulations, which have been condemned by the Commissioner for Community Relations as contrary to international human **rights**, that they fear for their homes, jobs and safety to the extent that they are unwilling to testify to the oppression while the Sergeant remains in authority there, and (p) several complaints have been made to police, to the Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service and to  Mr N.  Blair, National Aboriginal Congress representative, about Sergeant O'Shea exploiting financially, intimidating, illtreating and procuring wrongful convictions of Woorabinda residents.

* I do not know the **rights** and wrongs of the State Government in Tasmania doing the things that the honourable member has suggested it was going to do.

* They can do what they like', it means immediately that the **rights** of the private citizen are annihilated.

* But, once the dragnet has been cast so wide that it encompasses unlawful and lawful activities and the Government says 'They are to be regarded as part of the process of surveillance', that is the first step towards some kind of police state where the **rights** of the citizen are qualified and where the **rights** of the security organisation are unlimited; where the Parliament keeps putting restraints on itself and keeps giving carte blanche to somebody else.

* What sort of a democratic parliamentary institution are we if we really are abdicating our **rights** and saying to somebody else: 'You take them.

* The Minister for Social Security has disregarded statements that have been made all round the world by leaders, both civil and religious, about the **rights** of the unborn child.

* Some of the statements that have been  ma:e  about the **rights** of the unborn child appear in the Declaration of the Rights of a Child, United Nations General Assembly, 20th November 1959, which reads: 
Our Government has undertaken to reshape Australian life to make this Australia of ours a better place for all of us to live in.

* It would be a tragic day for Australia if we submitted to the hysterical and uninformed pressure of a minority clamouring for abortion on demand as part of human **rights**.

* If human **rights** are involved in this, let me invoke the supreme right of all - the right to life.

* As an Opposition we will not be recreant to the trust that has been placed in us; we will wear proudly the mantle of protection of people 's **rights**.

* The purpose for which it was established and for which it has had a continuing charter for many years was to bring an organised approach to the marketing, supply and handling of the Australian wheat crop whilst protecting the **rights** of the Australian consuming public.

* I believe that we have a duty, if we are sincere in our efforts to protect the **rights** of the individual, to to something such as setting up a committee.

* Under the amendment to section 27 of the Act the Corporation would be given potential preferential borrowing **rights**.

* The Australian Country Party opposed a similar financial provision in the Australian National Airlines Bill and was assured by the Minister for Civil Aviation  (Mr Charles Jones)  in the Committee stage that it was intended that in practice Trans-Australia Airlines would not be given preferential borrowing **rights**.

* Instead, Australia should commit itself seriously and consistently to the cause of peace and order, the resolution of conflict and the defence of human **rights**.

* It is extraordinary that the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  can describe himself as a small '1' Liberal, yet make an important speech here reviewing major trouble spots in the world, and especially those in our region, but never once mention the issues of civil liberties and human **rights**.

* Again, the Labor Party's scheme in no way interferes with the **rights** of the private practitioner or of the patient.

* That legislation confers important **rights** on injured workmen.

* They completely disregarded the **rights** of the Queensland people at that time.

* The Bill before the House is another one in the long line of Bills which seek to erode further the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* I firmly uphold the view that this legislation is not concerned with accuracy and justice and State **rights** but is a thrust of pragmatic political professionalism in action.

* He wishes to deny them their **rights**.

* That is the position in the United States of America, a country where there is a truly com-operative system of federalism, a country which retains and respects the **rights** of the States.

* When Queensland was separated from New South Wales in 1859 her **rights** were not clearly defined regarding the islands ofl the coast.

* It has for a long time been undisputed in international law that, subject only to the right of 'innocent passage' for foreign ships, a coastal country has full sovereign **rights** in respect of the territorial sea and the seabed and subsoil beneath it in the same manner and to the same extent as it has full sovereign **rights** in respect of its land territory.

* On behalf of the State of Queensland, I make an appeal to honourable members opposite to display the spirit of nationalism about which the honourable member for Macquarie spoke - a spirit of nationalism where the **rights** of a State, however small, shall be respected; where the **rights** of the person, as the honourable member for Stirling said, are of paramount importance; and where the historical gulfs and bays of the great State of Queensland and other States will be preserved and maintained as the responsibility of the State and will not be handed over to that monstrosity of centralism that is sought to be generated by a government which is intent on destroying private enterprise, a system of living which has stood the test of time in Australia and a  system  of living to which I am devoted to maintaining.

* However, I point out- I think I owe it to my friend the honourable member for Wills, and I am sure the  Chairman  will forgive me if I disclose one of the confidences of the Committee- that I was the person who raised the right and the need for the honourable member for Wills to be given full **rights** of reply both here and to the Committee.

* My basic objection to it is not just at the political level and does not concern just the privileges or **rights** of public servants.

* I do not for one moment deny the **rights** of the rural community in the predicament in which the Government has placed it, but I point out that the rural community by and large has seen fit to support the Government.

* The responsibility rests with those opposed to free abortions- that includes me- to have the States enact new statutes dealing with abortions or to test the Menhennitt and Levine rulings in the Supreme Courts of the various States to establish in good law the **rights** of the foetus.

* why should not Social Workers make frequent contact with other officers of the Department processing an application to ensure that there is not undue delay, that the application is not bogged down in some sort of bureaucratic inefficiency, and most importantly, to cater for the **rights** and entitlements of a client member of the public whose very livelihood and sustenance may, be depending on an early outcome of his application; 
This debate is about much more than the estimates presented for the Department of the Northern Territory.

* It has become a wideranging debate which takes into account not only the handover of limited **rights** and the imposition of hard State responsibilities on the people of the Northern Territory but also northern development.

* I ask a question of the AttorneyGeneral as the custodian of our **rights**, the protector of our liberty, the father protector.

* I am told that voting **rights** on the International Energy Agency are on the basis of one's intake of petroleum.

* What real strength do we have in the International Energy Agency in regard to sheer voting **rights**?

* The first thing they might have to deal with, of course, is lowlevel threats- such as guerillas, confrontation over seabeds, confrontations over **rights** of passage in the air or on sea, or even conceivably the dispatch of an overseas force to prevent from taking place in our area events which we would regard as contrary to our interests.

* We believe that the Act will remain dangerously incomplete while it ignores takeovers which occur by the acquisition of assets, especially land, real estate and mining **rights**.

* Despite their **rights** as Australians and their undisputed **rights** as electors, the people of the Northern Territory have been denied the opportunity to elect representatives to both Houses of this Parliament.

* That occurred on 1 January 1911 and it denied the people of the Northern Territory all electoral **rights**.

* For a number of years  Mr. H.  Nelson, father of the present Administrator of the Northern Territory, fought incessantly in this House for full voting **rights**, because although he was the representative of the Northern Territory he had no voting **rights** at all.

* But it was not until 1968, after the present Administrator of the Northern Territory,  Mr Jock  Nelson, had made many a stirring speech in this House in relation to representation for the Northern Territory, full voting **rights** for its representative and Senate representation, that the honourable member for the Northern Territory in fact received full voting **rights**.

* We on this side of the Parliament look with great pride to when this vote will be taken, because when the vote is taken we will see a majority of votes- as is needed under the Constitution- in this Joint Sittingto give the people of the Northern Territory the just **rights** for which they have been fighting since 1911.

* A package of six uranium Bills, covering uranium development, Aboriginal land **rights**, nuclear codes, national parks and environmental protection measures, has been passed through the Parliament by this Government.

* If I find myself in the situation where I feel my **rights** are being abused- I know other members of the Opposition feel the same way- it is my intention - 
Medibank too has been a very significant contribution to the well-being of these people.

* Today of course a pensioner enjoys the same **rights** as far as medical treatment is concerned as do other sections of the community.

* I remind the House of the very fundamental declaration of human **rights** which, in article 13, says that everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his country.

* Article 22 states: 
This Government is concerned about the **rights** of individuals.

* We have already acted to protect the **rights** of individuals in relation to industrial organisations.

* Registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act confers very significant **rights** and privileges upon an organisation.

* Where the full bench makes a declaration the Governor-General may within 6 months direct the Registrar to cancel the organisation's registration or make orders suspending the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the organisation or giving directions as to the exercise of any of its **rights**, privileges or capacities or for restricting the use of its funds or property to ensure observance of the order.

* They would be used only where these **rights**, fundamental to any democracy, are threatened.

* If any group acts in a way which puts these **rights** at risk, then they cannot expect the community to continue granting them the privileges to which they would otherwise be entitled.

* My Government will continue to support industrial laws which protect the **rights** of individual unionists and which contribute to a just and orderly system of industrial relations.

* We know from the experience of the last two years what is meant by this business of protecting the **rights** of individual unionists.

* Its attitude, epitomised by the proposal to revoke the mining **rights** of Coal and Allied Industries at the Warkworth coal deposit, is a factor that this Government has to cope with in trying to set its overall economic policy for Australia.

* Leave for production in a court of law of evidence given before the House or a committee.- The **rights** of the House are emphasized by the resolution of session 1 8 1 8 - 
It is against that background that I have moved the present motion.

* They have some **rights** of appeal within the structure of the Taxation Branch.

* The Bill also provides for the preservation of the **rights** of staff of the Australian Legal Aid Office to transfer to State and Territory commissions.

* This Bill, when read in conjunction with the second reading speech of the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott),  clearly protects the **rights** of existing officers.

* It refers to 'the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage', 'the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society', the responsibility for the care and education of dependent children, 'the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare', and 'the means available for assisting parties to a marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage '.

* Under clause 12 of the Bill all their **rights** are preserved in relation to their employment as members of the Commonwealth Public Service.

* Even people who have served in a war as recent as the Vietnam war have been denied adequate rehabilitation **rights**.

* It is wrong to allow people to live for years in our midst and deny them the **rights** of naturalisation and all the things that flow from it.

* I believe it is basic to the thinking of all members of this House that they believe in the preservation of the **rights** of the individual under the Declaration of Human Rights, and above all I think I can emphasise for members on this side of the House that we deplore antisemiitism no matter where it might be practised.

* I will discuss this problem with my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs to ensure whether by diplomatic means or through the United Nations we can take action to try to protect the **rights** of these deserving people.

* For example, it included some subsidies for nursing homes, changes in the payments concerning handicapped children, the wider provision of surgical aids and medical aids and appliances and the extension of full approval **rights** for certain friendly society dispensaries.

* I have been most concerned to ensure that the **rights** of senators and members are not interfered with in any way whilst SEATO personnel are accommodated in this building and that the guarding of the chamber and the rooms to be occupied bv SEATO is done as unobtrusively as possible.

* They have forgone those **rights** by their absolute opposition to every financial measure that we have undertaken.

* By **rights** most of these units should be available on a rental basis now.

* Democracy begins on the farms, in the factories and in the streets, and if people will not, often at risk to themselves, stand up for their **rights** in those places there will be no democracy.

* These include an order restraining the exercise of voting **rights** attached to bank shares, or directing the sale of all or any of the shares, in which the person concerned has an interest.

* The court may not make an order, other than an order restraining the exercise of voting **rights**, if it is satisfied that failure to comply with clause 10 was due to the person's inadvertence, mistake or ignorance and that, in all the circumstances, the failure ought to be excused.

* I have asked the Minister a question which has nothing to do with foreign policy or the **rights** or wrongs of the involvement of Australian servicemen or our Allies in various forms of conflict.

* I make no other plea and I make no argument against the **rights** or wrongs of some other action.

* I should like to remind honourable gentlemen of some of the things that the Government has been able to do in respect of women's **rights**.

* Has the Minister noted reports that the Channel 9 network has obtained exclusive **rights** to the Jubilee cricket test series between Australia and the Marylebone Cricket Club in England this year and to the Wimbledon, French and American tennis titles?

* Has he seen the reported statement by the  Chairman  of Channel 9 that the reason his network obtained these **rights** over the ABC could be given in one word, money, and that the deal cost a total of $2m?

* Was the ABC also seeking these **rights** but was unable to match the bid made by Channel 9 because of cuts in funds?

* It has sold out to the **rights** of the States.

* Additionally, because it has enacted virtually no legislation to cover its own territories, the Government obviously feels that citizens living in these territories have no environmental **rights**.

* It was the Government's intention that all exploration **rights** should be covered in the legislation.

* It has been brought to the Government's attention that the Bill would not have adequately met the Government's legal commitments to protect  existing **rights** in relation to that agreement.

* This legislation and the general subject of Aboriginal land **rights**, as we know, has stirred strong emotions.

* But I think I can say of the debates in this House and in the other place that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia has shown a consistent dedication to the passage of legislation to fulfil commitments made by all political parties to the granting of land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* I particularly mention  Senator Neville  Bonner who, as we know from our work with him as a colleague and also from what he has said publicly in the Senate, has been dedicated ever since he came into the Parliament to the fulfilment of Aboriginal land **rights** in legislation.

* We have taken great care to try to prevent both the dangers suggested by the Minister and the threats to the **rights** of fair trial, without in any way endangering Customs agents.

* He made all sorts of centralist proposals that would really rob the States of their sovereign **rights**, but at the same time he failed to acknowledge that there is currently, and has been for a considerable time, very extensive consultation between the States and the Commonwealth.

* The points that the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  quite within his **rights**, has raised today relate not to the report of the Standing Orders Committee but to an amendment which he moved in this House to the motion that the report of the Committee be adopted.

* He has **rights** within the community.

* We do not want a remote bureaucracy making some sort of vague assessment and giving some sort of vaguely worded decision on the **rights** of a person within the community.

* As K found in all of Kafka's writings, he was shuttled from minor official to minor official, always skirmishing on the periphery but never really quite reaching the heart of where the decisions were made, never quite reaching where he should be entitled to reach as a citizen within a democratic society, to put his case for his **rights** within a society.

* Individuals in our society have **rights**.

* Where they are rejected there ought to be a tribunal to which these people can make a public appeal, so that they can exercise democratic **rights**, otherwise the expression is an empty slogan.

* In lieu of or before ordering the deregistration he may suspend any of the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the union or of all or any of its members under the Act or any award, give directions as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities that have been so suspended, and provide for restricting the use of the funds or property of the union or branch and for the control of those funds or that property for the purpose of ensuring observance of the restrictions.

* It says that the Governor-General may suspend any of the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the union or all or any of its members under the Act or under any award; give directions as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities that have been suspended; and provide for restricting the use of the funds or property of the union or branch and for the control of those funds or that property for the purpose of ensuring observance of the restrictions.

* The Commonwealth has no **rights** at all in imposing production controls.

* It will co-operate as long as it has a reasonable chance to co-operate and providing the conditions under which the funds are advanced are consistent with the ideas of the Queensland Government and do not cut across State **rights**.

* I find emphasis in this very generalised speech on individual **rights**, on equality of opportunity and on equality and opportunity.

* Certainly, in a perverse way, it deals with the **rights** of individuals.

* It deals with their **rights** to act as brigands in commercial piracy, preying on the weak, the small investor who is perhaps bemused by avarice and so easy prey for the smart boys.

* The SBS will be empowered to fund its operations by the broadcasting of sponsored programs, by charging for the provision of services and facilities and by the sale of programs and **rights** or interests in programs.

* One has only to restate very quickly the principles in the Bill to remind honourable members and the public how unreasonable the Opposition is being- unreasonable in terms of the great responsibility which we assume in this House in Opposition or in Government; unreasonable in its attitude towards the **rights** and the expectations of the public, expectations which if they are not at this point developed will become quite apparently developed closer to 1 July when Medibank comes into operation.

* They do not give a damn about public **rights** and public needs.

* Quite often people tend to forget that those in rural communities have certain **rights** and they should not be denied these **rights** because of a huge commitment to new cities throughout the State.

* Why then is the Government attempting to usurp the **rights** of State authorities in these matters?

* Will he guarantee that under no circumstances will development **rights** for the Mulloka project or any part of the project be sold or leased to a foreign power.

* On 16th July 1970 the Australian Dried Fruits Association sent a telegram to the State Ministers for Agriculture and to the Federal Minister for Primary Industry pointing out this danger and asking for steps to be taken to facilitate the termination of planting by legislation, restriction of water **rights** or by any other means.

* But if the Minister is to grant new water **rights** for someone to grow more citrus or dried fruits, there are many dried fruits growers who say that it would be belter if he went into the Simpson Desert.

* Its purpose is to discuss the power of inquiry of committees appointed by Houses of the Parliament and the **rights** and duties of witnesses appearing before those committees.

* This is a serious question because the **rights** of a member to speak in this House are in question.

* I will come back to that word 'schedule' -  but at the same time there must be a full recognition of the **rights** of all members to adequate debating time for general and private members' business.

* Secondly, in respect of my representations about the fallacy of what he said, the law in Western Australia does not give any **rights** of appeal.

* Both the common law right and workers compensation actions have been the subject of legal fictions because the courts have striven to give compensation beyond the original boundaries of the **rights** of action.

* Does the Government not recognise that, firstly, the community does not want any more huge inefficient Government departments, and secondly, that there will be widespread retrenchments in the insurance industry if the workers compensation and common law **rights** of action disappear from the field of the insurance industry?

* It is very easy for members of the Government such as the honourable member for Cook to criticise the courts, but the courts and their **rights** to public hearings with representation of witnesses is surely one of the most cherished parts of our entire social and judicial structure.

* The fact of there being an appeal to a quasi-judicial tribunal is of little comfort when such a major right is taken away in a Bill which would otherwise be introducing some commendable new **rights**.

* It is the view of the Law Council that in making such a basic change to the **rights** of the seriously injured, by the introduction of an untried scheme of uncertain operation, existing common law **rights** should not be extinguished at this stage.

* He may not be aware that, unfortunately, within the States there is some considerable opposition to the proposition for the introduction of legislaton to protect plant breeders' **rights**.

* It is of course, as now interpreted, quite essential that there be complementary legislation if the plant breeders' **rights** are to be effectively implemented.

* Indeed, I am told that if we were able to establish plant breeders' **rights** we might well be able to introduce new varieties from overseas which might further develop the agricultural potential of this country.

* I want to record in  Hansard  the 10 **rights** of children.

* They are: Affection, love and understanding; nutrition and medical care; free education; full opportunities for play and recreation; a name and a nationality; special care if handicapped; to be among the first to receive relief in times of disaster; to learn to be useful members of society and to develop individual abilities; to be raised in a spirit of peace and universal brotherhood; and to enjoy those **rights** regardless of race, colour, sex or national or social origin.

* In cases of necessity, any standing or sessional order or orders of the House may be suspended, on motion, duly moved and seconded, without notice: Provided that such motion is carried by an absolute majority of Members having full voting **rights**.

* If this be so and if this be a precedent, things can be done by leave of the House and members' **rights** can be taken away by a small minority who may be in the House at the time.

* It is our protection and you are the guardian of our **rights**.

* we would have the backing of the vast majority of Australians who, again, are disturbed by the practice which has developed of invading public places and private property in order either to interfere with the **rights** of citizens or to threaten and intimidate other citizens.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the **rights** and freedoms of others.

* lt might be salutary for honourable members to see how diligent Liberal governments have been in recognising and asserting the **rights** of missions in this regard.

* The Minister was quite within his **rights** to give the answer that he did.

* We are prepared to work out with the ASEAN countries the extent of capacity required to cope with the expected traffic demands and to provide some additional landing **rights** to ASEAN airlines.

* The policy respects the **rights** of each of our bilateral partners to an equal share of the traffic between our two countries.

* We believe these to be reasonable and practical criteria which will enable the national interest to be served with the minimum practicable interference in the business community and the **rights** of shareholders.

* The honourable member would be aware, I think, of the medical examinations that are necessary, the appraisal by officers of the Repatriation Commission and the **rights** of appeal that people have to the Boards and other Tribunals.

* As Burke said, the moment you abate anything from the full **rights** of men each to govern himself and suffer any artificial positive limitation upon those **rights**, from that moment the whole organisation of government becomes a consideration of convenience.

* Deductions available for capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field, on the provision of community facilities adjacent to a mine or field, or on the purchase of mining **rights** or information, that currently are allowable over the estimated life of the mine or field will, for new expenditures, be allowable on reducing balances, by reference to a maximum life of 5 years instead of 25 years.

* The extension will permit deductions for exploration expenditure incurred up to 30 June 1978 in pursuance of exploration **rights** held at the time of Papua New Guinea 's independence.

* It also needs to be pointed out that nobody seriously claims that high rise flat living pays proper regard to the **rights** of the individual in terms of dignity and privacy.

* I am trying to protect the **rights** of the honourable member for Adelaide, whose time has been taken up by this procedure.

* The primary reason for the substantial period of lime taken to finalise the Land Kent and Rates (Deferment) Ordinance was the solution of a number of complex legal and technical problems involving the protection of the **rights** of anyone associated with the subject land.

* companies with the right to explore for and to  exploit petroleum on their own account, governments have vested these **rights** in their own national oil companies which have then entered into arrangements with the oil companies whereby the latter act as contractors, or operators, for the national oil company.

* Let me make it quite clear that it is intended that the regulations issued under the legislation will require that when employees are joined to an appeal they be advised and be given the same **rights** to make submissions as the appellant.

* Therefore, they will be in an equal status before the tribunal so that they can protect their own **rights** before the tribunal.

* I know this is a point that is sought to be whipped up outside this chamber, but I make quite clear the way in which the regulations will protect the **rights** of individuals who have not had a declaration made with respect to them.

* But an individual, declared surplus as a result of the outcome of the appeal by another employee, retains the further separate **rights** of appeal against any redeployment action taken or a decision that redeployment is not practicable.

* I am sure honourable members will readily appreciate that, by the procedures I have described and through the **rights** which each individual affected by a declaration has, he will be fully protected in respect of his own personal position within the Public Service.

* But, at the same time, we have to get a balance in order to protect the **rights** of individuals.

* At the same time, equality of political **rights** is inherent in a truly democratic State and these **rights** must be indisputably safeguarded by the legislature.

* I think the greatest argument that could be advanced by those in Western Australia who believe in State **rights** is the fact that Western Australia has to take loads and loads of highly protected goods- bounty paid goods- from this side of the continent and at the same time has to compete with its minerals and rural products on world markets in relation to which Western Australia gets no protection at all.

* There are some people in the State Parliament in Western Australia who are always standing up for State **rights** and who never hesitate to lecture their Federal representatives whenever they get the chance to do so about the importance of State **rights**, but I have never heard one of them stand up in recent years and speak about the importance of the matters to which I have been alluding.

* I call upon all union members to exercise their **rights** under the secret ballot legislation which we have implemented.

* The Government believes that it should be debated today because it is designed amongst other things to protect in every way Australia's assets and to protect the **rights** of the people.

* It is a Bill which we believe is fundamental to the safeguarding of the **rights** of the Australian people.

* I would suggest that some honourable members opposite, who are running away from their responsibilities as members of the House of Representatives, should consider that aspect, especially members opposite who are publicly stating that they will in no way interfere with the profit-taking **rights** of multi-national corporations even where Australia's interests are concerned.

* It is about the **rights** of another place with respect to this House in what are called financial matters.

* House is prepared to defend the **rights**, the powers and the purposes of this House as against the other place.

* Yet that person's **rights** to benefits are considerably less.

* Under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme as amended, a widow who subsequently remarries does not automatically lose the **rights** to a pension to which she was entitled in respect of her former husband.

* -It is interesting to note honourable members of the Opposition crying tears of blood about a proposal to give Trans-Australia Airlines **rights** to compete in the aircraft and travel industry in Australia.

* Hence, they continued throughout the whole of their period of office to refuse to grant **rights** to allow TAA to operate intrastate routes in States other than New South Wales.

* On the other hand, when Ansett Transport Industries Ltd sought a competitive position on routes which were exclusive to TAA it quickly was granted those **rights**.

* This motion restricts the **rights** and opportunities of honourable members on this side of the House.

* If they are not satisfied even the advertisers suffer and they may claim that they have certain **rights** because they are trying to sell goods.

* It must be of great concern to the Australian people that Opposition members, with a few notable exceptions, have sought to reserve their greatest invective not for any of the participants in armed conflict, not for those countries where human **rights** are not respected, but for Australian governments of the present and the past.

* No standing up for Australia's own **rights** was involved.

* Jim Fraser had a real understanding of the difficulties of administration but at the same time fought with zeal to uphold the **rights** of individuals and was tireless in his endeavours.

* I have mentioned examples of the denial of citizen **rights** in the States.

* For instance, there is a total denial of all citizen **rights** in the Upper House of New South Wales, for which nobody has to vote.

* to assert and protect the **rights** of Australian citizens in Yugoslavia; 
Let me remind you,  Mr Acting Speaker-  what I am bound to say unfortunately goes to the credibility of the Chair- it was not as if you had even listened to the question I put to the Minister.

* I am bound to say- I say it with regret- that that does not involve the protection of the **rights** of the members of this institution.

* Sir, we all know that the Government has got the numbers, but we on this side of the House are entitled to look to the Chair to protect the **rights** of this Parliament because those **rights** concern the **rights** of the Australian people.

* He has no other **rights** whatsoever in the chamber.

* I only want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Chair does not have the right to gag members or to interfere with the **rights** of members, whether directly or indirectly.

* But I raise this matter because it has a serious consequence in that it takes away the **rights** that members have in relation to proceedings under a Bill.

* It has been par excellence the defender of the serviceman's **rights**, the protector of his aspirations and the promoter of.

* What about the **rights** of people or a country at least to put forward their arguments in support of their case?

* This Bill provides the power to take away all **rights** to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings.

* There is power to take away all **rights** to continue with work regardless of previous expenditure or undertakings and this discretion is left to the Minister and not to the Parliament.

* People's **rights** and privileges ought to be protected.

* I suggest to the Minister the amendment we have put forward in this regard which reads in part: 
-I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: In view of the imminent declaration of Australia 's 200-mile economic zone, is the Minister aware of United States law which declares tuna a free swimming fish and bans any country declaring a 200-mile zone from interfering with the **rights** of United States fishing vessels to catch tuna in those areas?

* Is the Minister also aware that the same law prescribes that any interruption to the **rights** of a United States vessel under these circumstances will result in all possible sanctions being placed on the country concerned?

* Does anyone think for one moment that there is a country in the world, however backward or sophisticated, which would sell out any patent **rights**, any special skill, any special advantage that the country might have in any field at all?

* All I am saying is that the State of South Australia ought to have some **rights** in regard to this matter and ought to bc accorded something from this Government.

* If, as I think most honourable members believe to be the case, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has examined and continues to examine in some detail all of the submissions made to it by the relevant States under those and other headings it would be hard to sustain the argument that the Commission and through it the Government are neglectful of the **rights** and rightful needs of a State such as Tasmania and, of course, not only Tasmania.

* The Government has the responsibility of safeguarding the **rights** of the people.

* The fact of the matter is that the delay is now so long in some of the Family Courts that a situation is emerging where people will be divorced- that is, the marriage will have been dissolved- and all the **rights** that go with marriage including the right of the widow to bring an action under the Testators Family Maintenance Act can very easily be lost if the procedure in relation to ancillary matters has not been concluded.

* The wife would thereby not be able to get an order for the handing over of assets or for maintenance, both of which would secure her position, and she would lose because of the dissolution of marriage, the **rights** that she would have had under the Testators Family Maintenance Act.

* But the fact of the matter is that there have been delays and the widows who might have had those **rights** could have lost them.

* If the Labor Government tries to dominate the Queensland Government and tries to take away from a constitutionally elected State government its constitutional **rights** then, of course, the Federal Government cannot expect to get co-operation.

* It is dealing with a State government that under 3 prestigous Premiers - 
The **rights** of occupancy of the Air Force base, Butterworth, were transferred by the United Kingdom authorities to the Malaysian Government on and from lst April 1970.

* When I did so 161/2 months ago I said that all those who had served with him in the Parliament knew what an avid student he was of parliamentary procedures and what a redoubtable proponent he was of parliamentary **rights**.

* However, this intended modification to the existing exhaustive preferential voting system is also aimed at allowing electors the maximum degree of choice in exercising their democratic voting **rights**.

* It is hoped that the new deposit requirements will keep this proliferation of candidates within reasonable proportions, without going so far as to deprive serious intending candidates of their legitimate democratic **rights** to present themselves for election to public office.

* If the rate of profitable return is higher than necessary to encourage risk investment then the developer should pay a rental charge for the additional benefit he derives from his monopoly **rights**.

* That is part of private members ' **rights** in this place.

* If the Government seeks to provide additional accommodation for members in that way, I submit that their **rights** are in no way denied but enhanced.

* In all those circumstances the Government does not see that private members' **rights** have in any way been denied.

* Leaving that aside, in no way do I see it as denying private members their **rights** that we now seek to move on to Government business.

* The effect of clauses 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill is to continue the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect a person's **rights** or entitlements under Commonwealth legislation.

* I am happy to give him the assurance that under this Bill the standard rate of pension will be paid even though both partners to the marriage are in the same nursing home, and if otherwise entitled they will both have the **rights** to supplementary assistance.

* If they are considered to be unmarried they lose the benefit of the halving provisions of the Act and this in its turn may also affect their **rights** to supplementary assistance.

* If the honourable member thinks that the Bill of Rights is such an effective means of preserving individual **rights** I suggest that he read this book.

* Freedom of speech and freedom to do everything else must take cognisance of the **rights** of the innocent people of Australia.

* I was in America as a young man about 50 years ago and I formed the opinion there that unless one had money one did not have any **rights** whatsoever.

* As is usual, the Opposition is completely ignoring all the **rights** and the roles of the States.

* The honourable member for Wilmot  (Mr Bun)  made the point that the collegiate system in some way protects the **rights** of members in small States.

* I believe that there are many people in electorates around Australia, including people who normally do not support the political Party that I represent, who are very shocked and very dismayed at the attitude of this Government to land **rights**.

* The document goes on to suggest that the whole question of Aboriginal land **rights** has to be put over and against the tendency of the Australian community to put economic interest- mining interests- over and against the interests of a particular people.

* There are strong reasons for avoiding dislocation of the economy and for not infringing the **rights** of people who have settled their property **rights** over the past few years.

* If the Australian parliamentary system is to be a modern working one, if it is to maintain the respect and the confidence of the ordinary people of Australia, the sooner the House of Representatives asserts its proper **rights** about financial powers and about the dismissal of Ministers, the better.

* The average Australian when he drives past the Aboriginal embassy in Frome Place, Adelaide, sees a crowd of people who evidently make - I stress the word 'evidently' because I do not know - no attempt to get a job, who do not come from South Australia anyway and who display a board on which is written: 'We demand land **rights**.

* I think he cited Rhodesia as granting nine-tenths land **rights** to the native people of those areas.

* Whilst acknowledging the historical significance and **rights** of the Aboriginal people, this Parliament and this nation must look for the means of helping them most.

* I finish on this note: I cannot agree to the Opposition's list of amendments, most of which I regard as referring to matters which are completely within the sovereign **rights** and responsibilities of the States to put into effect.

* As citizens they have their **rights**.

* In those cities  His  Honour met with Government officials, judges, institutions and groups concerned with human **rights**.

* He has met with legislators, judges, lawyers, police officers, civil **rights** and race relations workers, and legal aid bodies and has had discussions with officers of the State Department, the Department of Justice, Depanment of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Contracts Compliance Program, the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Depanment of Labor, the Library of Congress, and a number of other agencies, and has had discussions with officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, and several other courts, civil and criminal.

* by inserting after sub-section (3) the following sub-sections: "(3a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the **rights** and freedoms of any person.

* There is a guarantee of a double onus in this new section, that where there is a suggestion that one had evidence which is illegal and cannot be used, there is still a chance for the prosecution to say that the gravity of the situation is such that it is in the public interest to use it and that it would not unduly prejudice the **rights** and freedoms of any person.

* I see it as an intrusion into the **rights** of the individual who has a right of free choice to protect his life's savings and his welfare in his declining years.

* These include such matters as staff, travel **rights**, allowances and, in the case of Whips and Ministers, for example, postage.

* The important Supreme Court case of Pollard's lessee v. Hagan in 1845 established that States entering the Union subsequent to the original federation were admitted on an equal footing and therefore acquired the same sovereign and proprietary **rights** in tidal lands and submerged lands under internal waters.

* The litigation in the Supreme Court since 1947 has not controverted the fundamental underlying principle, namely, State **rights** to submerged lands under internal waters.

* There have been frequent United States decisions establishing national property **rights** in the territorial sea, but until the United 
States v. California case in 1947 it was not clear how these **rights** were divided in the federation.

* In substance the Supreme Court was able to say that property **rights** in the territorial sea had coalesced with political **rights**, that political **rights** must vest in the national Government, and therefore property **rights** must too.

* It probably sparked the litigation in the Supreme Court to adjudicate between State and Federal **rights**.

* This was the first of 3 United States Supreme Court cases - the others were the United States v. Texas and the United States v. Louisiana both in 1950 - involving **rights** in the submerged lands underlying the ocean and outside the internal waters of California, Texas and Louisiana.

* The California case, a test case to determine the extent of respective **rights**, was instituted by the United States against the State of California in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

* However, it is suggested that our rather legalistic High Court will have to search for an historical vesting of **rights** in the territorial sea in one of our federal polities, rather than hand down a decision overtly motivated by political consideration.

* In these circumstances, Texas quite naturally argued that, as an independent nation, it had acquired paramount **rights** in the territorial sea equivalent to those awarded to the United States by the Supreme Court in the California case by virtue of its national external sovereignty.

* It invoked the 'equal footing* clause against Texas by holding that irrespective of its pre-admission status upon admission to the Union its **rights** in adjacent maritime areas were no greater than those of any other coastal State.

* The Supreme Court held in 1947, by a vote of 6 to 2, that the United States and not California had paramount **rights** in the territorial sea and, incident to this, full dominion over the resources of the appurtenant seabed.

* While this judgment settled the basic division of legal **rights** over submerged lands, it made no precise demarcation of the Federal-State boundary.

* Fourthly, the only necessary parallels for Australia in litigation are the first California case which determined **rights** in the territorial sea and the Special Master's Report which decided upon the extent of internal waters.

* The **rights** of passengers on air taxi flights, charter flights and joy rides conducted by the holders of charter licences only, however, depend on common law and the terms of the contract between the passenger and the carrier.

* We will work intensively with State and local authorities, but we will not allow State **rights** to work against the overall national interest.

* This Bill provides the greatest step foward so far taken in protecting these **rights** .

* I could not help but feel that it seemed strange that the Minister should concentrate only one paragraph in that whole speech on the **rights** of the consumer in a speech of some 1 9 paragraphs devoted to institutionalising the protection of those **rights**.

* He assures us that the Authority will provide the greatest step forward so far taken in protecting the **rights** to which we as consumers and members of the Australian public are entitled.

* If the purpose of this Bill is genuinely to expand and enforce consumer **rights**, then one cannot help but feel that the allocation of $ 1 m could have been better spent by being channelled through the Trade Practices Commission.

* The legislation deals with their **rights** and entitlements.

* Considerable hardship would be created in some cases if the **rights** of employees entering the service of the Commission now were not to be continued in the way they had in the past and in the manner on which they had planned their activities.

* The responsibility for selling the **rights** of the replay telecast of any football match rests with the organisation concerned.

* As I understand the position, the **rights** have been sold to a commercial station for SI  5,000.

* The Australian Broadcasting Commission is negotiating with the commercial station for the purchase of the **rights** for Queensland regional stations.

* Yet he talks about the **rights** and privileges of private members.

* Yet he has the temerity to come into the chamber and talk about the **rights** and privileges of private members.

* I turn to the seconder of the motion, the honourable member for Riverina, who spoke more on the **rights** and privileges of private members.

* 1 ) Which international airlines applied for new or additional landing **rights** in Australia during 1 976. 
and (5) The Office of Aboriginal Affairs has been able to advise on police training courses in relation to Aborigines and officers have given talks at police colleges to develop a greater understanding of the special problems of Aboriginal people in relation to the law.

* The Office has provided information to Aboriginal organisations about the available booklets of advice on citizens' **rights** and police powers and I understand that the Victorian Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs is planning the distribution of a special booklet of this kind for Aboriginal people.

* I have read reports in today's Press that the Queensland Government has given coal exploration **rights** to an overseas company, lt is within the authority of the Queensland Government to do so.

* That is a fair indication of **rights** and truth and of what is fit, neat and proper in Australian politics.

* That this conference affirm the individual **rights** of school leavers under 18 and therefore opposes any move to remove their eligibility for unemployment benefit even if they are living at home.

* Those moral imperatives are being forgotten at present The fundamental one is a respect for the **rights** of people, a regard for their **rights** of access to experiences which will give them independence and allow them to preserve dignity and self-respect.

* Will the Minister, in the interests of the health and safety of Australians and other peoples in the Pacific  area, show some real act of opposition to the French test firstly by denying port facilities to all French vessels and secondly, by refusing landing **rights** to the French ~ Concorde on its proposed visit next month?

* The failure to concede to Papua New Guinea the **rights** proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: 
My summary of a very brief and cursory examination of both the Minister's statement and the maps affixed to it shows that this is a very reasonable and satisfactory accord.

* One of the biggest problems facing the Greek Government and the Turkish Government is not Cyprus but the seabed boundaries in the Agean Sea because of the oil **rights** involved.

* I cannot resume my seat when I have the opportunity to speak for a few moments on the privileges and **rights** of justices of the High Court of Australia without again reminding this House that in 79 years there has never been a Tasmanian, a South Australian or a Western Australian appointed to the High Court of Australia.

* I submit these are real dangers in such a course of action for the protection of individual **rights** in this country.

* If the honourable member examines the debate of 1910 he will see that there was some measure of controversy between William Morris Hughes and Joseph Cook about the **rights** and wrongs of who established the first naval defence concept in Australia.

* But if we have to use these sexist analogies, the difference between the conduct of the Government and the conduct of the Opposition is the world of difference between the lawful exercise of conjugal **rights** and the rapist.

* We will stand up for the **rights** of this House and the **rights** of the Australian people.

* In short, the **rights** and independence of the Senate will in no way be abrogated by this Bill.

* The political systems, social structures, cultures and attitudes towards human **rights** of our Third World neighbours differ in important aspects from ours.

* It also provides thoughtful, informed and some very trenchant views on the policy options available to Australia on crucial matters: How we should adjust to the rapid economic growth now taking place to our north; how we should conduct our relations with the Association of South East Asian Nations; how far our interests coincide with general Western interests in relation to the Third World; what our posture should be in the United Nations and other international forums; what principles should inform our policies on such matters as aid, human **rights**, immigration and refugees.

* At the outset we note that there will be no interference with the **rights** and privileges of the members of this House and of the Senate.

* The Privileges Committee might want to ensure that the **rights** of members coming to and leaving the premises together with their relatives and others can be properly looked after.

* I make this point only because people will be coming here to demonstrate quite reasonably in respect to their **rights**.

* I make the point that we want an assurance that the **rights** of members and those closely associated with them are in no way inhibited.

* We have come from an almost feudal state in South Australia as far as people's attitudes or the attitude of the rulers of that State to the **rights** of people are concerned to the stage today where obviously those who observe the electoral laws of the various States and of the Commonwealth would regard South Australia as being the guiding light on the **rights** of people.

* That provision meant that in the absence of any other provision a public servant had to resign and forfeit his **rights** to superannuation and so on.

* They were enacted to extend similar **rights** to members of the defence forces.

* Each elector should have equal **rights** and be able to meet his member.

* It is necessary to know, when a member does have an interest, what effect that interest should have upon the member's **rights**, privileges and obligations.

* Do we mean the enjoyment, including **rights** of passage, of a public street?

* 1 wish that honourable members opposite would stop and take a look at the ordinary **rights** to which people in the community are heirs.

* If companies want the protection of limited liability and certain other **rights** in the community and want the right to be called public companies, I think that they are under the duty to expect some son of public restraint on their operations.

* It is disastrous that in the one field in which we may become a leader we are to give landing **rights** to international flights by SSTS at our airports such as Perth, thus not only boosting the sale of Concordes to Qantas but also to other airlines for it has been reported that aircraft salesmen say that if one aircraft is sold, 200 will be sold on the basis of keeping up with the competition.

* It is important that the general public is more fully informed on the implications of the granting of night paths and landing **rights**.

* I said that his appointment would be a matter that would test my strength of character; it would show whether I had the courage to stand up against men who would besmirch a man and who would determine that he and people like him have no real **rights** in this country.

* If we restrict a person's **rights** today, ours could be threatened tomorrow.

* Some honourable members might say that this could offend aspects of civil liberties and the **rights** of the individual.

* In cases where it appears that death or injury may have been due to the employer's failure to observe the industrial safety laws, the New Guinean or European concerned is told of his common law **rights** to sue for damages.

* If he does speak for the whole of his Party, that Party dissociates itself from - 
That we, the undersigned, protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising **rights** for the Victorian pink pages telephone directories to an American company, General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp., U.S.A., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.)

* The States have long considered that the Palladium of their **rights** and liberties as States is to be found in section 128 of the Constitution.

* Many of them take the view we are seeking to trench upon their **rights**.

* State **rights** is the battle cry which I know we find on occasions irritating and a little difficult to understand, but the attitude of mind is there.

* Despite the claims of opponents of the Aus.tralian Government about the infringement of State **rights** by this Government, this legislation is a shining example of the co-operation and coordination between the 3 levels of government in our nation that can develop and that do exist.

* The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  made a speech of one and a half minutes on a matter affecting the **rights** of 400,000 Australian government employees, **rights** which have been unquestioned for half a century.

* It includes provisions whereby national lines at each end of the trade have equal **rights** to participate in the trade carried by the conference and third shipping lines have the right to acquire a significant part of that trade such as 20 per cent.

* An oil shortage would not affect the implementation of these provisions as they set out **rights** and not obligations to carry conference trade, and conference members can mutually agree on any arrangements for participation in the trade.

* All through the discussions we have had on this Bill we have endeavoured to give TAA and ATI equal trading **rights**.

* This is a case where equal trading **rights** will not apply, because on my information it will cost TAA about an additional $600,000.

* At independence, Papua New Guinea assumed the **rights** and obligations conferred upon it as a sovereign state.

* Of necessity, it had to assess the limits of its territory and territorial jurisdiction, the **rights** of freedom of movement of its people, their freedom of access for the purposes of trade and commerce, its requirements for defence, both national and international, and its freedom of access to the seas adjacent to its mainland for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources on or beneath the seabed.

* The failure to concede to Papua New Guinea the **rights** proposed by the two Governments could well lead to the following consequences: 
results of negotiations between the Federal and State Governments regarding self-management, full freehold title to land, mineral **rights**, water **rights**, fishing **rights**, timber **rights**, etc.

* The **rights** of those officers had to be protected as they had previously been able to move around quite freely within the Department.

* In these circumstances, there is the very real question of the **rights** of the particular person involved.

* If in fact we have jurisdiction over the whole of the zone for 200 miles, and if the purpose of the Act is to give certain fishing licences or certain **rights**, we would surely still have jurisdiction over the residue.

* That means that the resources to house them, to give them jobs, to provide their children with education and to provide security to the older sections of the family who ought to have proper reunion **rights** must be made available to those people, hopefully in family units.

* 1 ) Has he noted that on 3 1 March 1977  (Hansard,  page 790) the then Treasurer told me that the Queensland Government and the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for National Resources had had discussions on the exploration **rights** over the Oakey Creek coal area in the Bowen Basin which had been granted to Houston Oil and Minerals of Australia Ltd without tender.

* Has he also noted that on 6 and 1 1 April 1978 a letter and statutory declaration were tabled in the Queensland Parliament from  Mr G.  J. Werner, a former coal exploration supervisor for the company, alleging that the Premier brought pressure to bear on the company that, in the event of it getting exploration **rights** in Queensland, it should use a drilling rig owned by the Premier's private company.

* Detailed provisions of the Bill deal with the appointment of staff, the preservation of **rights** of staff taken over from the Authority and machinery for the transitional problems of the new organisation.

* Whenever it is expedient and workloads permit, the Sub-Committee will take evidence in parallel for the following much broader terms of reference: 
Human **rights** in the Soviet Union bearing in mind Australia's support for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement.

* As far as the constitutional powers or **rights** of the Commonwealth to act in such cases is concerned, I say that no doubt exists because nearly all shipping in Australian waters is engaged in trade and commerce with other countries and among the States and therefore can be made subject to Commonwealth laws.

* Turning now to the publication of an alleged statement by the Leader of the House- a statement which the Leader describes as false- I think the House would agree that such wilful publication is damaging to the integrity of the person concerned and constitutes a serious infringement of his **rights**.

* Is it a fact that the new South Australian Government has now withdrawn the Bill, with a view to introducing a new Bill with considerably reduced **rights** for the Aboriginal people, especially in respect of mineral **rights**.

* It is not unreasonable to suggest in this Parliament that there is a strong case for holding an inquiry into whether people in that State have even basic civil **rights**.

* Some people have more **rights** than others.

* They are people who, on the basis of race, are denied the **rights** enjoyed by other people.

* If people in Queensland are denied the opportunity to support the Liberal Party, we will see political opportunists, for base political reasons, denying people their civil **rights**.

* We are not here to preside over the dilution of citizen **rights** in this community, and those people who say that as a matter of some almost divine right they should have more say than others are people who do not and cannot claim to have any sympathy with the democratic concept.

* To protect the **rights** of the smaller States, the less populated regions, the compromise reached was that the other chamber, the Senate, should have 2 senators from each of the States.

* What steps has the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea taken to inform New Guineans that advice on common law **rights** lo sue an employer for damages is available from officers of the Department of Labour.

* What action has the Department taken to inform New Guineans of the difference between common law **rights** to damages and **rights** lo workmen's compensation.

* Finally, may I add that when agreement is eventually reached under the land **rights** legislation in the Northern Territory for the mining or uranium in the Alligator Rivers Region, we will see the full flowering of the land **rights** granted to the Aboriginals in the Northern Territory as a consequence of the deliberate action by the Liberal-National Country Party Government to put Aboriginals in a position that they have never occupied before in the history of Australia.

* As I said, we will see the full flowering of land **rights** legislation when that agreement is finally entered into by the Northern Land Council with respect to mining at Ranger and subsequently with those other companies that wish to exploit the uranium deposits of Aboriginal traditional land.

* Other funds are being sought via direct subscriptions from business and the State Governments, co-sponsorship arrangements with private organisations and bodies, and revenue from the sale of **rights** for the use of the 'Project Australia' logo in approved cases.

* Appeal provisions in the Mining Act and Public Works Act which enable citizens to lodge objections are waived under the Clutha Development Pty Ltd Agreement Act so that citizens are denied traditional civic **rights**.

* We have had problems with Aboriginal land **rights** and there are now environmental considerations that have been taken into account over quite a period.

* The third point it made was that State governments had been giving **rights** to vast mineral deposits, some of which had resource lives of up to 150 years, to the same companies for quite minimal royalties.

* First, surely a man who wants to go out and work without losing his pension **rights** should be allowed to do so.

* Honourable members will know that Amnesty International is a world wide human **rights** movement which is independent of any government, political faction, ideology or religious creed.

* At this time we recognise that every time somebody enforces his right to drive his car through the city the **rights** of all others are diminished a little.

* However, the real issue is one of individual **rights** - whether we will continue to let the demands made on the urban system by the motor car continue to ride rough-shod over the lives of people and the quality of the human settlement of which they are a part.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights**' of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* During the discussions held by the Secretary of my Department and his First Assistant Secretary, undertakings were given to the staff of the Bureau that, in accordance with Government policies, provision would be made  to  safeguard  the **rights** of officers and employees of the Bureau.

* I am confident, however, that the **rights** of all staff are being fully protected and you have my assurance that I will keep you fully informed of all significant developments.

* The question that agitates the mind of every loyal Australian is just to what extent he will reap the benefits of his own national birthright; whether this Government, running true to form, will endeavour to see that the full fruits of it go to private enterprise, or whether a national government is prepared to exercise its undoubted **rights** to construct a natural gas pipeline to be a common carrier and, more than that, whether it is prepared to assert its authority over the continental shelf and in particular the deposits within the Northern Territory.

* I had to take action outside this House not only on my own behalf but on behalf of all honourable members and I hope that honourable members opposite will not regard this motion of dissent as a party issue but as a matter affecting their **rights** in this House because if the situation changes and we are on the Government side and members opposite are in Opposition 1 will defend their right to stand and speak in this chamber without there being any inferences concerning their personal character.

* But there is one reservation to this rule and that is where oppression or the suppression of human **rights** is continuous.

* This will particularly apply to the views we express about suppression of the **rights** of the Jewish people in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

* To indicate our point of view, at the anniversary meeting of the General Assembly on the 24th of next month - it is a special meeting - a declaration will be made relating to the **rights** of individuals, particularly the **rights** of minorities in certain countries.

* This is what we will support as the Australian Government: 
Although some progress has been achieved, there are still serious violations of human **rights** against individuals and groups in several regions of the world.

* We pledge ourselves to a continued and determined struggle against all violations of the **rights** and fundamental freedoms of human beings, by eliminating the basic causes of such violations, by promoting universal respect for the dignity of all peoples without regard to race, colour, sex, language or religion- 
The situation has become so serious in every State except Tasmania - we would remedy the situation in South Australia if we had control of the Upper House - there is gross inequality in electoral justice.

* If the States in which the Liberal and Country parties have control continue to deny to the people of those States their **rights** there is only one possible answer: We must go to a referendum.

* If it had been made in 1775, just a year before the Declaration of Independence and other things that flowed from that, including the **rights** of man and so on, it might well have been in tune.

* I should think that it is the first real attempt by any Australian government to make sure that all its citizens get equal **rights** wherever they are, despite the intervention of any State government, reactionary as some of the State governments may be.

* We are not going to tolerate the intervention between ourselves and the citizens of this country of any State government or any other authority where the fundamental **rights** of those citizens are concerned.

* Governments do not have **rights**; they have duties.

* Other issues are important, including the handling of the railways, transport, urban development and the rest of them, but when it gets down to the fundamental principle of the **rights** of citizens that is where the thing begins and that is what this legislation is about.

* Is there any honourable member who thinks that governments ought to be able to intervene between a person and his property **rights** just by saying: 'We need to deal with you that way'?

* We are facing and dealing with the **rights** of people who before the great panoply of government are helpless, and who before the pressures of the competitive society to which my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay referred are helpless in many respects.

* As I have already said, one would expect that some Government supporters would be prepared to stand up and be counted when their **rights** and the **rights** of the Parliament are being set aside in such a cavalier fashion by the Government and by the Leader of the House.

* On behalf of the Opposition I indicate that we oppose this motion because we believe it is unjust in that it restricts the **rights** and opportunities of honourable members to debate legislation which should be fully considered.

* Yet the honourable member has the hide and audacity to stand in the House and talk about the **rights** and wrongs of raising funds from some corporations.

* Mr Whitlam,  the present Leader of the Opposition, at the time of receiving this white envelope at that notorious breakfast, went on to say: 
Yet the Opposition has introduced a land **rights** question which puts in jeopardy programs which are for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout Australia.

* I am sure that if we put to the Aboriginal people that the question was whether we provided land and total land **rights** in Queensland, acquired all the reserves on just terms, that is, paying out that money for those **rights**, and lost ali their other programs throughout the rest of Australia- housing programs, education programs, health programs- they would say responsibly that they would wish to see the maintenance of those programs which would be to their immediate benefit.

* By involving ourselves in the school and by speaking to the teachers, to those in areas of responsibility in school councils and to the principals we can have not only a greater understanding and involvement but also have a greater say in what our children should be taught and how they should be taught without interfering with the **rights** and the benefits that come from having fully trained teachers coming from the expanded now governmentfinanced tertiary institute of teaching colleges.

* That the Minister for Foreign Affairs be censured and the Prime Minister call for him to resign because of his indifference or negation of human **rights** in Australia as exemplified by his actions in the matter relating to Georgi Ermolenko, the Russian violinist who, being an adult, while in Australia subject to the full protection of Australian law made known to the Rev.

* An asset account for Computicket Australia was opened showing the licence **rights** of the system as having a book value of $1.

* There was a revaluation of the licence **rights**.

* It was in the form of licence **rights** and computer software.

* It has been directed to a group of people who, in the history of this country, have been the most neglected, the most stigmatised, the most isolated, and have been denied their **rights** time and time again.

* In a 4 to 3 decision the Court held the statute unconstitutional on 2 principal grounds: Firstly, that the phrase 'Necessary to preserve life' was so vague as to be violative of the due process requirements for a criminal law, and, secondly, that the law was in violation of a woman's fundamental **rights** to life and to choose whether to bear children.

* The critical issue defined by the California Supreme Court was whether the state had any legitimate interest in the regulation of abortion which would justify so deep an infringement of the fundamental **rights** of women.

* the **rights** of and methods for appeal against the declaration.

* the **rights** of and methods for appeal against the declaration.

* If the Government decides to opt out of certain services now available to the public we believe that the method should be laid out and compelled in this Bill so that everybody, especially the people affected, would know of the decision, the reasons for it, how they would be affected and what their **rights** of appeal would be.

* For reasons of common sense, for reasons of what occurs elsewhere in Australian society, for reasons of what occurs with respect to other organisations in Australian society, and for reasons of no guarantees as to the nature of appointments, it ought to be quite clear to this House that there ought to be no judicial review but that **rights** are to be determined within the valid aims of the security organisation.

* We know that the tribunal is headed by 3 highly competent people who determine the **rights** not only of parliamentarians but also of academics and members of so many other sections of our community.

* The new scheme provides for a contributor the right to take a lump sum payment, together with other **rights**.

* We would have envisaged that members who under our scheme opted to stay in the existing scheme would have perhaps some of those **rights** given to them including, among others that we could consider, the change in respect of the position of widows.

* It is pretty hard going for any individual to say that he can summarise the **rights** and wrongs of the nationalised medical scheme in Britain.

* To dress this up as a blatant infringement of the **rights** of the lower income members of the populace is to draw a red herring across the trail and certainly is not a significant criticism of the Bill.

* -The Government has already demonstrated its commitment to the Northern Land Council under the land **rights** legislation in the Northern Territory and it has demonstrated that in veryfirm and cogent ways.

* This stands as a proud record of this Government in bringing to fruition policies which I had thought had the support of all members of this Parliament, and I have no doubt that the Government's policies in relation to land **rights** will be maintained and continued.

* I ask the Minister to look carefully into how this Bill can dovetail in to the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation.

* But if this provision is left in, I believe a provision is being placed in the statute books which is alien to our law, alien to the **rights** of every Australian, and places at risk the property of people who might very well be innocent but who cannot prove it.

* If not, I hope that members of goodwill on both sides of the House will accept that this provision as it is drawn is too strong, is alien to our customs, is contrary to the **rights** of Australia, and ought to be rejected.

* That is the question of the violation of human **rights** of parliamentarians in other countries.

* A former Argentinian member of Parliament,  Senator Yrigoyen,  was present at the conference as a direct result of the representations that had been made by the IPU on the violation of his human **rights** and his imprisonment.

* There are a number of other cases from a variety of countries and we, as Australian parliamentarians, should take note of the reports of that committee of the IPU and use our Parliament and our own Foreign Affairs Department to take action to assist in the correction of these violations of human **rights**.

* Why should we place our **rights** in the hands of a few people who run programs and whose little favourites run on to various programs?

* Since 1900 no attempt had ever been made to resort to them until 1972 when there was an informal approach by officials from Tasmania and Victoria seeking to know whether there was a possibility of the Government led by  Mr McMahon  joining with Tasmania in petitioning the Queen to refer to the Privy Council for its advisory opinion certain questions relating to **rights** to the seabed.

* This was not a question where governments alone would be concerned because matters concerning **rights** to the seabed so far have come to the High Court for decisiondecisions have been given- not at the instance of the Federal Government or of any State government, but at the instance of private citizens.

* In fact, those who have made those representations have apparently paid scant attention to the contents of the Bill because they allege that the Bill is an attack on public servants' **rights**, that it is provocative and will not make for effective industrial relations in this country.

* Protests against the tour have nothing to do with the **rights** of Australians to enjoy a summer's afternoon watching cricket.

* The inescapable truth is this: If this tour were to take place and if, as the Prime Minister has gratuitously urged the Australian public, the visitors were given a warm welcome, we would be branded throughout the world, not least in South Africa herself, at best as a people who put our passing pleasure before the **rights** of millions of human beings.

* Nevertheless the information obtained by the task force has formed the basis for recommendations to interested Ministers on measures to overcome illegal immigration in the area, keeping in mind however the traditional **rights** and movements of Papua-New Guineans in the Torres Strait.

* He has been a member for 23 years, but he has not had 23 years experience, he has had one year's experience 23 times because he is a remarkably slow learner of the **rights** and duties of the people for whom he deliberates, particularly members of the Opposition.

* I think it is really a scandal that the people of the Northern Territory do not have the right to participate in referenda or Senate elections, particularly when we realise - this is from memory - that prior to 1911 they had these **rights**.

* The people of the Northern Territory are fully entitled to these **rights**.

* He concluded by asserting the **rights** of a man with 'a career which was distinguished and which had greatly helped the freedom of the world and the relief of Europe from conquest from abroad'.

* It is as important for the future of our democracy to safeguard the **rights** of minorities to dissent as it is to safeguard the majority against the excesses of the dissenters.

* If the few anti-democratic violent minorities get away with it, then the **rights** of all legitimate dissenting minorities are endangered.

* Many of those people have carried with them portable pension **rights** from the countries of their origin or from the countries of their longest residence.

* But there are on the island a group of people who have not accrued those **rights** in some other country and it is proper that this Parliament and the Government here in Canberra should be concerned about the welfare and the security of those people.

* While we understand that the High Court has its **rights** as well, we also applaud the fact that Nauruan independence is in no way affected.

* Secondly, companies should not be given **rights** to private land on such a huge scale.

* Fourthly, needless legislation on permits, **rights** to land and so on is eliminated by Commonwealth control and the acquisition of land is already feasible under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955-66.

* A fine line must be drawn between the **rights** of the exploration companies with thenhuge investments based on export hopes, and those of the Australian consumer.

* Ours, unlike the Government's, is not a path up the slippery slope of advancement which takes into account only one side of the problem; ours is a path of equal **rights** for all.

* These people may be unwilling sellers and, as such, their **rights** must be safeguarded.

* If that is the philosophy behind this clause and this Bill, as I said you are fiddling with the **rights** of the Australian people and that is absolutely unjust.

* They want some action on land **rights**.

* I am sure that if honourable members were to give their attention to this proposal they would see that it can do nothing for Aboriginal land **rights**.

* His  second reading speech might be summed up by saying that it claims that the legislation is designed implement land **rights** for Aborigines and to tidy up a few machinery matters.

* This Bill does not represent just an amendment of existing legislation; at the same time it represents an abridgment of land **rights**.

* This trend is not so dangerous in this Bill that all Aborigines will rise up in indignation as they certainly did, for example, concerning the recent shameful legislation introduced by the Queensland Government concerning Aurukun and Mornington Island which firmly denies land ownership and mineral and quarrying **rights** to Aboriginal shires.

* We are very severely limited as to time, but I seek the Minister's assurance, if he can give it- I trust that eventually he will- that he will include the Gimbat and Goodparla pastoral leases, as recommended by the Fox report, in the Ranger uranium areas in the Alligator Rivers region, or that he will in some way include those leases in the land **rights** proposals.

* I have no doubt that he means exactly what he said in this first sentence of his second reading speech: 
This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's decisions on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land **rights**.

* As I have indicated these are aimed at uranium export first, not Aboriginal **rights** first.

* The Government has moved with reasonable and commendable promptness on this, as it did in relation to the original Land Rights Act, to see that land **rights** are given to Aborigines.

* Has the Australian Dairy Corporation requested the Commonwealth Government for the **rights** to produce and market a more spreadable butter.

* If so, does this refer to the patent **rights** jointly held by the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments for a butter/vegetable oil blend; if so, what are the intentions of the Government in this matter; if not, what other power or authority does the Commonwealth possess which is retarding the marketing of more spreadable butter.

* There has been talk that the **rights** of officers within the Bureau will be adversely affected.

* Their **rights** will be fully protected by the Minister and by the Government in carrying out the amalgamation.

* I quote from notes prepared by the Minister as to some of the action he has taken in ensuring that the **rights** and interests of people working in the Bureau will be fully protected.

* The Minister said: 
During the discussions held by the Secretary of my Department and his First Assistant Secretary, undertakings were given to the staff of the Bureau that, in accordance with Government policies, provision would be made to safeguard the **rights** of officers and employees of the Bureau.

* But I would say this: If those **rights** were to be infringed, they would have to be on very strong grounds, so great that it was palpably a case where national security was involved.

* 'Parliamentary privilege', says Erskine May, 'is the sum of the peculiar **rights** enjoyed by each House collectively as a constituent part of the High Court of Parliament, and by Members of each House individually, without which they could not discharge their functions .

* They are made to feel, by what honourable members opposite say, thai they have no **rights** left and that they should not be in a position to take action to remedy these things.

* Merely to put straight the **rights** of an individual on this issue - I do not suggest that a company do this - I say that there is nothing to prevent a person turning up at an inquiry to give his evidence without having given any of it in writing in advance.

* While I am on the subject of **rights** I make it clear that there is no obligation on industry to take part in what the Tariff Board calls pre-inquiry studies.

* The interest of the honourable member for Melbourne in matters relating to deportation and the **rights** of migrants in Australia is not new.

* In fact, last year when the Ombudsman Bill first came on for debate in the Budget sittings the honourable member referred extensively to the power of deportation and to the **rights** of migrants under the proposed legislation.

* In particular, he drew attention to the report of the Bland Committee on Administrative Discretions about the attitude of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the **rights** of migrants in Australia.

* Honourable members will be aware that the Labor Government recognises Aboriginal **rights** in land, and moved early in 1 973 to set up an Aboriginal Land Rights Commission to inquire into and report on appropriate means to recognise and establish Aboriginal land **rights** in the Northern Territory in the first instance.

* Although the former Government did not recognise Aboriginal **rights** in land, it did recognise the need of many Aboriginals living outside reserves for land to use and develop for economic and social purposes.

* Let me tell those men now in case they already do not know that their powers flow only from the provisions of the Local Government Act, which would never countenance their despicable behaviour in their miserable attempts to erode the democratic **rights** of this individual.

* They are the same democratic **rights** as thousands of Australians went away for, fought for and died for.

* We must look at the **rights** of democracy in America.

* This Government has never had enough courage to suggest there should be a referendum on this issue at which these young men would have a chance to exercise their **rights**, particularly if the voting age was reduced to 18.

* We should look at young men as young men and look at their **rights**.

* From the point of view of the Opposition we are particularly concerned about people demonstrating for their democratic **rights** in respect of legislation for which there is no mandate, particularly from the trade union movement when demonstrating against injustice.

* Coming back to the **rights** of people, they agitate en masse and ask questions as a group of perhaps 20 or 50.

* This Government is a weak government, lt is afraid of the **rights** of the people.

* They have no real interests in their **rights**.

* We cannot understand why South Africa is trying to suggest, other than in economic terms that, it ought to have any **rights** to it.

* To have to do it with soldiers and armaments and by safeguarding **rights** at the ballot box with a gun is no precedent for success in the area.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
I support the amendment and, of course, the general proposition that there should be general portability of pensions: but I hope that the greater availability to pension **rights** to anybody who wishes to leave this country will not lead to abuse of what is a right and privilege for those people.

* I also hope that by the Government making it easier for people to leave Australia and to take certain **rights** with them the general pride and dignity in being an Australian and wanting to remain in Australia will not be lessened in any way.

* That is to say, at that time more than 50 per cent of the capital, voting power and the **rights** to dividends and other distributions are in the hands of a public company shareholder.

* There co-exist, however, countervailing devices which ensure that any attempt by the public company shareholder to exercise its ostensible **rights** can easily be defeated by the private company interests so that the public company **rights** are, in fact, worthless.

* If the taxpayer disputes the opinion formed by the Commissioner on the facts of a particular case, the usual **rights** of objection and appeal against the Commissioner's decision will, of course, be open to him.

* Nevertheless we have to protect not only the **rights** of the Opposition but also the **rights** of individual members of this House in grievance debates, General Business debates and so forth.

* We will be keeping a very close eye on things to see that those **rights** are not submerged by the Government in any move to amend the Standing Orders.

* We recognise that in this area there will be shipping, fishing and other sorts of **rights** but we want control so that there is no deterioration of the area.

* What the honourable member for Lyne does not understand is that black power means the use of the right to vote, the use of the legal **rights** of Negroes to gain their just **rights** and their human **rights**.

* Is is non-violent to deny a human being the right to vote, the right to free choice of employment or the **rights** to equal wages, equal justice, education, health and social welfare, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, equal participation in cultural activities, freedom to choose his own spouse, the right to strike, freedom of movement, of religion, of political views, and the hundred other **rights** enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights?

* This will be the third ILO human **rights** convention ratified by Australia in the period since the present Government came to office, the others being Convention No.

* Only one ILO human **rights** convention will remain unratified - No.

* Ill has been accepted as a basic human **rights** instrument is demonstrated by the fact that 79 countries have ratified it.

* If he will come back the honourable gentleman will find this speech of mine very important because it does deal with human **rights**.

* It is a human **rights** problem.

* The prime motivation for the introduction of the deductibility of the sale of mining ore **rights**, of course, has something to do with an election, particularly in the electorate of Kalgoorlie.

* He himself has fought with a union in the past and he used the machinery of the law to assert the **rights** of an individual member, and he won.

* I would think that all members on both sides of the chamber would say that this whole question of national parks and Aboriginal land **rights** will be a continual and increasing issue for this Parliament, the Government and future governments.

* All one has to do is to look at the history of the very vexed area of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It is pleasing to me, as it is obviously pleasing to other Government members that we have also decided to restore through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs the **rights** of tuberculosis pensioners and to bring about many other improvements in benefits for our war veterans.

* I particularly deplore the honourable member for Perth re-opening the debate on a particular issue and talking about double standards because when I attempted to have placed on the agenda the question of human **rights** in Timor I was not backed up by the Government supporters of the delegation.

* The honourable member for Perth did not support me on a human **rights** issue that lies on our doorstep, but he is very concerned about human **rights** in Russia, Israel and other parts of the world.

* This amendment was moved because I felt that the maintenance procedures should be limited to protecting a party's **rights** and should not be brought just for the purpose of protecting a party's point of view.

* Either it can follow the Nimmo Committee recommendation, which proposed excluding from benefit cover services provided by  doctors  charging above the common fee or schedule of fees, or an alternative is to provide the patient with his fund benefit on the basis of his contribution having established certain **rights** for him in this respect.

* **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
That is a mislading statement.

* He was equating the six uranium Acts with changes in the land **rights** legislation to weaken the Land Council.

* He has a responsibility as the Minister administering the land **rights** legislation to see that the terms of that legislation are observed.

* The land **rights** legislation requires consultation with the traditional land owners and other Aboriginal communities before any agreement can be signed.

* It is time he stopped pressuring the Council and allowed Aboriginal communities to go through the procedures which are spelt out in the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation.

* One of the **rights** which every citizen of this country has is the right to make representations to a Minister, if he or she wish through a member of Parliament.

* The dilemma of this clause is that it imposes a responsibility on the Director-General which means that he does have seriously to consider whether he is going to waste the time and funds of his organisation by placing officers of security in buildings in Brisbane to take photographs of people who are exercising their democratic **rights**.

* I do not believe that we should be involving the Director-General of Security in situations where we give him a definition that is so broad, so wide that he finishes up having to involve himself and having to involve his service in what has been described as spook activities which are directed towards the legitimate **rights**, the ligitimate expression of view and the legitimate exercise of the civil liberties of the Australian people.

* suspend all or any of the capacities, **rights** and privileges of an organisation or any of its members.

* It represents a necessary reshaping of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to meet changed industrial circumstances and to reassert the rule of the law in expressing or defining industrial **rights** and obligations.

* I remind the House in talking about conciliation and arbitration that the trade unions have **rights** and duties.

* We won't co-operate until we know what the Federal Government intends, what its terms of reference are, who will conduct the inquiry and what **rights** States will have at an inquiry.

* It is not a time for pointing to constitutional **rights** or wrongs.

* What **rights** will the States have?'

* I just want to say in passing to the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  that with the pressure of questions in the House a member asks one question every 3 weeks - this matter has been debated in the House recently - and questions on notice are an integral part of the **rights** of this Parliament.

* -Employees as well as employers have **rights** and responsibilities.

* The various postal disputes which have brought this matter to a head highlight the selfish **rights** only' approach of these postal workers.

* The actions of spokesmen for the Labor Party today indicate that they also are concerned only for the selfish **rights** of these people.

* It would be interesting to compare the **rights** and responsibilities, as seen by the United States postmen and postal workers, with the attitude of some of the postal workers in Australia at present.

* The action of the Redfern postal workers today confirms this confrontation approach- the demand by them for selfish **rights** over and above the responsibility they have to the community and to the community of interest.

* By effectively seeking to assign pre-conditions of union membership in the letting of Government contracts the Government is effectively denying these **rights**.

* I remind the House that the Government, which has undoubted **rights** and obligations to govern, nevertheless through its election of a  Speaker  and the conduct of affairs here has the obligation to allow Opposition members to speak and to ensure that rulings are fair and that the House is equitably run.

* Australia takes its human **rights** seriously.

* The question of human **rights** is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture; too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations.

* It is about time the back benchers opposite stood up to the Government or the Executive and made sure that it supports human **rights**.

* For that purpose, there is no requirement of reciprocal **rights** in the foreign country in respect of Australian judgments.

* Whether at common law or under the State or Territory legislation, the recognition and enforcement **rights** for foreign judgments are not unlimited.

* Despite acknowledgment by the bulk of people to whom I spoke while visiting South Africa that apartheid is doomed and full political **rights** have to be given to non-whites, the Government itself steadfastly pursues its policy of apartheid.

* It is to be hoped that it will be ended on the initiative of the present South African Government rather than by what might be a violent initiative of those currently denied full **rights** of citizenship.

* Does it not wish to defend the **rights** of women?

* The amendments will not, however, withdraw any **rights** to lodge elections under section 36A in relation to transfers of interests in such property if it is established that the transfers took place before 24 May 1977, the day on which the amendments were foreshadowed in the Senate.

* It is, however, one thing to acknowledge the **rights** and convictions of those described to practise and to recommend, even to urge, others to accept; it is quite another to support amendments which by legislation impose thought systems, theological propositions and religious sanctions which may or may not be relevant in respect to those who seek the resolution of their problems within the protection of the secular law of the State.

* That this House places on record its extreme regret at the action of the Czechosolvakian Government in arresting and imprisoning 6 civil liberties dissidents, including the civil **rights** leader Frantisek Krieqel, the distinguished writer 
Pavel Kohout and the former Czech Foreign Minister Jiri Hajek, following the publication in Prague in January this year of the Human Rights Charter known as Charter 77 signed by over 240 scholars, writers and politicians demanding the restoration of basic civil **rights** in Czechoslovakia as guaranteed by the Helsinki pact of 1975 and further, this House calls upon the Czechoslovakian Government to restore basic civil **rights** to all citizens of Czechoslovakia regardless of their political or religious affiliations.

* We strongly condemn the trials of Soviet human **rights** defenders such as Scharansky, Orlov and Ginsburg.

* We have urged the Soviet Union to implement important principles of human **rights** embodied in the Helsinki Accords, and if that could occur I am quite certain that the thrust for peace throughout the world would be enormously strengthened.

* They give no consideration to the justice of their claims to certain **rights** and certain conditions to which they are entitled by reason of the positions they occupy or to the lead they should give the community.

* One can look at the questions of mineral **rights** and the takeover of assets of a company and other things like splitting shareholdings so that a large shareholding group split into a number of smaller groups has greater voting power than perhaps one group would have; business takeovers by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; the arrangements of boards and the commercial bigamy of boards which can be used to usurp powers of a company from a distance.

* If the proposed takeover is judged not to be against the national interest on this basis, the following additional criteria will also be taken into account: Whether, after the takeover, the business concerned could be expected to follow practices consistent with Australia's interest in matters such as exports, imports, local processing of materials produced, research and development and industrial relations; and whether the takeover would be consistent with the Government's objectives in relation to such matters as defence, the environment and conservation, urban and regional development and the preservation of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* If private members of the Liberal and Country Parties value their **rights**, if they are prepared to stand up for their constituents in what is as important a parliamentary activity as any other, question time, they will vote for this motion because the **rights** of everybody in this place, except those of the Prime Minister alone are in jeopardy.

* Let them stand up now for their **rights**.

* They either have this one man control of the whole House or they stand up for their **rights**.

* The Austraiian Government has called on governments to abide by the important principles of human **rights** embodied in the United Nations instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 1975 Helsinki Accords.

* There is nothing in my motion which would impinge in any way on the **rights** Of any State or of any citizen of any State.

* If my motion passes, the laws that apply in the States tomorrow will be no different from the laws that apply in the States today, no one's **rights** will be affected because no **rights** are under challenge.

* -Is the Prime Minister aware of the violation of human **rights** which is still taking place in the Philippines under the system of martial law?

* Does he agree that violation of human **rights** in extreme rightist controlled countries such as the Philippines is equally as reprehensible as the violation of human **rights** in communist countries?

* Finally, will the Government use its best endeavours in the appropriate forum to prevent the violation of human **rights** in the Philippines?

* The Leader of the House has acted within his **rights**.

* As far as I understand it, all the States' lighters- those that believe in the **rights** of the States to do their own thing- sit opposite.

* In this day and age, with some of the problems facing this country, bearing in mind the Government's majority I sincerely believe that there is an even greater responsibility on the Chair to ensure that the **rights** of the parliamentarian are protected.

* It is all very well to give Aborigines the same **rights** as other people to obtain drink, but, in view of the way in which the drink problem is destroying them, the price of being popular in the general community is a very dear one.

* It is all very well for the Government to say that it will buy popularity by giving Aborigines land **rights**.

* But, if it is done, as it appears to be done in many cases, "without any wise guidance as to how the land **rights** should be used, it is done at the expense of the well being of the Aboriginal people.

* During the discussions on the level of the third replenishment, agreement was also reached on a proposal to adjust the relative voting **rights** of individual Part I countries so as to reflect more accurately the total amounts which each such country had, or will have, contributed to IDA since its inception.

* By way of background, I might explain that voting **rights** are based on subscriptions to IDA.

* By general consensus at the time, it had previously been decided that the additional resources put at IDA's disposal under the first and second replenishment exercises should not affect voting **rights** and for this reason the commitments then entered into took the form of contributions, and not additional subscriptions.

* This will be done by permitting Part I countries to make additional subscriptions, which will carry voting **rights**, to IDA as well as contributions under the third replenishment exercise, the relative proportions between the two varying in each instance so as to produce the overall voting adjustments desired.

* Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of the Association indicated that, of the total amount of $US48m which Australia is expected to make available to IDA over the next 3 years, $US583,440 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting **rights**.

* So far the product of the 1976 Convention has been referenda on four items- simultaneous elections of the Houses of this Parliament, voting **rights** for the Territories, retiring ages forjudges, and the procedure for making appointments to casual vacancies which arise in the Senate.

* It certainly does not guarantee the fundamental **rights** of the citizens of this community, and where it does guarantee **rights** it tends to guarantee them as a conservative instrument would- that is, it fails to protect broadly **rights** in the community, but rather entrenches privileged position.

* However, I have a genuine regard for the **rights** of the Opposition to fight.

* The Review found that migrants are often placed at a disadvantage by their ignorance of their **rights**, entitlements and obligations in Australian society.

* The Government will be taking action in the area of the law to protect migrants' **rights** in criminal investigations and in voting, and to improve information on such aspects as the legal system generally and family law.

* Canada has raised its voice before to deplore the denial of human **rights** in parts of that region.

* When the founding fathers drew up our Constitution they balanced the **rights** of the colonies, which were later to become the States, with the **rights** of the population of Australia as a whole.

* Unfortunately, because of the expressed **rights** of the colonies at the time and because they felt there was a need to have a States House, which after federation rapidly became a Party House, the situation developed- and it exists at the present time- where the Senate in certain circumstances could refuse Supply and thus force the House of Representatives to an election without having to go to an election itself.

* I realise that in the Committee stage of the Bill I am somewhat restricted in what I can address myself to, but in spite of the earlier comments of the Attorney-General  (Mr Hughes)  that the States had agreed with the Bill and on the composition of the various bodies, I wish to register a very strong protest not only at the content of the Bill but also at the way the States have been prepared to step down and hand over their **rights** to the Commonwealth.

* Here the States have surrendered their **rights** to the Commonwealth; yet, almost in the same breath tomorrow, they will be jumping up and down claiming that the **rights** of the States are being whittled away.

* An end to the principle that the US alliance is crucial, and a beginning of support for the "human **rights**' revolution around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* I say to the honourable gentlemen that Woodward's recommendations on the 2 kilometre limit was not based so much on the sanctity of the sea, but rather on the need to protect traditional fishing **rights** and the need to establish a buffer zone of sea in order to preserve the privacy of Aboriginal land.

* In my view this section of the report does not reduce Aboriginal **rights** in respect of Aboriginal land.

* What it does is protect the **rights** of all people in the Northern Territory.

* The Committee was obliged to consider the **rights** of all people.

* It should be remembered that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act was drawn in order to preserve existing **rights** and usages.

* Aboriginal **rights** have been and will be protected through the appropriate land council.

* I believe that all recommendations contained in paragraph 129 of the report quite adequately protect the **rights** of traditional owners in this regard.

* I also comment on the lone protest made by the genial giant of the Parliament, the honourable member for Wills who, I think, has done the cause of land **rights** a disservice by castigating the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in such strong terms.

* By making this protest, he has run the risk of creating greater friction between the Assembly and the Aboriginal people at a time when the Assembly has made genuine attempts to improve its complementary land **rights** legislation in favour of the Aboriginal people.

* In general, during my visits to Aboriginal communities I found that traditional owners, whilst happy to have land **rights**, did not really see the significance of the legislation.

* The Aboriginal expectation has been raised, to the extent that he wants to know what the legislation means to him over and above the formality of receiving land **rights**.

* The legislation gives these ex-servicemen full appeal **rights** under the repatriation structure.

* Secondly, there is the territorial sea, over which it was assumed until recently the States had jurisdictional **rights**, but which under this Bill is subjected to Commonwealth control.

* This Bill vests sovereign **rights** over the continental shelf in the Commonwealth, to the limit which the Geneva Convention permits.

* If the territorial sea is found in law not to be equivalent to maritime territory but somehow just a bundle of **rights** over a sea area, then the section 123 problem might be avoided.

* Naturally, a decision about ownership of the sovereignty of the territorial sea does not resolve the quite separate problem of ownership of **rights** in and over the continental shelf.

* We believe that Australia's commitment to Vietnam prejudiced our **rights** in this area as honest brokers in the international arena and that, having committed ourselves to one side or the other, we could no longer step into the discussions about Vietnam as a neutral and impartial country on the side of humanity and not supporting either side.

* No-one knows the facts better than I. I had to move the suspension of Standing Orders in the last Parliament on a number of occasions because of the attitudes expressed by the Opposition when it was then in Government and its deliberate moves to remove the **rights** of the individual members of this Parliament.

* Was it not the Opposition, when it was in Government, which refused honourable members their **rights**, when it carried a motion in this House suspending the right to move for the suspension of Standing Orders?

* I repeat what I said earlier in the day: The establishment of a security file on a person places a very serious limitation on that person's civil **rights** in this country.

* The ability to establish a security file on a matter which is deemed to be subversive but which is not illegal would seem to be an extension of the inroads into the legal **rights** of citizens which should not be tolerated in a democratic society.

* He certainly has no respect for the law as a protector of the **rights** of a citizen but he looks on it as a vehicle to inhibit the **rights** of a citizen.

* Has his attention been drawn to recent statements of the Queensland Premier that moves for land **rights** in the States, as implemented in the Northern Territory, could lead to a black takeover backed by communist countries?

* Will the Government take steps to implement Aboriginal land **rights** throughout Australia, or will the Government continue to defer to the States which prefer to subject Aboriginal **rights** to mineral exploitation?

* If one goes through those clauses one finds that the existing employees of the Australian Legal Aid Office who will be transferred to State commissions will have their **rights** protected.

* Unless some agreement is reached by the Commonwealth which protects their **rights**, those people who are transferred to State commissions will have a right to apply not for 600 positions but for only 450 positions.

* We now have to face the situation that Aboriginals, because they have been nomadic, have no land **rights** under the system of law which Captain Phillip implanted from England 200 years ago.

* And, as I have stated already, there was the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and the group of 1966 international convenants on human **rights**.

* Since entering this Parliament I have received complaints on many occasions from water users downstream about a claim that too many water **rights** are given upstream and that this slows down the rate of flow of a river and often increases the pollution and salinity level of the water.

* I do not think that anyone could deny that laws and regulations that determine the **rights** for the use of water can be the means of distributing rural prosperity often to the advantage of those property holders upstream and to the disadvantage of those downstream.

* The **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded by: 
The **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded by 
Every law that takes away or impairs **rights** vested agreeably to existing laws is retrospective, and is generally unjust and may be oppressive .

* If there is one thing that is fundamental in our democracy, in our system of British justice, in our understanding of the common law **rights** of the citizen, it is that each citizen not only should have the opportunity to receive the services of the law but also should have the right to obtain the services of the lawyer of his choice, who is independent of everyone- government and individuals.

* Thereby the law, through the lawyer who provides the services, may stand as a bulwark between the government and the citizen or, in litigation or conflict between citizens, may stand up for the **rights** of one citizen against another before the independent courts of the land.

* He mentioned that social welfare benefits in this country were the **rights** of certain people.

* The question that I think that any government has to ask itself is just how far we go with these **rights**.

* I ask the Prime Minister Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing **rights** in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original British technology?

* This Bill is not intended to bring about any of the major reforms that are required to meet the basic human needs and **rights** of the handicapped citizen.

* If honourable members are to be stopped from speaking at  10  o'clock at night, when a lot of honourable members want to speak - and the honourable member for Wills is one who never misses an opportunity, when it presents itself, to get his name on the list of speakers, so he is not denied these **rights**- 
Is the Minister for External Territories aware of the widespread uncertainty and disquiet among expatriate employees in  Papua New Guinea regarding their future employment, promotion and superannuation **rights**?

* It is dishonest - and rank dishonesty - to start talking about this nonsense of the States' **rights** and of the Senate being the States House.

* Therefore, it is pertinent to remember that the accused had no right to legal representation, no right to hear evidence, no right to question witnesses, no right to call witnesses, indeed none of the **rights** of an accused in any British court of justice.

* The **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded by .

* It is not sufficient that the Parliament should simply approve legislation setting up a framework within which land **rights** can be legally handed over to Aboriginal communities.

* It is very clear that if these communities are to take full advantage of the land **rights** vested in them under this legislation, acceptable proposals will have to be made for a system of advisers to work with the Aboriginal communities because where great difficulties have arisen in the past, where there have been failures or the foreshadowing of failures in Aboriginal communities, has been where advice was foisted on the community from outside rather than where the means were provided for the community to obtain advice on its own account.

* I want to make it very clear to the House that if advisers are to work successfully with the Aboriginal communities which take up land **rights** under this legislation it will need to be on the basis of a system of grants handed over without strings to the communities concerned so that they can then go ahead and employ the advisers of their choice.

* At this stage of the development of the Aboriginal communities most likely to take up their **rights** under this legislation, it is unquestionable that the services of advisers are needed even to carry through the most routine and bureaucratic aspects of their relationship with the wider community and particularly in their relationship with governments.

* The Government accepted the recommendation that: 
The documents tabled today give effect to this new and innovative concept which acknowledges that the granting of land **rights** to Aboriginals and the management of that land as a park are in fact compatible land uses.

* It also contains a clause granting particular **rights** of access to officers of the NLC discharging their statutory responsibilities.

* In a newspaper article an American civil **rights** worker was reported to have said:  1 have never seen housing conditions anywhere in the world worse than the Aboriginal humpies - not in  Missisippi  Indian reserves, not in India or South East Asia - nothing has been worse.

* Tonight I mention two issues that relate to the **rights** of Telecom subscribers.

* A second case concerns the **rights** and freedoms of the individual- subscriber.

* I suggest that the Commission look at those by-laws because, if it were to enforce that by-law in relation to the individual citizen who has a telephone directory in his own home, how on earth could it insist on **rights** of entry?

* I believe that it would infringe the **rights** and liberties of an individual citizen to enter his home to inspect the cover of his telephone directory to see whether it is covered or has adhering to it particular promotional material with advertising on it.

* It was an expression of their frustration with the failure of this Government and other governments throughout Australia to acknowledge the legitimate land **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* It is well known that the government in this country has never acknowledged the land **rights** of the Aborigines in the way in which the land **rights** of the Red Indians of Canada and the United States of America and the land **rights** of the indigenous populations of South America and other places were acknowledged by the respective colonial governments.

* It was a symbol of their fight for land **rights**.

* FCAATSI would have been accused by every young militant Aboriginal in Australia of selling out the cause of Aboriginal land **rights** for the lease of land in Canberra.

* Other reasons are the obvious, complete failure by the Government to recognise the just claims for land **rights** and the hollow gestures that have been made.

* The proposed new section 35, therefore, provides for appeals against awards, certain decisions in relation to awards and agreements and it extends appeal **rights** to the whole of section 41(l.)(d) of the Act.

* My attitude to the Bill and my attitude to the law is that we want a security system that is well nigh perfect but, equally, we want to protect the **rights** of individuals- their civil **rights**, their right of freedom and their right to live their own lives provided they live within the law.

* I want some means to exist by which there can be an oversight of ASIO's operations so as to protect the **rights** of those individuals and do it well.

* This is the man who stands in front of the Labor Party and who for years has called for the **rights** of people in the world to selfdetermination.

* Under the terms of this Agreement, British publishers have agreed among themselves that they will not publish in the United Kingdom any book originating outside the British 'traditional' market (for example in the United States) unless they secure the **rights** to publish that book in the whole of the 'traditional' market, which includes Australia.

* It appears that under the operation of this Agreement, **rights** acquired from United States publishers by British publishers need not necessarily be exercised, i.e., the British publisher may not proceed to publication.

* It is a matter of concern that, given the claims, the demands, and the legitimate aspirations of the Aboriginal people for land **rights**, the Parliament should adopt a position in which it gives with one hand and tends to take away with the other.

* Parliamentary committees in this area - in the matter of voting **rights** and in the matter of land **rights** for the people of Yirrkala - have played a constructive role and I am sure that this Committee will play a similarly constructive role in the future.

* Whereas it thinks it can get a little sectional advantage it will find that it will get a major disadvantage which will not be sectional because the rest of Australia will not like to see its **rights** taken away and concentrated in these small sectional interests.

* It talks about granting to the United States Government all necessary **rights** of access to such land.

* There is reference to exclusive use, exclusive occupancy and all necessary **rights** of access.

* disputes arising out of or concerning jurisdiction or **rights** claimed or exercised by Australia- 
in respect of Australian waters, within the meaning of the Australian Pearl Fisheries Acts, being jurisdiction or **rights** claimed or exercised in respect of those waters by or under those Acts, except a dispute in relation to which the parties have first agreed upon a modus vivendi pending the final decision of the Court in the dispute; ' (3.)

* Let us assume that there is an award which is what we might describe as generous and let us exclude from any judgment on the **rights** or wrongs of the matter the people of Tasmania, for example.

* They sounded more like the words we have become used to hearing from the pro-communist left wing which has now most assuredly taken control of the Australian Labor Party in this country- the same sort of people who are in charge of the Victorian branch, which last year at its conference refused, and I repeat 'refused', to stand up and condemn the systematic and brutal violations of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* These people were not even prepared to utter one word of criticism in respect of those continuing violations of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* When unions take industrial action to put pressure on an employer in defence of the **rights** of trade unionists they will have to be conscious not only of the sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act but also of the sections of the Trade Practices Act, particularly proposed section 45D.

* It would have the effect of prohibiting all industrial action, such as strikes, working to regulations and picketing, regardless of how justified that action might be to defend trade unionists' **rights**.

* This most suspicious piece of legislation will certainly plunge the country into industrial confrontation, because if the unions accept it without some kind of battle they will forfeit aU **rights** to act as trade unions.

* The Convention aims to accord to the consulate and its staff that degree of immunity which the international community considers necessary for them to perform their functions free from interference or harassment, while at the same time the **rights** of citizens and the receiving State are protected to the greatest extent possible commensurate with that need.

* It should vest the land **rights** of these reserves in a meaningful way in the Aboriginal people who live there.

* There are vague innuendoes and sinister suggestions that a Soviet fleet will somehow impinge upon our freedom or **rights**.

* This Government has an unhappy record in regard to civil **rights** and such matters when it comes to the areas which it chooses to call 'public interest' or 'national security'.

* As soon as I saw this piece of legislation, I started to think of the current situation in relation to Timor, Indonesia's claims to it, the rather ambivalent attitude that the Australian Government has to those Indonesian claims and the response that one could expect from this Government at any moment as a result of the activities of people in this country such as myself in encouraging and supporting the people of East Timor in their attempt to fight for their own **rights**.

* I find one of the more 'distressing' areas of parliamentary thought the fact that when the Bill goes from here it is likely to get rougher treatment in the Senate in respect of trespassing on human **rights** and things like that, so bless me.

* So, on the Leader of the Opposition's own figures, one-third of all migrants who come to Australia would be deprived of their **rights** of the Labor Party's Bill which requires citizenship were passed.

* The proposals which the present Opposition made in March 1971 and which this Government made last November included provisions for improving voting facilities for patients and inmates of hospitals, convalescent homes and institutions, franchise **rights** for representatives of a government or public authority who are posted overseas, and the prohibition of members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly being elected to the Australian Parliament while still members of that Assembly.

* The change involves no derogation from voters' democratic **rights**; in fact, it will enhance them.

* It is interesting to recall that, in pursuance of this policy of granting equal access when economically justified, Ansett Airlines of Australia received **rights** from Adelaide to Darwin and Brisbane to Darwin in 1961.

* Trans-Australia Airlines also will be given immediate **rights** to operate air services in competition with the Ansett airlines between Darwin-Gove and between Cairns-Weipa-Thursday Island.

* In the meantime, the major airlines will continue to enjoy unrestricted **rights** to operate charter flights to cater for the important tourist trade.

* All the way through this debate we have been told that this Bill is doing something about **rights** but nowhere has anyone on behalf of the Government said anything that would indicate what a right is.

* What steps is the Attorney-General taking to tighten up this legislation in order to preserve the **rights** of citizens using telephones which, under the Constitution, are a Commonwealth monopoly?

* When considering controls and regulations, the important factor is to see that basic **rights** and reasonable freedom of action are not infringed unduly.

* It is true that there is no more emotive issue than the question of land **rights**.

* Accordingly, although contributions to replenishments as opposed to the original subscriptions to the IDA, do not carry voting **rights**, a small proportion of donors' contributions is counted as a subscription.

* Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available under the fifth replenishment, an amount of only $A2 12,416 should take the form of an additional subscription with voting **rights**.

* Under that scheme, a taxpayer obtains a loan of $1,000, promptly pays $700 as a pre-payment of interest, and then buys back, or has an associate buy back, the **rights** in the loan for $370.

* There are 3 different forms to challenge people's **rights** to have their names on the roll.

* In a modern society such as we like to pride ourselves to have, those things should be **rights** that people are entitled to have simply because they are members of the community.

* That is sad, because we all get proprietary **rights**, irrespective of our political tag, and we resent criticism.

* Let us take one of them - land **rights**.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  speaks about land **rights** in the same way as we speak about land for the development of housing, for the development of cattle and sheep stations, sugar production or mining.

* One is gratified that the Labor Party has come wholeheartedly to the view that the concept of land **rights** is fundamental to our social conscience and the well being of the Aboriginal people of Australia.

* We have debated land **rights** in this House so often.

* We on this side of the House are determined that we will do whatever is necessary to satisfy the spiritual longing of the Aboriginal people in regard to land **rights**.

* So, that is what we are talking about when we speak about land **rights**.

* We should deal with people with a proper sense of dignity and if it is not possible at this stage to get across to the Government the actual spiritual situation in regard to land **rights**, then the members of the Government Parties are a lost cause.

* So, despite the rejection by Aborigines, and perhaps in the concept of land **rights** and the materialistic view of things, we must do something about this in the North.

* If that situation eventuated it might be claimed that the concept of the Senate as a House of review and guardian of the States **rights** had been thwarted, to some extent at least.

* Honourable members will know that State **rights** provided by the Constitution have always been carefully preserved by each of the 6 States.

* and (2) Christmas Island is an external territory over which Australia has full sovereign **rights**.

* Australia and New Zealand have equal **rights** to the phosphate deposits on the Island.

* But the trend announced by  President  Carter in his decision that in future United States aid will be predicated by the requirement that recipients maintain acceptable standards of human **rights** could well prove to be an initiative of the greatest significance which Australia will have to watch with considerable interest.

* He was quite wrong in saying that the Labor Government is the only body or the first body to give any land **rights** to Aborigines.

* If he had read yesterday's Hansard he would have seen that I reminded him that in 1971 the Legislative Council in the Northern Territory conferred land **rights** on Aborigines under the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance.

* This evening, I wish to raise the question of some Commonwealth public servants and superannuation **rights**.

* I hope that the Government will take this matter under notice so that our employees can be given the same superannuation **rights** as those given to people employed by the States, and in fact to people employed by private enterprise, who are able to take lump sums instead of weekly payments.

* If a party, person or government seeks, by legal means, to deny a disadvantaged section of the community its voting **rights** this can be achieved by placing complications or difficulties in the way of voting which will prevent a substantial proportion of the population from casting formal votes.

* I would suggest that any system which makes it easier for people to identify and vote for the candidate or the parties which they choose is a system which advances the **rights** of people in a democracy.

* There are undoubtedly - and this must be accepted - some members of the Opposition who do not believe that there should be attacks on all authority or that there should be attacks on the civil **rights** of the majority of the people.

* They are even more important in terms of the **rights** of the individual.

* It is because of the need to maintain the privacy of those sorts of relationships that the rule of law has operated traditionally in our system to protect the **rights** of the individual.

* I do not believe there is any situation in Australian society which justifies this Parliament abrogating people's **rights** because we are concerned about a handfull of drug traffickers.

* But what we are doing is adopting legislation that strikes at the basic **rights** of every Australian citizen.

* He has his **rights** to protection under our legal system.

* But when the very carefully prepared document of the Law Council of Australia is looked at one can immediately see that this body is not concerned to promote the self-interest of the profession but is really concerned with the **rights** of an individual under this scheme.

* It said: 
Accident victims lose existing **rights** to challenge unfavourable evidence on the basis set out in the Report that any ' contest ' is bad for their rehabilitation.

* The safeguarding of the human **rights** of fugitive persons in Australia sought by a foreign country are protected by the Australian Act.

* It is necessary to ensure that extradition is not afforded from Australia in a way which is contrary to **rights** of the person sought by a foreign country.

* We have already introduced legislation to give full voting **rights** to 18-year-olds.

* Whilst we realise that some tolerance is essential, this legislation certainly will help to break down the wide disparity that exists now between the various electorates in our Federal system and bring about a system that gives equal voting **rights** to every elector, irrespective of what he is, what he does or where he lives.

* Therefore the Northern Land Council consent will not be necessary in respect of the Ranger project even if it becomes Aboriginal land under the land **rights** claim.

* This Government's concern for the environment is subordinate to its championing of the uranium miners **rights**.

* I will not enter into the arguments that have raged in this House over the last year or so about the **rights** and wrongs of various depreciation allowances, taxation allowances, the price of superphosphate, subsidies on nitrogen and other matters.

* So far as the implementation and operation of the new scheme is concerned, however - and for this purpose I am excluding reference to the parts which deal with members who become candidates at parliamentary elections and with the preservation of **rights** of eligible members who transfer to certain other employment - these to a very large extent, will be short-lived.

* I have been informed that rather than have an artificial legislative position under which the repealed provisions would be deemed to remain in force, it would be preferable to continue the existing legislation insofar as it relates to pension **rights** and to amend it in such manner as necessary.

* The legislative program, the **rights** of private members, committee and party meetings and the electoral commitments of the various members in their constituencies all have to be considered.

* The legislative program was carried through with honourable members opposite exercising their **rights** to put their points of view on certain issues, sometimes with grim results, but that is part and parcel of the game.

* The firm exported its second division toy technology to China; the toys and the goods are to be made in China, in return for which it retains the marketing **rights** in Great Britain and in a number of other European countries.

* Were such barter deals to exist between Australian exporting firms and China, the first question would be: What **rights** will exist for the exporting firm to market, similarly to what the Dunbee Corporation has done, those goods in this nation?

* We have to find a formula which supplies to the people of Norfolk Island the same security, standard of living and advantages as the rest of the people on this continent and its outlying islands receive and still preserves the **rights** as the islanders have had them and as we hope to see them developed.

* As W. H. C. Eddy pointed out, any such conspiracy:   is able to exploit for its own protection not merely the **rights** essential for maintaining free institutions, but also the ignorance and incredulity of most citizens and a set of techniques for confusing the issues and causing attempts at exposure to rebound and damage not the conspiracy but its critics.

* But in my experience the protests came - apart from those who bluntly resented the success of the message - from people who were prepared to read a 10 or 20-page document on the **rights** and wrongs of 

 - Mr Deputy Speaker, if the facts were anything like those that have just been presented to the House by the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  then of course everyone in the nation should be concerned.

* The first is pollution, the second is the squandering of the reserves of coking coal on the South Coast of New South Wales and the third refers to the sea bed vis-a-vis the Commonwealth's sovereign **rights**.

* The common law is not always tender for the **rights** of the individual, particularly the individual without money or without political influence.

* The purpose of this Bill is to supersede certain provisions of the laws of Queensland that discriminate against Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and deny them basic human **rights**.

* The United Nations Charter is based on the principles of dignity and equality inherent in all human beings and the Charter provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human **rights** and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race.

* The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 25th anniversary of which was celebrated on 10 December 1973, proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and **rights**, that everyone is entitled to all the **rights** and freedoms set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race.

* It further stated that gross denials of human **rights** arising from discrimination on grounds of race outraged the conscience of mankind.

* The 1972 platform of the Labor Party included the proposal that the Australian Parliament should legislate against all forms of discrimination as part of a program to provide equal **rights** and opportunities for all persons.

* The Federal platform of the Liberal Party, as approved by the Federal Council in October 1974, includes proposals for the implementation and enforcement of legislation to promote equality of **rights** between all Australian citizens and to remove any form of discrimination against Aboriginals.

* It does not believe that any group of Australian citizens should be subject to laws that are inconsistent with fundamental **rights**.

* They are intended to remove only elements of this legislation that are inconsistent with what the Australian Government regards as basic civil **rights** to be enjoyed by all Australians, without regard to race or colour.

* So it is ridiculous to suggest that the present system allows everybody to exercise their **rights** as far as preferences are concerned.

* If people want to exercise their **rights** and to extend the situation which occurred in 1974, in the not too distant future we will see in New South Wales three hundred or four hundred candidates.

* If people want to exercise their **rights** to prove a point- I would not suggest that honourable members opposite should laugh- and there are 300 or 400 candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, it will take 6 months for the Electoral Office to count the votes.

* They feel that if they give away any of the **rights** that they have to the Federal Government this would be another step towards centralisation.

* If one thing clearly came out of those negotiations it was that the Premier and the Government of Queensland were prepared to defend the **rights** of the people in those islands to remain a part of my own great State of Queensland.

* At the end of that period of time, should this eventuate - and it is not yet sure it will - the liquidator would repay the consortium which had lent the money to the liquidator and the members of the consortium would therefore have no **rights** or titles to any of the shares in any of the companies which Minsec held.

* He made reference to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence and to the sub-committee which is chaired by  Senator Wheeldon  and which is currently investigating human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* The Government is trying to provide the Public Service with the same **rights** and privileges and restrictions and controls as those applying under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the private enterprise sector.

* I have shown quite clearly that the Government is trying to bring the Public Service into line with the **rights**, privileges, controls, restrictions and the general ordinances of other organisations that come under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* Nothing in this sub-clause shall limit the employer's **rights** under paragraph (iii) of sub-clause (a) hereof.

* As I was saying, clearly in the private sector the trade union movement quite rightly accepts the restrictions, **rights**, controls and privileges provided under those awards.

* Why should the Public Service not be given the same priviliges and **rights**?

* Why should it be a privileged body that is allowed to have different **rights**?

* The honourable member for Hindmarsh made it quite clear that the Labor government was opposed to privileges, **rights** and everything given to public servants.

* The real fact is that public servants get many privileges under this Government, and they are protected in many ways, but they know in their hearts and in their minds that they should not get more **rights** than their fellow Australians; therefore, they should be bound by the same rules of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as the ordinary workers of this country.

* This amending legislation to the Income Tax Laws Amendment (Royalty) Act in fact exempts from retrospectivity, as I understand it, taxpayers whose assessments have been issued before the date of the announcement of the clarifying legislation and who have thereby acquired **rights** of objection and appeal.

* This Bill will give the States the **rights** to prevent these problems.

* The scales use the numbers 1-7, with 1 comparatively offering the highest level of political or civil **rights**, and 7 the lowest.

* It has produced a table in which it has given nations points for political **rights**, civil **rights** and a general status of freedom of outlook.

* He relied upon a quotation from the Woodward report to denigrate the **rights** of traditional owners and to say that in some way the **rights** and claims of people who had moved away from their traditional lands- very often people who may be only of part Aboriginal blood and living in fringe areas- were somehow more important and more significant.

* He deals with the land holding corporations, which should be called land trusts, and says that they should hold land for the benefit of all those having traditional interests in or **rights** over it.

* I want to say in response to the remarks by honourable members opposite that history will record that it was the Liberal and National Country Parties which pursued and brought to finality land **rights** for Aborigines, that it was a government of our persuasion which commissioned the Woodward report, and that it is a government of our persuasion which brought in this legislation that was enacted into law.

* The fact is that these are the parties which brought in the initial report upon which this legislation is based, and these are the parties which will have carried into the law of the land Aboriginal land **rights**, and that ought to be remembered.

* In my Party's policy statement a clear commitment was given to Aboriginal land **rights**, and those who endeavour to say that we lack that commitment need only look at the document.

* It is much the same with land **rights**.

* The spiritual connection between a clan and its land involves both **rights** and duties.

* The **rights** are to the unrestricted use of its natural products; the duties are .

* They make clear the importance of traditional owners in the structure of these Bills, the importance of land **rights** to Aborigines and the importance of giving them a purpose in life and an understanding of living and achieving.

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  has mentioned an amendment which will give those traditional owners **rights** in relation to that land that they may not have enjoyed before.

* Finally, if one looks at clause 67 one will see that it speaks of the traditional **rights** to use or occupy Aboriginal land.

* That sort of examination would only delay further the opportunity for us to be able to give land **rights** to Aborigines.

* How quickly can we anticipate his initiating action in this Parliament to protect the **rights** of the Aboriginal people of Mornington Island, Aurukun and elsewhere in Queensland?

* This provision will not establish democracy; it is a denial of the **rights** of electors.

* This legislation would make it impossible for a country member to service adequately his electorate and it would deny country electors the democratic **rights** to which they are entitled.

* He wants to deny to the electors who live in these areas their democratic **rights**.

* His  first assertion was that he stood for the **rights** of free choice.

* To the contrary its members would be failing in their duty if they did not fight with all their power to protect the limited **rights** of country people and to give them, to the maximum possible degree, something at least approaching equality of representation to which they, as Australian citizens are entitled.

* ls this the extent of my democratic **rights**?

* Many of the pleas directed at the Australian Government are loud and demanding about the needs and **rights** of particular groups within our society.

* Does anyone protest against the **rights** that we have established for these people?

* How often have we heard from retired people that the absence of fringe benefits that are available to people enjoying the **rights** under the pensioner medical service is one of the things that they find most irritating, anomalous and unjust?

* On behalf of the Government I welcome his statement that the Opposition recognises and supports Aboriginal land **rights** in principle.

* It does so very largely because although all States except Queensland have accepted Aboriginal land **rights** in some way, the Northern Territory has the overwhelming number of traditionally oriented people and for them land **rights** are very much a different matter.

* They are quite different from the land **rights** of Aborigines in a community like Cherbourg, near Brisbane, for example- and I do not denigrate in any way the right of the people of Cherbourg to own their own land.

* This is a matter of regret and I am told by the legal people that it is impossible to write a simple Bill to cater for a problem as complex as Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I hope that it will be possible for us to pass them through both Houses of the Parliament as soon as possible because one thing that is certain is that the question of land **rights** is a test of the credibility of this Government and every government.

* The right of effective access to justice has emerged with new social **rights**.

* Indeed, it is of paramount importance among these new **rights**, since clearly the enjoyment of traditional as well as new social **rights**  pre-supposes  mechanisms for their effective protection.

* Effective access to justice can thus be seen as the most basic requirement, the most basic human right, of a system which purports to guarantee legal **rights**.

* They have rejected every amendment that would have provided a judicial test of any action or order that could interfere with the **rights** of people.

* It makes nonsense of legislation to try to make those **rights** unenforceable.

* Having been set up, it should be given the widest possible jurisdiction to allow people to seek to enforce their **rights** under Federal law.

* It is a system which guarantees political freedom and the **rights** of the individual by decentralised power.

* First, our policy is based upon and has always been based upon the **rights** of the countries of the whole of South East Asia to determine their own future and to ensure that they have the right of electing their own governments.

* Another argument that has been put up against these proposals is that they constitute an erosion of States' **rights** and of Senate powers.

* I fail to see how the retirement of federal  judges  at 70 years of age constitutes in any way an erosion either of States' **rights** or of Senate powers.

* It has been argued by one of the senators in the upper house- I think it was  Senator Wood-  that all these proposals constitute an erosion of States' **rights**.

* Tenderers exercised their commercial judgment in the full knowledge of these facts and, in the event, placed vastly different values on the **rights** available.

* Great play has been made on the difference in wording between the paragraph in the original tender schedule relating to transferability of **rights** and in the authorities issued to Budget and Hertz.

* There are some who see the objective as not one of self-management, of the ability of people to make decisions for their own benefit and welfare, but rather of land **rights**.

* Whilst I would be quite prepared to admit- and our policy sets it out as a long-term objective- that land **rights** should be provided to Aboriginal people throughout Australia, it must be looked at in the context of what is achievable here and now.

* The first of those additional benefits is a cash payment on severence in those circumstances set out under the Bill in addition to- and I emphasise 'in addition to'- the public servants' **rights** under the Superannuation Act.

* The vast majority of the ordinary workers in Australia have none of those **rights** whatsoever.

* From these cases, it must be accepted that there is a rule of law which recognises that an unborn child may possess **rights**.

* It also implies that an unborn child is deemed to be a 'person' where the right is for his benefit, so if he survives his binh and obtains the requisite capacity to institute proceedings for an infringement of his **rights**, he may do so and obtain a remedy for the infringement when he was en ventre sa mere.

* In the various cases, as was pointed out, by Cozens.Hardy M. R. the unborn child's **rights** were considered separate and distinct from the mother's **rights**.

* (our emphasis added) 
We consider that the abovementioned judgment is authority for the proposition that the unborn child is recognised by law as a person separate from his/her mother and is the possessor of **rights** under law.

* The recognition of the unborn child as a separate legal person with legal **rights** which are enforceable on birth must mean that the law also recognises that that legal person cannot be deprived deliberately of its life by being aborted.

* Any **rights** of financiers against the vehicle will be extinguished.

* What of the **rights** of the owner of the vehicle?

* I could see a situation where the owner is paying for a vehicle that has been disposed of by the Department and he is precluded from having any **rights** in respect of the vehicle.

* We want to expand the present statutory **rights** to guarantee that everybody is covered.

* The Fund devised special drawing **rights** as a rational approach to the question of maintaining an adequate level of international liquidity.

* If not, what is our attitude to be to further issues of special drawing **rights** in the period ahead?

* There are proposals, for example, which are designed to displace foreign exchange balances from official reserve assets and substitute for them further issues of special drawing **rights**.

* In a way I admire them for this respect they now show for the **rights** and freedom of the people, for inflation and for those who suffer under it.

* The third factor is the provision of extensive quantities of Commonwealth finances annually; the fourth is the provision of an extensive range of Commonwealth and State government blanket incentives to business, industry and people generally to live in these new regional centres; and, fifthly, the provision of adequate safeguards for the property **rights** of those people already living in and having already invested in the specific regional growth centres.

* The point I am about to make concerns honourable members' superannuation **rights** which are directly related to their salaries.

* One should not allow intrusions by such personalities to affect the **rights** of people.

* The Opposition wants to stengthen the standing and the **rights** of the ordinary citizen vis-a-vis ASIO.

* Most of what we know or what leaks out about ASIO suggests that ASIO in Australia really concentrates very much on easy targets -on targets on street marches, especially in Brisbane, Aboriginal land **rights** campaigners, pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and so on.

* To come to the rescue of State **rights** against Federal intrusion in this case would be a betrayal of the Aboriginal people of Queensland.

* Powerful forces support Bjelke-Petersen and the mineral exploring **rights** he gives to his own companies.

* Migrants received assistance via welfare **rights** programs and were able to establish more effective communication through ethnic and community radio.

* This Government, through its spokesman on industrial matters, the Minister for Labour and National Service, is quite prepared to bring down rules and regulations in order to negate the obvious and honourable **rights** of working people, but it is not prepared to take a stand so far as other amalgamations are concerned.

* A framework for the conduct of industrial relations requires both **rights** and responsibilities to be recognised on both sides.

* The Conference committed an ALP government to move immediately to repeal 'all penalties for strikes against arbitral decisions of the Commission or a conciliation committee and the prohibition of action by the Commission to insert or register clauses in awards or agreements excluding the **rights** of workers to resort to industrial action'.

* The Labor Party has also given a commitment to recognise 'the **rights** of unions to regulate their own affairs in a democratic way free from government and judicial interference'.

* Who, indeed, protects the **rights** of individual unionists aggrieved by union action when they want to take action against their own union officials?

* I suggest that that gives them all the **rights** and entitlements that they need by way of preference.

* It has taken steps to protect the **rights** of individual unionists.

* The purpose of the embassy was to bring to the attention of members of Parliament and others, matters of complaint concerning the welfare of the Aboriginal race and in particular their land **rights**.

* Therefore, why did the Minister become so obsessed with the desire, by fair means or foul, to remove these people who were carrying on a peaceful demonstration in which they were trying to bring to the attention of members of Parliament not only their needs but also their **rights**?

* At public expense he had printed a booklet entitled 'Aboriginal land **rights** and the Northern Territory', which is merely a liftout from one of the most shocking speeches that has ever been made in this chamber.

* He went on to condemn anybody in the community - ministers of religion and so on - who dared stand up and state what his attitude was to land **rights** for the people who have just as much right if not more to live in this country as you and I.  Mr Speaker.

* The Minister went on in the booklet to draw the red herring of hypocrisy about the fact that certain Aborigines were claiming land **rights** and a total payment of some $6 billion.

* The Minister knew darned well when he put that statement in the booklet that he was misrepresenting the true and proper facts of the whole matter of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The Everard Park land **rights** case is a classic example of conflict between the Country Party and the Liberal Party.

* If the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  was sincere in his speech on Australia Day this year and if he was sincere in what he had to say to the Aboriginal lass that he clasped his arms around in Adelaide during a visit to that city in the winter months about the **rights** of Aborigines he should have challenged the making of this ordinance.

* Perhaps you feel that I am dealing too much with the subject of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The marauders in front of this House at midnight last night did not draw blood, but they may well have drawn blood because of their failure to appreciate the meaning of the basic principle of land **rights** to the Aborigines.

* The Government has done absolutely nothing, other than use a few words, to put into effect any form of land **rights** for Aborigines.

* In this House Ministers have done nothing, other than to reply to one or two questions from this side of the House, to indicate the land **rights** position in relation to Everard Park.

* It might interest honourable members opposite to learn that in door knocking in my electorate I have found to my surprise that the treatment of Aborigines and the denial of their land **rights** by this Government rank as one of the main issues, at least in the minds of the womenfolk.

* Having quoted to you from page 108 I thought that you would feel that the whole issue was Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Will the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair),  who has charge of the passage of this measure, be prepared to have a proper look at Aboriginal land **rights** and have the subject fully debated?

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* If honourable members read the judgment of the then Chief Justice,  Sir Owen  Dixon, they will find that his opening words were: This has been brought to settle **rights** and to determine henceforth as to where these matters lie.'

* The trouble is that the Premiers are afraid, not of the codes yet, because they have not been formulated, but of the legislation as it stands, for as they understand it they are afraid it will infringe their **rights**.

* I was attacked specifically because it was said that the legislation would infringe State **rights**.

* Therefore, again arguing for the sake of this discussion as a liberal liberal, valiantly standing for the **rights** of the States, I say that surely given the sort of communication that has been received from a number of Premiers, including the Premier of Victoria, the Government would be far better advised to delay the legislation.

* Unlike the governments of Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America, the Australian Government, and the British colonial administration before it have never recognised the **rights** of the indigenous people to the land they occupied at the time of European settlement.

* The policy of assimilation seeks that all persons of Aboriginal descent will choose to attain a similar manner and standard of living to that of other Australians, and live as members of a single Australian community, enjoying the same **rights** and privileges, accepting the same responsibilities and influenced by the same hopes and loyalties of other Australians.

* There are still many people who look apprehensively at the Constitution, believing that the inherent **rights** that our forebears, who in some way they believe were more wise than those of us who succeeded, wrote down so many years ago should inevitably survive without modification.

* I believe it is necessary when filling casual vacancies that we recognise that there will be a prescribed procedure which will enable the State governments to determine the manner by which they will select persons to fill casual vacancies, and which will ensure that the **rights** of the States are preserved, as it shall be certified by the Governor of the State and not by the GovernorGeneral, and that Governor of the State will then be able to submit the name and the person will be appointed in accordance with a constitutional requirement which I believe will validly set out a fit and proper procedure.

* Yet we hear noises from Government supporters, particularly the noisy ones, suggesting that it is a States' **rights** measure  vis-a-vis  some mythical centralist policy that exists elsewhere.

* Let me repeat: This Bill goes against any such States' **rights** philosophy.

* This concept should put to rest for ever the deception of the Fraser Government that it is a States' **rights** government.

* We can no longer ignore the **rights** of our fellow Australians to equitable access to communications facilities and to those services which cannot be adequately provided without such facilities.

* In my view, it is not good enough to argue that agreements such as this are based on the practicalities of the real world, such as the safety of passengers in Damascus, the travel costs of failing to maintain landing **rights** in the Middle East, and so forth.

* In my opinion, the question of principle should override these considerations, and Qantas and this Government should not adhere to such agreements, even if we have to forgo our travel **rights** in these areas.

* There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that this Government does subscribe to freedom of association and to the **rights** of people and citizens to express their views even when they dissent from the Government or dissent from any other mode of authority.

* We do not believe that the individual has a right to interfere with the **rights** of other people when demonstrating those beliefs nor to break the law in so doing nor to lead to actions of violence by refusing to accept that they are breaking the law.

* These are 2 quite distinct things but the honourable member can be quite sure that, insofar as peaceful expressions of opinion which do not interfere with the **rights** of other citizens are concerned, the Government is concerned to support them.

* On the other hand it is very likely that this Parliament has power to legislate so as to provide legal aid to citizens who are exercising their Federal **rights** before Federal courts.

* Let it be clear that this is not a matter, and is not being put forward as a matter, of State **rights**.

* Obviously a Federal Parliament which passes laws which create **rights**, duties and obligations has a real consideration in relation to those citizens who are enforcing those **rights**.

* The Houses of this Parliament are entitled to pass laws which effectively provide legal aid for people enforcing federal **rights**.

* Most of the individual **rights** which people have in this country spring out of State law and not out of Federal law.

* Obviously from the point of view of the public the most effective legal aid office will be one which enables the officers to give legal aid to people, whatever the source of their **rights**, be it Federal or State.

* Once the independence of the legal profession is dealt a blow, that will deal a blow to this country and to our basic **rights**.

* There are some people who are supposedly affluent who are deprived of their legal **rights** because they cannot afford to go into litigation.

* In this so-called modern society, so many are demanding their **rights**.

* They are going to interfere with the **rights** of people who vote for members of the Opposition as well as voting for members of the Government.

* My understanding of the **rights** of Federal members in the LCL is that they may exercise a right to sit on the Country Party benches in the Federal Parliament.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of binh.

* Proposed new section 45D can prevent people from exercising their normal **rights** as trade unionists.

* So the Minister should have made this amendment because all sorts of issues will arise in the industrial field as to what are the **rights** of other people in the same union movement.

* That policy recognises that we are not as dependent on others as formerly and that Australians have **rights** at stake in foreign takeovers in the ownership and control of Australian industry.

* The Court will be able in such circumstances to restrain the exercise of voting **rights**, direct payments to be withheld, direct the sale of shares, and make desirable ancillary orders.

* As regards human **rights**, the Government's views are clearly on the public record both within Australia and internationally.

* Surely something can be done to grant full equality of **rights** to those men.

* Surely we can assist our own citizens to obtain their **rights** from another nation or ally, a country that was not an enemy in the war.

* In regard to Wednesday mornings, I think it is an important factor that 90 Bills are being introduced in this session of Parliament and, in fairness to the public and democratic **rights**, all of these require close attention and study clause by clause.

* The Government has said that its intention in introducing the legislation is, as it puts it, to look after the **rights** of individuals in unions.

* The Government is denying all those other workers their **rights** if it allows this free loader in the plant.

* The other workers have **rights** as well.

* One of their **rights** is to decide with whom they will work.

* The Government wanted to protect the person who would take away the **rights** of the other workers.

* The Treaty will preserve, as a matter of priority, the traditional fishing **rights** of the Tones Strait Islanders.

* A Protected Zone within which those traditional **rights** will be preserved will be established.

* But this is not an objective to be achieved by usurping the **rights** of those overseas organisations which have a majority control today of our resources.

* is vested in Australian entities (including shareholder companies that are themselves Australian entities) and no one person who is not an Australian entity has **rights** to more than 20 per cent of the ownership or control.

* An enterprise owned by a company will be a enterprise with substantial Australian participation if **rights** to at least 20 per cent of the ownership and control of the company are held by one Australian entity.

* Other ancillary tests, dealing with matters such as **rights** over the appointment of directors, redeemable shares and options to acquire shares and artificial arrangements designed to obtain exemption that otherwise would not have been available, are also proposed as safeguards against devices to circumvent the main tests I have described.

* The law will treat this notice as if it were a notice of an income tax assessment, with the consequence that the borrower will have usual **rights** of objection and appeal against the Commissioner's refusal to give a certificate.

* The November 1973 statement of the Liberal and National Country Parties' Aboriginal Affairs Policy indicated that in recognising the land **rights** of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, we would ensure: that mineral prospecting and mineral development should only be allowed under strict Government control and in a manner which protects sacred sites and reflects the views and needs of the traditional Aboriginal owners; that royalties from mining be used for the benefit of the Aboriginal people and that a fair proportion thereof be paid in trust on behalf of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land on which mining is conducted '.

* So far as can be ascertained from the elections, public opinion polls, political meetings, letters from constituents and letters to editors of newspapers, the majority of Australians want the Government to create the overall economic conditions which will enable them to use their education and talents to live their lives with as much choice as the network of **rights** and obligations in the community will allow.

* It is a shame that the Opposition cannot work up the same fervour in defence of people's **rights** where private funds are concerned, where there is much more opportunity for abuse and prying and meddling in the medical records of private people than there will ever be under the program which we are introducing and which will have iron-clad guarantees to preserve the individual privacy of members.

* I do not believe that anybody's **rights** to natural justice or that anybody's **rights** of any kind are infringed by the fact that a photograph is taken of him and if, in fact, at some later stage there should be a question of fact arise I see no reason why that photograph should not be produced to decide what the actual facts were.

* Nor is there dispute between them on any of the other matters which are frequently thrown up against the Chinese Government, namely, questions of offshore islands, fishing **rights**, the ocean sub soil, the seabed, the continental shelf, Tibet and the China-India border - to use the historic  term,  the McMahon line.

* It should enforce all the law of the land and, as far as possible, enable the citizen to have all his **rights**, whatever the source of the law, determined in the one trial court.

* As I shall demonstrate, it will not enable people to have their **rights** determined in one court irrespective of the law, Federal or State, which is the source of those **rights**.

* In the Constitution in chapter III there is provision for it to be exercised by 3 distinct bodies - by the High Court itself; by a Federal court created by this Parliament, and that is what the Government is seeking to do under this Bill; and by section 77 (iii) which provides the means to enable **rights** and duties under Commonwealth law to be enforced in State courts.

* For instance, if one sued in relation to a simple contract debt one could not sue on that :n a Federal court but one could sue on a cheque because the **rights** under the cheque are ascribable to the Bills of Exchange Act under Federal law.

* 1 am more convinced than ever before, after observing the man at close quarters following two intensive meetings involving a deliberation in excess of six hours, that in that office he combines a judicial appreciation of the rule of law under a parliamentary democracy, together with an understanding of the **rights** of the individual Australian and of the necessity to ensure the national security of Australia.

* We put it under the control of a judge who was trained in the **rights** and freedoms of the British people under British law.

* When the present Opposition came into power it put the security organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the freedoms and **rights** of the British people, which applied also to the Australian people.

* -I draw attention to this table because of the questions raised in the Second Asian Agricultural Survey, which is a survey dealing with the impact of rural development projects which it says has ignored the basic questions of land **rights** and employment in rural areas.

* In Australia we have heard the slogan of 'land **rights**'.

* The three principles to which I have referred relate to unemployment, land tenure- the question of tenancy being too high- and the disproportionate gap that is everwidening between those people who have land and those who have no **rights** to it.

* The **rights** of the people of Keilor will be ignored if there is no curfew and the Government will be acting only in the interests of the profits of the airline operators.

* However, no-one has ever listened to the **rights** of the people of Keilor.

* It was only last year that what appeared to be collusion between the private and government stations in Western Australia resulted in the screening of video tape recordings of Perth football matches on the evenings of the match days being discontinued after a dispute over the payment for the television **rights** with the football authorities.

* My Government will continue its  efforts  in this field, and is at present negotiating with the British Authorities to maintain Australian beef exports, and to safeguard Australia's **rights** and interests, in the United Kingdom market.

* At present, the various State Governments claim sovereign **rights** in respect of such resources from low water mark to the outer limits of the shelf.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at Federation, it has sovereign **rights** in this area.

* In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth conceives to be its legal **rights**.

* Legislation will also be brought down this Session to give effect to the scheme for the preservation of superannuation **rights** - the so-called portability of pensions - which was announced in the Parliament on 25th September last.

* I could never understand why Torres Strait Islanders shoud be denied the **rights** of other exservicemen in respect of war service homes.

* The provisions of the Bill extend to every territory, including, I suppose, the penguins in Antarctica where we have extra-territorial **rights**.

* I turn now to some of the other decisions that have been made, particularly those concerning efforts to tax those people who are not in this country- efforts to claim extra-territorial **rights** in taxation.

* We have therefore agreed as a Party that we will not interfere with the **rights** of members to vote as they think fit.

* It was the honourable member for Bennelong  (Mr Howard)  who touched on the question of State **rights** in a kind of State **rights**-centralist context.

* The **rights** of a naturalising company would be withdrawn should it not adhere to the agreed understandings.

* It sees as the only panacea for the alleged problems of the free enterprise system the concept, not of looking to the **rights** of the individual but in fact of looking to the almighty state.

* States the **rights** that they have held for a long period; a government which seeks to cut down, not to build up; a government which seeks to put aside incentive in industry and replace it with that form of disincentive which is derived from the application of socialism in principle and in practice.

* That is from a government that says it believes in the **rights** of the little people.

* The immediate effect of the special drawing **rights** scheme has lo a small if imponderable extent been undermined by the agreement on South African gold sales.

* The initial distribution of the special drawing **rights** which took place on 1st January this year will amount to $US3,500m.

* At the moment the special drawing **rights** may well become the only source of new liquidity and they may also replace the dollar as the standard of value for other currencies.

* They would be within their legal **rights** in applying greater pressure than they arc now doing and in foreclosing.

* Firstly, it amends the International Monetary Agreements Act to accord with recent amendments to the International Monetary Fund's articles of agreement and those amendments involve in turn 3 items: Firstly, a run-down in the role of gold as a reserve asset in the international monetary system and a concomitant, greater reliance on special drawing **rights**; secondly, it recognises the abandonment of the so-called 
A second feature of the Bill is to increase our quota in the Fund.

* Each increase has the effect of increasing our drawing **rights** on the Fund should we have need of it at some time.

* Is it also a fact that public servants in the Territory are now obliged to determine their **rights** and obligations from a circular from (a) the Public Service Board (1970), (b) the Public Service Commissioner (1963) and (c) the Administrator (1970).

* Therefore, I did not think it was in the best interests of either airline at this time for us to agree that landing **rights** ought to be extended.

* I am pleased to support this measure which, as I understand it and as it was presented quite clearly by the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  has for its purpose the clarification of the argument about who controls the mineral **rights** in the territorial seas or submerged lands surrounding Australia extending out as far as the continental shelf.

* I would have thought any political Party would have been concerned to protect the **rights** of employees against unscrupulous employers.

* In a democracy there is a rather fine balance always to be drawn between public order on the one hand and the personal **rights** of citizens on the other.

* But I submit that it is also of fundamental importance that this right of dissent be expressed or exercised in such a way as not to interfere with the legal **rights** of other citizens.

* 1 believe that the vast majority of Australians are peaceful, law abiding people who have regard for the **rights** of others.

* I submit that the use of the term 'civil liberties' also connotes civil **rights** on the part of other persons.

* As I said before, those people, particularly among the younger generation, who use the term sometimes for incitement and who demonstrate for what they call 'civil liberties' are overlooking the fact that due consideration must always be given to civil duties and obligations as well as to civil **rights**.

* in the exercise of his **rights** everyone shall bc subject to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing recognition nf the **rights** of others and of meeting the requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.

* In recent times there have been instances of demonstrations involving unreasonable obstruction and therefore an interference with the **rights** of other people, if this Bill is passed, as I believe it will be, such obstruction infringing the lawful **rights** of others will be treated as a summary offence, punishable by' a fine of $250, 3 months gaol, or both.

* There is always a danger that safeguards imposed to curb excesses can go loo far, and interfere with the reasonable **rights** of citizens.

* But this is no reason why the community should sit by and accept the violent contempt of the law which is increasingly threatening public and private properly and citizens' **rights**.

* -The announced action of the Premier of Queensland in my view is a blatant violation of human **rights** and a violation of the will of the Aboriginal people- indeed that of the people of Australia.

* I ask him to seek a more positive response from this Government which since 1976 has hardly been in the vanguard insofar as the introduction of progressive legislation and the taking of action to safeguard Aboriginal land **rights** are concerned.

* When will this Government uphold the International Labour Organisation and United Nations conventions with regard to the **rights** of indigenous people insofar as land and other matters are concerned?

* When will this Government formulate investment policies which will prevent the violation of Aboriginal **rights**?

* When will the Government exercise its constitutional power and legislate more effectively to protect Aboriginal **rights**?

* The first plank of such a policy in respect of Cape York ought to be the protection of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* He should have been acting as a watch dog for the Aboriginal people when this assault on the **rights** of the Aurukun people took place back at the end of 1975 and the beginning of 1976.

* Two questions are involved- the **rights** of the people at Aurukun and the foreign investment policy of this Government.

* A great game of table tennis is going on at present and has been going on since this Government took office, but the **rights** of mining companies seem to go unfettered at the expense of those of the Aboriginal people.

* Has the Queensland Government infringed United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions regarding the **rights** of indigenous people in respect of their traditional lands, particularly the right to be consulted?

* This Act concerns primarily the **rights** of this great consortium made up of Tipperary Corporation, an American land developer, which has 40 per cent of the shares; Billiton Aluminium Australia, a subsidiary pf Royal Dutch Shell, which has 40 per cent of the shares; and Aluminium Pechiney Holdings Pty Ltd, an offshoot of the French Pechiney group, which has 20 per cent of the shares.

* I am particularly astonished that this Minister, in spite of his record in this House as a libertarian, as a champion of the **rights** of the individual and as an opponent of every form of authoritarianism, now should so roundly say that he is opposed to giving the pensioner the right of appeal against departmental decisions.

* It is particularly sad when the Minister, prior to his promotion to the feather bed of high office, was himself so determined in his onslaught on any vestige of encouragement to this dictatorial rule and on any infringement of the **rights** of the individual in the community.

* 1 would never have thought that I should have to remind this Minister that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and that part of that vigilance must be to establish and maintain - not favours to citizens, subject to politicians and officials - but the **rights** of citizens and the equal **rights** of all citizens - not a division into first class citizens on the one hand and pensioners as second class citizens on the other.

* Senior citizens are entitled to equal **rights** with all other citizens.

* Pensioners are not to be regarded as second class citizens for whom Big Brother always knows best and who must meekly accept the orders and decisions of politicians and officials who, as the Minister suggests - and I think he says it quite wrongly - will use their discretion, not apply the law but use their discretion either for or against the senior citizen, the pensioner, dealing with him by whim or by grace instead of in accord with the pensioner's **rights** under the law.

* The basis of the Minister's argument would mean the destruction of the **rights** of appeal which every taxpayer has against a decision of the Taxation Department.

* The pensioner seeks his **rights** as a human being, as one who has worked and paid taxes, as one who requires justice under the law rather than the exercise of official discretions.

* I hope that when independence is granted TAA will be given **rights** equal to those of ATI.

* Yet another important omission from this legislation is that provision of the 1975 Act which extended Aboriginal land **rights** 2 kilometres into the sea.

* This omission has upset a large number of Aboriginal communities as it offers them no protection of their fishing and religious **rights** off their land.

* The Yirrkala people, in a submission in September, stated it quite clearly when they said: 
Finally, might I add one additional matter which has relevance to the land **rights** legislation and also to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill, that is, the matter of a treaty of commitment between the Australian Government and the Aboriginal people.

* They represent the considered opinions of persons who have been concerned with the Aboriginal cause, and in particular with Aboriginal land **rights**, for a number of years.

* Decentralisation of the Department's offices, increased publicity of **rights** and entitlements and changes in appeal procedures have meant improved services to the public.

* as a result of, or by means of, trusts, agreements, arrangements, understandings and practices, whether or not having legal or equitable force and whether or not based on legal or equitable **rights**; or 
We in the Opposition oppose the legislation.

* I should think that the average Australian would regard it as important to maintain his or her **rights** on the question of political affiliation and on the question of what contributions are made to help a candidate or a party.

* The charge here today is not that the 3 mile limit ought to be 300 miles or that it is a question of minerals or State **rights**.

* The honourable member for Farrer  (Mr Fairbairn)  said in the House last week: 
That offer was that the States should retain control of the mineral resources of the territorial seabed, that is, from low water mark to the 3 mile mark off-shore, while the Commonwealth legislated to take over total **rights** outside the 3 mile limit to the edge of the continental shelf.

* We are not concerned here this afternoon with State **rights**.

* It is not unreal to say that the member for the Northern Territory was given full voting **rights** only when that member came from a party more acceptable to the Government.

* If I remember the figures correctly it was not until the Australian Capital Territory had an enrolment of almost 50,000 that the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting **rights**, but with the change to Country Party membership the Northern Territory was given full voting **rights** when that Territory's population reached 17,000.

* At a time when some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber are making noises about participation by private members in parliamentary affairs, we have before us a motion that removes from private members one of the few **rights** that they have to initiate business in the Parliament.

* I indicate our opposition to this move and suggest that it is an unnecessary restriction that the Government is placing upon the **rights** of members.

* Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the pre-election speech of the Prime Minister in which he said that the Australian Labor Party will establish once and for all Aborigines' **rights** to land and insist that, whatever the law of George III says, a tribe and a race with an identity of centuriesofmillenia is proprietary company.

* People and governments- State and Federal- irrespective of their position, progressively are challenging the **rights** of large corporations in this country to control and manipulate resources on which the people's standard of living depends and to which our economy is both extremely sensitive and vulnerable.

* Already this debate largely has been concerned with the degree to which the legislation balances the need for adequate security on the one hand with the **rights** and the liberties of the Australian citizen on the other hand.

* Whether we like it or not, the history of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, like that of other intelligence agencies in Western society, shows that it has often abused its role and the **rights** of the ordinary Australian citizen.

* I suppose that every member of this Parliament, on looking back at the record of ASIO, is aware of some circumstance in which the **rights** and the liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen have been abridged to some extent by these actions.

* That is a gross and, in my view, unjustifiable erosion of the **rights** of the average Australian citizen going about his business, being involved in the workings of his own political system.

* Any security intelligence gathering organisation in the discharge of its statutory duties, in my view, has a prime duty and a prime obligation to protect the **rights** and the liberties of the Australian citizen.

* This legislation is very critical to the proper operation of our security forces and, indeed, to the hard won **rights** of the ordinary Australian citizen.

* I was concerned to hear him argue so illogically that the same sorts of standards and prescriptions that apply to a company or a trade union- which is a public organisation, a voluntary organisation, like a company, with rules laid down- ought to apply to a security service, in the face of the findings of  Mr Justice  White and  Mr Justice  Hope and in the face of all the body of accumulated evidence that the laws have been broken and the **rights** of the ordinary citizen have been transgressed.

* Therefore I say that this is an opportunity when one does not make the sorts of glib presumptions which in the past have eroded the **rights** of the ordinary Australian citizen.

* Since then the Americans have bought up the **rights** to his engine.

* Earlier I started to mention - I curtailed it because I suspected that I would have to conclude my speech - the sort of development of services which is absolutely essential, in my opinion, if we are going to be responsible and humane in our approach not only to the needs but also the **rights** of every human being in our society.

* The services to be provided with that money are for a special section in the community who have **rights** as well as needs.

* The first is that those **rights** and needs are being maintained at a high level and protected at that level and, secondly, that when we spend the taxpayers money we do so in the most efficient way.

* We must keep some balance between the need to preserve and protect the **rights** of a defendant to a fair trial and the need, no less grave, to maintain the right of the Parliament to scrutinise and attack the conduct of Ministers where their conduct has some bearing on a legal proceeding.

* I hope that members of this Parliament will exercise their democratic **rights** and determine that the new parliament house should be built on Capital Hill.

* Later today I will be introducing into the Parliament a Bill to establish a human **rights** commission.

* The structure of the proposed development corporation ensured that the States of New South Wales and Victoria would have **rights** equal to those of the Australian Government.

* Our neighbours are either one party states, absolute monarchies or military juntas without any of the basic human **rights** that exist in genuine democracies.

* They stand for public office, speak their minds on radio, television and in the Press and generally have **rights** that they themselves, let alone Jews, do not have in Arab countries.

* Before we make concessions to the Arabs, before we withdraw from the defensible borders that were created during the 1967 war, before we start talking about the **rights** of the Palestinians you show us that the Arabs and particularly the PLO are prepared to accept our right to exist and are prepared to enter into normal, peaceful relations with Israel.

* Basically, promotions would be made by the authority and be subject to the various appeal provisions, which would protect the **rights** of individual teachers.

* One can only hope that eventually honourable members opposite will remember that the **rights** of minorities, the right to free discussion and the opportunity to debate matters of national importance are what the Parliament is all about.

* I propose to exercise my **rights** under the Standing Orders.

* I hadintended to exercise my **rights** under standing order 193 and have my dissent recorded in Hansard.

* I will not vote willingly for anything that includes the **rights** of lower courts to send people to gaol, particularly for offences such as this.

* These are the matters before the House tonight - the **rights**, privileges and freedoms of the community.

* That Party stands for freedom of speech, freedom of the individual and the **rights** of democracy.

* For example, if a group of 500 people are taking part in a demonstration and 2 of them are involved in unlawful violence or unlawful damage, is that sufficient reason for a police officer to break up the assembly and deny the **rights** of 49S other men?

* Recommendations involving human **rights** especially the **rights** to privacy and individual freedoms are within my responsibility and the Government is vigorously pursuing a policy of protection of individual **rights** and freedoms so far as it has power to do so.

* Worst of all, its inequity and the way that it neglects so many people in the community indicate that it is inappropriate to a wealthy country which makes some claim to a commitment to respect for human dignity and the **rights** of people.

* With the approval of the British Government, the Rolls Royce Co. in England is preparing to conclude an agreement with the Chinese Government involving the sale of about 800 Spey jet engines and the licence **rights** for the Chinese to manufacture this engine.

* When the supreme challenge came to the **rights** of this Parliament he bore himself with dignity and carried out his tasks with the highest conception of his duty to the institution he serves and the cause of Australian democracy.

* Nor can there be any suggestion that in its operation the scheme will amount to a denial of any **rights** which Aboriginals have as citizens.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  decried this Government's efforts in the land **rights** field.

* I might say that with the land **rights** legislation, with the national employment strategy and with the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development, we have made three major steps in advance of our programs for Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency.

* In summary ] put it to the Minister, and I expect him to accept, that the matter I am about to raise is not advanced with any view to obstructing or harrassing ASIO but only to ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the duties and functions of the organisation on the one hand and individual **rights** on the other.

* I find it very hard to accept this proposal, despite the good humoured way in which the Leader of the House has presented it, as being anything other than an attempt by the Government to erode the **rights** of the individual member.

* Other important issues which arise in that area include the great question of Aboriginal land **rights**, what to do with our uranium, the bluetongue problem and the illegal importation of drugs, plants and animals.

* There is the question of potential mineral **rights**.

* First of all, the power to bug citizens, the power to wire tap citizens, is a power abhorrent to anyone who believes in the ordinary man's basic **rights**, his right to privacy and his liberty to say what he wishes in the privacy of his own home.

* Electronic surveillance is a far more insidious, far deeper affront to these basic **rights** than most other forms of intrusion because the individual is quite unaware of the invasion of his **rights**.

* The citizen is aware of the affront to his **rights** when the police search his home.

* Under our present laws, he has **rights** of challenge, appeal and redress.

* This undermining of the **rights** to privacy in our society results from the pursuit of good causes.

* It is important that our detestation of alleged drug smugglers not blind us to their **rights** to privacy under law.

* There has to be a balance between the **rights** of the individual to privacy and the needs of law enforcement.

* We have all this business about land **rights** and so on.

* At least one cannot be unaware of the powerful economic forces that are now in operation in some of the areas that are supposed to be the land areas of the Aboriginal population and the problems such as whether we will take uranium, whether we will take bauxite, whether we will take some other minerals without consideration for the **rights** of these people.

* I should also remind the honourable gentleman that the entitlement of an insured person to the proceeds of an insurance policy is a matter of private contractual right and is a matter which can be pursued according to those private contractual **rights** by the individual concerned.

* The point I make simply is that a lot of these practices can be effectively responded to and effectively coped with by the individuals in question pursuing their **rights** through the civil courts.

* I suppose that the  Speaker  of this Parliament has **rights** as a member of Parliament.

* I am bound to say that some real progress might have been made in apprehending the culprits in respect of the Hilton Hotel outrage if our security organisations had been doing their job instead of acting as professional snoopers on people who are concerned to express their **rights** as citizens in the community and take political positions and attitudes which do not necessarily agree with those of the government of the day or the people who adopt the standards that apply in ASIO.

* If we are to take what has happened in this field in Western Australia as an indication of What would be acceptable to the Commonwealth, then I believe that this House should not give such a b ank cheque because I believe that what has happened in this field in Western Australia is an infringement on the proper and just **rights** of individual Australian citizens and is completely bad in principle.

* They have their **rights** impringed upon.

* It would have preferred that the Commissioner, as representative of the public interest, should have had power to bring proceedings on behalf of disadvantaged persons, persons with language difficulties and persons who may be diffident about enforcing their **rights** under the legislation.

* The legislation is a significant step forward in the development of policies for the promotion of human **rights** in Australia.

* Aboriginals have the same **rights** to compete for vacant positions as other persons, but it is not possible to tell in advance who will be selected to occupy particular vacant positions.

* The Australian Electoral Office arranges, as a separate measure wherever possible, for Aboriginals to accompany electoral officers and assist them in informing and educating Aboriginal people about their franchise **rights**.

* Further in this long history I wish to draw the attention of the House to the words of an Aboriginal civil **rights** leader,  Mr Archie  Smallwood, who summed up in a nutshell the feelings of the people of the multi-racial suburb of Hill End in Brisbane, a suburb where people have learned to live with people who are different.

* The actions arising from the land **rights** legislation have brought about the situation today- the pressure on land council members.

* True, the Act created important new **rights** for citizens and corporations, but their practical importance is somewhat limited by traditional judicial views on the availability of discretionary remedies and by cost.

* There is no 'compact' conferring perpetual **rights** on those who have or on those who acquire.

* It is an infringement of the **rights** of this House.

* In all of this there has been a serious infringement of the **rights** of the House.

* It treads the very narrow path between safeguarding human **rights** for our protection on the one hand and maintaining civil liberties for our basic freedom on the other hand.

* It is true to say that in any discussion on legislation one has to admit that it infringes on personal liberties and human **rights**.

* That statement to me, when weighing up the problems and difficulties associated with trespassing, as it were, on civil liberties and private **rights**, seems to be a sufficient safeguard to ensure that Australia has the best of both worlds in maintaining the freedom of people and capturing those who are engaged in drug trafficking.

* In this regard, I quote from Section 6 (Assignment of Rights), of the original tender document C3/79/10, contained in Appendix B (Terms and Conditions to be observed by Concessionaires) which states: 
The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or **rights** arising under this authority or sub-let any part or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agents on franchise for the purpose of conducting the business at any of the airports.

* The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or **rights** arising under this authority - 
That is the perspective in which this Bill, which has become known as a law and order Bill, should be viewed.

* Those of us on this side of the House who attend Party meetings and who can have an influence on the form of legislation that comes before this House would not have a bar of a Bill that limited the **rights** of people in the minority putting their point of view to those in authority in a legitimate fashion.

* It has been used in a way which has been directed at picking up people who are on about social reform, people who are concerned about class distinction in this society, about inequalities and the deprivation of **rights**.

* People who are concerned about such things as Aboriginal welfare and those who are concerned about the deprivation of **rights**.

* I take the point made at the end of his question about selective commentaries which are made not only in the media but also by those who take an interest in international relations about the restrictions on human **rights** and a prejudice even to the right to life in certain countries.

* I repeat that we deplore atrocities and breaches of human **rights** wherever they occur but particularly in regard to the charges which are made about Cambodia.

* The Bill gives full regard to the **rights** of adults to determine their own relationships as responsible adults, according to ordinary law, provided their actions did not injure or work to the detriment of innocent people.

* The basic change in this regard is that the question of maintenance would be determined on a careful assessment of respective needs, responsibilities, resources and earning capacities, without there being a necessity for any argument over **rights** and wrongs.

* Why shouldn't men and women have equal **rights** in the question of custody?

* This raises the issue of children's **rights** and whether these **rights** are different from the **rights** of the parents.

* This raises a conflict between the natural right of the parent to bring up a child and the child's **rights**.

* I would like to look at another recorded case in examining this question of the child 's **rights**.

* What are the child's **rights**?

* In the debate that has taken place so far there has been some very intriguing reference to something called a balance between the **rights** of a minority to express its dissent with the **rights** of the majority to go about its normal and every day life.

* The Government has come down very heavily against those people in Australia who care to exercise their **rights** of dissent.

* The Government has always talked in terms of the pressure of minorities and the usurpation of the **rights** of government.

* The same sort of approach toward dissent and the **rights** of a minority characterises the Soviet Union.

* What the Government has done in this Bill has been to say that there are two factors - the democratic **rights** of individuals and public order.

* Unfortunately, the Government knows only too well that it exploits majority thinking on the civic **rights** of individuals.

* But a democratic society cannot subordinate so grossly the **rights** - of individuals and minorities, as the Government does through this Bill.

* Here is a law that has been brought in for the specific purpose of suppressing and limiting your **rights**' anybody with any political sense at all knows what the reaction will be to this sort of Bill.

* This Bill means that the **rights** of the individual are to be determined not by this Act of Parliament or by the Australian Constitution because they are not mentioned there, but by a policeman on the spot at a public incident and by the magistrate.

* This Bill comes down heavily against the lawful **rights** of individuals and minorities to assemble and to express their individual and group views in an attempt to change opinions.

* The Bill represents a further restriction on the individual **rights** and freedoms of persons.

* People believe that we should protect minority **rights** and should protect certain individuals.

* We believe that Australia is a free society but on 5th January  Mr Lewer,  in the Central Court of Petty Sessions, said: 
What these views fail to take into account is that an individual in our form of society has duties as well as **rights**.

* However, I think the House ought to remember that the legal profession does have experience in the provision of legal aid services and must play a very substantial role in any system devised for the provision of legal aid, because however much people may take sideswipes at the legal profession the fact is that an independent legal profession is an important safeguard of individual **rights** in a democracy.

* Proceedings for a decree of restitution of conjugal **rights**, of jactitation of marriage or of judicial separation shall not be instituted or continued after the commencement of this Act.

* It is high time that there were Commonwealth laws to protect the **rights** of electors in some of the corrupt States.

* The brave new era of States' **rights** has been aborted.

* The original legislation was amended on 9 December 1974 to enable organisations which wished to do so to transfer their **rights** to other eligible organisations.

* These **rights** were sought by some organisations and this gave a considerable stimulus to the program and created a demand for grants in respect of hostels that exceeded the number that could be funded in 1975-76 within the Budget allocation of $40m.

* At the same time these organisations were given an assurance by the previous Government that their **rights** under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 would be preserved even though the making of grants in respect of their projects had been deferred.

* The Government has decided that, to enable an annual program of construction to be undertaken and to ensure that the **rights** of organisations which have acquired entitlements under the legislation are preserved, there should be an extension of the time within which the erection of a hostel can be commenced.

* An amendment to the existing legislation will give organisations with existing **rights** 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels.

* Will the proposed new role of the Commission deny it the opportunity to buy through agents so as to preserve confidentiality; if so, will this place it at a disadvantage by comparison with major foreign mining interests and  Mr Iwasaki  who hold extensive freehold land and leasing **rights** in Queensland.

* By then, my time had expired and so, I repeat, I was prevented by abuses of the Standing Orders from exercising my **rights** in this House to partake fully in the debate on the Banking Bill 1 974.

* In short, my **rights** to speak were shockingly curtailed.

* Under general international law, and despite certain recent claims and attempts, there is no warrant for the establishment by coastal states of exclusive fishery limits separated from the proper limits of territorial waters, or for the assertion of exclusive fishing **rights** in areas going beyond these.

* Similarly I believe that on the western side straight lines can be drawn from Cape Wessel down to the  Sir Edward  Pellew group of islands and the area shut off could be for the exclusive fishing **rights** of Australia.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* The Leader of the Opposition has his **rights** under the Standing Orders.

* When looking at the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Gwydir the first point to be considered is that we are dealing with an Act of the Queensland Parliament which is in force, so anything that is done concerning the **rights** of Aborigines to enter on to reserves is done under the authority of that Act.

* It should be clearly understood by honourable members that the clauses which were removed by the Senate and which are the subject of the amendment now before us are there to protect the **rights** of all Aborigines and all Islanders to enter upon and live peaceably on those places.

* If honourable members give away their **rights** on this matter obviously we will have no **rights** to debate the other 2 quite extensive, expensive Bills.

* I wonder what the American authorities or the Civil Aeronautics Board would have said if we had said that no Pan American  747  fights to this country would be allowed until Australia got the **rights** it sought in respect of aircraft of that type.

* Let people fly within the curfew hours because they have no special **rights**.

* That we, the undersigned, protest against the action of the Commonwealth Government in letting the contract for the advertising **rights** for the Victorian Pink Pages Telephone Directories to an American Company, General Telephone &amp; Electronics Corp. U.S.A., trading in Australia as Directories (Aust.)

* Pty Ltd. 
Health Services Commission although, as the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  has pointed out, we wish to see that its method of operation takes full account of the **rights** and responsibilities of State governments and of this Parliament.

* We have reservations about whether it will adequately protect the **rights** and responsibilities of the States and, even more importantly, the **rights** and responsibilities of this House.

* I venture to say that if this were done the efficiency of the corporation, properly managed in the way that I am suggesting, would be such that even though it had only **rights** to competition in intrastate shipping it would very soon assume virtually what amounts to full **rights** to take intrastate as well, because I cannot imagine how many of the stevedoring companies in the main ports could continue to operate if all they were allowed to do was to deal with intrastate shipping.

* Part of the difficulty for a country such as Australia is to ensure that there is adequate preservation of the **rights** of the zone if it is extended to 200 miles.

* If there can be an international accord, it obviously would be more easy to preserve those **rights**.

* It goes on to refer to the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare.

* No honourable member who sits in this chamber would be prepared to deny that the honourable member for Wills since he has been a member of this House has always shown that he believes in the **rights** of the individual members, and that he is prepared to protect their interests.

* He has been just as adamant - indeed he has seized every opportunity - to protect the interests and what he felt to be the **rights** of Government supporters as he has of honourable members on this side of the House.

* But I want to say that during the period in which the Parliament has been prorogued there have been some disheartening developments in respect of the Aboriginal and Northern Territory land **rights** legislation.

* But if in the pursuit of such breaches there is any evidence of undue activity in one area or any suggestion of a denial of proper civil **rights** and liberties then I would certainly want to be given examples and that matter would be pursued quite vigorously.

* The Minister for Social Services is allowing his ideological preoccupations, in boycotting these nations, to deny their former citizens pension **rights** if they cease to live in Australia.

* On this occasion, as on the occasion of the second reading of the Labor Party's Bill, I have dealt principally with the **rights** of migrants.

* The Income Tax Assessment Bill seeks to abolish the present provisions giving tax exemption for profits from mining gold or of income derived from the sale, transfer or assignment of **rights** to mine a particular area for gold.

* But I do believe it is important that we should take some steps to preserve the **rights** of the rank and file members of this Parliament, not only on this side of the House but on the other side too as the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  has pointed out, and to bring forward public business and have it discussed with regularity and without, interference.

* The Opposition there is given many more **rights** than the Opposition here has.

* Under the present provisions of the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust Act the Governor may proclaim that any **rights** of entry, prospecting, exploration or mining conferred under the Mining Act 1971-78 and the Petroleum Act 1940-78 are exercisable in relation to land vested in the Aboriginal Lands Trust.

* The Working Party recommendations are in the spirit of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation as implemented by the Commonwealth Government in the Northern Territory.

* I would hope that the Opposition would not use this merely to set up bargaining positions, political or otherwise, with respect to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Another of the provisions in the Bill is to eliminate an anomaly in the present Act relating to the **rights** and benefits of the Commission's officers formerly employed by the Public Service.

* They will be on the same footing with respect to **rights** and benefits as if they were still in the Pub.lic Service.

* I would assert that all State governments of any political colour have certain **rights** to endeavour to raise revenue by implementing perhaps new avenues for doing so, and to endeavour to budget for it despite all the doubt that surrounds implementation and innovation in a new field.

* I do not deny the achievements of his Government in education but if he is saying that a white backlash will develop because of special programmes in land **rights**, then will it not at the same time develop a white backlash if there are special programmes in education?

* The honourable member for Herbert asked whether there were land **rights** for Torres Strait Islanders.

* That exclusive corporate land **rights** be granted to Aboriginal communities which retain a strong tribal structure or demonstrate a potential for corporate action in regard to land at present reserved for the use of Aborigines, or where traditional occupancy according to tribal custom can be established from anthropological or other evidence.

* Aboriginal land **rights** shall carry with them full **rights** to minerals in those lands.

* An interesting statement of the Government's altitude to land **rights** was made in the last publication by the Government on Australian Aborigines, made under the authority of the then Minister for Territories, the hon C. E. Barnes, in July 1967.

* It sees Aboriginal land **rights** as being a transitional phase in the history of the Aboriginal people from which they eventually will emerge when they merge into the Australian community.

* Presumably they could sell out to other Aborigines, but it would be a corporate trust We do not want them to be like the Red Indians in the United States who, when they received land **rights**, had a situation where generations of chiefs lived it up and their descendants have remained paupers to this day.

* We need to develop schemes where these people can be compensated for loss of land **rights** and this probably means acquiring allotments and assisting Aborigines to obtain houses.

* Of course, for many tens of thousands of Aborigines in urban areas - the indications are that over 60 per cent of those Aborigines at least need rehousing because of low standard accommodation - we must develop schemes of compensation for loss of land **rights**.

* Surely doctors should have no special **rights** to exemption because of their social or professional status.

* The **rights** of individuals in this country, a democracy, are important.

* There will always be demands by Government, by individual groups, by organisations for information which, in one view, should be available and which, in another view, to ask for it would be an invasion of personal **rights**.

* The law and order specialists on the Government side, under another name, are the people who believe in suppression of the **rights** of the individual, suppression of the right to dissent and the gaoling of people who do not agree with them.

* A related shortcoming is the approach it takes to human **rights** issues.

* Whereas the report in various places urges us not to be patronising and claims, in referring to human **rights**, that we should not impose our democratic values on other countries, the fact is that it rather patronisingly suggests that we should not expect our neighbours to respect human dignity.

* This also raises the pious argument in the report that we should not allow human **rights** to be a factor in our relations.

* In response to that I have emphasised several aspects; but let me now ask: Is the Committee trying to say that there is no concern in the Philippines about human **rights**?

* There is a regrettable pattern of capitalseeking, rapid return, minimal national constraints and minimum **rights** for as few local employees as possible.

* Every saw mill, every mining company and every business has full **rights** through the member in the electorate to approach the Commonwealth on the same principle.

* The second Fox report deals not with the general problem of export but with the specific problems of the Northern Territory and has drawn attention to very serious and difficult problems concerning environmental control, respect of the **rights** of Aborigines and national parks.

* We must, of course, see that their **rights** are protected.

* The grim tragedy of Timor constitutes a denial of basic human **rights** as well as a brutal act of annexation of the type carried out by Hitler when he seized Czechoslovakia.

* has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition, that provision is unenforceable in so far as it confers **rights** or benefits or imposes duties or obligations on a corporation.

* '(5) The making of a contract, arrangement or understanding does not constitute a contravention of this section by reason that the contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision the giving effect to which would, or would but for the operation of sub-section 88 (8) or section 93, constitute a contravention of section 47 and this section does not apply to or in relation to the giving effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding by way of- 
I doubt whether this House has ever heard a more brutal rejection of the **rights** not just of members of the Liberal Party of Australia and members of the Australian Country Part but the **rights** of all members than the one we have just heard from the leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  who has not only rejected our **rights** but has announced that he will later on move to use his numbers to prevent the exercise of all our **rights** in the future.

* The Prime Minister's emphasis on State **rights** in subsidising the arts- what he is pleased to call devolution'- is the purest example of Liberal ideology taking precedence over good sense.

* In his statement he said: 
So there is a fairly clear assertion of what he believes ought to be the Commonwealth's **rights** in this matter.

* There was no point in winning additional landing **rights** in US cities ... if there was not sufficient fuel available for regular flights.

* The fact that this can be advocated publicly by the Leader of the Opposition - not by somebody outside Parliament, not by somebody seeking to attack the Vietnam war or the **rights** and wrongs of the Vietnam war, but by the Leader of the Opposition, the man who hopes some day to become Prime Minister - for him to advocate such an action is in fact an implication to which I referred at the beginning of this speech which has national significance.

* We have just heard that the off-shore mineral **rights** legislation has been deferred for a while.

* The Bill also extends the **rights** in relation to student children engaged in full time education.

* It had the lease **rights**.

* This clause gives such senators all the **rights** of and everything associated with being a member of the Senate.

* Despite the legal terms used by the honourable member for Stirling, Territory senators, when elected, will have equal **rights** with other senators in voting and in respect of everything else associated with Senate membership.

* Frankly, if their votes are bad in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, they should be because members opposite are denying to the people of these Territories the same **rights** as apply to every Australian in every part of Australia outside of the 2 Territories.

* The optimum environment statement should also include the **rights** of the environment.

* That is another way of saying that the **rights** of the majority who did not rob banks would not be served.

* The former is not in the interest of the majority who did not bear arms but had **rights** to walk the streets in safety.

* We will have then a frame of reference within which we can rationally decide which **rights**' society can keep, increase or decrease in the interests of most people.

* We had a long campaign before free and equal voting **rights** were obtained for Aboriginal people, and the Queensland Government was the last to surrender on that account.

* To treat the patent system as a mere aggregation of individual private **rights** is to ignore its capability for contributing to national economic development.

* We are told that people should be free to do what they like, provided that they do not interfere with the **rights** of other individuals.

* The approach adopted in all cases recognises that men liable for national service have **rights** as well as obligations which are to be respected and in replying every effort is made to answer any questions and to explain carefully the man's individual position.

* In moving to diminish the limits of power of the States through the Senate, the Government is taking another bold step to violate State **rights** by eroding the Senate's power, influence and prestige.

* This legislation violates the historical origins of the Senate and weakens the foundation of our 
In the area of industrial relations, one of vital importance to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community, my Government will bring down legislation to protect the **rights** of individuals and the community, and establish an Industrial Relations Bureau.

* In addition to providing for continuation of payments to pensioners wherever they choose to live outside Australia, the provisions introduced by this Bill will also allow a social security pensioner living overseas, if he wishes and is otherwise eligible, to transfer to a repatriation Service pension, or vice versa, thus giving him the same **rights** in this respect as would be available to him in Australia.

* We will also be introducing at an early date legislation to reinstate the exemption under section 23 (p) of the Income Tax Assessment Act for income from the sale of mining **rights**.

* In other fields it has proved useless to confer abstract **rights**, however enlightened, upon people without giving them also a tribunal to which they can go, confident in the knowledge that their **rights** will he cheaply and speedily enforced.

* The amendments were wrong then and they are wrong now and ought to be struck out as soon as we have in power a government which has any repect for the **rights** of the citizens of this country.

* a country that treats me as a serf or a slave, I cannot possibly engender within my being the same pride as I can as a member of a country which gives me the **rights** that belong to every free human being.

* It is because my country gives me **rights** which some other countries do not give to me that makes me proud to be an Australian.

* I now wonder whether I am a citizen of a country that gives me the kind of citizenship **rights** that any proud free man is entitled to expect from the country of his birth.

* The Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years have full legal capacity and adult **rights** in relation to, among other things, matters of contract and property.

* This Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years shall be of full age and capacity except for certain specified matters including conditions, **rights** and obligations of employment.

* Clause 3 of the Bill provides thai upon the legislation coining into operation persons who have attained or who attain the age of 18 years shall bc deemed to attain full age and full capacity for the purposes of the laws of the State, except for certain specified matters including conditions, **rights** and obligations of employment.

* He therefore clearly and consciously abrogated any **rights** and privileges he could expect as an M.P.

* By giving transit **rights** to the New Zealand rugby union team the Fraser Government deliberately condoned sporting contacts with South Africa.

* The clause continues: the power to suspend, to the extent specified in the order, any of the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the organization or of all or any of its members, as such members, under this Act or any other Act or under awards or determinations under this Act or under any other Act; the power to give directions as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities that have been so suspended; 
Government for public debate and consideration of the Bill introduced on 4 June.

* It is also worthwhile noting that the representations received have come from all parts of Australia- a clear indication of the depth and spread of public interest in Aboriginal land **rights**.

* To further ensure that the Aborigines with traditional **rights** in land guide the action of land councils, an amendment will provide that a land council should express the wishes as well as the opinions of Aborigines in its area.

* As I indicated in introducing the Bill, it is the Government's intention, as it was  Mr Justice  Woodward's recommendation, that existing **rights** in land should be fully protected.

* Where application for mineral leases on land which becomes Aboriginal land under the Act or by a successful claim on traditional grounds to unalienated Crown land had been lodged previously to 4 June, being the date of introduction of the Bill, but not granted as a result of a freeze imposed in December 1972 pending decisions on land **rights**, the grant of a further mining interest will not be subject to consent but the applicant companies will still be obliged to negotiate fair terms in accordance with the Act.

* In his report he envisaged that consent would be negotiated normally at the stage when exploration **rights** were applied for and that the right to develop any minerals or petroleum discovered should be subject only to the adequacy of the notice given of development intentions and the final negotiation of fair terms.

* It is now intended to spell out in the Bill, however, guidelines stipulating the kind of laws which should be made by the Legislative Assembly, and to guarantee recognition in those laws of traditional **rights**.

* For example, an offence will be written into the Bill for unlawful entry onto a sacred site; Ordinances dealing with sacred sites will have to protect traditional interests in accordance with Aboriginal wishes; traditional Aboriginal **rights** to enter Aboriginal land must be provided for; protection or conservation of wildlife in the Northern Territory, including wildlife on Aboriginal land, must operate through schemes of management formulated in consultation with Aboriginals and the right of Aboriginals to utilise wildlife resources; and Ordinances regulating entry to seas adjacent to Aboriginal land to a distance of 2 kilometres must provide for the right of Aboriginals to enter and use the resources of those waters in accordance with Aboriginal tradition.

* I have said before that I believe that the passage of legislation to grant land **rights** to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory will be a most significant and progressive step in the social and political history of this country.

* I am confident that the Parliament will give the Bill the attention it deserves and will find that the amendments I have here outlined briefly will strengthen the essential provisions of the Bill while guaranteeing proper protection of existing statutory and other **rights** as recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward.

* This legislation massively infringes the **rights** of tens of thousands of loyal public servants.

* Fifthly, the confirmation of fishing **rights** in territorial waters for local inhabitants of the islands of Aubusi, Boigu, Dauan, Kaumag, Moimi and Saibai which have been retained by Australia under the Treaty, and, sixthly, the guarantee of freedom of movement by Papua New Guineans and Torres Strait Islanders within the protected zone to engage in their traditional activities.

* One hopes this includes the **rights** of Australians to visit the mainland of Papua New Guinea for traditional purposes to gather water from wells.

* grant to brokers or other persons leases, licences or other **rights** in respect of any land, building or equipment; and 
One other thing I am concerned about is the right to work.

* I hope that we shall have some measure for preserving the **rights** of individuals who want to work.

* I believe that the problem confronting this Government - it should be a problem of all governments and all members of Parliament - is to balance the freedom of the individual with the **rights** of the individual and the public interest.

* Our belief in private **rights** giving preference to the private way of economic development has proved right and desirable for all the community.

* This Government and the Parties which comprise it are the significant force in our country to strike a just balance between the freedom of individual citizens and the **rights** and claims of public interest.

* This is on the basis that he has no political **rights**.

* He said to me: 'Do you think that we have a stable democracy in this country when we cannot have full, free and one-man-one-vote elections; when we see the trade union movement hindered; when we see those who have power getting into the issue of preventing me from having my normal **rights**?

* His  plea to me was: 'Can you get  President  Carter, who has 40,000 troops in Korea holding the peace and safety of South Korea, to use his leverage to get civil, political and human **rights** in South Korea?'

* I believe that Parliament over the next decade will need increasingly to ensure that, in the ultimate, it is Parliament that protects the **rights** of individuals and the very democracy which brings us as elected representatives of the people to this chamber.

* Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, 1976 s.23E 
We stand by our belief in the fundamental **rights** of the Australian people and we are prepared to guarantee these **rights** by the creation of a Government vehicle to support our policy.

* It could help educate our young people in such areas of industrial relations informing them of their **rights** under the laws and their obligations under the laws.

* Sir Paul  Hasluck, as the relevant Minister, gave it a more humane touch where he said that assimilation meant Aborigines would live at the same standard and have the same **rights** and so forth as Europeans.

* I think we were also representatives of this Parliament on the select committee which looked into Aboriginal voting **rights**.

* The third unanswered question is: Will we change the whole course of our history and acknowledge that any **rights** whatsoever attach to their prior occupancy of Australia?

* We are beginning to acknowledge that there were people with a prior occupancy and therefore they have some **rights**.

* In that rather tragic case before the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory it appears that if the Aborigines had had the forethought to run a wire along the land and to draw a boundary they would have received the same sorts of **rights** as a squatter has, only that they would have been better entitled as squatters from time immemorial.

* But George III did not need an alliance with the Aborigines in Australia and so no treaty was entered into with them to acknowledge their land **rights**.

* We write to bring to the attention of your organisation the fact that the Lee Kuan Yew government in Singapore has lately intensified its oppression and ill-treatment of political detainees, and to appeal for moral support for the struggle for justice and human **rights** of political detainees in Singapore.

* It is incredible that the Lee Kuan Yew government in Singapore has sought to pose as an advocate of human **rights** before the world body when it has blatantly trampled upon the most elementary concept of human **rights** in its own country.

* We call on all those who genuinely believe in justice and human **rights** to lend their support to the campaign for the immediate and unconditional release of all political detainees in Singapore.

* It is rather incredible that the government in Singapore has sought to pose as an advocate of human **rights** before this world body when its own record as far as political dissidents is concerned is so shameful.

* I believe that 
I find it more than a little curious that a party which aspires to the great traditions of small '1' liberalism by putting a capital 'L' on its political designation should prove itself so reactionary, so repressive and so depriving in the way in which it approaches issues that affect fundamental **rights** in society.

* I can assure honourable members that the evidence there shows that these sorts of assertions are grossly over-blown and I do not believe that the Liberal Party does itself any credit, if it claims to be a liberal party, by jumping on the bandwaggon of reaction where social welfare benefits and services are concerned and where peoples' fundamental **rights** to self respect and dignity are involved.

* It is not an issue in respect of which anybody would agree that all the **rights** or wrongs are on one side or the other.

* If we want to do anything about this matter it is to preserve for the real Aboriginals their real **rights**.

* Some may have some kinds of **rights** over land; some another kind of right over the land.

* Some may have hunting **rights**; some may have other **rights** such as ceremonial **rights**.

* But I am not in favour of this kind of simplistic idea that we can take Aboriginal **rights** which are complex and just put them into our simple Procrustean bed of ownership.

* Anybody who knows anything about the way in which these Aboriginal **rights** work as between themselves would not be committing this kind of simplistic mistake which is in a way an outrage against real Aboriginality.

* Education should promote love of freedom and justice and should develop critical perception, ability to choose intelligently, capacity for selfgovernment and a sense of social responsibility, lt should instil belief in the equal **rights** of all people and respect for their essential humanity, irrespective of nationality, colour or creed.

* It is assumed that electorates will be so drawn as to ensure that the **rights** of people are put above the convenience of political parties and members thereof.

* That offer was that the States should retain control of the mineral resources of the territorial seabed, that is, from low water mark to the 3-mile mark off-shore, while the Commonwealth legislated to take over total **rights** outside the 3-mile limit to the edge of the continental shelf.

* But under this proposed legislation who would have the legal **rights** within the 3-mile limit?

* If the Commonwealth takes the attitude that the States have no **rights** because the agreement, undertaking - call it what you like - is not legally enforceable, what the Commonwealth is saying is that if the Commonwealth promises something get it written into a contract immediately, and in an enforceable form, otherwise the promise is not worth anything.

* The Northern Territory administration was concerned about the role it would play in a national park and the Northern Land Council was very concerned that any role the Northern Territory administration played might impinge upon the **rights** of Aboriginal people.

* The Commonwealth made it very clear that the **rights** of the Aboriginal people would be preserved and that Commonwealth control would be maintained over this great national park.

* Fully supports the Resolutions of the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations on Cyprus; 
Notes the spirit of goodwill with which the Government of Cyprus approached the resumption of the intercommunal talks under the personal auspices and directive of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and strongly supports the immediate application of human **rights** in Cyprus as the only basis for a just political statement.

* It is important for the **rights** of the House that standing order 401 be given due weight.

* Members have been given more and improved speaking **rights** in the Parliament.

* I am afraid that this gets back to a States **rights** issue.

* In the United Nations we as a nation applaud the freedoms that are there espousedhuman **rights**, the protection of the individual's life and property, the freedom of countries from aggression, and so on.

* Another matter to which reference has been made is the human **rights** legislation.

* That Bill clearly espoused the **rights**.

* It meant that we as a Parliament would legislate to guarantee that people had **rights**.

* Personally my own view is that those **rights** ought to be spelled out in the Constitution itself, but it is important for them to be incor- porated in legislation and to be enforceable in legislation.

* All that the Government is saying is that it will establish a human **rights** commission.

* That Bill had the ability to enforce **rights**.

* We were relying on the external affairs powers in respect of our legislation so that this Parliament would be able to say right throughout Australia that **rights** could be guaranteed.

* It will not be as strong and it will not encompass all **rights**.

* Some of the major areas lacking in detail are, firstly, the lack of definite guidelines for negotiation of agreements with the State governments in relation to accommodation and finance; secondly, the lack of precise definition of the functions of the Health Insurance Commission; and, thirdly, the lack of definition of doctors' and patients' **rights** and entitlements.

* We are not buying into the old debates about State aid and State **rights**.

* I wish to raise tonight a serious situation concerning the issue of human **rights** and what I can only assume to be the most unsatisfactory nature of diplomatic representation by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in this country.

* What are the general **rights** of national groups in the Soviet Union.

* How does this compare with the **rights** or the Jewish community?

* The issue of human **rights** in the Soviet Union and in other countries has concerned me and I have placed a question on notice for the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  seeking information on the number of political prisoners in every country on which information can be obtained and I eagerly await that reply.

* Even more remarkable is another sentence on the front page which reads: 
Finally, it seems to me that the Soviet Union is jeopardising detente and world peace and is curiously supersensitive on the issue of human **rights** when it complains so bitterly about  President  Carter's comments on Soviet dissidents.

* The only arguments that have been advanced as to why we have to curtail our **rights** in this matter is that the Minister does not trust Bjelke-Petersen.

* That is why the House has to curtail its **rights** and prerogatives.

* The **rights** of the Queensland Governmentwhich the Minister says he does not trust- to walk into their reserves and the **rights** of the Queensland Government to apply continued pressure upon the Aboriginal people in the reserves that are the subject of this debate can continue and will continue by virtue of the prearranged decisions that have been made by this Minister and his colleagues.

* Just as there is room in this debate for a view that the best way to tolerance is not necessarily through legislative coercion, it is equally true that there is no room for the view that the essential liberties of people in any society are not necessarily to be protected in the ultimate by the passage of legislation which lays down explicit rules as to what **rights** people have, as to what **rights** people can enjoy and as to what things people can and cannot do.

* In my view, this represents a denial of **rights** to certain young Australians and it is these **rights** which have been ignored by previous governments which have had a preponderance of people who professed to represent the needs of persons from rural electorates.

* I turn to the **rights** of the individual.

* Compare those achievements with the whittling away of the **rights** of people in which the Government is now indulging.

* By **rights** they should be laying off labour now.

* We should not approach every problem or every Bill with swords drawn on this constant argument about State **rights**.

* But, speaking for the Australian Labor Government, I do promise that such a mistake will only be made again if the community at large defaults on its responsibilities and ignores its **rights**.

* There can be no claim, in my opinion, that in any way the Australian Government is usurping State **rights** in this matter, as it is clear that the State governments are also in the initial stages of developing their own techniques.

* The 1 8-year-olds were given voting **rights** for the first time.

* The Minister said that  Mr Salemi  has no fundamental **rights**, but I suppose from this Minister's view of life nobody has any fundamental **rights**.

* However, the cost of acquiring petroleum mining or exploration **rights** or information will not qualify under the scheme.

* It is not under threat and the laws of Norfolk Island, I hope, will continue to protect the **rights** of those people who live there to enjoy their culture and to ensure that they can contain the number of people who go there to share the island with them.

* The Prime Minister's Policy Speech said: We will establish once and for all Aborigines' **rights** to land and insist that whatever the law of George III says, a tribe and a race with an identity of centuriesmillenia - is as much entitled to own land as even a proprietary company.

* So when they talk about wanting **rights** for private members they should remember this: A few days ago on Grievance Day when private members have their only chance once a month to put their views, the Opposition put up frivolous motions and took that time away from the private members.

* The Opposition has its **rights**, as does the Government.

* The USSR has been consistently evading and violating the covenants it has signed in regard to human **rights**.

* The Soviet Union has demonstrated the most utter hypocrisy in regard to human **rights** and I think it is time that the Government officially associated itself with a protest in the United Nations.

* I ask now that the Government officially bring to the notice of the United Nations the consistent violation of all human **rights** which the Soviet Union is perpetrating against its .own citizens inside its own borders.

* These schemes involved the taxpayer obtaining a tax deduction for prepayments of interest on a loan which is artificial in that it is then effectively cancelled by the taxpayer buying back the **rights** in it.

* Of course, trade practices legislation is designed to create a free market place situation where the consumer does have some **rights**, where the consumer is presented with some choice, where competition does work or at least is encouraged to work so as to provide some of the beneficial aspects of a competitive system.

* The Attorney-General, when introducing the Bill, placed a lot of emphasis on, in fact devoted a fair section of his speech to, the difficulties in assessing the relative merits of human **rights** as against the need to protect the public interest where crime is involved.

* That is where we get into this problem of human **rights**.

* What are one's **rights** regarding the law when those enforcing the law are endeavouring to ascertain whether a crime has.

* One then enters into the area of human **rights**, about which we are now talking.

* So, when the Attorney-General talks about human **rights**, that is certainly the case.

* The Opposition is entitled to talk about the Bill because it was a former Attorney-General, Kep Enderby, who encouraged the Law Reform Commission to look at this question, particularly with regard to civil **rights**.

* However, with regard to the question of investigation and what it means, we are talking about what I have said already, that is, the need to maintain a proper balance between protection for the individual **rights** and liberties on the one hand and the community's need for practical and effective law enforcement on the other hand.

* The recurring theme throughout the Commission's report is that there are common law **rights**, but the **rights** are illusory.

* It is all very well to talk about **rights**, but let us see them spelt out.

* If **rights** are to be of any use to us they must be enforceable.

* What this rather legalistic term means is that evidence obtained in contravention of the rules should be inadmissible, unless the prosecution can satisfy the court that it should be introduced in the public interest without unduly interfering with the **rights** of the accused.

* The question is the perennial one of individual **rights** versus law enforcement.

* The Law Reform Commission is to be congratulated for making provision for these advances to be used in enforcing the **rights** of the accused.

* He has been through it all before; but the person who is not used to this sort of thing may not be aware of his **rights**.

* This is another instance of common law **rights** being practically worthless.

* In his second reading speech the Attorney-General mentioned those **rights**.

* That is pretty obvious, because common law **rights** are theoretical.

* that we could rely on the common law **rights**.

* If the common law has had any genus it has been of a textbook type and not of a practical type, lt Ls for that reason we do need law which spells out what people's **rights** are.

* I refer to the provision for a person to sign an acknowledgment that he had received a warning as to his **rights**.

* The recommendation of the majority of the Commission was that in cases where the police suspected that a person had committed a serious crime they should not question that person, nor seek to have him accompany them to the station or elsewhere, without first advising him of his **rights**.

* The method of ensuring that that was done would be to have the person sign the acknowledgment that he was advised of his **rights**.

* The first was that very few citizens are aware of their common law **rights** and the police are not always able to inform them.

* This means, in effect, that the individual's **rights** are illusionary.

* What the majority was saying was that no person should be deprived of his **rights** because of ignorance.

* The best sort of education in this area is to inform a person of his **rights** at the time those **rights** are in question.

* Its purpose is purely to ensure that the **rights** of people have been looked at properly, lt is of no good to say later: We made a mistake.

* There has been a suggestion that the Bill that we are now considering is denying the **rights** of individuals.

* On the contrary it preserves the **rights** of individuals.

* It is in order to protect the **rights** of those individuals that this Bill is presently before the Parliament.

* But we on this side of the Parliament do not believe that the Parliament is the proper body to adjudicate on the **rights** and wrongs of these individuals.

* Its purpose is not to cast into doubt the powers of the courts of this land; its purpose is not to cast into doubt the ability of the magistrates, justices and judges to adjudicate on the **rights** and wrongs of individual cases before them; its purpose is to guarantee those **rights**.

* The general question of the **rights** of the individuals who erected their tents in front of Parliament House has been canvassed.

* It is important that we should recognise that in order to preserve the **rights** of those who wish to demonstrate and speak on behalf of minority groups, we are not seeking to remove them from the front of Parliament House.

* Indeed, for them to set up their encampment is to deny the **rights** of individuals to demonstrate.

* But with respect to the other charges and whether they should be pursued, my colleague the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood)  in another place has said that he believes that Messrs Ambrose Golden-Brown and William James Richard Harrison - 2 of the plaintiffs in the proceedings - might well bc found as having secured for themselves **rights** which should not now be taken from them.

* Accordingly, while it is believed that proceedings should be continued against all other persons charged with a variety of offences there is reason to distinguish these persons because of the degree to which they might well be said to have attracted to themselves peculiar **rights**.

* Over which reserves have mining or pastoral **rights** been granted, and to whom have they been granted.

* In respect of which reserves where mining or pastoral **rights** have been granted are royalties or other considerations to be paid for the benefit of the Aboriginal people, and what are the particulars of these considerations in each case.

* Does he agree that self-management without land **rights** is a mirage and that rnining is the greatest and most constant threat to their social stability?

* We are certainly not interested in depriving them of royalties; we are not interested in their fisheries **rights**; we are not interested in the off-shore operations of their civil and criminal codes; but we are very much interested in making sure that, for the first time, there will be really intensive drilling on the North- West Shelf which covers 142,000 square miles and is one of the best and richest resources of natural gas in the world today.

* Bill entrenches in Australian domestic law for the first time the customary **rights** of Aborigines according to their traditional interests.

* I think that what  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership **rights** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* It was pointed out that there could be a conjunction of Aboriginal interest and Australian domestic legal interest through the identity of the Aboriginal who is the custodian and who might also be the trustee for the Aborigines of their land **rights** through membership of the land trust I feel that whatever might be said about the material provided to the House by the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  from those Aborigines around Hermannsburg, there will not be the friction they fear when this legislation is put into operation.

* It was proposed to  Mr Justice  Woodward that Aborigines should also have the **rights** to minerals within their land.

* But his greatest opponent, the preserver of our **rights** and traditions, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, will not allow him to do this.

* In effect, the answer emerges with stark reality and crystal clarity that when the schemes are sound Queensland will accept and has accepted them; where freedom and dignity are threatened Queensland will resist and defend the **rights** of sovereignty and privacy.

* Down that road lies totalitarianism and the progressive restriction of the freedom of the individual, the basic right of the individual to exercise the maximum freedom of choice, compatible with the **rights** of his fellow citizens.

* As a result, the voters elected a Government which is dedicated to increasing the freedom of the individual and the respect of his basic **rights** as an individual, while at the same time exercising its responsibility as a Government to protect and to assist those in our community who cannot care adequately for themselves.

* During his visit to Jakarta in September 1974 and  President  Suharto's visit to Australia in April 1975 that man and his Government sold the right of Australia to hold its head high and to say that we are people of principle, regardless of which party is in government, and that we know where the **rights** of individuals for self-determination lie.

* They demonstrated to this nation while in government their utter and complete contempt for the truth and for the **rights** of peoples whether Indonesians or Timorese.

* He said: 
What is the difference between the life or death of an Indonesian soldier killed in Timor and the **rights** of a citizen of Timor to fight for his independence?

* Yet at the time when Australia could have done something, when we could have given the moral support which I believe, on the basis of recent intelligence,  President  Suharto would have wished at that time, the Prime Mnister sold the **rights** of another people to decide their future, and left in its wake the death and destruction which has fallen upon that small nation.

* The ones to which I refer are the SRDs, the statutory reserve deposits - not the special drawing **rights**, no matter how much some people might like to have special drawing **rights**.

* His  last action was to vindicate the **rights** of this House against what was an act of very great discourtesy.

* But it is consistent with the attitudes shown towards the **rights** of the House by the holder of that office.

* No reference was made from the other side to the importance of the speakership in vindicating the **rights** of this Parliament.

* So I say that in Australia the tradition of vindicating the **rights** of this House in the formation of a government and its **rights**  vis-a-vis  the Crown is very defective.

* I suppose an argument could be developed, if we recognise de facto one government's **rights** over a piece of territory, although we are not going to the extent of recognising de jure that government's **rights** we are by implication obliterating our de jure recognition of the former government.

* A person loses certain **rights**- I suppose that they are consequential **rights**- to property and the like and travel **rights**.

* I refer to the case of a war widow who now has an illegitimate child, and I raise the question of the **rights** of the child and the **rights** of the woman.

* She could then apply for a social security pension, which would result in a similar sum of money being available to her, but with reduced **rights**.

* Surely it is a simple matter of natural justice that the child and the mother should be entitled to the same **rights** as a civilian widow with a child on a social security pension, without having to accept the penalty that she must surrender her entitlements as a war widow.

* It may be that the Repatriation Act is deficient, and it is certainly a fact that it is not long ago that the same child would have been denied **rights** under the Social Services Act.

* Thirdly, the Bill proposes to enhance the means by which the **rights** of members of organisations and the interests of the community can be better protected through the functioning of the Commission, the Industrial Relations Bureau and the Federal Court.

* Individual Rights 
I have already made general reference to the manner in which unions can erode the industrial **rights** of individuals.

* However, organisations are meant to protect and enlarge the **rights** of individuals, and not to undermine their liberties.

* A number of cases in which infringements of the **rights** of individuals by trade unions have occurred have received attention in recent months.

* The letter, referring to Article 3, said: Whereas this construction is not intended to restrict the Government of Australia's **rights** of consultation, it is intended to spell out clearly that consultation does not carry with it any degree of control over the station or its use'.

* What **rights** are available to persons required to remove clothing for the purpose of a search by Customs officials, and how are such **rights** notified to the suspect.

* Are existing provisions under the Customs Act sufficient to safeguard human **rights** and dignity.

* After years of devoted study of abortion law versus choice morality, Callahan found it necessary, reluctantly, to choose permissive abortion as the only type of abortion law which recognises women's **rights** over their own bodies, but not absolute **rights** because due regard must be given to the foetus and to society, and which upholds the dignity of the law by not allowing it to fall into disrepute, as laws prohibiting abortion do.

* He said that the granting of land **rights** for Aborigines in the Northern Territory would make the Northern Territory into a black state.

* Now to deny the indigenous people **rights** is, in my view, far from being honest.

* The Governor-General, with no consideration for the **rights** of the members of this chamber and with no consideration for the **rights** of the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, who, the honourable member for Mackellar has convinced us, is the champion of the **rights** of this chamber, refused to see the  Speaker.

* Every member of the Government parties in the Senate voted against the suggestion that the legislation be the subject of calm, dispassionate discussion of the **rights** of the people.

* It has nothing to do with attending the Labor Party rally in the domain or somewhere else, but it has everything to do with the **rights** and lives of people; the question of terrorism and the danger to people's lives.

* The Bill is a failure from the point of view of protecting the **rights** and privileges of people against interference.

* When this legislation was first introduced I criticised the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  for a quite unacceptable approach to the **rights** of the Opposition on the one hand, and the **rights** of the Government back benchers on the other.

* This action is recorded in our history as the greatest invasion of security possible and a violation of human **rights**.

* that a balance between the **rights** of individual persons and the preservation of the security of Australia as a nation is no simple or easy thing to achieve.

* Granted that there are problems, it is necessary for us to ensure that any techniques adopted do not infringe fundamental human **rights** and privileges.

* Firstly, common law has guaranteed the **rights** of the individual to such an extent that there has been no successful prosecution for sedition in England for over 100 years.

* It is right to continue the practice of tilting the balance in favour of offering greater protection to the security of the State, rather than in the direction of the safeguarding the **rights** of the individual.

* I repeat that the Conference of Privy Councillors- the greatest legal authority- has said that it would favour protection for the security of the State rather than safeguarding the **rights** of the individual.

* This clause appears to me to guarantee the **rights** of any person who may be aggrieved in relation to any assessment made of him under the ASIO legislation.

* He sent a telegram to you as the custodian of the **rights** of this Parliament, the custodian of the **rights** of the members of this House.

* Afraid of prosecution and uncertain of their **rights** under the law some doctors are refusing women an abortion when they are in need.

* Parliaments have not protected all the **rights** involved when they force women to bear children against their will.

* This lack of freedom of choice cannot be accepted by people who respect basic individual **rights**.

* I warn this wholly male House that it is because we are males there is a great danger that we will ignore the needs and **rights** of women in this matter.

* But to confine one's thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other **rights** inherent in the situation, such as the **rights** to health and welfare of the mother and her existing family, the **rights** to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the child to be wanted.

* Those who accept without question the 'right to life' of the foetus must examine their consciences and answer for the desperate misery and hardship imposed upon pregnant women, the existence of illicit abortionists, the hypocrisy of a law that is different for rich and poor, and the confusion that faces doctors as to their medical **rights**.

* And those who deny the **rights** of life to the foetus at any stage of its development without thorough examination and conviction do so at the peril of encouraging disrespect for life, legalised by the state, which is the most fundamental of al) **rights** and which is basic to all other **rights**.

* The principle of the right to life and its relation to other **rights** is the reason why there is so much emotion and controversy in the abortion debate.

* There is however a sea of controversy amongst theologians, the medical fraternity and the public as to when, during that continuum, the foetus should be granted **rights**.

* The validity of **rights** is only as strong as the powers that protect them.

* Rights can only be realised when they are exercised, and the state, once it grants **rights**, is obliged to use its full power to enforce and protect those **rights** regardless of sex, colour, race or creed, or even financial standing.

* The law does not regard the foetus as a human being and bestow it with full **rights** of citizenship, otherwise the state would not condone the 'murders' that pass as abortions.

* It cannot grant **rights** cheaply.

* Faced with a similar question of **rights**, including the right to life of the foetus, the United States Supreme Court laid down rules for all abortion laws.

* Our Bill is guided by these rules and the common law as they relate to the protection of the life of the woman and to the developing **rights** of the foetus as the gestion progresses.

* For, once the right to life has been conferred, life should not be taken unless by consent or when it can be proven beyond doubt that the taking of life was essential to protect the equal **rights** of another.

* This would involve the preservation of superannuation **rights** not only of each of the contributors covered by the Bills - some 250,000 people - but also of contributors in other Commonwealth schemes.

* I do not think it is desirable that Commonwealth employees be denied the advantages of the preservation of these **rights** pending consideration of a national superannuation scheme applying to the whole of the work force.

* It is not a charter of the **rights** of Australians overseas.

* By these 3 factors, as has been mentioned, we have the right to say, firstly, that this clause is harsh and unreasonable; secondly, it is unnecessary because of the State Jaw; and thirdly, it takes away any **rights** that the accused might have had under the British common law system.

* In the case of canned fruits, the policy would operate to deny us free entry and to require the payment of a 25 per cent tariff while other countries which are progressively being associated with **rights** in the European Common Market, such as Spain, Greece, Turkey, Israel and practically the whole of North Africa, would be enabled to have duty free entry.

* , (5) and (6) All persons concerned can be assured that in applying any scheme of rationalisation which might be adopted for the industry, their accrued **rights** would be protected and special effort would be made to achieve justice in every respect.

* So, for the time being, the **rights** of individuals to go on to Aboriginal land are already restricted and the exercise of those **rights** is capable of being restricted by the operation of that ordinance.

* Secondly, 1 1 November marks the day on which payment in fact will be made automatically and without reference to Parliament, so that there can be no political intereference with the **rights** of pensioners to receive adjustments in accordance with rises in the cost of living.

* All purchases would be by agreement and would not include mineral **rights** as the vendors would not have these **rights**.

* Other acquisitions by the Commonwealth, effected under the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act 1955, and when involving compulsory processes, may or may not include mineral **rights** as necessity determines.

* In the case of Shoalwater Bay training reserve, the mineral **rights** were acquired and pursuant to Section 5 1 of the Lands Acquisitions Act 1955, **rights** were subsequently granted back by the Commonwealth to those private holders of land which necessitated pre-acquisition.

* I would not expect these administrative arrangements to be in any way prejudicial to or have any adverse effect on the **rights** of authors under the public lending right scheme.

* I do not propose in the few minutes available to me to canvass the **rights** or wrongs of the decision made on the environmental issue but the fact is that, as a consequence of that decision, very many Australians are suffering hardship and distress.

* The land is owned by the Bellambi Coal Co. Ltd, and is part of the Sydney water supply catchment area with water **rights** consequently controlled by the Metropolitan Sewerage and Drainage Board.

* The Committee notes that the Land Rights Act was drawn up so as to preserve existing **rights**.

* The Committee is aware of the strong desire by Aboriginals to obtain **rights** over the 2 kilometres area.

* It therefore proposes that the Northern Territory legislation should make provision for the following: 
The **rights** of existing commercial fishing licences to be retained and that new fishing licences be issued only after consultation between the Fisheries Branch of the Department of the Northern Territory and the relevant Land Council; and 
The majority of the members of the Committee believes that the Parliament should maintain a continuing oversight of the administration of the Land Rights Act to ensure that the letter and spirit of the Act have been observed.

* Land **rights** is a fundamental question to the Aboriginal people.

* We have to take that only a few steps further to have a better feeling about the land **rights** situation of the Aboriginal people.

* The issue in the debate between myself and my colleague the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson),  a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, and the rest of my colleagues, although not all of them, was the question of the **rights** to the sea.

* It is my view that we should have conferred the ownership of the sea area, 2 kilometres from land, upon the Aboriginal people with **rights** of access to that area coming by application to the Aboriginal people.

* The Committee has chosen to advocate that, in fact, the sea shall be more or less open with **rights** to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people but with absolute right of access to Aboriginal people.

* I believe it is time we took up the whole issue of land **rights**.

* Perhaps we should actually purchase from the Queensland Government such areas as the Torres Strait Islands, Palm Island and so on, and deed that land in trust to the Aboriginal community in the same way as we are talking of land **rights** in the Northern Territory.

* The subject of land **rights** has been a difficult question for all communities everywhere.

* The Spanish laws of the 16th and 17th centuries provided absolute **rights** to land for indigenous people.

* The task force was charged with the responsibility of investigating the allegations, keeping firmly in mind the traditional **rights** and traditional movements of people from Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait area.

* It would seem also that the basic human **rights** of equality before the law and equal access to the courts cannot be attained without an adequate system of legal aid.

* Their **rights** have been suspended.

* The Opposition agrees that that is so, but it will not co-operate to the extent that the House plays a secondary role, nor will it co-operate to the extent of asking its members to deny themselves their right to call divisions, or to call for a quorum if they feel that is necessary, or to deny themselves any other **rights** which they have as members of this House.

* it abolishes basic existing **rights** of people, substitutes apparent benefits which are not described with clarity and which are at the unfettered discretion of bureaucrats, and leaves many people worse off than under their existing legal **rights**; 
There is no way in a democratic community that a democratically elected government can bring about confrontation which is a much vaunted word used by members of the Labor Party.

* This legislation is designed to ensure that the ordinary **rights** of employers and the law are applied.

* They sought to erode the **rights** of Queensland people to obtain loans from building societies by adopting a most undignified and reprehensible approach.

* I am also advised that the Woods Report on 'Canadian Industrial Relations' (December 1968) recommended that legislation be introduced to guarantee **rights** of the kind referred to by the honourable members but that to date no such legislation has been enacted.

* Every member of a labour organisation shall have equal **rights** and privileges within such organisation to nominate candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor organisation, to attend membership meetings and to participate in the deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in such organisation's constitution and bylaws.

* The United States and Australia have adopted different methods in guaranteeing **rights** to members of labour organisations.

* Historically the United States has favoured conferring such **rights** in the form of a Bill of Rights.

* Australia has followed the British practice of not conferring **rights** in this form.

* However, the provisions of the Commonwealth Act which provide means for the invalidation of any rule of an organisation which is unreasonable, oppressive or unjust and for the performance or observance of any rule of such an organisation provide a more extensive protection of the **rights** of members than does the United States Act which guarantees only specified **rights** to members of labour organisations in that country.

* If honourable members find it difficult to follow the convolutions of the Act how can they expect a pensioner to find out his **rights** or obligations under the Act?

* May I remind them of the Human Rights Bill by which my predecessor valiantly tried to upgrade human **rights** in Australia, only to have the Bill defeated by the Opposition and ultimately killed by the prorogation.

* In view of the world-wide protests against this mockery of justice perpetrated in Prague and in view of the public statements of  President  Carter,  Mrs Thatcher,  the Italian  President  and the European Parliament, will the Minister now indicate Australia's attitude to this travesty of basic human **rights**?

* It was based on our argument that his original Customs Amendment Bill 1979 gave too much to the necessities of law enforcement and lacked consideration for the **rights** of individuals.

* I am not saying whether the Opposition had **rights** or whether it did not, but last night we saw in this Parliament what we are being encouraged to see in our universities by some sections only, what we are starting to see in some of our courts by some sections only, and it is something that should concern every member of this Parliament whether he be Labor or Liberal.

* I again urge reconsideration of these provisions in terms of the very concept of land **rights** for particular groups or communities and in relation to particular land.

* I do not think I need to say any more about the fact that land trusts are to be directed by the Land Council so that the land owner really exercises no **rights** at all.

* Wherever one looks in the Bill one finds a problem in terms of land **rights**, land ownership in the ordinary sense that we would understand it, and I believe in the ordinary sense that Aboriginal people would understand it.

* In our opinion the Corporation is another structure which has been set up to ride roughshod over the State **rights** and it has been debated in this chamber.

* I quote again from the publication 'It's Time ' which states: 
Yet the Minister is setting up a monstrosity and a monopoly which will usurp the powers, the **rights** and the authority of the States.

* This, of course, is a complete fabrication and a denial of traditional **rights** which have been build up in this country for very good reasons.

* There are problems in many areas- economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental, technical and Aboriginal **rights**.

* For example, the Government does not want to look at recommendation 3 of the First Fox Report which states: 
If the safeguards to the environment are contemptible; the respect for the **rights** of Aborigines is beneath contempt.

* Government went to the people, one of the objectives of its policy was to establish a bill of human **rights** to be applied throughout Australia.

* On page 45 of the Platform Constitution and Rules of the Australian Labor Party, we see that the Australian Constitution is to be amended to provide for the protection of fundamental civil **rights** and liberties.

* Paragraph 2 of the section on civil liberties states: 
The Australian and State Parliaments to pass Acts providing for human **rights** and civil liberties, and to take all possible legislative and administrative action and judicial proceedings to prevent infringement of such **rights** and liberties and in particular to prevent discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, sex, creed or politics.

* We are faced today with a blatant attempt by -this Government to eat away at the fundamental **rights** of the Australian people.

* But to suggest that people who have been allowed to come to this land, who have lost so much, their possessions, their **rights** in their own country and above all some of their self respect, should now be permitted to enter Australia as second class citizens and be denied the inalienable **rights** which we all take for granted, is a situation which I for one view with abhorrence and dismay.

* I wish to make it quite clear at this point that, whether a person is a Chilean, a Bait, a Ugandan, a Cypriot or a Vietnamese, once given permission to enter Australia they should have the full **rights** and responsibilities under the law of this land.

* These **rights** are inalienable.

* Above all, it is essential that people who live in Australia be given the full **rights** under the law.

* Certainly there is no law of which I am aware which dictates that any person or any citizen living in this land should be prevented from enjoying to the full his democratic **rights**.

* One has been referred to by previous speakers in this debate, and that is the relative **rights** of the mining interests and Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.

* Another member of the Legislative Council - from memory I think it was  Dr Letts  - expressed concern about the **rights** of people who had had their property acquired by the Government in Canberra.

* What worries me is that nobody seemed to be speaking up for the **rights** of people who do not have any land, people who want to acquire, housing at reasonable cost in a town where land prices are excessively high.

* But I urge the Government to look at the question of the **rights** of minority interests, because I fear that at the present stage of the political development of the Northern Territory we.

* might well find that people in tie underprivileged minorities will have their **rights** trampled upon.

* As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the 3-mile limit.

* The Opposition comes in here preaching about removing the **rights** of people to be able to put up a little sign saying that they represent something.

* The Commons, on 1 2 April 1 733 and the Lords on 1 7 May 1763, resolved, 'That the assaulting, insulting or menacing any Member of this House in his coming to or going from the House, or upon the account of his behaviour in Parliament, is an high infringement of the privilege of this House, a most outrageous and dangerous violation of the **rights** of Parliament and an high crime and misdemeanour'; and on 6 June 1 780 the Commons resolved, 'That it is a gross breach of the privilege of this House for any person to obstruct and insult the Members of this House in the coming to, or going from, the House .

* Members of the Commonwealth Teaching Service will have the protections and **rights** available under the Compensation (Com monwealth Employees) Acts, the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act and the Superannuation Act.

* Part V of the Bill includes a provision that any Commonwealth public servant who is appointed as Commissioner or who joins the Teaching Service will retain his existing and accruing **rights**.

* However the Bill safeguards the **rights** of members of the Service when promotions are made.

* Finding that there were manganese deposits in the area, the mission was bright enough to take out a licence to control the mineral **rights**.

* It is that the Government has authorised the introduction of legislation to recognise land **rights** for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, those land **rights** being in respect of the reserves there and also traditional lands to which Aborigines wish to make claim.

* A fundamental provision recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward- namely, to declare the nature of the Aboriginal land **rights** to their own land- was omitted from the Bill introduced by the previous Government.

* We will be making sure that their **rights** are given to them in a legislative framework, with complementary legislation in the Northern Territory, in such areas as land use and the right of entry to Aboriginal land and communities.

* Out of this cooperative effort between this Government and the Northern Territory we will have a piece of legislation giving land **rights** to Aborigines which will be able to last for a long time.

* I thought that the right to vote was one of the democratic **rights** of every Australian.

* I understand that even in the recent election in Australia there were problems with batches of postal ballot papers posted inside 
How can the **rights** of man be properly respected in a society which tolerates this kind of attitude to labour?

* Even though there may be joint rolls, that in no way infringes upon the **rights** of a State government to make its own decisions regarding redistribution.

* We tried it the quiet way but from now on we will play it tough and hard, but, nevertheless, it will be fair because the Australian Gaslight Co. has its **rights**.

* I want to reaffirm that at all times I have pressed and will continue to press for the fullest mining of all uranium in the Northern Territory, with due regard to environmental restoration, and other interests, such as Aboriginal **rights**.

* No Labor administration will be responsible for denying to the respective discoveries of uranium in any areas, the subject of the Woodward Committee's terms of reference, proper **rights** under the Northern Territory mining ordinances for their ultimate development.

* The Australian Atomic Energy Commission reports that in the Northern Territory where all our richest uranium deposits are, excepting Yeelirrie, the total expenditure for uranium prospecting during 1973 is expected to be $2.6 lm in 29,600 square miles held under prospecting **rights**.

* In the past 9 months country people's **rights** have been quickly cut away and many are saying that this is just another step in the campaign.

* I ask the Minister for Immigration the following question: In view of the fact that many thousands of nonEnglish speaking migrants make up a significant part of the Australian work force, will the Minister take steps to make available appropriate explanatory material in the relevant languages showing the **rights** as well as the obligations of employees?

* Will the Minister confer with the Minister for Labour with a view to ensuring that awards and decisions of State and Australian arbitration tribunals as well as State and Australian statutes are translated and published in the appropriate languages so that all workers, irrespective of their national origin, will understand and have the capacity to enforce their **rights** legally?

* It is extraordinary that we ought to be debating a clause like this which is so fundamental to the whole legislation and which strikes at the basis of the question of authority and the system of democracy as it operates in this country, where a DirectorGeneral of an organisation whose record is not, to say the least, particularly good in terms of safeguarding the **rights** of the individual is, in terms of this clause, able to deny to the Parliament, and to the Minister, information which has been collected by the organisation.

* One gets the feeling that the Government is somewhat embarrassed by this legislation, that it is not prepared to come into the chamber and debate the legislation even to the extent that it was debated in the Senate where there may be, perhaps, stronger traditions of civil liberty and stronger Government members who are concerned about protecting the **rights** of the individual.

* It seems to me that as long as the Government is prepared to allow a clause like this to stand within legislation like this, we cannot really believe that the cant about individual liberties, the cant about democracy and the **rights** of freedom of speech and the right to organise, is anything more than cant or anything more than hypocrisy.

* It is of course within the bounds of the **rights** and responsibilities of the AuditorGeneral as to what action he may take following requests or views expressed by the Committee.

* The Commonwealth is asserting its **rights** in this area.

* When the determinations of the High Court of Australia are made, I would think that the States will realise that, instead of there being an attack on State **rights**, under the developments which then take place this legislation will actually confer a benefit on the States, because it confers a benefit on all the people of Australia.

* Did the former Prime Minister announce on 25th September 1969 (Hansard, page 1997) that on the basis of  Sir Leslie  Melville's report of February 1968 his Government intended to legislate for transferability of superannuation **rights** for those employed by the Commonwealth who choose to move to public employment with the States.

* He would not, without breaching his commission and his oath of office, certify an agreement which, as it were, took away the **rights** of one section of the community or infringed upon the **rights** of other sections of the community.

* Every person is entitled to expect equal **rights** and that the Government of the day will treat him as an Australian, not as someone belonging to a sub-standard section of the community, as is presently the case under this Government.

* We have to see that when we take money from them through a tax scheme, whether it is voluntary on the side of the contributors or compulsory on the side of taxpayers as it is to prop up this scheme, we get as much mileage as we can out of every $1 that we spend of their money, consistent with good standards of professional service, the **rights** of people and so on.

* In his State of the Union message in September last the  President  of Mexico announced that only the United States had objected to Mexico's decision and reserved legal **rights** in this regard.

* The current level of expenditure is intolerable to anyone who is concerned with the basic **rights** of the people within this income group.

* There is growing stress, tension and industrial disputation in the Public Service as a result of increased work loads, loss of certain employment **rights** and staff imbalances, and there is a reduction in the quality of services provided.

* Equally, the legislation is not urgently required to provide greater equality of voting **rights**.

* We have yet to hear the proposed time schedule, but if the Minister follows his past pattern, his mania for cutting off adequacy of opportunity for debate is such that I guess we will have about half an hour to pass 5 major Bills affecting the electoral **rights** of the Australian community.

* His second argument was in regard to equality of voting **rights**.

* The Liberal and National Country parties in this Parliament are now bordering on a philosophy that would outlaw altogether the right to strike and take us back to the feudal or slave days when the basic **rights** of man were taken away from him.

* All these **rights** are clearly set out in this Covenant.

* I hope Queenslanders who are listening tonight and those who read this debate will realise that their leader is not prepared to give them human **rights**, yet here we are as a nation pretending to the world that we will give those **rights** to all our citizens.

* It is a day set aside every year to commemorate a courageous group of women in the United States of America who campaigned in the streets, many years before it was accepted that one could campaign in the streets, for the **rights** of women.

* It will even be a battle to make clear that it is fundamentally a people's battle and not just a battle for women's **rights**, but a struggle to proclaim that every section of society, all men, women and children born and unborn will benefit from sweeping changes in attitudes to women's **rights**.

* It has been moved with the intention of showing this Parliament and the Australian people that the Leader of the Country Party was fighting, not for his personal **rights** but for the Country Party to be accorded its proper status in this House.

* Will he give a specific answer as to whether the Commonwealth Industrial Court recently ruled that section 141 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act makes it lawful for a union executive to carry a resolution containing an erroneous expression of legal opinion as to a members **rights** to petition for a controlled election in his union and that no remedy would be available under the Act until an implied threat became  a  reality.

* I think we should keep this very much in mind when Government supporters talk about how they defend the **rights** of the lower income and middle income groups.

* So do not let this Government say that it is the defender of the **rights** of the migrants any more, because in fact it is working against the migrants.

* Because of this (and the existing **rights** to retire on full pension at age 60) the Commonwealth may feel obliged to provide again for full benefits at age sixty.

* But 1 have always come up against a brick wall for the simple reason that the States have what they called sovereign **rights**.

* Whilst they have these sovereign **rights** they will not do anything that will result in some of their land being taken away from within their authority.

* In regard to Chowilla the former Minister for National Development,  Mr Fairbairn,  said in this House on 25th September 1969: 
During my remarks I have mentioned the sovereign **rights** of the States and the fact that they will not agree to the establishment of a Murray valley authority.

* He, of course, has had no voting **rights**.

* The amendment before the House formalises this arrangement and gives the  President  of the Students Association voting **rights**, lt does this by making him an ex officio member of the Council.

* The general Insurance Act gives **rights** of appeal to the Tribunal.

* The former Government at no time expressed itself as being opposed to the provision of voting **rights** for the 18, 19 and 20-year-olds.

* Although the franchise age issue could have been dealt with separately, a variety of other legal issues surrounding the **rights** of 18, 19 and 20-year-olds needed the closest scrutiny.

* These and other trends have made migrants particularly vulnerable as they are the persons most readily affected by economic recession yet least able to defend their interests and **rights** at such times.

* Is there a future for many of the innovative programs started during Labor's term of office- programs under the Department of Social Security such as welfare **rights**, the Outreach program, telephone interpreter services and so on?

* Perhaps ethnic radio could assist migrants with information about their **rights** and entitlements and in finding jobs.

* I think more and more that the task we will face in government is somehow or other to protect the **rights** of the individual in a society where the ordinary people- the little people if I could use that phrase- tend to become submerged.

* The **rights** of the smaller people, people with very specific problems such as the migrants are submerged.

* Of course there are some people in this situation who can really act with less than proper concern for the **rights** of the people to whom their administration is directed.

* I am simply concerned at the concept of bigness, at the **rights** of the individual, and that we need to be constantly on our guard.

* I do not want to debate the **rights** or the wrongs of this principle or the way in which we may try to stabilise land prices.

* A recent example of this is the grant of $2m to the States to operate their legal aid systems and to allow people to exercise their legal **rights** whether those **rights** come from this Parliament or the State Parliament.

* The creation of the Legal Aid Office which will depend upon the services of salaried legal officers will also allow people to take full advantage of their legal **rights**.

* I refer also to the fiat that was given to enable citizens of Canberra to use legal **rights** that they might not otherwise have been able to use in the legal challenge in the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory concerning the tower on Black Mountain.

* This case is another typical example of the attitude of the Government to the people being given legal **rights** and being allowed to exercise them.

* In the field of human **rights**, or civil liberties if honourable members wish to call it that, the International Labour Organisation conventions on human **rights**, race and discrimination have been ratified.

* We should be concerned with the United Nations declaration on the **rights** of a child, which is set out in the amendment, and which states: 
Working mothers in this community are not receiving much assistance at the moment.

* If there were adequate provision for maternity leave and accrued **rights** in this regard it would assist the working mother.

* It is indicative of the Government's intentions that its concentration is on those 2 big cities which certainly have **rights** and which certainly need assistance but not at the expense of the rest of the country.

* This will cut out the ambitions and the **rights** of many other regions, including rural areas and the cities and towns in Australia, which rightly are looking for some assistance in regional development.

* Yet the honourable member made great play of the fact that somebody was ignoring the **rights** of individual members.

* He seemed to suggest that as it was only a requirement to have a ballot, that in some way ignored the **rights** of rank and file members of unions.

* A lot has been said about State **rights**.

* I would make the comment that all 3 States have surrendered mutually some **rights** to the Commission.

* I would think that there would be then some very interesting legal problems involving this question of State **rights**.

* Is it not about time that we recognised his right as well as the **rights** of white collar workers who have had a reduced working week for decades?

* Clearly the Minister is wild because the Aboriginal people are standing up for their **rights** and at this stage will not allow his Government to mine uranium on their land.

* The circular states that no **rights** of tenancy are created by residents in the particular village or aged persons home.

* We ought to be telling them that they have full **rights** of tenancy unless they become unsuitable as tenants; unless their behaviour or health makes them incompatible with the best interests of the other people who live in the aged persons home or village.

* At Federation, the citizens of the Northern Territory, as residents of the State of South Australia, enjoyed the same political **rights** as other Commonwealth citizens.

* Because of the requirements of the Constitution, those political **rights** were removed in 1910 when the Territory was transferred from South Australia and accorded the status of a Commonwealth Territory.

* In a very real sense, the constitutional history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the Territory to regain the **rights** which they lost in 1910.

* It wants to find the right, sensible balance between the proper **rights** and interests of broadcasters to answer claims which might be made about their performance and the interests of the public in ensuring that this country has better television and that the publichas a proper voice.

* I speak for those men and I am here to fight for them and for their **rights**.

* The whole meaning of the present phoney war about State **rights** is the protection of private affluence and the perpetuation of public squalor.

* As indicated in my Speech of 13th April 1972, the Social Services Act provides that the residence qualification for portable pension **rights** is 20 years after reaching the age of 16 years.

* Forget about justice and forget about the people's **rights**.

* A person like John Singleton and all his mates can march up to a political party and say: 'If you want to win this election this is the way to do it: Forget about telling someone for 10 minutes that you have a good policy on a peace zone in the Indian Ocean or that you support equal **rights** for women because that is not the way in which to win votes'.

* Originally it was intended that that should not be a political House and that it should be purely a House of State representatives to guard the **rights** of the States.

* For that reason it was intended that that House should be purely a States **rights** House with equal representation for the States- ten each, as it is today- irrespective of the population of each State.

* I should like to remind him that this is a House of Parliament democratically elected and by this tactic the Government is denying the **rights** of every member of this House, including the 17 new ones, to talk about an issue that affects every Australian now living and every Australian to be born.

* Human nature being what it is, as soon as the **rights** of a professional man to practise in a free competitive society is taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, and the exploration of the perplexing problems of mankind will not be forthcoming and we all will be reduced to the level of mediocrity - 
The Lands Acquisition Act provides that all acquisitions carried out by the Commonwealth shall be on just terms, in line with the provisions of the Constitution.

* All owners of property should have the same **rights** and the same obligations when the Commonwealth acquires their land.

* The Act contains provisions safeguarding owners' **rights**.

* Formal processes are laid down for notifying owners of intended acquisition and of the **rights** and obligations after land has been acquired.

* The Act also lays down the right to faircompensation, **rights** to arbitration and to assessment of compensation by the courts in cases of disagreement.

* The Government is determined to ensure that the Aboriginal citizens of this country will achieve land **rights**.

* The Government acknowledges that the common law which was planted from England into the Australian colonies did not give proper **rights** to the Aboriginal inhabitants.

* They did not have land **rights** as individuals.

* So that meant they had no land **rights**.

* The Australian Government is committed by a long-standing plank in its Party platform as well as by policy speeches I have made at successive elections to see that the Aboriginal people of Australia do get land **rights**.

* I look forward to the day when, regardless of which party is in office, the Northern Territory assumes its own full State **rights** and becomes the 7th State of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* The discussions over which I presided in a period of less than 2 years have borne fruit and on 25th October I felt that we had reached the stage when the time was not too far off when we would be able to salute the people of the Territory as people with the same State **rights** as those in the other States of the Commonwealth.

* This final provision followed directly on the recommendation made in paragraph 740 by  Mr Justice  Woodward, where he stated: 
The 1978 amendments deny the ordinary industrial **rights** of workers and the unions associated with the mining, handling and transportation of uranium.

* This Act, which you supported,  Mr Deputy Speaker  denies basic civil **rights** to people who hinder uranium mining in any way.

* He did all this under the guise of States' **rights**.

* I do not say that they should never be made on reserves because it may be that, in cases where mineral **rights** have already been given, for example at Magellan and at Nabarlek, the reservations to the Crown should, of course, remain.

* It seems to me that it would be reasonable to give to the Aboriginals the normal mineral **rights**, with the exceptions of those areas in which some kind of mineral tenure is conceded already.

* Old titles in most of the Australian States did carry mineral **rights**.

* Old titles in the Northern Territory, when it was under South Australian administration and some freehold was given, carried mineral **rights**.

* Members of the left of the Labor Party seem to be taking publicly a position which is dictated by governments of communist persuasion at present and, regrettably, does not assert either Australia 's interest, or the **rights** of the individuals of the countries concerned to the degree that we believe necessary.

* It is a resolution to suspend Israel's voting **rights** and World Health Organisation services to Israel.

* 1 presume that these are details which can be fixed in the agreement and are part of the **rights** and responsibility of the State to introduce to the Commonwealth Government as part of the agreement between those 2 parties.

* It deals not only with the incorporation of companies, but also with the **rights**,  inter se,  of their shareholders and with the liquidation of companies.

* Among other changes provided for in the Bill are: Firstly, the circumstances in which remedies are available to minority interests are widened and extended to debenture holders; secondly, a share in a company which is held in trust for that company will not carry voting **rights**; thirdly, a company will be required to keep a register of options to acquire securities in a company; fourthly, a company will be required to keep a register which will enable a check to be made on multiple directorships.

* In essence, a company may not deduct against income of a year a business loss incurred in a prior year unless throughout both years either the same persons beneficially owned more than 50 per cent of shareholders' dividend, voting and capital **rights**, or the company carried on the same business after a disqualifying change in shareholdings as it carried on before the change.

* In the last 2 weeks it has been brought to the attention of this chamber that an Eastern European diplomat had the courage of his convictions to go to an Australian embassy and ask for political asylum and that this Government which is prepared to stand up in the United Nations and talk about the freedom of the individual and the need for political asylum, refused that man his individual **rights**.

* The same Government is the first one to stand up and say that it stands for the **rights** of the individual, that it is a government which believes that all nations must base their policies on the principle of independence, and that it is a government which says that all nations must be free and equal; yet when one man had the courage to come forward and ask for its help the Government turned him away at the door.

* They arose from the desire to protect the **rights** of workers moving between these countries.

* It does not care about the sovereign **rights** of the States and shows its lack of care by not doing anything meaningful and significant to overcome those huge cost increases with regard to the total debt of the States and the total debt per head of population in the various States.

* The States have **rights** under the Constitution; but those **rights** can be torpedoed and sabotaged by a hostile centralised government which does not recognise the particular position of the States in a co-operative operative federalist system.

* But there are many of us who are concerned about the **rights** and the liberties of the people of Canberra.

* There is no single piece of legislation that deals with the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people that is as important as this legislation.

* I then went on to discuss a number of myths about the Senate, the suggestion for example that it really is distinctively useful as a House of review; that it can realistically be looked to for protection of the **rights** of the States; that a multiparty rather than a 2-party Senate is desirable in principle despite the minority balance of power situations to which it lends itself.

* The clause allows regulations to be made which will shackle the **rights** of the police to organise into associations which are in their best interests and which protect the future of their total membership.

* This question, with the related matter of ensuring that the **rights** of suspects and accused are not abused by police, is matched in importance only by the question of accountability of the police force to the Minister.

* the creation of **rights** of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline, demotions, retirements and dismissals: 
No.

* If you,  Mr Speaker,  would preserve - as 1 know it is your aim to do - the **rights** of the House and of all members of Parliament you should have told the Prime Minister when he mistakenly moved this as an amendment that it is of course a separate proposition and that if he wished to move it he should do so later as a separate motion.

* In the life of a parliament there will always be times when disorder may be the only means of preserving the **rights** and order which should prevail in the Parliament.

* Once an opposition believes, rightly or wrongly, that the Government is abusing the forms of the House, preventing the proper conduct of the proceedings of the House, and denying the Opposition the opportunities which it should have, then it becomes obligatory upon the Opposition, if Parliamentary **rights** and procedures are to be preserved, for it to use every means in its power to make it plain to the Government that those tactics will not succeed.

* During that time there was much argument and play about whether the Northern Territory had full voting **rights** in this House.

* After voting **rights** had been granted the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  put a Bill like this on the notice paper.

* Whether he thought anything of the Northern Territory or the people in it I would not know, but certainly I would say from the way his Government is acting towards the Northern Territory at this moment that he and his Ministers think nothing whatsoever of the people in the 
And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* I refer to the relative level of profits and wages in the community and the relative **rights** of industry to the measure of profit which should be returned to it.

* In regard to this issue we can well understand the Minister's concern to guarantee that those citizens are able to maintain the **rights** which by custom and usage they have had for many years.

* It has been suggested- I think it is probably not disputed- that the Torres Strait Islanders as a matter of custom, usage and existing **rights** have access to those islands for their resources.

* As I said on 1 1 May, we do not want to see any unnecessary political interference on the basis that somebody else has any **rights** in this matter.

* Another cause for concern with the arts under this Government is the abolition of the Australian authors fund and a totally inadequate Budget allocation this year of less than $700,000 for the public lending **rights** scheme, the rates for which were set in 1973.

* Everyone concerned with an equitable distribution of income from the publication of original Australian fiction, prose and poetry must wonder who will look after public lending **rights** and what sort of budget will be made available for this very worthy form of arts assistance in the Budget allocation for 1977-78.

* With no one to speak up for it and only the Prime Minister's word that adequate funding of the scheme will continue, the public lending **rights** grants to authors and publishers may soon wither and die.

* 1 have asked the Government on a number of occasions in this Parliament to make a statement on the future of Commonwealth employees in the aircraft industry guaranteeing their accrued **rights**.

* This was done in the case of Bell Bay in Tasmania and there is no reason why it could not be done in the case of the Government Aircraft Factories so that the senior personnel in the industry could rest assured that their accrued **rights** for superannuation and other benefits, to which their service entitles them, would be protected should the industry be rationalised or should a merger take place whereby it would no longer be a government operation.

* So, when people talk about consulting the States and protecting State **rights**, I would have thought that the pre-school education and child minding area was very specifically one for the States; but in cases in which it suited the former government it had no compunction at all in excluding the States from its legislation.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has referred to the problem which we see in relation to clause 10 sub-clause (3) of the Bill which seems to indicate that, in relation to the value of exports coming from the sale of industrial property **rights** or eligible know-how, if the amount is $10,000 someone would be eligible for consideration of a grant But the point is that the clause says now that the whole of those earnings must be from the sale of industrial property **rights** or eligible know-how.

* As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pointed out, this puts a person who has extra export earnings from another source in a particular difficulty if the total export earnings lie between $10,000 and $25,000 and may make that person ineligible even though he has $10,000 worth of export earnings coming from the sale of industrial property **rights** or eligible know-how.

* A committee system of this nature would not restrict the **rights** of members to debate legislation.

* But the matter put to me by the honourable member for Herbert does not involve prerogative; it involves **rights**.

* The Government stands for **rights**.

* I should like to see more **rights** as against discretion put into this legislation as quickly as it is reasonable to do.

* It is possible - let me be frank with the House because I do not think honourable members will take advantage of my frankness- 
Service regulations allow Service personnel to undertake pan time employment in off-duty hours or during leave periods as Service members are considered to have the same **rights** as other citizens to seek supplementary employment.

* He put forward this week the outline of a manpower policy and, above all, he has put forward a scheme which is designed to train trade union officials at all levels so that they may exercise their power with responsibility and skill, and with the motive of ensuring that the **rights** of employees shall be protected and the **rights** of the community will not be harmed.

* The non-IATA BOAC company has arranged landing **rights** in certain countries.

* The doctor may ask for the patient's drawing **rights** on the fund and the patient has to agree to transfer them.

* The real position as far as this encroachment on the doctors' **rights** is concerned is that there are 3 ways in which the scheme will operate: The patient may pay the doctor and receive a refund on receipt; the patient may forward the unpaid account to Medibank and receive a cheque made out to the doctor; or the doctor may directly bill Medibank after accepting assignment of the drawing **rights** from the patient.

* Since the population of the Territory was then small, the member so chosen was not granted full voting **rights** at that time.

* For most of the period since 1948, the people of Canberra were very ably represented by the late Jim Fraser and, as a result of his agitation, the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting **rights** in this House as from 1967.

* The Australian Government naturally would regret any move to inhibit the **rights** and freedoms of individuals anywhere in the world.

* The particular sources of concern with the proposals, which I am advised did become law on 14 February of this year are, firstly, the description of Poland as a 'socialist state'; secondly, a reference to the Polish United Workers Partythat is, of course, the Communist Party- as the leading political force in the country; thirdly, a reference to Poland's alliance with the Soviet Union; and, fourthly, a clause that would have made citizens' **rights** contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state.

* Finally, referring to the last point of the specific changes that I mentioned, namely, the clause that would make citizens' **rights** contingent upon their fulfilling duties towards the state, I should say that I understand that in Poland there continues to be vocal opposition to the law as there does elsewhere in the world by Polish citizens.

* The Australian Government naturally would regret any move to inhibit the **rights** and freedoms of Polish citizens.

* The debate on the Bills to be dealt with next week will bring the whole matter into the forefront of what we are about in this country when we are talking about civil **rights** of people, their **rights** of privacy and their right to be protected against malicious prosecution.

* If ever there was a Bill which protected the **rights** of incumbent members of the Australian Federal Police Force it is this Bill.

* The honourable member talks as if he had not read the Bill when he talks about the creation of **rights** of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline demotions, retirements and dismissals.

* Because the honourable member - 
I refer also to appeals and the protection of the **rights** of existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force.

* Firstly, the current position is that the appeal **rights** in respect to existing members of the Commonwealth Police Force and the Australian Capital Territory Police Force are laid down in regulations.

* I believe that the **rights** of members were protected.

* Article 1, section 3 of the United Nations Charter states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote and encourage respect for human **rights** and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* The regulations had to be consistent with the powers conferred on the statutory body and at all times the **rights** of individuals had to be protected.

* I believe that a review of the exercise of administrative discretions by public servants is in the public interest and in the interests of the **rights** of individuals.

* Queensland Government or the Australian Sugar Board by allowing large surpluses of cane to be destroyed - to be ploughed in at the end of this year - the Opposition would have no hesitation in seeing that this matter was raised in the United Nations because this destruction of food would infringe the basic **rights** and principles of every civilised nation.

* Therefore, while it is within the permissible **rights** of the Australian Government to allow for stocks up to 450,000 tons, there is no case for the destruction of sugar in Australia.

* Nothing will convince me that in testing the manufacturers observe the speed limits of that State or respect the **rights** of the other road users.

* For example, the **rights** of unsuccessful appellants to seek reopening of their cases by presentation of further evidence and the right of appellants to have access to information in the records relating to their case were inserted in the 1929 Act.

* While incorporating these present day principles for the review of administrative decisions, the Bill seeks to retain the best elements of the existing system- in particular those elements which confer upon applicants special **rights** and privileges.

* The Tribunal will be empowered to hear and dispose of those applications without the need for the applicant himself to take any action to preserve his **rights**.

* But I also emphasise that the essential principles of the repatriation appeals system- those that have protected appellants and conferred upon them **rights** to ensure that every opportunity is given to them to achieve justice- are being retained.

* Its basic purpose is to codify and clarify the **rights** and duties of citizens and the Commonwealth Police, when involved in the process of criminal investigation.

* It is part of a comprehensive review of the laws of the Commonwealth which closely touch the human **rights** of the people of Australia.

* In the life of this Parliament important steps have already been taken or foreshadowed which protect and advance human **rights** and it is appropriate to refer to but a few.

* References have been given by me to the Law Reform Commission upon a number of matters which are vital to the human **rights** of all Australians.

* In  Her  Majesty's Speech this month it was announced that the Government intended to establish a human **rights** commission.

* The aim of the legislation will be to give effective machinery on a national basis to protect and advance human **rights** in this country.

* These steps reflect the Government's concern with the **rights** of the individual and the need to update the law and legal protective machinery so that these **rights** can be asserted in the present age.

* The Bill is especially relevant for the Government's stated intention to establish a human **rights** commission, a basic purpose of which will be to ensure that our federal law complies with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

* The International Covenant is itself part of an international movement to protect human **rights**, which originated after the Second World War and was foreshadowed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights agreed upon early in the life of the United Nations Organisation.

* It is therefore natural and entirely to be expected that the International Covenant refers to the **rights** of a person in this circumstance.

* It represents the standard which civilised communities around the world agree should govern the civil and political **rights** of their people.

* We should not, therefore, underestimate too readily the **rights** which our own system already guarantees.

* This Bill must therefore be seen in the context both of the important initiatives taken by the Government in Australia to advance and protect human **rights** and against the background of the International Covenant.

* Basic human **rights** should not be left in vague general terms.

* In its preparation, an endeavour has been made to strike a balance between the community's needs for effective law enforcement and the need to preserve and respect basic human **rights**.

* At the same time the basic **rights** and freedoms of the individual citizens in our democracy must be preserved.

* To ensure that, in the interrogation of persons suspected of committing an offence, the **rights** of the suspect are not infringed and to reduce to the minimum disputes as to the accuracy of records of such interviews, provisions will be made requiring that such interviews be tape recorded or be conducted in the presence of an independent third party and reduced to writing or, if neither of these courses is practicable in the particular circumstances, a written record of the interview be verified by an independent third party as soon as possible after it is made.

* However, the Government believes that it must protect the **rights** of contribu- torsinthehealthinsuranceorganisations.Ithas re-introduced this Bill to make sure that the **rights** of the people are protected.

* It is always so odd that we hear so much about protecting the **rights** of the States.

* We do not hear very much from the Opposition about the protection of the **rights** of the people.

* I did not and I do not believe that State **rights** are in any way nearly as important as people 's **rights**.

* Who will protect the contributors' **rights**- the people's **rights**- if it is not the Australian Government, which also contributes to the health organisations and keeps them going?

* He would be happy only if the mineral **rights**, whatever they are, also were acquired and taken away from the State Government.

* The whole concept of the valuation of land acquired by the Crown, in right of the Commonwealth, in this country is that the mineral **rights** are left in the hands of the States.

* That would be not only in regard to this place - 
This Bill has two main purposes: To establish a Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission to operate in conjunction with State and Territorial Legal Aid Commissions; and to provide for the preservation of the **rights** of staff of the Australian Legal Aid Office who transfer to State and territorial commissions.

* Thus Part IV of the Bill seeks to preserve the **rights** of ALAO staff who transfer to State and territorial commissions.

* It does this in 2 ways: Firstly, by requiring certain minimum terms and conditions to be included in any arrangement for the transfer of ALAO staff; and, secondly, by applying the second tier of the revised officers' **rights** declaration scheme to staff transferred.

* The terms and conditions that, under Part IV, must be included in any such arrangement are the basic **rights** to present salary, leave and superannuation entitlements.

* These are minimum conditions only and, in discussions with staff associations and the States, the Commonwealth will be seeking to have included in any arrangement the preservation of various other **rights** such as those dealing with allowances, increments and probationary service.

* Under part IV, ALAO staff transferred may seek transfer to or promotion in the Australian Public 
If the Prime Minister considers it is right to make certain ministerial changes affecting his Cabinet ranks, and if the Liberal Party considers that to be within its God-given **rights**, fair enough.

* If women continue to exercise their legal **rights** to have abortions and some find that they cannot afford their own doctor or a private hospital without the assistance of the scheduled Commonwealth medical benefits, then, as many speakers have said, including the mover of the motion, they would have access to a public hospital.

* I am fearful of the infringements to the civil **rights**, liberties and freedoms of the Australian people that have been upheld since federation.

* Australians, many of whom fought in these wars to overthrow fascist regimes and to protect the **rights** and freedoms of the individual, are now being placed in an insidious position of having to look at the prospect of a new form of fascism in their own backyards of clean, respected Australia.

* I suggest that the Joint Committee of the two Houses of this Parliament that will shortly examine this subject should look with care and with a view to obtaining some guidance, at the system used in the Canadian Parliament where the **rights** and privileges belong to both Houses.

* Therefore, the sooner we establish our **rights** granted and guaranteed to us in the Constitution, the better will be our relations with the media and the better will be our relations with the public outside.

* These proposed laws do not deal with the **rights** of political parties; they deal with the **rights** of our people.

* Their representatives in this chamber have full voting **rights** along with all the other members who meet in it.

* At the instance of the Government the people of the Australian Capital Territory now have 2 members in the House of Representatives enjoying full voting **rights**.

* He tended to create the impression first of all that the Australian Labor Party was concerned with the **rights** and needs of all forms of education but fell into the trap once again of using the wealth of particular schools as a weapon to push his Party's own sense of a needs policy.

* When one looks at the principles involved in education it is always wise and appropriate to look a little into history to see the wriggling of the Opposition over its understanding and comments on the **rights** of all children to educational grants.

* There were no fundamental **rights** recognised here.

* It developed the new note of denying basic **rights**.

* But it is too clear to see if you deny basic **rights** so they developed a new policy of saying: 'We are in favour of assistance to all children but, of course, the assistance will be on the basis of needs'.

* The alienated comfortable who have become the new avant-garde of the Labor Party have adopted a most sophisticated form of supporting the principles of flat denial operative during the 1950s and 1960s because these principles are an effective denial of **rights** and, unfortunately, it amounts to an effective denial of the **rights** of children at all schools in Australia.

* All children have **rights**.

* The best way to observe those **rights** as applicable to all students is not to place a false and an unwieldy needs test upon children.

* If you apply a needs test you do not basically observe **rights**.

* They propose all kinds of incredible family proposals at all levels but the only area in which they would make divisions and in which they promote division is in the **rights** of children at all schools within Australia.

* It is not a recognition of the **rights** of all, but a little soporific thrown out for each interest group in order to cause division.

* The challenges that I make to the Opposition, and which I invite the Opposition to answer, are these: Will it affirm that all children should have **rights** in education - even the children of the honourable member for Hindmarsh?

* But to refer to Tasmania for a moment, I am well aware of the problem which the honourable member for Dennison  (Dr Solomon)  has raised concerning apple processing and a glut of particular types of bulk apple products in Australia, but I remind the honourable member that if he can talk about Tasmania having certain **rights** in Australia with regard to apples I can talk about Victoria having a certain right in Australia with regard to pears.

* The alternative is that the Government is composed of knaves because it is indulging in action which will bring about in this country an industrial confrontation which simply must occur if the unions are to preserve their **rights** to act collectively and to take any form of industrial action.

* Notwithstanding that everyone is agreed that the High Court should be relieved of part of its existing original and appellate jurisdiction, that proposal has perished on the rock of State **rights**.

* If we are talking about something which is a specifically academic issue, I would find it abhorrent - I notice with some slight pleasure that the Minister has agreed with me - and I would say that it was quite unethical and a transgression of the **rights** of the University if we were to join issue on a specifically academic matter.

* But it seems to me that, given the goodwill of the operators - and that is almost to be expected in a situation such as this - this structure is not one which is inimical to the **rights** of the undergraduates.

* When the employees stand up for their **rights**, their insistence that this should not happen, they then have to suffer a scurrilous attack in this House by 2 people who would not even know what a trade union movement is.

* It is on that basis again that we can give some safeguard to the people who elect all of us, to whom we are answerable and to whom we must guarantee that their **rights** have not unnecessarily been infringed or invaded.

* The knowledge that there will be a judicial audit will act as a sanction and guarantee that those people will not violate any of the **rights** of the citizens of this country.

* I believe that the sessional orders have been so framed that matters that affect the **rights** of any individual may continue to be debated by a Minister speaking after 1 1 o'clock, in accordance with the sessional orders.

* I know that honourable members opposite always seem to defend the socalled **rights** of people who own the land involved.

* Measures are being taken to secure the **rights** of those living in Commonwealth territories.

* The implementation of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation is proceeding and my Government will continue to revue the effectiveness of government programs for Aboriginals.

* To the people of Australia I recall the paragraph of the Speech concerning securing the **rights** of those living in Commonwealth territories'.

* They enjoy the same opportunities, **rights** and privileges as does any member of this House, but with one difference.

* The suspension of Standing Orders is designed to deny us on this side of the Parliament an opportunity even to identify the way by which this Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill will destroy the **rights** of the States and will destroy the **rights** of the individual.

* All that the Government is doing is postponing the day when this Parliament can consider the Appropriation Bills, upon which so much of the future and so much of the **rights** of the Australian people must hinge.

* The Government believes that it would be retrogressive to deprive workers of the **rights** already existing under compensation law to receive payment from the first week in respect of injuries arising at work.

* State **rights** are concerned.

* They keep suggesting that it is an intrusion of State **rights** for the Commonwealth to enter this field at all.

* The centralism bogy with its anachronistic calls to the worst and most divisive features of the old States' **rights** argument is something which we can well do without.

* The Government does not accord similar **rights** to members such as the honourable member for Perth who, as he said earlier tonight, represents 100,000 people.

* An opposition it quite within its **rights** to oppose - indeed, it would be failing in the exercise of its proper function as an opposition if it did not strenuously oppose with every means in its power within the Standing Orders of this Parliament - legislation with which it did not agree.

* What representations have been made using these contacts to further democratic procedures and respect for human **rights** in these countries and to foster international discussions and cultural exchanges with them?

* The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights covers a wide range of **rights** which have been drawn up in very broad terms.

* The **rights** in these 2 Covenants are being considered together and as a whole.

* We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to affirm faith in fundamental human **rights**, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal **rights** of men and women and of nations large and small.

* At the same time, equality of political **rights** is inherent in a truly democratic State .

* Equality of political **rights** may mean that strictly and mathematically there is a variation which will upset the purists, that the Parliament will be better and stronger because representation is given to those areas and, indeed, to those States which are entitled to a base representation which should not, under any formula, be subject to reduction.

* These conditions related to proliferation, terrorism, safeguards in relation to nuclear weapons, the existence of proven safe ways of disposal and/or storage of radioactive wastes, environmental concerns and the **rights** of Aborigines.

* The emphasis is to the effect that safeguards are effective, that the problems of disposal have been solved, that the environment is safeguarded and that the **rights** of Aborigines are protected.

* Firstly, one of the first things that the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  said when he was elected to office was that he would pay regard to and add to the **rights** of private members.

* He has immediately cut down on question time, which is one of the few **rights** that private members have.

* I believe that the only way to protect the - **rights** of a private member is to incorporate in the Standing Orders a period of 45 minutes for question time.

* The term 'disarmament' is most usefully seen as shorthand for 'disarmament and arms control', and covering a wide range of activities which could be put under these six headings: Firstly, the negotiations between the superpowers to control nuclear armaments and otherwise limit or control the development of the strategic environment or particular weapon systems; secondly, the discussions in international organisations, particularly at the United Nations, among wider groups of countries to seek the elimination, or ban the use of, particular categories of weapons; thirdly, the diplomatic conferences sponsored by the International Committee of the Red Cross to improve international law relating to humanitarian **rights** in armed conflict; fourthly, the various activities underway to prevent the diversion of nuclear material to military or explosive use; fifthly, regional negotiations to secure limitations to or a reduction of force levels, or to establish procedures for war avoidance; and finally, unilateral actions by countries to shape their defence forces and their diplomatic posture to diminish the prospects of conflict and enable reallocation of national resources in their region to social purposes rather than military expenditure.

* The Minister's explicit policy towards human **rights** issues as set out in his annual foreign policy statement on 9 May 1978 is that these issues should be discussed in the United Nations and not elsewhere.

* The Opposition does not want to see the Minister embarrassed at the United Nations, but if people start to agitate in this country- as they are- against the deprival of their human **rights**, he is going to be so embarrassed.

* The Government's policy is summed up by my honourable friend the Minister for Defence and by the Prime Minister - this has consistently been the case - as being to strive for, to seek and to find those means in the world that will enable countries to have their independence, to maintain their national integrity, and to ensure that the inviolability of human **rights** is held in honour.

* But, taken together, they deal with the need to make an early start on the mining and development of our uranium resources, whilst at the same time ensuring adequate protection of the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region, protection of the **rights** and legitimate interests of the Aborigines in the region, protection of the safety of persons engaged in the uranium industry, and the development of adequate safeguards to prevent proliferation of the nuclear armament industry.

* We in this Parliament have a responsibility to Australia and the rest of the world to develop our uranium resources as speedily as possible, subject, of course, to essential safeguard provisions, reasonable environmental and safety considerations and the **rights** and interests of the Aboriginal and other inhabitants of the areas where the reserves are located.

* The first question is this: Should we as an Australian nation, a major contributor to and supporter of the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Development Fund, place a human **rights** tag on our commitment, which this year is worth $96.8m?

* To do otherwise would be to support financially national administrations whose policies are directed against the recognition of basic human **rights**.

* I believe it is perfectly proper that the Australian nation and, indeed, the Parliament representing the people of Australia, should bring to bear all means at our disposal to bring about an appreciation of and a respect for basic human **rights** in our Asian neighbours.

* The Wilson Government, to its eternal credit, altered the law again after the  Rookes v. Barnard  decision, to restore the **rights** of unions to use the boycott and the strike weapon to get a fair crack of the whip in an adversary situation with employers.

* When it was put by one of your own Ministers at the Premiers' Conference that we should legislate in this field to protect human **rights**, Bjelke-Petersen said 'I won't have a bar of it.'

* People are gaoled throughout the length and breadth of Queensland for seeking to exercise the **rights** you loudly proclaim in the United Nations.

* When we speak of the need for the protection of human **rights** in Australia, we are speaking about enshrining minimum **rights**- minimum democratic **rights**, minimum legal process **rights**, minimum prohibition of anti-discrimination, minimum **rights** of freedom of speech, thought and religion and freedom of assembly and association, and you have not got it in Queensland.

* Parliaments may add to and expand these **rights**, but they should not subtract from them.

* The Minister said in his statement that 'the Government is concerned about infringements of human **rights** wherever they occur'.

* He said, in relation to human **rights** under State laws: 
I notice the Minister is silent.

* In other words, the Prime Minister was saying that States **rights** are more important than human **rights**.

* It is of great regret that human **rights** have increasingly been suppressed around the world and particularly in our own neighbourhood.

* The plain established fact is that Indonesia has engaged in a gross and consistent violations of human **rights** in Timor which ought not to have been condoned as they have been.

* The refugee question is related to human **rights**.

* For example, the Fraser Government is out of step with the United States on human **rights**, Indian Ocean arms control, and nuclear nonproliferation policy, to name only three areas where it claims close identity with American policy.

* We have to acknowledge cultural differences with our neighbours, but if we do not maintain a consistent concern for human **rights** in our policies we risk more blatant disregard for human **rights** in neighbouring countries and, we risk, also, a progressive deterioration of and disregard for human **rights** and freedoms in our own country.

* It is nonsense for the Minister for Science to talk about any parallel between the **rights** of government and the roles of government in the Indian acquisition of Goa in the same sentence even as our **rights** and roles with respect to the future of Portuguese Timor.

* I believe that there is an opportunity for the Australian Government in international forums and certainly in regional forums to ensure that this whole matter is canvassed, that there are discussions not just, as he asserted, in Lisbon, Jakarta, New York and Canberra, but that there are discussions in a public way which will ensure Australia's long term continued interest in the maintenance of the closest and friendliest relations with Indonesia will be preserved and that the future of Timor is settled in such a way as to ensure the maintenance of peace in this region and to ensure that ultimately the **rights** of the people of Timor are not denied.

* Certainly their **rights** to operate are protected in that in Part IX they are allowed the right of appeal to a tribunal should their application to the registrar be not approved, but what redress do they have against travel operators who are not agents?

* Why can they not be allowed to put up a relay station to enable the people in the more remote areas to receive the **rights** that those in the city areas already have?

* To safeguard the **rights** and promote the interests of parents and children in the field of education in Australia, and in particular the **rights** and interests of parents availing or wishing to avail themselves of the services of non-government schools for their children.

* But if it is true - and the honourable member for Scullin apparently feels it to be so - it is important to see in what way members of Parliament can protect their **rights**.

* If the honourable member for Scullin believes, as he apparently does, that there is an erosion already of the **rights** of members of this Parliament, how little it becomes him now to support a measure that will restrict those **rights**.

* What I have related is just an example of what has been frequently pointed out- that overseas born residents are often ignorant of their **rights** in and the resources of the Australian community.

* All we are doing here is asking the Schools Commission to take into account the **rights** of parents.

* Further, the Commission shall have regard to Article 26 of the United Nations Charter on human **rights**, a copy of which is set out hereunder: 
Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* It relates to their determination with respect to **rights** of entry and with respect to who shall reside on the reserves in Queensland.

* In that clause is a declara tion that the sovereign **rights** of Australia as a coastal State in respect of the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources are vested in and exercisable by the crown in the right of the Commonwealth.

* There will be no courtesy in the future activities of the Government in relation to asserting the sovereign **rights** of the Australian people.

* Unlike those established groups, people generally have great difficulty in establishing their **rights** and gaining entitlements to which they should justifiably have an opening.

* This is regrettable because the Australian public has certain **rights** and we are here to represent the public.

* The fact still remains that while we recognise the needs of the vast majority, the minority who live around the airport also have **rights**.

* It denies the **rights** of the small men of this community the opportunity to earn a wage which might be reasonably negotiated according to the provisions of the present Constitution.

* We now are talking about traditional land **rights**.

* We are proposing to put the preservation of their traditional **rights** in the hands of Aboriginals whom nominally they will choose themselves but who actually, because they are more articulate and live in Darwin and there is this big overall thing, will be people that they really would not want.

* Proposed new section 14 provides that a grant is not payable unless the amount of the export earnings in the grant year exceeds $25,000 or, if the whole of that amount consists of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property **rights** or eligible know-how, $10,000.

* The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as security of life and limb, all members of society have equal **rights** and claims upon society.

* I believe that it is the duty of this Parliament and of this nation to recognise that for too long in the abortion debate the **rights** of the foetus have been ignored and overlooked by people who were duty bound to uphold those **rights**.

* Whilst I fully recognise the logic and the sincerity of the point of view put by honourable members who have taken in this debate a view different from my own, the **rights** of the mother should be considered.

* Today's vote in this Parliament is the first step to restoring here and now in the national Parliament some of the real values of human life, of saying to the community that we stand for those who have the **rights** to live.

* We all know that quite apart from reason and consultation, the processes of conciliation have to be backed on occasions by the force of law to protect the **rights** of individual working men and women of Australia and to protect the **rights** of all citizens in this country against the predatory actions of some union leaders in some circumstances.

* I believe that is a measure that significantly protects the **rights** of certain Australian individuals.

* The recent use of section  45d  was a classic example of the way in which that provision is used by an employer to protect the **rights** of his own employees.

* Therefore the action under section 45d was encompassed to protect the **rights** of a number of Aus.tralian working people.

* And that this procedure providing for selection by a method of chance is an unfair and arbitrary imposition on the human **rights** of a minority and discriminates against certain of the young male persons in the community in favour of others solely by reason of their respective dates of birth.

* It is expected that a first report by the Commissioner will make some recommendations on the manner in which the detailed implementation of the Government's Aboriginal land **rights** policy should be worked out, taking into account the desirability of full Aboriginal participation in this process.

* Clause 4 is very important in the process of overcoming union militancy and protecting the **rights** of the average citizen.

* In announcing that decision, the Prime Minister mentioned that the Government would be introducing legislation to enable  Mr Justice  Fox to retain his judicial status and the **rights** which attach to that status while he is AmbassadoratLarge.

* I am sure honourable members will agree that it is appropriate that  His  Honour should retain his pension **rights**.

* The substance of these letters will be that in return for Australia waiving its **rights** under the Trade Agreement, the British Government will be prepared to waive its **rights** under the Trade Agreement to take measures to restore the balance of advantages under the Trade Agreement as it existed immediately prior to the introduction of the levy schemes.

* What must be remembered is that privileges are not the prerogative of members in their personal capacities: Insofar as the House claims and members enjoy those **rights** and immunities which are grouped under the general description of 'privileges', they are claimed and enjoyed by the House in its corporate capacity and by its members on behalf of the citizens whom they represent.

* 129 of Session 1964-65), the committee said - 
In 1701 the House of Commons resolved that 'to print or publish any books or libels, reflecting upon the proceedings of the House of Commons, or any member thereof, for, or in relation to, his service therein, is a high violation of the **rights** and privileges of the House of Commons'.

* For a party that at one stage liked to speak of the privacy of the individual and the **rights** of the individual, the Labor Party has demonstrated anything but a preparedness to comply with those sorts of restraints.

* We want to ensure that they have a say about land **rights**.

* Has the Queensland Government infringed United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions regarding the **rights** of indigenous people in respect of their traditional lands, particularly the right to be consulted?

* He also dealt with the protection of the Aurukun settlement, hunting and fishing **rights** and the honouring of agreements and the enforcement of the law.

* It does not have the effect of giving them land **rights**.

* It has nothing to do with the land **rights** issue.

* The Bill is capable of conceding certain **rights** and prerogatives to communities established under the Queensland Aborigines Act of 1 97 1 .

* They were not struck because of a realisation of the socio-economic need of a substantial proportion of the population; nor were they introduced because of the imperatives of social and economic justice; nor were they introduced because of a humanly inspired sense of moral concern for and obligation towards the **rights** of a very large number of people in the community.

* Specifically a scheme such as this would assist employees in private enterprise, more than 60 per cent of whom are without superannuation **rights**.

* Recompense for injury under workers compensation and under third' party insurance cover is currently subject to important limitations which are derived more from legal technicalities and complexities than from a recognition of the injured party's needs and **rights**.

* In neither case is satisfaction of human needs and personal **rights** a determining factor.

* People's needs and **rights**, following on injury, rather than the sorting out of legal conundrums based on proof of fault, ought to determine the right to compensation benefits.

* In this sort of area it is not a question of States **rights** or the new federalism.

* Therefore, overseas pension **rights** are almost personal property like an insurance policy or any other investment.

* They are different in kind, therefore, from **rights** in Australia which are not tied to personal and individual contributions.

* Secondly, it did nothing to protect the pension **rights** coming from overseas of people who had left their home countries to settle in Australia.

* It does not in any way give us the power to negotiate with other countries in order to protect the pension **rights** accruing from overseas of people who have come to settle permanently in Australia.

* This contempt of the political **rights** of the citizens of the Territories was seen again recently in the opposition to our attempts to obtain Senate representation for the people of these areas - the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.

* The political **rights** of all Australians are diminished while some of our citizens are denied the right of fully participating in the governing of the nation.

* Surely issues such as the **rights** of individuals, or the nature of parliamentary government, are of vital concern to all Australian citizens.

* Their claims were strongly put at the time of the last referendum in 1967 when clearly they felt very deeply, as did all Australians, about the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* The citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory merely seek the same **rights** as other Australians.

* It also will make a start on restoring State **rights** and responsibilities.

* In view of  President  Carter's statement that the 'moral and intellectual poverty' of cold war obsessions had led the United States into Vietnam, does the Government intend to examine its own past mistakes before developing new foreign policies based on  President  Carter's call for a wider concern for human **rights**?

* The idea is that because you are in power you have an absolute right to control the **rights** of the citizens.

* They have no **rights** as citizens.

* We should mobilise enough people at the United Nations to take a good close look and see that the **rights** of the people of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia are protected and that nobody takes away the **rights** of the people of North Vietnam or the **rights** of the people of South Vietnam.

* The Soviet Government has been made aware of the strong feelings in Australia concerning the fundamental human **rights** of the Jewish people in the Soviet Union to emigrate if they so wish.

* The Government will continue to make known its views on the denial of fundamental human **rights**, whether in the USSR or elsewhere, whenever suitable opportunities occur.

* We need ... a greater variety of choice both within and between institutions, associated with an establishment of basic law and human **rights**.

* He said that we have to consider the **rights** of States in international law.

* This legislation is concerned with the **rights** of Australia in relation to this matter and the intrusion of anti-trust laws in the United States of America into what basically is Australia's concern, namely, the price at which we will fix our uranium.

* The honourable member talks about company meetings at which an individual might have **rights** to vote.

* Honourable members on this side of the chamber have been advancing the argument that people can have **rights** to vote but a person who has 1000 shares has no more **rights** in that vote than a person who has one share.

* When we argue here today what the individual **rights** are, that is subservient to the fact that the conciliation and arbitration system is built on the fact that there will be a trade union organisation.

* People are not free to destroy the **rights** and conditions for which men have fought hard over a period of years.

* lt is also necessary to have agreements between these 2 nations that will protect the **rights** of the people of the Torres Straits to live on their own islands, have title to their own land and retain Australian citizenship with all that that means.

* While we must maintain for these people such **rights** as 1 mentioned of retaining their citizenship and living on their islands, we must also consider the **rights** of the people of Papua New Guinea, given that a continuing continental shelf runs between the 2 nations, to some share in the resources of the seabed.

* The Prime Minister said, inter alia, that the Government was 'impressed by the potentialities of the question' - he was referring to the boundary - 'as a source of friction between Australia and an emerging Papua New Guinea', but was also very mindful of the **rights** and interests of the Torres Strait Islanders'; and was therefore proposing 'discussions ... in January between officials of the Papua New Guinea Government, your Government' - that is, the Queensland Government - 'and my Government (including the Office of Aboriginal Affairs)'.

* As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs mentioned in his second reading speech, this Government has appointed  Mr Justice  Woodward to examine the question of land **rights** in the Northern Territory in order to ascertain how in each individual situation, we can best vest these lands in the hands of the Aboriginal people who live in these communities and reserves.

* In view of the record profit of $70m said to have been made in Queensland this year by Utah Mining Australia Limited, in which we have only 10 per cent Australian equity, I ask the Minister: What are the mining **rights** of Utah Mining Australia Limited in the Queensland Bowen Basin?

* It is split on the issue of human **rights**.

* The major motion was that the Russian Government was denying the **rights** and liberties of those of its citizens who wished to exercise their democratic **rights** of free expression and peaceful dissent.

* It cannot even agree on the fundamental issue of human **rights**.

* The people on the Labor side who would put other issues ahead of Aboriginal **rights** are not to my knowledge members of this Parliament, members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly or members of the staffs of those people.

* They do this because they feel that the Parliament is the repository of their **rights** as citizens.

* It is just possible, too, that there are people in the community who are not attached to any of the parties, lt is just possible that they take seriously the fact that the Parliament is the repository, or is supposed to be the repository, of the people's **rights** and so they go past the member, they go past the Party and they go direct to the democratically elected Parliament of the nation sitting as a Parliament - to what has been called the grand constituency of all the people.

* The Opposition wants some reality about the **rights** of petitioners.

* I point out to the honourable member for Oxley and to some other members in this House that the Standing Orders also protect the **rights** of other members.

* It is not a matter of being opposed to the **rights** of the people of Canberra; it is a matter of saying: 'We agree with this but we believe that other people in Australia have equal **rights**'.

* I can appreciate his attitude if he believes that he has certain **rights** in this Parliament.

* He does have those **rights**.

* It is proposed that the Act should be amended to permit the Governor-General to apply the Act to a foreign country where he is satisfied that under the domestic law of that country extradition is provided where reciprocity is offered, and proper safeguards will be made for protection of **rights** for fugitive persons in Australia who might be sought by a foreign country.

* It introduced the Medibank scheme, community health centres, welfare **rights** officers, and translator and interpreter services.

* I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will ask the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  who will be in charge of the Bill, to look at this clause extremely carefully because it questions our **rights** in relation to what we have responsibility for when compared with State **rights**.

* I will support those proposed amendments because of the principles they espouse in relation to State **rights** and responsibilities.

* We of the Country Party oppose at all times any moves by the Labor Government which seek to centralise all power in Canberra and which tend to downgrade the **rights** of the States.

* Yet we have the honourable member for Denison standing up in this chamber as a socalled upholder of the **rights** of Tasmania and in effect arguing against his own State.

* Police have raided the homes of dissidents throughout Poland, confiscating posters and photographs of Pope John Paul II, according to die civil **rights** movement in Warsaw.

* The national Director is to have the right of access to any area in the region and the right to require information, with power to apply to the Supreme Court to enforce his **rights**.

* I think the House should be immensely indebted to the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  for warning us of the consequences involved, if at some time in the future, taking the assumption that this legislation is passed, the Bill comes into form and is an Act, is challenged and it is found that the purported extinguishing and abolition of the common law **rights**, which is postulated in clauses 9 1 and 92 of the Bill, was not validly made.

* We on this side of the House believe that the socialistic approach of the present Government to all aspects of the way of life of the citizens of this country violates the fundamental **rights** and desires of Australians right into the very front door of their home, as this legislation shows.

* -The **rights** of the Utah Mining Company to mine black coal in the Bowen Basin total 300 million tons.

* I told the gentlemen who approached me that the Government would honour to the letter their **rights** to extract 300 million tons and no more.

* The freight rate can be loaded in those operations and then the Commission has no **rights** of investigation, no power under the amendment proposed by the Opposition to issue any direction as to unfair and unreasonable competition.

* One point I mention for the record is that the Labor Government was in fact the Government which took the initiative to set up the commission to investigate matters related to the campaign for Aboriginal land **rights**.

* In a letter to the  Bulletin  dated 20 November 1976 and headed 'Land **rights** hangup'  Mr Eames  had this to say: 
Pastor Paul Albrecht and his missionary colleagues,  Mr Stoll  and  Mr Ziersch,  base their opposition to Aboriginal land **rights** ... on misconceptions and misreadings both of the legislation which has been proposed and the response to it by Aborigines.

* The powerful vested interest groups which also oppose land **rights** have, however, adopted Albrecht 's opinion with great enthusiasm and considerable relief.

* Mr Anderson  suggests that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  should not arbitrate and decide on any matter as important as Aboriginal land **rights** and claims without thorough reference and consultation with Aboriginal leaders.

* Mr Anderson  suggested in a letter published in the  Bulletin  of 13 November that these discussions could take place on the following principles: 
Invoilable legislation setting aside our land and sacred **rights** in certain areas (regardless of whether such land is currently occupied by our people).

* Before I do, I would like to say how sad I am to see the present Government departing so far from the principles and sound practice of the land **rights** Bill introduced by the Whitlam Government into this House in October 1 975.

* Honourable members will be aware that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly wished to control all land **rights** legislation.

* Why does it not listen to the Aboriginal people who know their land **rights** will be summarily dealt with by the NTLA, and who are outraged by what they see to be the Federal Government's betrayal of their interests.

* Finally, I wish to discuss briefly the issue of Aboriginal **rights** to hunt protected wildlife in Aboriginal lands.

* I call on the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  to investigate this situation in which the **rights** and dignity, not to mention the cash, of citizens are being abused.

* Might not a precedent set in the area of tax law be used in future to justify a retrospective change that affected not just pocket-books, but basic civil **rights**?

* In view of the fact that the **rights** and entitlements of claimants were not affected in any way, it was not considered necessary to inform professional social workers or the general public.

* Approximately 97 per cent of the land area in Papua New Guinea is held by the indigenous persons oi communities by virtue of **rights** of a proprietary or possessory kind which belong to individuals or communities and arise from and are regulated by native custom.

* These customary **rights** to land are protected in the laws of the Territory.

* The most important provision in the land legislation protecting these **rights** provides that only the Administration can purchase or lease land from the native people.

* It is time Australia, and this Government in particular, got moving in all the possible ways open to it, and stood for the **rights** of the people of East Timor to determine their own future.

* I cannot accept the proposition that Australia's relationship with the Indonesian people will be destroyed if we make a moral stand on the **rights** of the East Timorese people for independence.

* What can be so important about Australia's relations with the Jakarta generals that we can ignore the gross violation of human **rights** on our very doorstep?

* This position was in line with the general principles of the Labor Party on the **rights** of people for self-determination and condemned the role of Indonesia.

* When questioned as to what changes this would bring if it occurred, the honourable member replied that the ALP policy would be changed to bring an end to the principle that the United States alli ance is crucial and that there would be  a  beginning of support for the human **rights** revolution around the world, more often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* As we know, the Conference deleted reference to the crucial importance of the United States alliance and substituted a form of words which were to emasculate the ANZUS Treaty and make it a vague convention on human **rights**.

* -I challenge that part of his statement in which he said that he would see that equal **rights** were given to TransAustralia Airlines and Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in operating on an intrastate basis.

* Am I to take it from that statement that it is the intention of the Commonwealth to override State **rights** on this matter?

* I ask that question because of the very sorry spectacle of what happened in regard to Aboriginal land **rights**, if I may use that term, as the Government sees them as illustrated by the speech of the Prime Minister on 26th January this year.

* further than that, any land **rights** for Aborigines in areas adjacent to their own properties?

* The Government now stands in a position of having to reveal its sincerity in regard to Aboriginal land **rights** in this particular property acquisition.

* I have already referred to the statement in relation to the concept of Aboriginal land **rights** which was made by the Prime Minister on 26th January of this year.

* The attitude of the Department of the Interior to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land **rights** and the attitude displayed by the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts are somewhat different.

* The people in this nation have **rights**.

* They have **rights** to privacy and they have **rights** to have their practices deemed to be private.

* These amendments are primarily aimed at changing references to Australian Federal Police from references to Commonwealth Police, as well as to preserve **rights** under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, where appropriate, to members of the Australian Federal Police.

* The one exception to this, as set out in clause 2, sub-clause (2), amends sections 87 and 87j of the Public Service Act 1922, which are in relation to the preservation of **rights** under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, which are to come into operation on the date of the commencement of section 32 of the Public Service Amendment Act 1978.

* In this instance, the amendments provide for the preservation by some former Commonwealth Police officers, who have been appointed to the Australian Federal Police, of their **rights** under the Officers' Rights Declaration Act in respect of their former service in the Australian Public Service.

* As I have already said I believe that we should do what we can to maintain an independent school system so that this very necessary aspect of the individual **rights** of people in Australia - that is freedom of choice in the education of their children - should be preserved.

* Not many persons in Grayndler will be exercising their new **rights** granted by this Government to own gold, but they will be adversely affected by those cuts in expenditure and the new directions of this regime.

* The so-called right to property is central to the program of the Workers Party and its supporters characterise the **rights** of Australian citizens to education, health care and equal opportunity as privileges.

* They say that in no circumstances must one man's need take precedence over what they characterise very narrowly as another's **rights**.

* that full and proper recognition be given to the status and **rights** of a woman as wife and mother; 
I believe there should be some reform regarding divorce but I also  most  firmly believe that the **rights** of children and marriage, if we are to continue living under our present socio-economic structure, must be protected and after perusal and deliberation I have reached the conclusion that this Bill will only undermine our society, irrespective of one 's religious persuasion.

* Whilst it may be theoretically convenient to limit the number of unions by amalgamation, it is not desirable to interfere with the **rights** of individuals who responsibly establish organisations and unions so that matters pertaining to their occupation or interest can be considered.

* As a member of the Opposition, I view the Bill now before the House as an infringement on the **rights** of individuals and dangerous to the members of unions.

* Where there is an industrial dispute in contravention of either an arbitration decision or justified government intervention, the people on strike should not be considered to have **rights** maintained in respect of their employment; nor should they have any approval or support when they prevent other people from taking their jobs in such unjustified strikes.

* The  Speaker  is the embodiment of the parliament, with all its **rights** and privileges and all of the trust and responsibilty conferred on it by the people.

* So we need as  Speaker  a person who can champion the **rights** of Parliament courageously and without fear or favour.

* Today, more than ever before, the  Speaker  must champion and defend the **rights** of the freely elected Parliament.

* That independence on the part of the  Speaker  is absolutely essential if the **rights** of the members of this Parliament are to be protected and, more importantly, if there is to be respect for the independence and the importance of this institution within our democratic system.

* I might mention that if the right honourable member for Bruce is to protect the **rights** of individual members of this House he should cease making the very heavy imposition that he has made on the research services of the Parliamentary Library, especially the legal research service.

* This would be a severe interference with the **rights** of anybody.

* But it is somewhat scandalous to think that when one endeavours to make representations one's telephone conversation is disconnected and one's correspondence is ignored, and the **rights** of the boy, which are the main consideration, are rejected.

* They are not entitled to interfere with the private **rights** of people who come here and should not encourage avaricious people to extort money from them on the basis that they know they can get away with it because they have the Department behind them.

* I should point out,  Mr Speaker,  that you will see in the last part of the newspaper article an attack on the specific **rights** to fair trial of the honourable member for New England.

* Whose **rights** are at stake in this dispute?

* Firstly, the **rights** of the small businessman are at stake.

* So the matter involves the **rights** of the small businessmen of the community to carry out their normal activities.

* Secondly, it involves the **rights** of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union.

* The matter affects not only the **rights** of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union but also the **rights** of other unionists throughout the country.

* The **rights** of the public are also involved.

* It is an attack by certain people against the **rights** of other members of their union.

* It is a matter concerning the **rights** of other people in the community- people who have to observe industrial awards- to carry out their business in the way in which they see fit but within the law.

* They are not sticking up for the **rights** of small businessmen who want to carry on their activities and who want to be free to work in an honest way to secure their own livelihoods and to make the wheels of industry turn.

* They are not sticking up for the **rights** of other unionists in the Transport Workers Union who, probably traditionally have been supporters of the Australian Labor Party.

* The members of the Labor Opposition are not sticking up for the **rights** of members of the public to go about their ordinary affairs in their motor vehicles, to go about their affairs concerned with their businesses, with their family activities or for purposes of their own pleasure.

* The **rights** of the public ought to have some standing in this Parliament.

* The members of the Labor Opposition are not sticking up for the **rights** of all members of the Australian community to have the economy improve and to have it continue on its upswing.

* We on this side of the House support the **rights** of individual workers and of all citizens involved in the Australian economy to be able to go about their businesses and to conduct their affairs in a normal and peaceful way, without intimidation.

* Does the proposed border settlement forfeit possible commercial fishing or other development **rights** of traditional owners of fishing zones.

* We must accept that there can be no restriction on the **rights** of people to group together, to form parties and, having formed parties, to offer candidates for election by the Australian people.

* It contains 33 pages and has 97 clauses concerning the **rights** of people before the courts, and the duties of the courts to the 120,000 who  live  in the Australian Capital Territory and to those who pass through it.

* The other day he was talking about such matters as the civil **rights**.

* While several States have moved towards the recognition of Aboriginal land **rights**, this legislation goes much further than has previously been contemplated in Australia.

* This Bill will give effect to the recommendations of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission- the Woodward report- and grant land **rights** to Aboriginals in the Northern Territory.

* This Bill will establish in our law those aspects of Aboriginal traditional law relating to land which  Mr Justice  Blackburn could not uphold in 1971 in the Gove land **rights** case: It creates for Aboriginals proprietary interests in, and communal title to, land, and makes that title inalienable.

* It was, he went on, 'a virtual command by 5 700 000 Australians that the national Government should take a lead to promote (among other things) the land **rights** of Aboriginals'.

* He further stated in his policy speech before the national election in December 1972 that a Labor government would legislate to give Aboriginals land **rights**, 'not just because their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are diminished while the Aboriginals are denied their rightful place in this nation'.

* The number of establishments at which breaches were found is as follows: 1967 the Office askedILO member States to review those of the following seven ILO 'human **rights**' Conventions which they had not already ratified: 
Australia had already ratified Convention Nos 1 1, 29 and 105.

* Recent comment by Sheik Yamani, the Saudi Arabian Minister for Minerals and Energy was that they would not produce in excess of the cash flow which they would need to develop their own country and beyond that they did not choose to be paid in currency of doubtful value and certainly not in special drawing **rights** from the International Monetary Fund.

* whose obligation is to provide the necessary risk capital and technology to match the proprietary **rights** of the Australian nation.

* In Queensland, for example, where coal activities are already 80 per cent dominated by overseas interests, including 60 per cent by one such company, the Shell Company of Australia Ltd is now acquiring **rights** to explore for coal and **rights** over proven reserves of coal for the purpose of developing in due course installations for the liquefaction of coal.

* centres on what they call the **rights** of the Governments of the sovereign States' or, more simply, 'State **rights**'.

* As so called State **rights** loom so large in this conflict, it is worth considering what they realy mean.

* T believe that the State **rights** issue is a counterfeit issue.

* Whether you are discussing off-shore oil, education or housing, state governments do not have **rights**.

* Neither does the Commonwealth Government have **rights**.

* No government has **rights**: governments have only responsibilities.

* Only the people have, **rights**, and the people of the States, of course, are the people of the Commonwealth.

* A state of impasse now exists in the Commonwealth-State financial relationship in spite of the - concessions' gained by the States at the last Premiers Conference, and it will persist 'as long as governments cling to the meaningless abstraction called government, **rights**'.

* It is high time that we did the same to the divine **rights** of governments.

* To think that any member would deny the **rights** of a fellow elected member to put a point of view would always be beyond me.

* It is not simply an agreement under which we have **rights**; it is an agreement under which we have obligations.

* Nol only did this completely downgrade ANZUS but it substituted a form of words which do not fit into ANZUS; they seek to make it rather a vague convention on human **rights**.

* Among the changes in policy this would bring are:  (1)  An end to the principle that the US alliance is crucial, and  a  beginning of support for the 'human **rights**' revolution around the world most often expressed in the national liberation movements.

* By this wording ANZUS is to be twisted lo become a human **rights** national liberation convention.

* There is the issue of the basic **rights** of trade unionists.

* I said earlier that political strikes not only usurp the **rights** and responsibilities of individual trade union members, they also put democracy at risk.

* I am gravely concerned at the way in which the extreme left wing of the trade union movement is increasingly denying rank and file trade union members their basic **rights** as unionists.

* It also raises the question of the **rights** of parliamentary democracy to prevail without the intrusion by individuals who are not elected by the people of this country and to protect the **rights** of parliamentarians to carry out their obligations to the people who elect them without interference from the Commonwealth police or any other organisation.

* The honourable member for Gwydir  (Mr Hunt)  has quite rightly referred to the question of privacy and human **rights**.

* the landlord has no legal **rights** at all.

* In my opinion, a vote against this Bill is a vote against the **rights** of good health of one million Australians who are uninsured.

* When we speak of States and States' **rights** I sometimes feel that we forget the people who live in particular places.

* The Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  in defence of the Government's position on this matter, made what unfortunately was a palpably inadequate defence of Australia's **rights** or Australia's capacity.

* The people do have **rights** and they must be protected.

* In politics they adopt the court room position all the time but unless people are able to live decently all of those protestations of court room **rights** which are so actively pursued by the Sydney silk that leads the Labor Party come to nothing.

* He is not concerned with protecting the **rights** of those people whose **rights** have to be protected during times such as these.

* They know when a government is trying to protect their **rights** as well as to uplift the totality of the Australian community and the Australian economy.

* The practice and procedure of the courts has a substantial effect on the **rights** of individuals.

* The present system also allows the **rights** of a person under Federal law to vary from one State to another.

* A good deal of what is covered by practice and procedure affects substantive **rights**, so that the judges, in making rules relating to these matters, are in effect legislating.

* Why are the **rights** of a citizen in Kalgoorlie being denied and interrupted by urgent legislation from an incompetent Government?

* What I suggest is that we do not try to intrude the **rights** of the Parliament, which are very important, into situations where it would be quite silly and inappropriate to do so.

* He talks about his **rights** as a member of Parliament.

* It is misleading for honourable members, to confuse the **rights** of members of the Parliament and the **rights** of the Parliament with proper executive procedures which are absolutely essential.

* What has in fact happened as part of the trade off between the New South Wales authorities and to some extent the profession is that the private profession is now dealing in the main with civil matters, matters of money and matters of property and is not dealing with the private **rights** of the citizen in those cases where his liberty is under threat.

* First of all, I come to what I regard and the Government regards as a very basic principle, that is whether or not governments should trench upon the **rights** of individuals to lend their support to political parties.

* Is the honourable gentleman serious when he says that this legislation does not trammel **rights** at all?

* I put it to the honourable gentleman: It is a significant invasion of the **rights** of people to support political parties.

* I have adverted to the fact that it represents a substantial invasion of the **rights** of individuals.

* We will not entertain a Bill of this character, which represents, on the one hand, a singular invasion of the **rights** of individuals and, on the other hand, the establishment of gross paraphernalia to police it, where the provisions are plainly in contrast to the genuine instinct of a democratic society.

* It was forecast in all the various Communist media that land **rights** would become the big issue in 1972 in view of the fact that Australia was withdrawing its troops from Vietnam.

* Emotional speeches, high sounding phrases and cliches and a clamour for land **rights** in itself will not overcome the disabilities of the Australian Aborigines.

* Essentially the Government's aim is to have a single Australian society, including Australian Aborigines, having equal **rights**, responsibilities and opportunities.

* Any sensible debate or discussion of Aboriginal land **rights** in the Northern Territory must start with the basic facts.

* Of course, the Government recognises the deep attachment that Aboriginal people have to land but it cannot reverse the whole course of Australian history without interfering with the **rights** of other Australians.

* What do people mean when they press for land **rights**?

* Outside this Parliament, according to Press reports, a spokesman for Aborigines said that they wanted full State **rights** of the Northern Territory under Aboriginal ownership and all titles for mineral ownership together with all other reserves and settlements in Australia with their titles to mining and mineral **rights**.

* They want mineral and mining **rights** in certain towns and cities, preservation of all sacred Aboriginal sites - this, of course, is being done - and compensation with an initial payment of $6 billion for all other land throughout Australia and a percentage of the gross national product each year.

* Indeed, the principal claim for land **rights** seems to be for compensation for land which it is claimed was taken away from the Aborigines over the past 200 years.

* If traditional **rights** are to be accepted for the Yirrkala at Gove by what logic can they be denied to the Larrakeah people in Darwin?

* A rich lode of amethyst is being mined high on an adjacent hill and prospecting **rights** are held over other areas of the reserve.

* Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government does not enact any law that would detract from or hinder the **rights** of the Aborigines to be there.

* Let me make it clear that we do not shed one vestige of our attitude towards human **rights**.

* If there is any doubt in this House as to the attitude of the Parliament generally towards human **rights**, honourable members would do well to examine the report that was recently tabled by  Senator John  Wheeldon 's Committee.

* I pay tribute to  Senator Wheeldon  for his great sincerity and the sincerity of the other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in producing a document which so exposed the question of human **rights**.

* I make it perfectly clear as a prelude to the comments I am about to make that we do not sacrifice one iota of our attitude towards the extreme sanctity of human **rights** for every single human being on this globe.

* I am satisfied that when, as we now know will be the case, the Gurindji people receive the land **rights** for which they have been waiting at Wattie Creek for the past 6 years they will go ahead and build a viable community, and that they will go ahead and develop a viable cattle enterprise on the land which they take over.

* For example- I quoted this case when the legislation was last being extended in this House- Industrial Equity announced in May 1974 that it had restructured its issued shares by restricting the voting **rights** of overseas shareholders and large bundles of shares were placed in the hands of the staff superannuation fund.

* We believe, as we did when the original text was drafted in December 1972, that it goes a long way towards overcoming some of the more obvious problems we are facing in respect to foreign interest 
In addition an examinable proposal under the legislation includes the acquisition of voting or non-voting **rights** in a corporation which has considered total assets greater than $3m.

* The bases of this Government's policies are our rejection of the use of force as a proper means of solving international problems; our belief in the democratic process and the **rights** of people to determine their own institutions; and our deep concern for the welfare of the underprivileged anywhere in the world.

* It preserves the inalienable **rights** of individuals as human beings.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  in his deliberate attempts toward centralism, has suggested that all appeals to the Privy Council be no longer heard, completely disregarding the **rights** of the States.

* We in Queensland, whilst upset at the cavalier attempts of the Prime Minister to downgrade in a rather facetious manner the forthcoming visit to the United Kingdom of the honourable Jo Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, know that our State will have its constitutional **rights** safeguarded by the appeal of our Premier to the authorities to have the **rights** of our federal system preserved.

* So it is that this Bill provides for all, regardless of origin, the same requirements as to residence, good character, knowledge of the language and of the **rights** and duties of citizenship and intention to live here permanently.

* An examination of the 2 quotes surely will provide the answer that the latter position should be so, as it is implied in the first quote that the number of years is not the only yardstick or criterion but other factors are included, such as knowledge of the language and of the **rights** and the duties of citizenship.

* An erstwhile citizen of Australia is relieved of all the legal obligations of Australian citizenship and, of course, he loses the **rights** that accrue with that Australian citizenship.

* 38, 23rd September 1964, pages 733 to 735, states: 
It is clearly in the interest of Australia that our grant of citizenship be an exclusive one, that our political **rights** and obligations be the only ones to which naturalised Australian citizens are subject.

* Steps are open to the Australian Government to try to ensure that our naturalised citizens enjoy the full **rights** that our other Australian citizens enjoy.

* Article 1 of the convention dealing with the complex problem of dual nationality states: 
I would have thought that this Government, which espouses in the name of the **rights** of the individual, fairness within the community, open government and all of these high flung phrases that honourable members are prone to use which announces that it intends to bring in an administrative review tribunal, would ensure in a piece of legislation which according to the words used by Government supporters is acknowledged to be of far-reaching significance and importance within the commercial community of Australia, that this elementary right of appeal against a decision on a question of law should not be denied to people who are brought within the purview of this Act.

* If such a business is practicable will he consider making land available not on the principle of traditional land **rights** but to facilitate the setting up of an Aboriginal enterprise for a community which already exists?

* Members **rights** can be denied in this way.

* But over and above that, we believe that the Australian Parliament as the custodian of civil liberties and human values has a responsibility when dealing with human **rights** such as the public funding of abortions to consider the effect that decisions reached in this Parliament will have not only on this generation but also on future generations of Australians.

* Why is it that we must wait now after 13 years or more since the first shots were fired on land **rights** in this Parliament?

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory will forgive us if, on this side of the Committee, we have a reasonable suspicion that the National Country Party is not all that dedicated to the principle of land **rights** for Aboriginal people.

* He has always acted as though the land **rights** of Aboriginal people could be transcended, for instance, by miners.

* I do not want to take it upon myself to express a view as to the **rights** or liabilities of members of Parliament or candidates for Parliament who happen to be barristers, solicitors, chemists or doctors, all of whom in one way or another can receive payments for professional services to various federal agencies.

* The **rights** or wrongs of the case will not be investigated.

* I believe in civil **rights** and the freedom of the individual to follow his conscience and choose his own method of protest.

* On 11th September last year I asked the then Attorney-General a question about reciprocal legal aid **rights** for people living in the various States.

* The honourable gentleman referred to 1968 and the conferring of voting **rights** on the present honourable member for the Northern Territory.

* It was not easy to vote against the measure and no one voted against it but it was utterly unprincipled that throughout the time when  Mr Jock  Nelson was a member of this House there was a steel determination on the part of the then Government not to confer voting **rights** on him.

* The present member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  should not have had voting **rights** conferred upon him in mid-term.

* He should have remained throughout that term without a vote and then should have gone to election when we would have had a member elected who had voting **rights**, that matter being determined by the Northern Territory.

* It was a piece of absolutely unscrupulous practice on the part of the Government which the honourable gentleman supported to confer on a man **rights** to which he had not been elected.

* If Jock Nelson bad continued as a member of this Parliament the honourable member for Mackellar knows very well that the democratic sentiments of the Government of 1968 would not have conferred voting **rights** upon him.

* As to the extent of representation the honourable member said that the High Court would probably find that that was the degree to which voting **rights** could be conferred.

* But if that is the meaning of 'extent', if it can give it to any extent or in the terms it thinks fit, then any extent or terms it thinks fit would include full voting **rights**.

* I do not think that the honourable member for Wentworth can give us lectures in democracy when it comes to discussing the conferring of voting **rights** on members of this.

* Minister spoke also of my motives in regard to the 1939 conferring of voting **rights** on the member for the Northern Territory and, incidentally, the member for the Australian Capital Territory at the same time - a matter which he most conveniently forgot.

* This inevitably raises the question of whether the **rights** of the individual are in jeopardy if a government takes steps to discourage a course of conduct which is now pursued by a minority in our community.

* These might include health warnings on packets, taxation manipulation, restrictions on smoking opportunities, encouragement of the **rights** of the non-smoker, as well as measures such as are involved in political, publicity and education programmes.

* When we are formulating the justice that we seek we do not have control or **rights** over aspects that are changing within our society.

* Amnesty provides a bi-partisan, a multinational basis for vigilance in questions of civil **rights**.

* One of the basic **rights** in a democracy is the people's right to know.

* The court may quash or set aside the decision or part of the decision, refer the matter back to the decision maker for further consideration subject to such directions as the court thinks fit, make an order declaring the **rights** of the parties in respect of which the order relates, or direct any of the parties to do or refrain from doing any act or thing where the court considers this necessary to do justice between the parties.

* I am sorry that over the past 70 years this Parliament has been in operation our Presidents and Speakers have not stood up for their **rights**.

* But these are their **rights**.

* I ask,  Mr Speaker,  that you should assert your **rights** in this respect.

* In the past the laws regarding inventions, trade marks and designs have been formed and administered on the narrow grounds of the granting of proprietary **rights**.

* His  findings, however, will be the basis upon which the Commonwealth will act not only in the Northern Territory, not only in the Jervis Bay territory at places such as Wreck Bay, but also in the States where the Aborigines are still exercising traditional land **rights**.

* We are determined to see that there will be non-alienable nontransferable **rights** vested in the Aborigines in respect of the land which they have traditionally occupied.

* The facts are that every possible step that could be taken to stultify and frustrate the development of the **rights** of the Aboriginal people of Australia has emanated  principally  from the National Country Party, and its principal spokesmen have been people like the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Adermann)  and the members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, as it is now called.

* As I said before, this Bill is simply the continual entrenchment of vested **rights**, particularly in mining areas but also in pastoral areas, by the people of the Northern Territory.

* The facts are that unless this Parliament takes the initiative, takes up its own duties and establishes Aboriginal **rights**, these **rights** will never be protected.

* No matter how many there are, some **rights** of future opportunity should be made available to them.

* No matter how many there are, they have **rights** and they should have opportunities for advancement and some expectation of future promotion in the Air Force.

* Admittedly there are probably no more than a couple of score of servicemen involved throughout Australia in these 4 musterings, but they must have **rights** and incentives and some expec tation of breaking through this barrier of corporal which pays only about $13.50 a day.

* The States consider - and I believe that this is the case - that they now have fewer **rights**, less power and less room to manoeuvre.

* -I take the opportunity during the discussion of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to raise the question of land **rights** in Western Australia.

* We have in Western Australia the possibility of there developing a Queenslandtype situation in relation to the legitimate claims of the Aboriginal people for land **rights**.

* The Aboriginal people throughout Australia have made perfectly clear their demand for land **rights**.

* This is particularly perplexing for us and something that we have to scrutinise all the more diligently, because we know at least that the Premier of Queensland is opposed- he is prepared to take his opposition to extraordinary extremes- to the granting of any sort of real, permanent land **rights** to the Aborigines of that State.

* particularly aware of is that there is not some sort of shoddy deal perpetrated in Western Australia under which the legitimate claims and the **rights** of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia are simply shoved under the carpet as a result of some collaboration between the Federal and State governments.

* The Premier of Western Australia will always say that a system of land **rights** does exist in Western Australia but, of course, that is only a subterfuge for the real thing.

* It is not good enough for the State Government to say that that constitutes land **rights**.

* It does not constitute land **rights**.

* So much for the **rights** and civil liberties expressed by honourable members opposite.

* Equally, the Opposition accepts that the Statistician, with his tremendous responsibilities and **rights**, takes on a statutory position.

* It also provides that he will have roughly the same set of responsibilities and **rights** within Australia as the Commissioner of Taxation has.

* That is what the Opposition is concerned about, and I am sure that subsequent speakers in the debate will stress the very real concern of the Opposition about this matter of privacy, bearing in mind the **rights** of the individual when looking at some of the suggested programs in almost all aspects of life that are recommended in the Crisp report.

* Is the Minister aware of a statement made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the Australian Government is secretly selling out the **rights** of the people of East Timor by arranging the delivery of further military aid to Indonesia in the form of patrol boats?

* I understand that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition stated: 
In the second area of concern- the preservation of the **rights** of the States in regard to wildlife control- the Minister expressed the hope that the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers would help to achieve co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States.

* I conclude on this point: The waterside workers have won their position and should guard it jealously but they should not sacrifice the standards and the **rights** of others to opportunities simply for unjustified pursuits.

* It will ensure effective discipline in the defence force, but at the same time it will ensure that the **rights** of individual servicemen are preserved.

* Recalling the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, as well as the recommendations of the World Population Conference, the United Nations World Food Conference, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, the World Conference of the International Women's Year; the Declaration and program of Action adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States that establish the basis of the New International Economic Order, 
Human dignity and the exercise of free choice consistent with over-all public welfare are basic **rights** which must be assured in every society.

* All countries, particularly developing countries, must create conditions which make possible the full integration of women and youth in political, economic and social activities, particularly in the planning and implementation of human settlement proposals and in all the associated activities, on the basis of equal **rights**, in order to achieve an efficient and full utilisation of available human resources, bearing in mind that women constitute half of the world population.

* Efforts must be made to ensure that the commercial practices governing the transfer of technology are adapted to the needs of the developing countries and to ensure that buyers ' **rights** are not abused.

* One hears a good deal about human **rights**.

* I remind the House that one of the most fundamental **rights**, of which we hear little, is the right to be different.

* Human **rights** and the welfare of the people themselves will be mv first concern.

* I firmly believe that the Commonwealth while not impinging upon States **rights** and, I emphasise, State responsibilities must ensure that we as a Commonwealth retain the right to investigate and the ability to assess any proposals being undertaken which are of national significance.

* Persons concerned will have certain **rights** if in the future they have to join or do join the Public Service or statutory bodies after leaving Papua New Guinea.

* Because of the limits of our Australian Constitution the Federal Government will need the co-operation of all States if we are to protect the **rights** and national inheritance of future generations.

* Henceforth these student children will attract full benefit **rights** irrespective of age.

* Whether or not the jurisdiction is left in our hands by the High Court, which of us in any event would want to be like the judges in pre-war Germany who simply acted out their office in a train of events that culminated in legal conclusions that 'Jews ' and 'Communists ' were no longer full citizens entitled to rely on **rights** previously accumulated, that is to say, were persons who could be struck down by a mere executive act.

* The judges in prewar Germany were legally able to conclude that Jews and communists were no longer full citizens entitled to rely on **rights** previously accumulated.

* I repeat 'entitled to rely on **rights** previously accumulated '.

* Yet Parliament is an institution which ought to have **rights** and powers quite apart from the **rights** and powers of the Executive Government.

* I recommend very strongly to all legal practitioners and to all litigants who are at present exercising their **rights** under the Family Law Act that parties be not prepared to accept a decree of dissolution of their marriage until a court is also able to hear the ancillary questions of maintenance, custody and the distribution of property.

* When we appreciate that there could be a delay of up to two years between the granting of a decree for dissolution of a marriage and the dealing with ancillary matters, we see how much the odds are in favour of a number of cases arising where divorcees will lose **rights** they would otherwise have had to the matrimonial home and property to enable them to maintain themselves and the children of the marriage.

* I commend the Attorney-General who introduced the human **rights** Commission Bill which is presently before the House for consideration and the freedom of information legislation which will shortly be before the House.

* How can we rely upon him as a member of Cabinet to defend the human liberties and **rights** of individuals if he does not even begin to understand what this is all about?

* No other word accurately describes his action because it rolls into one, an attack on civil liberties, civil **rights** and democracy.

* We are big enough as a country to say: 'Have your civil liberty; have your human **rights**.

* I hope that you can understand,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  how people who believe in civil **rights** and civil liberties will regard this coercion by the Government and by the action of the Prime Minister as totally reprehensible.

* The only way that the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory can exercise their **rights** and their duties as free and equal Australians citizens is for them to be represented wherever there are representative institutions, including the Senate.

* Now it comes to political **rights**.

* It is late in the day, but the decisions we will make this evening will deliver equal political **rights** to all citizens in Australia, no matter where they live.

* The Prime Minister knows that the trade union movement is against it and that there is a ground swell among workers against it because they feel that their **rights** are being taken away.

* I turn to some of the inequities in and the loss of existing **rights** under the Bill.

* Accident victims are given no **rights** to challenge unfavourable evidence on the basis set out in the report, namely, that any contest is bad for their rehabilitation.

* Since foreign takeover controls were first introduced in 1972 they have operated on the following basis: Firstly, the interim legislationthe Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act 1972-1974- extends to foreign takeovers of companies effected by means of acquisitions of voting shares; and secondly, the policy measures taken in December 1974 when the Government announced its comprehensive foreign takeover legislation proposals, extended to takeovers of incorporated or unincorporated business by means of acquisitions of assets, and mineral **rights**.

* As I understand it, the likely effect of the new proposals will be, firstly, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral **rights**.

* It is proposed that the criteria for determining national interest be widened to take into account all competition, productive capacity, development of new markets, conservation, urban development and the preservation of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I take this opportunity during the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department to give some arguments as to why Australia needs a bill of **rights**.

* I believe it needs a bill of **rights** because the existing safeguards in our laws are no longer sufficient to give full protection to personal civil liberties in an ever changing world which increasingly feels pressures curtailing these civil liberties.

* Put in another way, it can be said that Australia needs a bill of **rights** so that we can enlarge and extend existing areas of freedom.

* Spokesmen for conservative governments in countries like England and Australia have traditionally argued that there is no need for a bill of **rights**.

* In saying this, such spokesmen always forget that within the common law itself, charters of individual **rights** have played an important part in the development of the common law and the British Constitution, which rests on the common law and from which Australia draws so many of its values.

* Conservative commentators have also said that these 3 documents and the spirit behind them are sufficient and that they guarantee our **rights** against executive encroachment.

* In recent years many countries have recognised the obvious advantages to be gained by a re-assertion of fundamental **rights** both from a protective point of view and from an educative point of view.

* For example, there is probably a distinction to be drawn between personal civil liberties and the dogmatic assertion of economic **rights**, particularly when they apply to great corporations.

* It is very important if a park is proclaimed that it not bring to an end existing **rights** under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act.

* Although we accept the premise contained in this legislation that a person is more mature and indeed is able to exercise full franchise **rights** at 18, we do not extend that to the whole, concept of adulthood.

* The reduction of the age of majority and the age at which voting **rights** are gained is not the conscientious matter it was even 5 years ago when only a few honourable members this side of the House were prepared to support the matter.

* There was a time when arguments in favour of voting **rights** for women and Aborigines were also rejected.

* As I have said, apart from voting **rights**, the questions of the age of marriage without consent, the age to contract, and matters relating to interests under wills and settlements have all to be considered.

* This suggested that if he had not found out the people involved would not have had any knowledge of the **rights** they have under the law.

* Never before has there been such cooperation between State and Federal authorities, with the State Government standing up for the **rights** of its Western Australian citizens in no uncertain manner.

* He is, of course, doing what he is paid for and one would be disappointed if he failed to earn the money he is so paid - paid in many cases to hide the facts of the previous Government's policies, to hide the fact that the last Liberal Government sadly neglected the State's **rights** of Western Australian citizens and that past Western Australian Liberal Governments failed to stand up to their Federal counterparts to gain just recognition of the **rights** of Western Australian citizens.

* The State's **rights** groups which have been formed in Western Australia have produced, and continue to produce, masses of statistics which prove this neglect.

* No wonder they talk secession, in view of the lack of recognition by succeeding Liberal governments, both State and Federal, of the **rights** of Western Australians to a fair and equitable treatment in the distribution of national revenue.

* A government removes the **rights** of people to make decisions for themselves every time it decides that it will take money from them and determine how best to spend that money.

* Whatever the **rights** and wrongs of that statement were, and I think it had more wrong than right in it, the fact is that there was a deliberate decision to create unemployment.

* They give up many of their **rights**, not simply the right of action against the Commonwealth for negligence.

* Will the Minister consider allowing a drug prescribed by a dental practitioner, in accordance with his **rights** under State legislation, to be provided as a pharmaceutical benefit; if not, why not.

* The Minister for Social Welfare  (Mr Hayden)  has stood up for the **rights** of long-haired youths to draw unemployment benefits.

* We are equally concerned that there is no provision for the **rights** of the individual.

* The Government, mindful of its mandate and responsibility, is determined to ensure that the Australian electoral laws embrace those fundamental principles of human **rights** and democracy in this nation.

* Having taken the proposal for the Joint Sitting once to the High Court, it has even said it is going to take it there again and so deny the people their democratic **rights**.

* The Bill gives expression to the democratic principles of equal **rights** for all people, as opposed to the manipulation of the electoral system for the benefit of political parties.

* Its objective is to give to the 
I was careful to mention that so that he would know that this was something on which he had given me a decision and also because he has a facility for remembering correspondence from members on the Country Party benches - regarding the **rights** of 18 to 20-year-old persons to vote in Federal elections under section 41 of the Constitution, what is the reason for the Government's refusal .

* Alan's wisdom, his independence and his constant consistent concern for the **rights** of the individual will be remembered by all.

* Clause 2 1 of the Bill continues the Government 's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect the **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* Legislation has been introduced by this Government to grant voting **rights** to the 18- year-olds.

* I remind the Leader of the Country Party that nothing is surer than when a vote is taken in this Parliament tonight a majority of members will stand on the side of true democracy - will stand for equality of **rights** for all Australian citizens.

* To conclude differently, and to sanction  minority  control of state legislative bodies, would appear to deny majority **rights** in a way that far surpasses any possible denial of minority **rights** that might otherwise be thought to result.

* In the first place, any expression of its views is not only irrelevant in that it does not have legislative power to take a moral legislative view on abortion, but also any attempts to do so would involve a subversion of the **rights** of sovereign States in this area.

* The case against abortion on demand is a strong one, but it has not been strong enough to sway the legislators in those governments which have the sovereign **rights** to legislate on this matter, or indeed to enforce existing legislation that is honoured more in the breach than in the observance.

* It is improper for anyone to endeavour to use this House to subvert the sovereign **rights** of the States by imposing a discriminatory restraint on the **rights** of individuals to have abortions.

* It is the Parliament which decides the **rights** and wrongs of whether they should take place.

* What a shame the organisers of this enormous campaign have chosen to direct their power towards getting an expression of opinion and nothing more from a parliament with no **rights** in the matter, rather than to do something that would be practical and useful to its cause; that is, to influence the State parliaments to either introduce additional laws in respect of abortion, or to impose and make certain the existing laws work.

* When we came to office we were faced with a situation created by the Government of Queensland, a Country Party Government which has ruled Queensland for many years and which has granted leases and mineral **rights** according to its own legislation and is now in the process virtually of being criticised by its own Country Party members.

* In 1972, having had **rights** there before and carrying on quite an amount of exploration work, they took advantage of legislation introduced by the Queensland Country Party Government to obtain leases.

* Our policy makes it quite clear that the Labor Party places human **rights** and values first and provides for the development of full human dignity in this sphere.

* I conclude on this note: I know that the Government wants to move on to other business, but on the question of land **rights** I am most critical of the Government.

* I ask those who stand in this place and condemn the Budget to say specifically where they would cut back on expenditure and would deny to the Australian public its just **rights**.

* However, this Government considers that as these actions affect property and the **rights** of individuals it is most desirable that where practicable the appropriate powers should be set out in specific legislation.

* is of opinion that, as a matter of priority, legislation should be introduced to protect the **rights** of ex-nuptial children and, in particular,  insofaras  the Commonwealth Government is concerned, to remove the word illegitimate from all existing Commonwealth legislation and to amend existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that ex-nuptial children have the right to participate in the same benefits and entitlements that any other child in the community is able to receive.

* It is well known to honourable members opposite and to the public that the Commonwealth entered the field of education as a whole - it is, as you know,  Mr Speaker,  a vast field - substantially at the higher levels of education, notably at the tertiary level, where the educating was essentially carried out by autonomous or semi-autonomous institutions from univer sities down and where it was much easier to involve the Commonwealth in considerable capital expenditure without transgressing the **rights** of the States and their education departments.

* As alluded to by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, it may not be within section 51 placita (xxi) and (xxii) of the Constitution which refer to marriage, divorce and matrimonial causes and, in relation thereto, parental **rights** and the custody and guardianship of infants.

* In response and in return for that assistance, which I might add has not been forthcoming in all other parts of the world, governments of Australia have ignored their **rights** and obligations to protect employees in those industries which have been so affected.

* During the past generation previous governments have created and have encouraged this depersonalised society in which the **rights** of individuals are cheap, in which individuals count for little and in which all that counts is the number of dollars and cents that were made in each year.

* For years and years now General Secretary Frank Mitchell and  President  Edgar Williams have been responsible for allowing one of the finest unions in Australia to detenorate into a disgraceful shambles with some of the worst awards in Australia and an utter comtempt for the democratic **rights** of the union membership.

* He wants to give to AWU members in Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria the same high level of awards and **rights** of participation in the affairs of the union as AWU members enjoy in New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania.

* The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms for all.

* There seems to be as much neglect in educating people to their responsibilities as there is enthusiasm for advancing their **rights** to privileges, real or imaginary.

* We have to decide whether we want to maintain the culture of the Aboriginal, whether we want to grant land **rights** to him, whether we want to relegate him to the distant places of this continent or whether we want to absorb or merge- describe it as we please- him into the main Australian community, realising that that represents about 99 per cent of our community.

* We have demonstrated our active concern for the **rights** of peoples oppressed in Rhodesia and South Africa by voting in favour of the last 2 United Nations General Assembly resolutions on Rhodesia, which we had not previously supported, terminating all trade to and from Rhodesia, and by seeking the closure of the Rhodesia Information Centre in Sydney.

* Australia has asserted her sovereign **rights** to explore and exploit the natural resources of its continental shelf out to the outer shelf of the continental margin.

* Equality before the law can only be meaningful if each individual had the ability to exercise his **rights**.

* Equality of political **rights** is inherent in a truly democratic state.

* Equality of political **rights** is a matter that must be guaranteed under the law in a democratic society.

* But,  Mr Chairman,  equality of political **rights**, equality of voting value and equality of political representation cannot be guaranteed in a situation where electorates which vary in size from less than 4 square miles to almost 900,000 square miles, are required under law to have virtually equal numbers of electors.

* The Labor Party could not care less about the democratic **rights** of Australian citizens to enjoy equality of representation in this Parliament.

* We of the Australian Country Party would be failing in our duty if we did not fight with all our power to protect the limited **rights** of country people and to fight to secure for country people something approaching the equality of representation to which they, as Australian citizens, are entitled.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views.

* Have not people who live in the proximity of aerodromes and who were established there before aeroplanes became what they are today any **rights**, any civil liberties or any right to say that their mode of living should be protected?

* Surely we cannot ignore the **rights** of thousands upon thousands of people because aircraft companies want to have aerodromes right in the heart of Sydney.

* Deeply involved in the psychology of the situation is the question ot land **rights**.

* We could debate this at great length, but not one of use can say with certainty exactly what the machinery is by which we could implement such **rights**.

* This is, of course, the way in which the States have exercised their **rights** under the existing legislation.

* In re-presenting these Bills the Government is intentionally reasserting the **rights** of this House.

* If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself, the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the **rights** or privileges of minorities, then Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian democracy.

* The proposed corporation will ensure the **rights** of policy holders, in that their guarantee, security and protection will be assured, and that is a lot more than a high proportion of companies in the insurance industry have done over the last 5 years.

* Especially am 1 not sure of Papua New Guinea in that respect if the House of Assembly is doing what the House of Assembly has been doing at our request and trampling on local land **rights** as in Bougainville.

* If they elect to carry on in business entering into contracts of chattel hiring instead of attending to the area of money-lending and contracts of that nature, secured by chattel mortgages, then their legal **rights** will be judged by the terms of the agreements they enter into and by the contract law applicable to contracts of that form.

* Unless the Government is prepared to reconsider its attitude on this provision the Minister appears to be more interested, I would think, in protecting the profits of Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd and Commercial and General Acceptance Ltd than in the **rights** of the Australian public.

* The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was created in the time of the previous Labor Government and it gives an opportunity for citizens to establish their **rights** as against administrative decisions.

* We think that is a very important democratic way of saying that the Parliament itself is not going to be supreme in all of its actions and where there are administrative determinations and decisions, as there have to be in the normal course of events, **rights** will be given to people in certain circumstances to say as citizens that they object to those determinations and decisions.

* I rise on this issue because the Government has proclaimed itself as the guardian of the **rights** of the States and it has said that the Opposition is not terribly concerned about the **rights** of the States.

* We regard it as quite undesirable that legislation, which could potentially be used against States ' **rights** and civil liberties in unspecified circumstances, should be passed.

* This legislation can override their powers and their **rights**.

* I am simply saying that where those anxieties exist, in my view if a government proclaims to be concerned about the **rights** of the States and proclaims to be concerned about the **rights** of the individual against what it epitomised as an over-centralised Labor Government then proceeds in this fashion in the face of those objections, including objections from Liberal Premiers, it strikes me as quite incongruous.

* Why should not postal voting facilities be available to a man on remand at Long Bay Gaol, a man not convicted of anything and who still has all his civil **rights** but probably cannot raise bail.

* They said that was a trespass upon the **rights** and properties of the Woodside-Burmah consortium.

* What they were in fact trying to do was to protect the **rights** of Woodside-Burmah to export gas and condensate from the North West Shelf.

* I think that today people are claiming too many **rights** and are not accepting enough responsibilities.

* Clause 22 of the Bill continues the Government's policy of expanding, wherever possible, the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to administrative decisions which affect **rights** or entitlements of persons under Commonwealth legislation.

* There is some strong support now in certain quarters for an increased role for special drawing **rights** - SDRs - in the monetary system.

* While it opposed the establishment of a Palestinian Liberation Organisation controlled West Bank state, it endorsed the concept of a Jordanian solution for the political expression of Palestinian **rights**.

* Those citizens of Jordan, who are well integrated into the Jordanian economy, presumably also have **rights** as Palestinians.

* It provides more satisfactory and extensive safeguards and appeal **rights** for such staff.

* What **rights** have they to be any more secure than, perhaps, people in private industry or the self-employed person, the small business man or the small farmer?

* According to Labor's policy at the present time ANZUS, as we know it, is to be converted into a kind of human **rights** convention.

* It was the concession made to the smaller States to protect what were conceived to be their fundamental **rights**.

* The world economic order of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund is cracking and will steadily disintegrate, hence the recent Rambouillet conference of 8  Major nations  to demonetise gold, replacing it with special drawing **rights**.

* One is a multiple reserve currency whereby the obligation, so far solely upon the United States, would be shared by other major powers, and the other is the adoption of the special drawing **rights** as a principal reserve asset.

* With the latter choice at Rambouillet it yet remains to be seen whether special drawing **rights** will be able fully to finance the growth of a world in which most nations still tend to prefer the possession of gold as a major reserve asset.

* By all means let us take sides if the principles are clear, if humanitarian **rights** are at stake, if our own interests or security are involved; but not when the facts are flimsy and disputed and more is to be lost than gained from intervention.

* It is to ignore the significance of the European Security Conference, including the Soviet concessions on human **rights**.

* I would have thought that if the honourable gentleman's concern for the protection of **rights** of the rank and file is as genuine as he has stated it to be on a number of occasions before this House he would retain the protection of a secret ballot by postal voting.

* After all we have a compulsory system of voting which surely means that the Government and, indeed, the Parliament should be providing for conditions that make it reasonably easy for people either to vote under compulsion or to exert their **rights** as they happen to see the situation.

* The implication was that the profits accruing to the airline operators, wherever they might be, were so great that the **rights** of the common man were being ignored.

* In his statement on 17 November 1976 he said that traditional Aboriginal **rights** to enter Aboriginal lands must be provided for.

* That, of course, does not take away from this Federal Parliament its **rights** to legislate in a way that would over-ride legislation of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to which it may object.

* It is really to safeguard the **rights** of the Assembly so that it has a channel of appeal to this Parliament.

* They were the ones who neglected the **rights** of tenants for a quarter of a century.

* I would add that any person who seeks to suggest that the Commonwealth Government will not protect the **rights** of all Australians is doing a great disservice to this Government, to this Parliament and to Australia.

* Generation after generation of these people have been raped of their basic **rights**.

* The Bills also seek to plug a blatant tax loophole regarding the repatriation of profits by foreign companies operating in Australia as branches of their parent company; to protect the revenue against a recent court decision which threatens to reduce tax revenue greatly unless counteraction is taken; and they implement the concession on capital investment in Australian film **rights** to encourage investment by Australians in the production of Australian films.

* But an Australian government ought to act with a proper regard for all the traditional **rights** of Australians.

* That did not stop this great defender of the **rights** of members of this Parliament - the man who objects now to these words - from attacking a man whose reputation in this country is unequalled probably by any member of the Public Service anywhere.

* It is the Government which is ignoring the **rights** and the difficulties of persons representing country areas.

* So we can only conclude - of course it is well known - that Labor favours a centralist system of government and that it does not favour a federal system under which the States have their **rights**.

* We must remember that under our Constitution the States have sovereign **rights** and are responsible for certain functions.

* States have certain constitutional powers and **rights**.

* It is a concern with which I have a great deal of sympathy and which should be shared by all members of this Parliament and all members of the Australian public who have a respect for the **rights** of the individual.

* Fourthly, it was also proposed that citizens' **rights** should be linked with the performance of their civic duties- in other words, there were no civil **rights**.

* Although some minor liberalisation of citizens ' **rights** and duties was achieved, the basic points- that is, the socialist character of the state, the role of the Polish United Workers Party and the country's reliance on the Soviet Union for political support and defence- remain in force.

* The future of individual **rights** in Poland is now quite clearly suspect.

* I think that there is no way in which there can be continuation of a situation of military domination that would result in the people now living in the West Bank areas being deprived of the political **rights** to which they would be entitled, any more than anyone would want to see the people of Israel deprived of their political **rights**.

* This is a serious charge but is supported by an earlier example of  Senator Greenwood's  benign view of the **rights** of terrorists.

* Until you exercise your **rights** under the legislation, don't come to us crying poor mouth.'

* It is quite clear that in other clauses of this BUI there are many guarantees as to the negotiating **rights** of Aborigines through the land councils and the deed-holding body, the Land Trust, in respect of the mining interests.

* They would not even allow the **rights** of Aborigines with respect to rnining interests to be protected because there would be none being renewed from which Aborigines would need to be protected or from which they could obtain payment in terms of negotiated settlements and so on.

* A former  Speaker  of this Parliament, the long since deceased Archie Cameron, refused to recognise Assistant Ministers because he said that constitutionally they had no **rights** whatever in this Parliament.

* I think costs should not have been permitted by the Government when it was amending the Act, because when costs are permitted against parties appearing before the court they are very often greater than the fines and, indeed, the costs can be a deterrent against a unionist seeking his lawful **rights** under the Act.

* his absence was for the purpose of carrying out his duties or exercising his **rights** as an officer or delegate of an organization: and 
My colleague, the honourable member for McMillan  (Mr Buchanan),  and other colleagues will deal with other aspects of the matter.

* The honourable member tends to ignore both the constitutional **rights** of the States and what I believe to be the States' wishes in this matter.

* I stress that it is important that we should recognise the State **rights** involved in the establishment and maintenance of ports.

* I repeat that we all need to recognise that the States have constitutional **rights** in this field.

* Not only do they have constitutional **rights** but also do they wish to maintain those **rights** in this field.

* Doubtless the Minister would argue that this is an extension of the democratic **rights** of the ordinary unionist.

* The other argument, of course, is that senators representing the Territories would be sectionalists and would be arguing for the **rights** of the Territories.

* The provision for mobile polling booths will overcome that to a very large extent, and every effort is required to ensure that all citizens exercise their **rights**.

* Fair-minded employers will not seek to deny to workers the **rights** they themselves enjoy.

* The **rights** of officers to be transferred to the statutory corporation are covered by the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, and although this Act does not as it stands fully protect the **rights** of officers in this situation, the Government plans very soon to amend the Act.

* Most importantly, how is the average contributor to be made aware of his **rights** to appeal to the Minister to direct the funds?

* I do not intend to make comments on the **rights** or wrongs of the dispute between that Association and the Government.

* However, I am perturbed that a responsible industrial organisation- an organisation which ardently believes in freedom of speech and the **rights** of the media to report without fear or favour- should take action aimed not at the Government but at the Parliament.

* The **rights** of the public to enter Parliament House with the minimum of inconvenience, to criticise Parliament, parliamentarians, governments and Oppositions, to demonstrate without undue inconvenience to other members of the public and to exercise their hard won right of a free and secret vote are too precious to allow them to be lost by the inaction of Parliament itself.

* For that reason, and taking that as a democratic guide, we should insist on our **rights** at every possible opportunity.

* As far as 1 am concerned any procedure which involves a denial of **rights** should not be traditional.

* -Is the Prime Minister aware of a statement made in 1 977 by the former Attorney-General, the present Minister for Home Affairs, that human **rights** should be the same all over the country, and of a further statement which reads: 'We ought to be able to get together on this.

* In view of those statements and the statement of the Prime Minister today that the Commonwealth would not use the external affairs power under the Constitution to enact a Bill of **rights** which guarantees the provision of human **rights** by all States throughout Australia by the end of this year, will the Prime Minister guarantee that such **rights** will be brought into operation shortly rather than wait a further two years?

* 1 point out to the House that in the United States and in the United Kingdom it is standard practice that matters involving property **rights** are put aside when the liberty of a subject is involved.

* If it is not inconsistent with fundamental **rights** and duties, the House should avoid setting itself up as an alternative forum or body of inquiry or permit its proceedings to interfere in the course of justice.

* Apart from particular matters such as criminal cases, courts material, civil cases and matters referred by a legislature to a judicial body, the rule has application to other hearings, inquiries or investigations in which the **rights** of individuals or a community group or the achievement of justice may be prejudiced.

* It is the obligation of the Chair to hold the balance between the **rights** and duties ofthe House on the one hand and the **rights** and interests of the citizen on the other.

* This is done by these great advocates of the **rights** of the individual, those who would have us marching and singing 'The Marseillaise', 'Land of Hope and.

* Generally, the Government has supported the view that the **rights** of taxpayers under existing legislation should not be altered retrospectively.

* One reimbursement technique is for the shareholders concerned to put broadly equivalent funds into the company, for example, by subscribing for redeemable preference shares that, after payment of a one-and-for-all dividend, carry virtually no **rights**.

* It gives to those who sit in this Parliament the opportunity to say whether they believe in these democratic principles and the equal **rights** of all electors, or whether they stand for manipulation of the Electoral Act to retain governments of their political colour irrespective of the vote of the Australian people.

* We have a growing movement by women, young and old, in the community to assert their **rights** and their position in this society.

* They are seeking equality of **rights** and recognition of their place in society as people, not just as chattels of men or as the housekeepers of the community.

* If nations go to war they do so because they feel threatened by some other nation or in some way or other they feel they have a need for this action in order to assert their **rights** or their position.

* We have denied them basic **rights**.

* The Government intends to press for the establishment of Aboriginal land **rights**, far better health services and better nutritional standards for Aborigines so thu no longer will they be the poverty-stricken section of this Australian community with one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world.

* Clauses 6 and 7 of the Bill deal with the **rights** of life insurance companies to carry on business that is not life insurance.

* This is a welcome move in the direction of protecting the **rights** of policy holders.

* All our talk of millions of extra dollars should not be allowed to hide the fact that what we are really aiming at is a cultural, social and economic revolution in our society with a new respect for the **rights** of every individual, not just an elite, to have the opportunity of living a personally satisfying life as a member of a genuinely democratic community.

* We believe that individual **rights** and freedoms are basic to our society.

* The first two paragraphs of the Labor Party's policy on uranium state that we recognise that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the **rights** and well-being of the Aboriginal people.

* I am convinced that, if we were to take action in a way which did not interfere with the free expression of opposition and the publication of opposition to government action, but which did prevent it being expressed with licence which interfered with the civil **rights** of the majority of this country, wc would have the backing of the vast majority of Australians who, again, are disturbed by the practice which has developed of invading public places and private properly in order either to interfere with the **rights** of citizens or to threaten and intimidate other citizens.

* As early as the meeting of March last year the then Minister for National Development did make it clear that the Commonwealth proposed legislation on offshore mineral **rights** beyond the 3-mile limit and that such legislation would not follow the lines of the off-shore petroleum legislation.

* A movement formed to fight persecution and protect human **rights** - an organisation affiliated with the United Nations and concerned with the release of political prisoners .

* State governments have particular **rights** and all of them are getting in for their pound of flesh.

* Secondly, it sets out the function of the Bureau and the **rights** and obligations of the Statistician.

* There should not be laws which affect people in their fundamental **rights** or which can apply the processes of law.

* In a sense, I think the attitudes which are present in this legislation, attitudes which are reflected in clauses 35, 41 and 42, are designed essentially to increase alienation within the Australian community, to increase division and bitterness, to make people feel that, if they do not match up to a test which most of the people in this Parliament have rarely matched up to, somehow they are less than equal and somehow they do not have the same **rights** as the rest of the community.

* Implicit within them are concepts of social control, of coercion, of conflict within the community, where we repress people in a certain section of the community and deny them basic **rights**, where we subject them to harassment, where we pursue them rather than seeking to understand how they can make a contribution to the community.

* We will doubtless argue at a later stage in Committee the **rights** and wrongs of the proposed amendment by which the honourable member for Fremantle wishes to change this body from an advisory capacity to a statutory body.

* This will be one of the most difficult problems because the medical profession is traditionally jealous of its **rights** to set its own fees.

* There are many other ancillary provisions of the Bill which deal only with meetings of the Commission, officers and employees', **rights** of Public Servants, moneys payable to the Commission, estimates, audits and so on.

* They are found at proposed new section 30, and read as follows: 
That the House notes the 40th Anniversary of the signing of the infamous Ribbentrop-Molotov Treaty in Moscow on the night of 23-24 August 1939 as a vital prelude to the commencement of World War II, and recalls with regret that notwithstanding the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 the Soviet Union continues to enjoy the **rights** guaranteed to it by the said Treaty, involving the enslavement of many independent nations and over 250 million citizens of Central and Eastern Europe.

* There has been no emphasis in the administration of the legislation on the **rights** of homeless people.

* We know that there is no group which is more offended in terms of its **rights** within the population.

* They have had their legal **rights** completely overridden.

* The **rights** of homeless people would seem to me to be an area on which much greater emphasis might have been placed by the Government.

* I refer not only to legal **rights** but also to **rights** to receive basic care.

* First of all, we read in one of the letters that Magna Carta has been undermined by this measure of the Treasurer; that the liberties of the Australian people are in danger; and that their human **rights** are threatened by this retrospectivity.

* If any arrangement had or was calculated to result directly or indirectly in the type of tax advantage described in the lettered sub-clauses of the section, the Commissioner should have the right to disregard it for taxation purposes, unless the arrangement was an ordinary business transaction creating **rights** or obligations that would normally be created between business people dealing at arm 's length in a transaction of the nature in question and effected by means normally employed in such a transaction, or was made in the ordinary course of making or changing an investment, or was a bona fide arrangement of a person's or a family's affairs, and the Commissioner was satisfied that the arrangement was not entered into solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining the tax advantage or that one of its main objectives was to obtain the tax advantage.

* -I think we have to protect the country and I think we have to protect the country against people who believe that an individual 's **rights** should be subject to the political nees or thoughts of a person such as the Minister.

* How many people have been disadvantaged in Australia- denied Australian citizenship, denied positions in the Public Service and denied normal civilian **rights** in Australiabecause of the existence of a security file?

* It appears that this House is involved in a practice of denying protection to citizens and acquiring for instrumentalities of the Government of the day means by which the **rights** of individuals can be denied rather than protected.

* Are they the words of a zealous custodian of States **rights** or are they the words of a jugular vein politician who is determined to use the Senate merely to reverse the freely expressed will of the people of Australia?

* The **rights** and wrongs of this are beside the point; all the evidence of history reflects it as a part of the human condition.

* If Yarrabah is an example of some of the other problems in Queensland- and I believe it is- it is timely, appropriate and urgent that the Commonwealth Government assert its constitutional **rights** and take over the administration of the care and advancement of Aboriginal people.

* The Aboriginal people in Queensland are quite clear as to their **rights**, namely, that they should have control of their own destiny and that they should have control of the land on which they are located.

* I submit that all special legislative and administrative measures affecting Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should be based on respect for individual dignity and human **rights** and should be designed to develop selfrespect, independence, self-management and self-sufficiency of Aboriginals and Islanders.

* In taking its decision on uranium mining, the national park, and Aboriginal land **rights**, the Government has been guided by the two reports of the Ranger Environmental Inquiry commissioned under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act.

* Consideration will be given to the need to amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 so that effect can be given to the proposal by the Northern Land Council, that Aboriginal Land should become part of the 
The Government accepts the recommendation that consideration be given to providing, by regulations, that mining companies and their contractors answer promptly any request for relevant information respecting their operations made by the Director of National Parks and Wildlife and for him to have appropriate **rights** of inspection.

* The emotionalism which has been associated with so much of the objection to constructive critics in the past in my view has been couched out of concern to protect our security agency from any sort of criticism rather than a genuine concern about establishing or maintaining the minimal level of secrecy consistent with the democratic **rights** of the community and, on the other hand, an appropriately effective functioning of a security service.

* Those people have no appeal **rights**, and no **rights** even to know.

* That is not a way to deal with the **rights** of Commonwealth public servants who seek not a hand out but justice.

* We often heard the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, championing the **rights** of this Parliament and saying that it should be supreme in any major policy announcements that are made.

* If the Government has decided not to proceed with revision of the code (a) what is the reason and (b) is he satisfied that the legal **rights** of servicemen are adequately protected by the existing code.

* I am sufficient of an idealist to believe that where freedoms and basic human **rights** are threatened anywhere in the world it is the duty of those who support those basic freedoms and human **rights** to stand up in their defence.

* I have no qualms in saying that where those **rights** are threatened by totalitarian regimes, either of the right or of the left, in the northern hemisphere or in the southern hemisphere, I will do my bit.

* I hope that 10 February 1976 will be remembered by all Australians who believe in freedom as a day of shame for international democracy, a day of the deprivation of the **rights** and liberties of the people of Poland, and a day of sadness for all who love freedom and all who believe that one day we will see a free Poland.

* We have seen uprising of the workers- the very same people who are supposed to be represented by those people on the other side of the House, those who support the Labor Party, those who support the **rights** of the ordinary worker.

* 1 would have thought that in 1976 members of the Australian Labor Party would be prepared to come out and say that this is one further assault on the **rights** and liberties of the workers in another country which we will not tolerate.

* Similarly at about that time the Polish United Workers -Congress, which in fact is the Communist Party,- at its congress, instead of agreeing to those things which were being requested, decided that it would take the alternative course of not only denying those freedoms but also of taking away 3 basic **rights** which hitherto had been the entitlement of the people of Poland.

* What it wants to write into the Constitution amounts to a denial of the right of political association, of the formation of parties and of any real chance of an effective opposition in the Polish Parliament; secondly, the taking away of the **rights** of an independent and free Polish foreign policy by writing into the Constitution that,  ipso facto,  the foreign policy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, will be, for all intents and purposes, the foreign policy of Poland; and, thirdly, by giving to an arm of the Executive, the State Council, an interpretive right- whatever the honourable member for Wills might say it is not the right of the Governor-General of Australia but in fact is the right of the High Court of Australia- to interpret the Constitution.

* In those 3 steps three basic **rights** were taken away.

* m 
My Government will carry out a continuing program of law reform, particularly with a view to protecting civil liberties and enhancing individual **rights**.

* Constant  viligance  is required to ensure that the **rights** of individual citizens are not eroded or ignored.

* Constant vigilance is required to ensure that the **rights** of individual citizens are not eroded or ignored.

* It is legitimate for any honourable member of this House to ask: Have our individual **rights** been eroded or ignored?

* They would be bad enough, goodness knows, if we were talking about just the **rights** of the average citizen.

* We find that  Mr Acting  Justice White had this to say in paragraph 16.1.2 of his report: 
How do we as a Parliament listening to all this talk about parliamentary privilege and the **rights** of members contemplate a situation in which all honourable members representing the Government are prepared- and presumably the Prime Minister is prepared- to accept the situation in which they know that every member on this side of the House, and every Labor parliamentarian throughout Australia, has been the subject of a security dossier?

* Talk about preserving our civil **rights** and our liberties!

* I have listened to the comments of the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  and the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  on the definitions clause, particularly on the definition of 'unreasonable obstruction' but I point out to them that the only thing which is prevented is an obstruction which interferes with the lawful **rights** or privileges of other persons.

* We do not confine it except to eliminate from the entire area of freedom this tiny corner where people are violent or are interfering with the **rights** of other people.

* Again in the definition, to make sure that the position of the demonstrator, the dissenter, or the person who is assembling or obstructing a street is safeguarded, it is said that regard must be had to all the circumstances of the obstruction or interference, including its place, time, duration and nature before a determination can be made that an act constitutes an unreasonable interference with the **rights** of others.

* The Aboriginal Affairs Minister told newsmen that the future of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation was in jeopardy because of recent developments over the Ranger project.

* The essence of the matter is as follows: In February 1969 Cabinet made a very clear decision that the Commonwealth would legislate to assert total **rights** over the sea bed outside the 3-mile limit.

* That offer was that the States should retain control of the mineral resources of the territorial seabed, that is, from low water mark to the 3- mile mark off-shore, while the Commonwealth legislated to take over total **rights** outside the 3- mile limit to the edge of the continental shelf.

* The amount of money which will be raised by the levy on third party and workers' compensation insurers, as I indicated the last time I answered a question from the honourable member, would be the same amount which would be currently outlaid and which would be outlaid in any succeeding year for hospital and medical costs incurred by people covered by those schemes and drawing on those sorts of services as a result of their **rights** under those sorts of insurance schemes.

* Here I am with no **rights** to run an airline and with no subsidies, competing with the Government to run a resort'.

* By suspending this standing order or another standing order the Government can whittle away the **rights** of an Opposition and the **rights** of private members and make the Parliament completely subservient to the majority party.

* The reason for it is that the Government has a lack of confidence in the ability of its own 
I want to say something about the **rights** of people to negotiate and the **rights** of people to agree.

* The young man who goes to Vietnam and returns is given an indication of his repatriation **rights**.

* They are given certain **rights** and promised certain privileges.

* If this is correct then the Corporation falls far short of what the industry is really asking for in relation to the protection of its **rights** and interests in actual selling.

* When we are the government after 2nd December we will take immediate steps to bring about the situation for which the wool growers are looking, to protect their **rights** and to give them a feeling of real security instead of the uncertainty which the present Government's policy fosters.

* There has been a total disregard, in any way, for the **rights** of Parliament or of the members of Parliament.

* refusing to restore land **rights** to Aborigines living on reserves or in significant communities; 
The provisions in this Bill are designed to ensure that no one is deprived of any right or entitlement under the National Health Act during the transition to the Australian Health Insurance Program.

* The provisions empowering repeal of parts of the Act will not be activated until all **rights** and entitlements under those parts of the Act have been fully realised.

* My experience is the reverse - that the man who is cynical and mercenary is the man who is crying the loudest - in the Society of General Practitioners in particular - about his civil **rights** to charge what he likes and saying that medical care is not a right, it is a luxury, and that those who want it must pay for it.

* I think it would be apparent to the House that it is an absurd proposition to consider that the Government would take steps to destroy the Northern Land Council or any Aboriginal land council created by it under the land **rights** legislation.

* The very essence of land **rights** legislation is that it puts Aboriginal land in the hands of Aboriginals and creates bodies such as the land councils so that they can act for Aboriginals and in the interests of Aboriginals.

* The **rights** of the subservient and the **rights** of the citizen are expanding.

* The **rights** of the medical profession, of the pharmacists and of the people in these allied fields are expanding.

* Indeed, the **rights** of the manufacturers themselves ought to be expanding.

* Like most citizens I am not prepared to concede any **rights**, any decision making, to anyone unless I have an opportunity of knowing the reasons why they arrive at those decisions.

* Those decisions will pretty much determine what sort of penalties will be imposed on people and what sort of **rights** people will have in the legal system which will operate in the Australian Capital Territory.

* Aboriginals in all States have suffered from the Government's cavalier land **rights** policies.

* The Aboriginal Land Fund Commission was established by the Labor Government in 1974 and, pending Aboriginal land **rights** legislation in the States, it has been a means of securing land for Aboriginal groups beyond the boundaries of the Northern Territory.

* The Commission's work has also been hindered by the attitude of the Queensland Government and the Federal Government's failure to protect the **rights** of Aboriginals in that State.

* The Prime Minister has overridden his Minister on land **rights** and land acquisition in order to smother those issues.

* The interests and **rights** of Queensland's Aborigines have been sacrificed for that purpose.

* It does not take into account legal costs or the grazing **rights** of one farmer next door.

* Let us make it very clear that not only State **rights** are at issue in these two clauses; the matter of civil liberties is very much involved also.

* I refer not only to what the Government deems to be State **rights**.

* If we look at what happened last evening to the Atomic Energy Commission Bill we see that no State **rights** are left under that legislation- the Commonwealth has the power to go in and mine.

* When we talk about these matters let us make it clear that if we have a national or international responsibility, we also have a responsibility in the area of civil **rights**.

* The honourable member knows very well that it is left to the State of Queensland to look after the **rights** of Aborigines.

* The Opposition accepts that but there is also a responsibility in the area of civil **rights** and other matters which are affected by this legislation.

* Will the Minister examine all relevant Commonwealth laws to determine whether any **rights** and freedoms conferred on any citizen by those laws will prevail over any attempted subtraction from the citizen's right to personal freedom or freedom of assembly by the laws of the State of Queensland?

* Any stand Australia takes must be on the ground of impairment or threatened impairment of our **rights** under GATT.

* The Minister is well aware of the traditional methods of consultation of Aboriginal people and of the significance of land **rights** to these people.

* He has completely rejected the matter of Aboriginal land **rights**, on which he has written so eloquently in the  Northern Territory News.

* Under the extremely repressive provisions of the Atomic Energy Act and the associated Approved Defence Projects Protection Act, the Government has the power to deny ordinary industrial **rights** to the workers and unions involved in the mining, handling and transportation of uranium.

* The civil **rights** of persons who hinder or oppose the project are not guaranteed.

* Australia adopted a covenant in the United Nations and said that it would ensure political and civil **rights** to people.

* In that State there is no equality of political and civil **rights** such as we say should apply throughout the world.

* Electoral gerrymandering guarantees that people in Queensland do not have valid voting **rights** as they should have under the civil **rights** covenant.

* The Government introduced a Bill on the basis that there should be a human **rights** commission, but it will be just a breeding ground for complaints and it will have no ability to correct any of the defects.

* If the proposed commission finds something wrong in a State it will not be able to do anything but write a letter to the Premier and say that human **rights** are not being applied there as they should be, whether they be political **rights** or civil **rights**.

* Under the human **rights** covenant people are entitled to demonstrate peaceably.

* This Government has adopted a cosmetic approach in setting up a commission which has no legal teeth to correct defects or to fight against the complete destruction of human and civil **rights**.

* People are certain that they cannot enforce their **rights** and they have no idea whether their money is being wisely invested or misappropriated.

* The Government is talking about how it will support people's **rights**, but it does not have the ability to do so.

* If a person appointed as Commissioner or as an officer of the Commissioner was, immediately before his appointment, an officer of the Australian Public Service or a person to whom the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928-1973 applied- 
he retains his existing and accruing **rights**; 
for the purpose of determining those **rights**, his service as Commissioner or as an officer shall be taken into account as if it were service in the Australian Public Service; and 
the Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928-1973 applies as if this Act and this section had been specified in the Schedule to that Act.

* For too long this Parliament has tinkered with pieces of legislation  ad infinitum,  stacking them end on end so that we are disadvantaged in the way we debate them and the citizen who is trying to find out his or her **rights** and eligibility in respect of various things is also disadvantaged.

* It is argued that the other members of the community would look at public servants green with envy and demand that their **rights** and eligibilities should be increased to that level.

* Subsequently in 1952 a Labor government was returned and it set to work to change the legislation so that people who were elected to the Victorian Parliament from the Victorian Public Service would be able to return to their jobs with all **rights** reserved.

* Subsequently, just before I was elected to this Parliament, the Act was changed- as a matter of fact it was a good piece of behaviour by a Liberal government- so that people elected to the Australian Parliament would be able to return to their jobs up to a period of 9 years after their election with all their **rights** reserved.

* So I suggest to the Ministry that it immediately examines the situation in Victoria and places in the Australian Public Service Act, the provisions which permit members of the Public Service elected to a parliament to be able to return to the Public Service upon defeat or retirement with their **rights** reserved.

* I refer to the portability of **rights** and the ability to transfer from that service to the general Australian Public Service at will.

* In the recent amendment to the National Health Act the **rights** of persons who joined friendly societies prior to 24th April 1964 to receive rebates up to' the full amount of the new patient contribution, viz., one dollar, have been preserved.

* Let us just create all the conditions of violence, all the emotional stirring up, and all the means whereby there will be a reaction by the people against the usurpation of their **rights**, and if there is any violence blame the police and call them Fascist pigs.'

* Our young people are being prodded into situations where their emotions will be aroused, where violence must ensue, and where there is inevitably a clash with law and order or with ordinary decent citizens who do not want to see their **rights** usurped.

* With respect to the new **rights** of legal practitioners, clause 8 of the Judiciary Amendment Bill proposes the insertion of a new section to confer a new right on legal practitioners who are now entitled to practise in Federal courts to practise in any court of any State in a case where that court is exercising Federal jurisdiction.

* But T want to give some support to the argument that was put forward here tonight by the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who very satisfactorily demolished the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill as the most serious threat yet to State **rights**.

* We have prided ourselves on having a federal system of government, a system that has protected the **rights** of the individual.

* So every effort must be made by the Australian people to ensure that we do not allow the central government to whittle away the authority of the States and the **rights** of the States generally, as it appears to be doing.

* Of course, if this were done we would end up with a hotchpotch Senate representation which would take away the power of the Senate to protect the **rights** of the States.

* In fact, the former Government over the years extended greater powers to the member for the Northern Territory who today has full voting **rights** in this chamber, as he should.

* I see it as a very serious threat to the constitutional **rights** of the States.

* In fact the countries of the world which have been given the option of taking up their selling **rights**- the producers' club- are letting their **rights** pass beyond them to the next producer because they are waiting to sell at the right price.

* I can only regard the action by the people concerned as being in very poor taste and interfering with the **rights** of individuals to conduct their worship - in this case, Mass at the Cathedral throughout Sunday - and I hope that people who desire to protest in some way or another will respect the **rights** of people to worship in this country as they so wish, without this sort of impediment.

* But I should like to mention land **rights**, which is a practical problem.

* The acquisition of this land is a practical approach to the problem of land **rights** in which these people are interested.

* The Country Party members should be ashamed that they are part of the coalition that gave to the BHP-Esso group the sole **rights** to exploit the whole of the Bass Strait oil basin which has the richest oil bearing permeable sands in the world, ranging in depth from 280 ft to 320 ft.

* I will not go over the ground which we canvassed during the debate on the land **rights** legislation.

* However, I think that the re-creation of the Standing Committee in the form of a special land **rights** scrutiny committee is a good step towards strengthening the parliamentary committees.

* It is understandable that in circumstances where the **rights** of individuals are affected there should be deliberate consideration within this Parliament as to whether or not charges against them should be advanced and proceeded with.

* But the basis of my case in rejecting the amendment is not specifically that these offences were different from a breach of the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance; it is based on a concern which 1 think every member of this Parliament needs to have about the maintenance of respect for the police force and respect for the observation of laws and for the police in maintaining and protecting the **rights** of individuals in our society.

* It is obvious that the list of offences includes a number of offences which go to the very heart of what I would see as and would contend is fundamental if in our society we are to preserve and protect the **rights** of the police.

* The **rights** of the police are the **rights** of the individual.

* The **rights** of the individual are tremendously important to every man, woman and child in Australia.

* I am not alone, and the Opposition is not alone, in this concern because this year one of the outstanding developments in the field of Aboriginal affairs, the one that has perhaps drawn more public notice and comment than any other issue in Aboriginal affairs, was the one-eyed approach of the State Government in Queensland- I stress that it is of the same political colour as the Administration in the Northern Territory- over the matter of land **rights**.

* I know that there is strong feeling among whites in the Northern Territory that they have **rights** also.

* In the Committee stage of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill we will also spell out some of our misgivings with regard to the **rights** of Aboriginals.

* The misconceptions relate to the **rights** of Aborigines overriding those of whites.

* There has never been, and I cannot see that there ever will be, from the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council, the bodies responsible for negotiating land **rights** for the Northern Territory, a claim for anything like 50 per cent of the Territory.

* For our **rights**.

* They were asked: ' What **rights**? '

* The reply was: 
They were asked what **rights** were being denied them.

* I believe there has not been adequate consultation with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on this legislation as to what will happen to funding and what its **rights** will be.

* It is proposed that **rights** similar to those which apply under the Commonwealth legislation at the present time will be available under Northern Territory legislation upon that enactment.

* Surely they ought to be permitted to express their views as to the effects of the legislation on their income and their **rights**.

* I think it is very outrageous legislation, from the point of view that the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory has **rights** of its own.

* It is clear from High Court decisions that we can pass legislation which says that the people in the Territory will not have any **rights** at all.

* There are no guaranteed **rights** in respect of having a vote.

* I want to say something later about the Constitution which does not give any **rights**.

* This is no way in which to draft legislation to give to the people of the Northern Territory their own parliament, their own members of parliament and their own **rights**.

* People's **rights** can be completely removed.

* We should not appoint somebody to exercise all those **rights**.

* I refer here to concessions on television and radio licences, concessions on telephone services and certain **rights** in relation to the pensioner medical service and pensioner hospital benefits.

* They could, for instance, draw an Australian pension here and as a result of portability **rights** overseas could draw, for instance, a United Kingdom pension, a West German pension or a pension from any one of a number of countries.

* Agreements for the prevention of double taxation which Australia has with other countries give Australia taxing **rights** in respect of these people with the qualification, in the case of a United States resident where the visit is a short term one, that Australia's taxing **rights** are conditional upon the services in Australia not being performed on behalf of a United States resident Where this condition is not met the Australian earnings of a United States musician are exempt in Australia and taxable at home.

* Are steps being taken to remedy this imbalance of **rights** which presently operates to the disadvantage of Australian citizens?

* I think all of us felt that the servicemen of this country and their dependants had **rights** that perhaps were not the same as the **rights** enjoyed by staff members of the Commonwealth Bank, members of the civil service and so on.

* If one in those thousand was fortunate enough to find a viable ore body, then previously under paragraph 23 (p) the sale of the mining **rights** to that ore body were exempt from taxation.

* The prospector has been able to achieve a once in a lifetime windfall reward by selling mining **rights** to those areas.

* Again the deliberate attempts by the Government are to deny the **rights** of the people and the members of this Parliament and also to deny us an opportunity to debate the matters.

* The whole community must guarantee the legitimate **rights** of the most humble citizen.

* This Government is concerned to protect the **rights** of all its citizens.

* The basic issue in this legislation is individual **rights**.

* Australia has been very slow to introduce legislation which effectively protects the **rights** of consumers.

* The United States, which is often said to be the home of capitalist society, has had strong protective legislation for many years - legislation which guarantees the **rights** of consumers and which outlaws many of the insidious practices which have been allowed to go on in this country virtually unchecked.

* He claims and deplores that in North Vietnam those deprived of the **rights** of citizenship cannot vote.

* military or other help in defence of their democratic **rights**?

* By way of background, I might explain that voting **rights** are based on subscriptions to IDA.

* By general consensus, it had been decided that the additional resources put at IDA's disposal under the first and second replenishments should not affect existing voting **rights**.

* This was done by permitting countries to make additional subscriptionswhich carry voting **rights**- to IDA as well as contributions under the third replenishment, the relative proportions between the two varying in each instance so as to produce the overall adjustments in voting **rights** desired.

* Complex calculations undertaken by the staff of IDA indicate that, of the total amount which Australia is expected to make available to IDA over the next few years, the equivalent of US$590,525- that is $A399,003 calculated on the same basis as before- should take the form of an additional subscription with voting **rights**.

* Indians and for developing countries in negotiating mining **rights** and leases.

* It even envisaged using the national interest provisions of the land **rights** legislation to make sure that they were honoured.

* Chip and Pulp Co. Pty Ltd (an associate of Bunning's Timber Holdings Ltd) al Bunbury has timber **rights** granted by the Western Australian Government for the production of chips and is understood to bc negotiating with potential Japanese purchasers, lt is also understood that there are several other possible projects under examination in Victoria.

* In their battle to protect State **rights**, they have entirely forgotten the only **rights** that matter - the **rights** of the people, a right to expect protection from inflation.

* The fundamental electoral law hitherto has been that the electors of Australia are the people to worry about - that the people we are concerned with are the people who are citizens of Australia and who have **rights** as electors.

* Secondary students are not being taught their **rights** under hire purchase agreements; how to buy a house; how to complete a tax return or what to claim as deductions; what **rights** they have if they are arrested by the police; the pros and cons of health insurance and life insurance.

* The present law is that a company can deduct its prior year losses if it satisfies tests: Either a 'continuing ownership test' - that is, persons owning 40 per cent of its capital, voting and dividend right throughout the year of loss own similar **rights** throughout the year of deduction; or, alternatively, a 'same business test' - that is, it carries on the same business throughout the year of deduction as it carried on immediately before a disqualifying change in its shareholdings.

* Special provisions apply also, in certain circumstances, which enable the continuing ownership test to have regard to the indirect **rights** in the loss company of natural persons who are shareholders in companies interposed between those persons and the loss company.

* The amendments in this Bill will, firstly, increase the 40 per cent continuing ownership test to require  a  more than 50 per cent continuity of capital, dividend and voting **rights** in the loss company; secondly, remedy certain deficiencies in the safeguarding provisions relating to arrangements intended to defeat the purpose of the continuing ownership test; thirdly, remedy deficiencies in the existing tracing provisions to enable continuing interests in the loss company to be traced to natural persons through companies, trustees and partnerships interposed between the loss company and those natural persons; fourthly, enable the loss deduction to be denied in certain circumstances where the benefit of tax loss deduction is to be derived by 'outsiders' or where it is clear that the continuing shareholders in the loss company are not intended to receive the full monetary benefits of their apparent continuing interest in the company; and, fifthly, repeal the special provision relating to newlyincorporated companies.

* They have no **rights** to be here at all.

* The former Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory passed a series of resolutions between 1965 and 1967 seeking voting **rights** in referendums and the former Northern Territory Legislative Council passed a similar resolution on 1 1 October 1973.

* Honourable members will recall that a proposal to give Territory electors referendum voting **rights** was included in the Constitution Alteration (Mode of Altering the Constitution) Bill that failed at a referendum in 1974.

* In view of this known case of a serious violation of human **rights** in that no charges have been laid against the Archbishop, I ask the Minister whether, having regard for Monsignor Thuan 's reported declining health, fresh and strong representations will be made to the Vietnamese authorities asking for his immediate release?

* It is a question of members of this House having certain **rights** and privileges and having an opportunity to say what they want to say in the interests of their electorates.

* There again in that particular area there have been numerous cases where, simply because of the inability of the migrant to understand his **rights** and entitlements from government departmentsthis could apply particularly in relation to the Department of Social Security- he has been denied those **rights**.

* It is as well for the Government to remember that it has a responsibility to ensure that **rights** to every citizen, to every worker, are not denied simply because of the inability of the worker, being a migrant, to communicate in the normally used English language.

* My colleague the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott),  who is at present overseas, is strongly of the view that legislation should never take away established **rights**.

* They have asked for their **rights** often enough.

* As recently as 1 1 October this year the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory passed a resolution seeking voting **rights** in referendums on the same conditions as those enjoyed by citizens in the States.

* They have been denied their **rights** for too long.

* I hope that in the future, when circumstances permit, it will be possible to restrain total expenditure and still preserve the **rights** and privileges of the disadvantaged people in Australia by ensuring that the whole spectrum of welfare payments is applied more selectively and less universally.

* In fact the statements that have been made already by me and by the Prime Minister concerning Aboriginal land **rights** indicate the commitment of this Government to significant reforms in Aboriginal affairs.

* That is the way I would hope that my ministry will demonstrate to the Aboriginal people, and beyond them to all Australians, as the way in which we must treat these people who are our equals as citizens; people who have the same **rights** as you and I; people who deserve the same support as you and I, and because of their particular position in society people who must receive special treatment from Government.

* But inevitably it will happen if we allow the part-bloods and those full-bloods who have no traditional ties but who may be a little on the smart side to come in and usurp by their superior skills in committees, by their superior command of the European language, and by their superior knowledge of European law, or whatever it may be, the real **rights** of the traditional Aboriginals.

* Mr Speaker,  I hope that you will look into the question of whether this has a potential for interference with the **rights** and the duties of the staff of this Parliament and that the Indonesian 
Government is told that we regard its action as an impertinence.

* I know that there are some honourable members opposite who think that the Indonesians have **rights** in Timor.

* Even if they think Indonesia has **rights** in Timor, it has no right to interfere with the activities of an Australian citizen.

* But Opposition members say that the law already covers the offences created by the Bill, that the Bill is repressive and imposes restrictions on individual liberty that are quite unwarranted and that it attempts to prevent people from exercising their basic **rights**.

* Instead of imagining what the Bill says and fulminating against it, they should read the clauses of the Bill, read the limitations that it does impose on conduct that should be condemned and practices that should be penalised and read the qualifications and the exemptions that are written into the Bill to protect people charged with offences under the Bill, and they will see that the Bill is not restrictive or oppressive and that it does not impose unjustified limitations on the exercise of people's liberties and **rights**.

* They did not restrict the **rights** of anybody in the Northern Territory or anywhere else.

* This is the reason why moves have been made at all levels - in this Government, in State governments and at international level - to preserve some of the **rights** of the citizen.

* I shall list some of these **rights**.

* This right should be written into the United Nations Charter of Human Rights and every other charter of **rights**.

* It should be written into a Bill of **rights** in this country.

* Families have their own **rights**.

* Again, wherever **rights** and sovereignty exist, there will also be duties.

* We have to be prepared to curtail these **rights**.

* I am not arguing against law and order at one level just because I am asking for **rights** at another level.

* The **rights** of the head of a family to decide what his child shall eat.

* what sort of medical attention he shall have, what sort of education he shall have and so on are curtailed - and rightfully so - by the laws which safeguard the **rights** of the child.

* There is a need for the community at large to be more concerned about the **rights** within the family group without trespassing on the sovereignty of the family.

* There is no such thing as -the **rights** of a tribe.

* I am one who is inclined to say that only people have **rights** and that government and state **rights** are just cloaks or devices to deprive people of **rights**.

* The other aspect is that the lump sum return under the Crean scheme could be used to purchase additional pension **rights**.

* Part of it could be used to purchase additional pension **rights**.

* A contributor must use the whole of the lump sum to purchase additional pension **rights**.

* He cannot say that he will take half as a lump sum payment and use half to purchase additional pension **rights**.

* Another important example of inflexibility is the denial of the right to pick up units which have been rejected and which, under the Crean scheme, people would have been able to pick up 3 months before or 3 months after a new scheme was introduced and claim them as full pension **rights**.

* These are basic **rights**, one would think, that a person should have, and if they are refused there ought to be some right to have the matter reviewed.

* I hope that the 
Attorney-General, when preparing this legislation, will give careful thought to whether, in his desire to protect human **rights** about which he speaks often, he will at least protect the citizen from the decisions of Ministers of the Crown which may be just as defective because Ministers rely on the advice and support of bureaucratic people in making their decisions.

* I suggest that these are areas of human **rights** which are of tremendous importance to people in our community.

* The Opposition has as its paramount objective to draft into citizen **rights** and responsibilities young men and young women at the age of 18.

* Everything else - the question of proprietary **rights**, the **rights** of inheritance and other matters that have been detailed by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  are ancillary to it and a positive and firm lead is necessary, particularly when there is a growing climate of public opinion in support of the long overdue change of the law.

* It is creating an atmosphere in which people who have **rights** are being denied those **rights**.

* We need more established **rights** and less arbitrary discretion being practised by Directors-General or other members of the Department of Social Security.

* Finally a technical amendment is being made in connection with the **rights** of a tax agent to apply for a review of concellation of registration as a tax agent.

* During the events of 1 1 November- momentous for the Parliament, for  the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions, for Australia's reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the **rights** of Parliament.

* It is no fault of the honourable member for Corio that his message went unheeded and unheard, that the Governor-General refused to see him until after the dissolution of Parliament was proclaimed, that the  Speaker  was insulted by the representative of the Queen, and that the office of  Speaker  and all the **rights** and privileges it embodies were treated with contempt.

* He did not rest in his endeavours to redress the wrong that was done to this institution and to defend the **rights** of honourable members.

* The **rights** of the Australian Parliament in relation to the Crown remain unclear.

* I put it to you,  Mr Deputy Speaker-  I know you to be a reasonable man- what **rights** have people who have no advantage because of disability, station in life or a variety of other reasons, to live their lives in the way they want to live them?

* They have no **rights** at all.

* Mr Speaker,  I would welcome your examination of the matter and any advice or comment you feel able to give me in respect of the implication of this matter has on the **rights** of members of this House.

* It is curious that in the House of Representatives, where there is only one woman member, it falls to the lot of most male members of the House to protect women's **rights** against the wishes of many women's organisations.

* There are the proposals of the AttorneyGeneral, which were described in the Press recently, to introduce a human **rights** type Bill which would guarantee or state the fundamental importance of human **rights** as they have been declared in the United Nations.

* The Government is providing money to finance legal aid so that the ordinary citizens can gain access to the courts through the normal independent legal profession and so assert and protect their **rights**.

* There are also proposals for administrative law reform under which citizens who are aggrieved by administrative decisions can, by having access to legal aid and salaried legal services, assert and protect their **rights**.

* That can be overcome by such things as charter flight **rights** and better communications.

* It had nothing to do with tents or with people camping on Commonwealth Crown Land, The real opposition from the Government, the real thing that offended it, the real thing it could not stomach, was the reminder out there by those 2 flags, the sign 'Aboriginal Embassy' in a symbolic form, and the tents, that these people claim land **rights** - something that was taken from them many years ago.

* The Aborigines made it clear that they hoped to stay there until Parliament began sitting in order to make their point - the Minister says it was a political point - concerning a claim for land **rights**.

* Until that time that demonstration had been the most successful peaceful symbol of the Aboriginal claim for land **rights** that one could possibly imagine.

* The Embassy had been a peaceful symbol of the Aboriginals' claim for land **rights**.

* After all, we remember that the thread running through the Minister's speeches has been that 'perhaps they do not want land **rights**; perhaps they want a club or something like that in Canberra'; or 'Perhaps if I offer them something they will go away and they will not trouble me with their unpleasant, embarrassing political demands'.

* The clenched fist salute was given and chants for land **rights** could be heard.

* They talked about the cause of Aborigines and the cause of land **rights**.

* I ask the Parliament to give serious consideration to this matter and to remember that we are dealing with the **rights** and privileges of a group of people who are just as much part of Australia as we are.

* One is that Israel should withdraw from territories which she occupied by force; the other is that the Palestinian people have **rights** as well.

* Those who are now speaking about the **rights** of the individual should examine what choices are open to the individual or young married couples under the present system.

* Then there is the question of human **rights**.

* On each occasion Australia found that the States would not co-operate in permitting the Commonwealth to ratify international conventions in the field of human **rights**.

* Where there is an ILO requirement for State legislation, where there is in practice a requirement for Human **rights** legislation by the States, where is the co-operation?

* In relation to human **rights** I have quoted conventions from 1950 onwards and in relation to maritime matters I have quoted conventions from 1957 onwards.

* It is important for Australia to assert its **rights** to fisheries, to the sea bed, and to the riches of the sea bed and of the territorial sea.

* In what shape is our nation, in what shape is the present Government or any future government at international conferences when it is dealing with these resources and with transit **rights**?

* These alternative penalties would have been to suspend the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the union, or all of a section of its members, the power to suspend a union officer or officers, power to give direction as to the exercise of any **rights**, privileges or capacities that had been suspended and power to restrict the use of union funds or property.

* Furthermore, the effect of the legislation was that all the members of a union or a certain group of members or some individual members could be deprived of their **rights** to hold any position in the union or to nominate for any position in the union.

* It has withdrawn all the so-called **rights** of individuals clauses, all the new penal provisions and some of the more horrendous parts of the Bureau's operations have been withdrawn.

* I wanted to raise the matters of narcotics, civil **rights**, security and some of the things which happen at international conferences and which relate to the human **rights** of parliamentarians.

* We on this side of the House share the traditional view about the Government's **rights** in money matters.

* At this point I move: 
The next proposed provision to which I shall refer arises from a problem which has caused much dissatisfaction among people who lose their franchise **rights** when they are posted overseas as representatives of a Government or a public authority.

* If we add to that list the problems created by the behaviour of Parliament itself- the destruction of convention, the defiance of reason, the pursuit of power without concern for the **rights** and privileges of minorities- Australians will have little faith in the future of Australian democracy.

* At this time, when we newer Australians are' about to enjoy one of our traditions, namely the Christmas holidays, has the Government at last some good news for those older Australians, our Aboriginal people, particularly concerning their modest land **rights** claims?

* He was the man who produced a nonsensical Bill about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* He gets up in this House and attacks the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly- people who have been born in the Northern Territory, and who have worked in the Northern Territory and who would know far more than the whole of his former Department put together, about land **rights**, Aboriginal sacred sites and Aboriginal law.

* Above all, they were to be assisted by being informed of the many **rights** which their new country afforded them.

* He is the real communicator between the migrant community in that area and their **rights** in the Australian community.

* They do not want someone in their midst who is able to explain the **rights** of a worker to a worker.

* If their own leadership is not giving them that chance, this Government, through the action it is taking, undoubtedly will give a greater chance to the majority of workers to assert their views, their **rights** and their aspirations.

* I am amazed at the attitude of some of the members of this Parliament who try to make this a question only of State **rights**.

* Equally, it is unsatisfactory to contemplate a renewal of exploration **rights** on 72,000 square miles for which the present Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act provides.

* Obviously he has not read the Bill because the provisions of the Bill go far beyond this and they give specific **rights** to Trans-Australia Airlines that are not being provided for Ansett Transport Industries.

* The major thrust of the legislation encompasses the conditions and **rights** of employees of the State railway systems transferring to the Australian National Railways Commission.

* Superannuation **rights** and entitlements of transferring employees are set out in clause 12.

* No **rights** of tenancy are created by residence in .

* One of them, for example, declares that the tenants of a certain establishment have limited **rights**.

* He huffs and puffs, as do many members on the Liberal Party and National Country Party side, on the question of Russia and human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* This House set up the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which in turn set up a sub-committee chaired by  Senator Wheeldon  dealing with human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* They will see just how frequently not a single member of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party attends meetings of that sub-committee, which was set up following a resolution of this chamber to investigate the question of human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* He is not concerned in the slightest with the question of human **rights**.

* The resolution that was passed last weekend by the Victorian conference of the Australian Labor Party to which the honourable member referred, states quite clearly the Labor Party's support for human **rights** in all countries and condemns attacks on those human **rights**, whether they occur in totalitarian regimes of the Right or the Left.

* In passing the powers from the Australian Parliament to that of Papua New Guinea the legislation does not canvass the implications of fishing and the intertwining of fishing **rights** in areas that are adjacent to both countries.

* There is no dispute about the **rights** of the indigenous Papuan New Guinea fishermen operating in waters in the Torres Strait and elsewhere where the 2 countries traditionally or Papua New Guineans in particular and people from the Torres Strait Islands have exercised their fishing interests.

* It is of course also true that as far as ocean resources are concerned the question of the **rights** of countries which have extensive ocean boundaries is under discussion within various law of the sea conferences that are being conducted around the world.

* Whatever the resolution of the extent of territorial waters, I believe that it is important for countries like Papua New Guinea and Australia not only to gain the maximum jurisdiction over these waters but also to ensure that they take advantage of the fishing **rights** within those waters.

* Funds for welfare migrant facilities and welfare **rights** services have been reduced by 12 per cent in real terms from a miserable $800,000 last year to an even more miserable $750,000 this year.

* In other more enlightened countries, such as the United States of America, the public's voice is heard, its **rights** are protected by statute and this whole matter is a question of public inquiry and public documentation.

* It includes protection of the **rights** of public servants appointed to the statutory offices.

* One would think that we ought expressly to give some power of review in such matters which concern the **rights** of a very great number of persons to pursue occupations in Australia or to secure citizen **rights** in Australia.

* It will make a very great contribution to citizen **rights** in this country.

* The third is that in matters of fundamental importance, such as security of life and limb, all members of society have equal **rights** and claims upon society.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Although the sovereignty issue is not, strictly speaking, sub judice it certainly needs to be resolved before anybody will know what the true position is as to who has the **rights** and whether the Commonwealth law can be said to be legal.

* Part I and Part II of that enactment include a claim by the Commonwealth to sovereignty and to sovereign **rights** in respect of the territorial sea and internal waters excluding those that were subject to State sovereignty in 1900 and including not only internal waters but also the continental shelf.

* Laws and regulations determining **rights** to the use of water can affect the distribution of prosperity.

* It preserves the **rights** of ex-servicemen, formerly members of the Torres Strait Light Infantry Forces, who will now be brought under the provisions of the Repatriation Act.

* However, because of the geographic location of the Torres Strait Islands, their remoteness, and the limitations of sea transportation between the islands, this time limit has been extended to 6 months for persons resident in the Torres Strait Islands, so that no member will be disadvantaged in respect of the exercise of his **rights** of appeal.

* It is important to the persons who will benefit therefrom and who will henceforth enjoy the same **rights** under the same legislation as all Australians who were members of the defence forces.

* They consider that this is a monstrous piece of legislation; that it has been badly conceived and poorly drawn up, that it gives unfettered, enormous power to an authority, a Minister and a government over which Parliament has little scrutiny; that it conflicts with many of the sovereign **rights** of the States in the handling of mineral affairs; that it gives to the authority and the Minister enormous power to acquire mineral projects in Australia; and that it gives the authority unlimited advantages which discriminate very severely against private mining operations in this country.

* State **rights** are over-ridden to a very broad extent.

* My Government is committed to see that Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders have **rights** under the law to the land which they and their forebears have used.

* It has not done, as some other States have done, given **rights** to that land to the Aborigines as individuals or families.

* One of the first acts that my Government took was to request that  Mr Justice  - 
I wish briefly to express a concern which really follows upon the concern I expressed in relation to subclause (4) of clause 29, and that is that a party or group of persons may, under the fairly wide criteria which I envisage under clause 29, be given legal assistance in respect of an action which does not involve the prosecution of individual **rights**, which does not involve an attempt to recover damages or to assert a claim to property, but which might, for example, involve an environmental action against a particular company, either large or small.

* I do not deny him that right for one minute; I think it is part of his **rights** as a member of Parliament.

* In keeping with the Government's commitment to civil **rights** and administrative justice, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of Ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area.

* However, I believe that it is necessary to retain that requirement for the practical means of protecting not only the financial **rights** of a spouse or former spouse but also to guard against this situation of child abduction and removal from the country.

* Briefly, with certain exceptions, they include persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial **rights** has been obtained.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure that, as far as possible, passports are not issued to persons who are likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country, or the **rights** and welfare of its citizens.

* Whilst it could be argued that the denial of travel facilities to extremists, terrorists and drug pedlars could be in violation of a basic human right, I believe that the risk to the **rights** of others that is posed by these persons is a more important consideration.

* Grants to organisations for welfare **rights** services have been cut by one-fifth.

* That article provides that a State Party may at any time declare that it recognises the competence of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive and consider communications from individuals or groups of individuals within its jurisdiction claiming to be victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the **rights** set forth in the Convention.

* There is one thing that this Government has demonstrated in these cuts, namely, its utter contempt for the needs, aspirations and **rights** of our ethnic communities.

* Under the Australian Labor Party Government for the first time ethnic groups were given a fair go- 
Has his attention also been drawn to indexed item 7 1 - Melville report on portability of superannuation **rights**.

* Another new provision will require the value of benefits received under a stock option or share purchase scheme to be measured at the time of the exercise of the option or on the transfer of the shares rather than, as at present, when the **rights** are acquired.

* Capital expenditure on the development of a mine or oil field, on the provision of community facilities adjacent to a mine or field, or on the purchase of mining **rights** or information will be deductible henceforth over the estimated life of the mine or field.

* First of all the honourable member- I think I quote him fairly accurately- referred to the need to protect in a democratic way the **rights** of people carrying out functions, presumably in these waters.

* Social Security to examine the rather vexed problem of the reciprocity of pension **rights** with Malta.

* Whether one takes a legal view or a practical view, whether one talks about **rights** which have been accrued or about reasonable expectations, the fact of the matter is that I believe the legislation involves the application of retrospectivity and to that extent I find it offensive.

* But I do not believe that the Parliament should blithely amend or change a situation and deprive people of the **rights** which they believed they had accrued.

* My own view is that we have demonstrated ourselves to be a Government concerned with the **rights** of the individual, and with the right of the individual to have executive and administrative decisions reviewed.

* As far as custody is concerned, the problem of the disputes beyond the reach of the Family Law Act is part of a wider need for uniform State and Territory laws as to custody, including custody and **rights** of ex-nuptial children.

* That the proposed expenditure be reduced by  $2,  as aB indication to the Government that recent events in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea for which the Government is responsible constitute a danger to the civil liberties and **rights** of the people of those Territories.

* Mr Chairman,  the purpose of the amendment is to persuade the House and the Government that civil **rights** and civil liberties are not being enhanced as they should be or even protected in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea at this time.

* Civil **rights** legislation can be of two kinds.

* There is the repressive kind of legislation that is not civil **rights** legislation but is the antithesis of it.

* People learn about civil **rights** and civil liberties when they have a Bill of Rights to guide and influence them.

* They know its value and they would never put up with the inroads upon their **rights** that are accepted without question in many countries without a Bill of Rights, and indeed in this country.

* However, the legislation that expresses this Government's view on civil **rights** is to be found in the Public Order Ordinance and its recent attack on the role of the Public Solicitor in New Guinea.

* It is terribly important that people should know what their **rights** are.

* I would think that most people in Australia would recognise that residents of the Territories are citizens of Australia and that they should not be excluded by some narrow legal definition from exercising their **rights** to vote in national referendums.

* Thus  Mr Home  and his family have since been permitted - as an act of grace, mark you - but subject to extraordinary prohibitions on his **rights** as a citizen, restrictions which cannot be linked by any stretch of the imagination with legitimate forestry purposes, to stay in the home until the end of this month.

* I know, and every honourable member knows, that the State must possess immense powers to set aside individual **rights** even to the extent of individual injustice in a time of grave emergency to the State.

* The amendment claims that full and proper recognition be given to the status and **rights** of a woman as wife and mother.

* Perhaps I should remind the Minister that, in his judgment, Chief Justice Barwick said that sovereign **rights** to explore and exploit this area belong to the Australian Government in the right of the Crown and not the States.

* The functions of the Designated Authority under the Federal Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in the granting of exploration or production **rights**, the definition of areas, the payment and collection of royalties and other moneys and the conditions of drilling intensity are exclusively Commonwealth functions in the exercise of Commonwealth sovereignty.

* I can see no provision for the father of the unborn child to exercise his responsibilities or his **rights**.

* But if it is accepted, as I accept, that a third person is involved, there must be laws to protect the **rights** of that person - a person incapable of defending his or her own **rights**.

* It seems that the court had no doubt that this child - although only a matter of a few weeks past conception at the time of the accident - certainly had the legal **rights** of other members of the community.

* I believe that in a democratic society the emphasis must be placed on the **rights** - including the right to life and the right to fulfilment - of the individual.

* This is in contrast to a totalitarian society in which the right of the individual is subordinated to the **rights** of the state.

* I am concerned that we should not allow ourselves to move, perhaps unwittingly and certainly not consciously, into a kind of society which accepts the subordination of the **rights** of the individual, including his most fundamental **rights**.

* to be not an expression of the liberation of a woman but an affront to her womanhood and a denial of her **rights** if it is suggested that all responsibility for avoiding or terminating an unwanted pregnancy should rest with that woman alone.

* The motion that has been moved in this notice is that a select committee of the House be established to inquire into and report on extending and guaranteeing Aboriginal voting **rights** and obligations- I emphasise the word 'obligations'- for the Federal, State and Territory parliaments.

* The fact of the matter is that Aboriginals have voting **rights**.

* I suppose that there is no question of extending those **rights**.

* It is also a fact that in recent experience in the Northern Territory, in both Federal and Territory elections, it has been shown that the existing procedures are adequate and that there is a very high degree of awareness amongst members of the Aboriginal population of their voting **rights**.

* They are being educated progressively how to exercise those **rights**.

* We still hear people argue, for example, that the Senate is a useful house of review and also the house which, because of its equal State representation, can be looked to for the protection of the **rights** of the States.

* Last year prior to his visit to Indonesia,  Mr Hayden  was full of assertiveness about human **rights**.

* Apart from these political prisoners, did you raise with any of the people with whom you spoke the question of the human **rights** problem?

* Both have **rights**.

* Unfortunately the law has not denned the **rights** of the unborn child, the least of which, surely, is the right to live.

* The honourable member for Hume, in his opening remarks, pointed out: 
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has indicated in its report on consumer policy in member countries that there is now general acceptance of the need for governments to take action to reinforce the consumer's position with these objectives in mind: To protect the consumer against hazards to safety and health; to protect the consumer against deceptive and other unfair practices; to provide the consumer with adequate **rights** and means of redress; to provide information and education to facilitate a sound choice by the consumer, and to facilitate the proper exercise of the consumer's **rights**; and to involve consumer representatives in the formulation of regulations or other elements of economic policies which concern them.

* The fine print in contracts, guarantees, warranties and the like excluding the customer's legitimate **rights** is now void or of no effect.

* I knew that we would clash in some areas of deep social policy such as land **rights** and so on, but, generally speaking, when it comes to treating people the way people ought to be treated, there is not a great deal of difference in the Australian community between left, right and centre about the immediate needs of the person on the ground.

* It is pointless to argue that health is the responsibility of the States or to talk about State **rights**.

* It is pointless, on the other hand, to talk about Commonwealth Government **rights**.

* We must acknowledge the existence of the various States and not talk about State **rights**.

* They are special drawing **rights** - led to a renewed easing of quotations.

* If an alliance is to mean anything it bestows both **rights** and responsibilities.

* But we also have **rights** and these are particularly important when the United States is indulging in brinkmanship in Indo-China which could lead to Chinese intervention or he possibility of the use of nuclear weapons.

* They are forfeiting Australia's **rights**.

* The Attorney-General may get up and say that a young fellow has the right of appeal, that he has the right to go and get a legal eagle to represent him - he has a whole host of **rights**.

* But does he have these **rights** if he does not have the financial resources?

* We have a responsibility to speak up for the cause of human **rights** in all countries, and nowhere are these less respected than in Uganda.

* The honourable member for St George  (Mr Neil)  referred in this House last year to the report of the International Commission of Jurists of May 1974 which showed evidence of a massive and continuing violation of human **rights** in Uganda which suggested a planned campaign of systematic liquidation.

* I would like to think that the Prime Minister of this country, or of any country interested in the preservation of human **rights**, would be seated at the same conference table as  President  Amin.

* It is time for us to express our views in a frank, honest and direct way not only in relation to Uganda but also in relation to all countries which suppress human **rights** and prostitute human dignity.

* The man who now wears the shoes of Prime Minister and who in March of this year was speaking of the **rights** of Parliament, before a month had passed was causing Bills to be rushed through this House and the Parliament to sit at all hours and into the morning so that he might close down the Parliament as soon as possible.

* He neglected the **rights** of Parliament further a fortnight ago when he was hell bent on disregarding the views of Parliament on the subject of the appointment of Assistant Ministers.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  spoke about the **rights** of conscientious objectors, but a person has to be a conscientious objector to all wars, not only to the particular undeclared war in Vietnam.

* Sixthly, if section 45D becomes law, not only will the **rights** of employee organisations to represent their members be at an end, but also the **rights** of all citizens to seek betterment of their way of life will be under threat.

* Does the Attorney-General propose to engage American lawyers to assist in drafting legislation on restrictive trade practices and Aboriginal land **rights**.

* I recall challenging the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  a few weeks ago to declare the Government's policy in respect of a referendum to be held in the term of this Parliament to determine the **rights** of each of the 2 Houses.

* Those honourable members opposite who support the actions of last November betray their **rights** as members of the House of Representatives.

* The Minister knows that the immigration ministers asked that urgent attention be given to the question of **rights**^' of Australian workers or their dependants if they lived in another State or went to" live in another country.

* Before we allow to pass out of the control of this Parliament the determination of the **rights** and privileges of Aborigines, including the right of Aborigines to live their own lives, I think proper and carefully set out legislation which deals with the tribal Aborigines and their **rights** to live in the manner in which they wish to live in the Northern Territory should be established.

* It is absolutely essential that we should assert the **rights** of Aborigines to be Aborigines.

* In the last week, the Minister for Trade and Resources  (Mr Anthony)  has been saying that if certain mining contracts were not signed then the land **rights** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory could be in jeopardy.

* I should like to thank the Commissioner for the work that he has done and the steps that have been taken to launch us upon a very important and complicated project - the establishment of the land **rights** of the Aboriginal people of .

* I should like to inform honourable members that the Government has considered the report and the Commission's recommendations and has authorised me to convene meetings of the 2 proposed Aboriginal land **rights** councils in the Northern Territory as soon as possible.

* It was 10 years ago that we started to campaign about Aboriginal land **rights** for the people of Yirrkala.

* It did not affect incorporated or unincorporated businesses by way of acquisitions of assets and mineral **rights**.

* Accordingly, administrative practices were introduced to maintain some control over incorporated or unincorporated businesses by means of acquisitions of assets and mineral **rights**.

* First, takeovers covered by the 1972 policy measures, that is, takeovers of businesses by means of asset acquisitions and takeovers of mineral **rights**.

* These comprise company takeovers effected by means of acquisitions of shares other than voting shares; company takeovers effected by means of splitting a large shareholding into small nominee groups where this has the effect of increasing the voting **rights** attached to the shareholding; business takeovers effected by means of leases or licences over the assets of a business; and business takeovers effected by agreements and arrangements relating to board representation **rights** and **rights** to participate in the management or profits of a business.

* For a few hours yesterday on the lawns outside this House a few pieces of canvass flew as an assertion of the **rights** and dignity of the Australian Aborigines.

* Today this Bill has been brought in to delay another historically inevitable event - the assertion by the Australian Aborigines of their **rights** as human beings.

* It sees itself in the role of being a watchdog of the **rights** of the community.

* What would be feasible, however, is a simple amendment to the law to provide for a right of appeal to a court, which amendment would not only safeguard Latham's democratic **rights** but also the **rights** of others who may find themselves on the receiving end of union muscle.

* After all, Latham's **rights** are representative of the **rights** of all Australians, **rights** that Parliament is duty bound to protect.

* Surely then the New South Wales Government exists to protect the democratic **rights** of its citizens.

* I will continue to fight for their **rights** even though regrettably their preferences do not always come my way.

* There are many ramifications of land **rights** which can legitimately be commented on in debating this Bill.

* I move: 
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: whilst not opposing the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Government as soon as possible should extend by legislation the **rights** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory to Aborigines in the Australian Capital Territory '.

* The whole aim and spirit of land **rights** legislation indicates that this land should be dealt with on the same basis as any other land which is assigned, recognised and reserved for Aborigines as their traditional land.

* Land councils have shown themselves not always to be fully apprised of the **rights** and interests of local traditional land owners.

* The tactics are clear: Needle the unionist until he fights for his **rights**; then batter him into submission.

* In the last decade tremendous emphasis has been placed on the resources of the oceans and the development of oil and natural gas exploration **rights**.

* The right honourable member for Higgins mentioned a decision which apparently has been taken by a State government to give exclusive fishing **rights** to a foreign company to operate in Australian waters.

* The present laws as they relate to Australian waters - the 3- mile limit, the territorial limit, the fishing **rights**) - will have to be looked at thoroughly at the United Nations convention next year.

* Many other countries, particularly in Latin America, already have made unilateral decisions regarding changes in the breadth of the territorial sea as it relates to fishing **rights** in the limits of the outer continental shelf.

* It is important that the Australian and State governments and industry interests work in close harmony to achieve our aims and accordingly, all members of the Commission should be equal and have full voting **rights**.

* The basic minimal human **rights** laid down in the Helsinki Pact of 1975 are already being dishonoured in Czechoslovakia.

* I hope that Australia is prepared to express a view, and to express a strong view if necessary, at Belgrade this year at the conference to consider the application of the Helsinki Pact, that we as a country believe it is about time that those countries behind the Iron Curtain which deny basic civil **rights** to their citizens should think again and should at least acknowledge that they have a responsibility to ensure that those who live within their boundaries have the same basic freedoms and **rights** as we enjoy in Australia.

* We believe in the enrichment which can come from diversity, but not when it comes to waste; not when it comes to atavistic, backward-looking theories which come back in over-simplistic terms to States **rights** as though States were people.

* ls he able to give details of the land **rights** extended to Aboriginal peoples in (a) Canada and (b) the United States of America by (i) state or provincial and (ii) federal legislatures, including the dates of commencement of the **rights**.

* Can he give details of (a) Federal and (b) State government actions which, since Federation, have (i) increased and (ii) decreased the size of Aboriginal reserves in Australia, including in the answer the dates of the actions, the amendments to areas of reserves and a note on whether Aborigines **rights** on resrved land were restricted in any way.

* In relation to part (3) can he say whether any non-Aboriginals were given economic **rights** over the land affected and, if they were, can he also say (a) what was the nature of these **rights** and (b) if the **rights** were extended to (i) local and 
The first thing J should like to say is that this is not a permanent measure.

* The fact of the matter is that no other government ever took away from private members more of their **rights** in this Parliament than did those who sit opposite.

* Honourable members opposite refer to the whittling down of members' **rights** in respect of the one minute that will be used up in the ringing of the bells and say that Cabinet Ministers and others could easily reach the chamber in 2 minutes.

* Members opposite claim that we are restricting their **rights**.

* I urge the House to support the motion and give away one minute in the interests of restoring democracy to the Parliament and  maintaining the **rights** of members to vote here.

* Anyone travelling under Commonwealth auspices should have the same **rights** and privileges in relation to seeking som.pensation by themselves or their families.

* There are far too many people today who keep prattling about their **rights** who should be more concerned with living up to their own duties and responsibilities.'

* It was completely fallacious for the honourable member for Angas to argue that this Bill is one that will protect the **rights**, of minorities.

* The plain fact is that this Bill is aimed against the **rights** of people in this country to dissent.

* Its most objectionable feature is that it does nothing to indicate clearly what the **rights** to lawful assembly are in this country.

* Rather it further constricts **rights** to protest and obscures just what is allowed and what is not in the public streets.

* This usually takes the form of sanctimonious expression on the lines that there is a right and proper way to exercise these inalienable **rights**.

* But the components of this right and proper way to express these **rights** are never defined.

* A lead is never given on what is the right- way to express these **rights**.

* His  **rights** are not prescribed; they are discretionary and this discretion is defined in only the crudest and vaguest of terms.

* These are measures which could have been undertaken to give substance to the claim by the Government that the Bill would give a meaningful form to basic **rights**.

* If a positive acknowledgment were made of the validity of public protest and the **rights** and duties of public dissenters were written into the law, then most of the problems associated with public demonstration in Australia would be eliminated.

* I ask the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  when he responds to confirm my understanding of his reply in the second reading debate that he will take up with the Trade Practices Commission the question of its views on the adequacy of its **rights** of intervention under proposed new section 163a which is to be inserted in the principal Act by means of clause 1 5 of this Bill.

* Nabalco to establish their traditional land **rights** at Gove and in which the Commonwealth helped with their costs.

* In those 2 years none of the States have moved to assert their **rights**.

* In the 2 years since this Bill was shelved the States have not conferred on asserting their **rights** or approaching the Commonwealth.

* I believe that if we have anything in us at all we have to be concerned with human **rights** round the world.

* We are concerned here with civil **rights** not only in the Soviet Union but also throughout the world.

* God alone knows, there is a lack of civil **rights** in that area .

* Are the members of this other committee, because of remarks that have been made by certain people in this House and in the other House, to ignore the lack of human **rights** that has already become evident to that committee?

* Because they trade where they want to trade there is an extra responsibility on us as members of Parliament to show that we are concerned in taking evidence about human **rights** round the world.

* Above all, the important aspect of this document is that a group of members from both sides of this Parliament was given the responsibility to look into human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* That is not an unreasonable time, considering the state of the mails in this country, considering the isolation of many people in country areas and considering the **rights** and interests of the sick and infirm who have to cast votes in this way.

* The first past the post system takes away the **rights** of electors.

* It also eliminates the **rights** of candidates with little party support or candidates representing small parties to have counted whatever support they do have in the electorate.

* It shows the intelligence of this Government to suggest that the **rights** of the individual must always be maintained, yet from the point of view of conscientious objection no judicial test of its validity has been put in the Government's legislation; no union can test it.

* It will give a balance at the Federal level to those additional **rights** which presently exist for citizens at the 
It is necessary for the public to realise that the office of ombudsman is not a complete end in itself.

* I see the introduction of an ombudsman as a further link forged for the **rights** of the individual and the citizen.

* -The Opposition feels that to make this legislation completely clear with respect to the **rights** of miners, mining companies or exploration companies that may have **rights**, licences or permits within an area of the Australian coastal seas that may be considered for proclamation purposes, an amendment is necessary to this clause.

* Accordingly I move: 
After sub-clause 6, insert the following sub-clause: '(6a) Any proclamation shall be subject to any **rights**, licences and permits acquired under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-1973.'

* It is felt that to make the legislation perfectly clear with respect to **rights**, licences and permits that may have been acquired under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967-73 in an area that could be an area to be preserved or proclaimed by the Governor-General for the purposes of establishing a marine national park, an amendment is necessary.

* In 1936 that member was given his first voting **rights**, and that was in respect of the disallowance of ordinances.

* In 1959 he was given wider **rights** of voting on specific matters affecting the Northern Territory.

* In 1968 he was given full voting **rights**.

* There is no constitutional bar to the representation with full voting **rights** of the Territories in this House but there is a constitutional bar, I would think, to the representation of those Territories in the other House.

* I believe that they are being denied their **rights** to test the validity of the direction of the Department because of the financial penalties which would accrue if this matter were taken to litigation.

* The Government at this stage has not announced that those persons who are employed by it in the Government Aircraft Factories will have their accrued **rights** protected - and this is a very important factor - in any merger.

* It may be that in future these **rights** will be protected, but at the moment no such announcement has been made.

* I ask the Government, as I have asked it in the past, to make that sort of announcement so that people who may be affected by a merger can have peace of mind from the knowledge that they will not lose their accrued employment **rights**.

* This Bill enables our security organisation to have powers that on any view of it greatly infringe upon and impede the **rights** and the liberties of the Australian citizen.

* It would not matter if I were a member of a Labor government and this Bill were our legislation, I would say that the security and the protection of the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people would be enhanced and safeguarded by the simple fact that the Leader of the Opposition whoever he may be- whether it is the present Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  or the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who is sitting at the table, or anyone of a host of prominent members of the Liberal Party- would be kept fully informed as of right within the terminology of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition.

* It would safeguard the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people against any temptation by the Attorney-General of the day to use the very considerable processes within this legislation for bipartisan purposes.

* We reluctantly believe that many of these powers are necessary for a security organisation, but in giving those powers to a security organisation we need to have a system of checks and balances to ensure that the prerogatives of this Parliament and through those prerogatives the **rights** of the Australian people, are maintained.

* If this amendment were to be accepted, many of the arguments that have already been put forward in respect of the legislation could be transfigured inasmuch as the people of Australia would know that, whatever changes of government or of personnel take place, the Leader of the Opposition as spokesman for the alternative government must as of right be kept fully informed of the exercise of those powers which strike most at the **rights** and liberties of the average citizen.

* It is a direct challenge to the **rights** of this House and therefore to the **rights** of the people of Australia.

* The **rights** of the House of Representatives must be established- now.

* The **rights** of democratically elected governments to govern must be established- now.

* The **rights** of the Australian people must be established- now.

* These **rights** have never before been questioned by any action of the Senate since Federation.

* We will not sell out the constitutional **rights** of this House.

* I felt that possibly the greatest breakthrough in this particular sphere of allowing, permitting and encouraging migrants to know about their **rights** and privileges as Australian workers came when  Mr Justice  Moore, in handing down a decision, said that that decision would be made available in the languages of the people who had been concerned in the dispute and who had been encouraged to come and work in this country.

* It was also pretty obvious that having been injured, many of these people were not aware of their compensation **rights**.

* The second is that we should try to make a renewed effort to see that newly arrived workers know their **rights** and responsibilities in terms of their awards and all the protections which they can call upon when they need them.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* What we are trying to do is to protect the **rights** of the individual.

* Where the Full Bench makes a declaration, the Governor-General may, within six months, direct the Registrar to cancel the organisation 's registration, or make orders suspending the **rights**, privileges or capacities of the organisation, or give directions as to the exercise of any of its **rights**, privileges or capacities, or for restricting the use of its funds or property to ensure observance of the order.

* The Minister alleged that he could not interfere with the activities of the Queensland Government because he and his Government believed in the **rights** of the States.

* I have already said in this House before that the **rights** of State governments - in fact the **rights** of any government - are secondary.

* What matter are the **rights** of people.

* For that matter the Commonwealth Government did not worry about the **rights** of the States when it tried to legislate earlier this year on off-shore minerals.

* I do not think it should worry about the **rights** of State governments.

* State governments do not have **rights**; Commonwealth Governments do not have **rights**.

* It is only people who have **rights**.

* I think the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government is to safeguard the human **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* Nothing - is more fundamental than land **rights**.

* In your own right - without attention being drawn to a matter without complaint - you have an obligation to protect the interests, the **rights**, the good name and the characters of private members of this House.

* This House will be destroyed if you as  Speaker  are not prepared to exercise the sort of authority that you are given under that standing order to protect the **rights** of private members, and it will not be long before every member of this House, is cowed into a state of silence and submissiveness by these bullying tactics, used in an attempt to silence and prevent them from doing their duty by seeking to impugn their characters in the way in which the Prime Minister has been doing constantly since he occupied that office.

* In Victoria, as the honourable member for St George has said, we have seen the disgraceful, shameful and totally immoral failure of the Victorian ALP to take a stand on human **rights** issues - 
Yes,  Mr Speaker.

* In response to a question which was asked at Question Time and which related to the matter of human **rights** in Russia and a recent decision of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Labor Party, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  challenged me to make a statement dissociating myself from that decision.

* The implication was that if I did not make a statement dissociating myself from that policy decision, it would be interpreted as evidence that I was not concerned or was not opposing the onslaught against human **rights** in Russia.

* They condemn the onslaught against human **rights** by any authoritarian and totalitarian government, whether based on the ideology of the Left or the Right.

* I have gone on public record several times quite recently condemning the onslaught against dissidents in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics but also pointing out that there are extensive erosions of basic human **rights** in just about every country within our own geopolitical region.

* To be consistent, we would have to raise concern about those matters in specific terms if we are to set upon a campaign of condemning other countries in relation to the abuse of human **rights**.

* Some people in the Parliament are not aware of the strange way in which the law moves; are not aware of how the electoral laws of this country affect the electoral responsibilities of candidates and of members and the **rights** of voters.

* We ask nothing more than that a parliamentary committee should look at those laws, should see the way in which reform is required to bring about some sense to them, especially those laws which honourable members know are frustrating the proper **rights** of citizens of this country and are being ignored by those of us who stand as candidates for our respective political parties.

* It covers all the matters affecting the **rights** of citizens, lt is an enormously important document, following upon the Constitution, in seeing that civil liberties are available- for example, the right to elect or not elect a party in this country.

* This can serve only to prejudice the **rights** of citizens outside the Parliament.

* I think that the Minister's actions are beyond reproach, that the Minister has shown himself to be one who has applied the immigration laws with understanding and tolerance, and that above all he has maintained the convention and upheld the law in respect of the **rights** of members of Parliament of the British Commonwealth of Nations to visit Australia with impunity.

* 3) which we are debating seeks to protect the **rights** of unionists who are not able as individuals to fight for themselves.

* The truth is that many people in the Opposition know how vitally necessary this Bill is to protect the **rights** of individuals.

* The whole essence of the legislation before us is that it is designed to protect the individual, to protect his **rights** against arbitrary dismissal, to protect his **rights** against arbitrary action by union officials.

* It is a pity that there are some situations, particularly in States controlled by Labor governments, in which those **rights** of individuals will still be in jeopardy because of the difficulties presently existing in State and Federal awards.

* The whole purpose of this Bill is not to destroy the Communist Party- would that it were possible to do such a thing- but it is designed specifically as the beginning of a number of major industrial steps to give **rights** and freedom to the individuals within those unions so that they will have the full protection of the law when and if they decide to stand up and seek office in the interests of other members of those unions.

* If that principle were adopted I do not think it would involve any serious diminution of the **rights** of the Minister but it would put the Minister at the same level as all other parties to the proceedings.

* The Minister would be well advised to examine that proposal because I can see difficulties arising if the Commonwealth chooses to place itself in a position where the Minister does not approach the Court with the same **rights**, no more and no less, as the other parties before the court.

* I have no quarrel with the provisions contained in this Bill, which is to facilitate the transfer of State officers to the Australian Public Service, because I believe that an officer is entitled in all fairness and justice to have his **rights** and privileges protected.

* While I have said that this is a mechanical Bill, which deals with a Public Service officer's entitlement to have his **rights** and privileges protected, I think I have pointed out that there are a few cloudy issues associated with its introduction, which concern every Australian, but more particularly the Aboriginal and Island people.

* I repeat that the Opposition will not oppose the passage of this legislation because it serves to protect the **rights** and privileges of the Public Service.

* When persons have **rights** that must be adjudicated upon, a court traditionally looks at the position very carefully and in great detail.

* If, in the more spectacular cases involving civil **rights** or the individual's freedom, the courts were to do anything other than scrutinise in the absolutely closest and most minute detail the entire position, there could be miscarriages of justice.

* Much of that procedure is not appropriate where we are dealing with modern legislation designed to assist to produce better social conditions for people or to put into operation policies of the Government where the individual **rights** of the person concerned are very important but where it is not necessary to go into tremendous technical detail in determining , those **rights**.

* If an action is brought against a government instrumentality in one of the courts or on appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and there is too great a degree of claiming of Crown privilege, in some cases that could impinge upon the **rights** of the individual.

* The issues involve moral principles of equal justice for all regardless of race, and the **rights** of peoples to self-determination which are embodied in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* Possibly the greatest tragedy of Australian politics was the formation of the States with sovereign **rights**.

* In these areas did they back the people to the hilt and say that it was wrong that the States should have sovereign **rights**, that the people they represented should have the right to have in their own areas a government which would take some responsibility for the area and which would have some regional association with it?

* I believe that it is preposterous and pretentious for us to be pontificating about what **rights** the other sex should have over their reproductive capacity.

* If an all-female assembly were to pass laws, Lysistrata-like, determining the sexual **rights** of males there would be considerable consternation among men.

* I do not ignore the **rights** of the foetus, but I cannot concede that a 3-week foetus has equivalent **rights** to those of a 16 yearold girl.

* If we accept that the foetus lives, the **rights** of both the foetus and the mother cannot be protected at once; and I give my priority to the unrepresented and unprotected unborn, with the exception stipulated in the motion - that is: 
I indicate that this Bill now re-presented is part of what ought to be regarded as an historic battle for the assertion of the **rights** of this House.

* It is not going to be resolved by this House and the Labor Government backing down on what it believes are its fundamental **rights**.

* There is no doubt that the role of the family has changed quite significantly over the ages and I think that it would be unwise and unreal not to acknowledge this, but if one acknowledges as I do that the family is still the basic unit of society then it also follows that marriage is an essential part of the family relationship because marriage is a public avowal of the relationship between 2 people and the **rights** and obligations that they both assume.

* I believe that one of its chief weaknesses is that it does not give rise to the maintenance or the development of a public attitude towards the **rights** and obligations of marriage.

* As the honourable member for Dawson quite properly pointed out, voting **rights** will be given to those producers who have 200 hives or more.

* But there is a depressing sameness about what is going to happen here because the intervention of State **rights** and all the rest of it prevents us from acting so effectively in northern Queensland unless we choose to take the necessary action to use the power conferred upon us at the referendum.

* I understand that last night the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued a statement about the acceptance of the general principles of land **rights** for Aborigines.

* The referendum in 1967- that is not very long ago- gave a clear mandate to this Parliament that when such issues are at stake the Australian Government must act regardless of any views of federalism, State **rights** or anything else.

* The **rights** of the Aboriginal people transcend anything else in this arena.

* Today we are talking about the betrayal by the Queensland Government of the general consensus that has developed in this Parliament and throughout the community concerning the **rights** of the Aboriginal people and their land.

* He was involved with the question of land **rights** and the protection of the Aboriginal people.

* and expresses the wish that one day the people of Hungary will have the opportunity to live in their country with the same **rights** and freedoms as those which are enjoyed by the people of the Commonwealth of Australia.

* His  reply went like this: 'In response to your telegram, the  Chairman  of the Tribunal has advised me that it was to be implied that the travel **rights** of members would be restored upon their reelection to the Parliament'.

* In other words, either on the declaration of the poll or on the night of the election, when in Wills I had what might be called a handy lead, it would be said that a member was in business again and his **rights** would be restored.

* All mining leases are subject to covenants and conditions requiring the working of the lease, the protection of Aboriginal **rights**, restoration of land and such special conditions as are deemed necessary.

* In this whole process the **rights** of the community, the **rights** of parents, the **rights** of family and the places of students and children when they grow up all have to be considered.

* There is no point in the States saying that they have States **rights** and then trying to absolve themselves from this responsibility.

* The acquisition of the area is fundamental to the success of land **rights** policy insofar as that policy has any socio-economic aims at all.

* The 87 people listed as traditional Aboriginal owners of the town common at Borroloola and the islands to which the report refers include traditional owners of Bing Bong station lands, and the traditional land **rights** as distinct from ownership usufruct of the land for various purposes, extend to a much larger group.

* I believe that he will take up the points I have mentioned, but I think he will concede that in statements he made before he became Minister he spoke frequently of mineral **rights**.

* The more the phrase 'mineral **rights**' rears its ugly head, the more I am afraid that we will want prompt action to indicate that they will not override Aboriginal **rights**.

* The imposition of a means test and other matters seriously prejudice the **rights** of people.

* Another most important matter which is very topical in Queensland at present is the question of human **rights**.

* Human **rights** do not exist in Queensland.

* The Human Rights Commission Bill introduced into this House does nothing to protect the **rights** of people in Queensland.

* We nave seen in recent days, and particularly last week, examples of where people were not entitled to exercise their **rights** in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that is, the right to demonstrate on any issue that they thought was proper as long as they did it in a peaceful fashion.

* I draw attention to the fact that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has in it a number of articles which set out the **rights** of people.

* The covenant also has in it a number of measures which guarantee these **rights**.

* It states that if a person feels his **rights** have been interfered with in any way the question should be dealt with by a competent judicial tribunal.

* Article 21 provides: 
Not one of those **rights** can be maintained in Queensland at present.

* The legislation introduced into this Parliament which has not yet been debated will do nothing to protect people's **rights** in Queensland.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  together with the then Attorney-General,  Mr Eflicott,  were anxious to introduce legislation on human **rights**.

* Instead of having effective legislation providing for uniformity throughout the nation, along with an effective piece of legal **rights** legislation in accordance with the International Covenant, we have nothing except an advisory commission or a commission that can only examine.

* People will not be mtimidated by a Premier who does not adhere to the principles of human dignity and will not give people their **rights**.

* They are well meaning people who understand the **rights** of others.

* Pollution recognises no state **rights**, no national boundaries or territorial waters or national air space.

* It is not a question of States **rights**, or national prowess compared to other nations.

* As a result of the review which the Government has undertaken, it has been decided that further steps must be taken to fulfil its responsibility to safeguard our society while protecting the individual **rights** and liberties of all Australians.

* The overall balancing of the interests of security and the **rights** of private citizens.

* In all other legislation this Government has brought in in the fields of health, education, new cities, urban development, local government grants, gas and oil distribution, mining exploration and off-shore **rights**, the central control has been vested in Canberra.

* This offensive requirement, this denial of basic **rights**, this shameful example of political discrimination, is the personal responsibility of the Prime Minister, and he alone demanded it.

* We hope that a Bill relating to land **rights** in the Northern Territory, which we understand the Government is about to introduce into the Senate will contain a similar principle so that the **rights** of Aboriginal councils in the Northern Territory to say who goes on to their lands will be preserved.

* My Party has joined with many concerned groups in the community- trade unions, Aboriginal people, church groups, women's groups, environmentalists and groups of citizens concerned with the preservation of democractic **rights**- in condemning the haste of the Government in making its 11 November statement, its disregard of the final recommendation of the Fox report and its general stance on the issue of uranium mining development.

* This Government, by its actions and its statement made ironically on 1 1 November of this year, has tried to ignore both the Fox report and the people 's **rights**.

* The Government should recognise the legitimate demands and **rights** of the people.

* Indeed, one particularly disturbing aspect of the Timor situation is the persistant refusal of those countries that normally champion human **rights** to examine, let alone accept, the steady flow of evidence that a tragedy of far greater proportions that was at first believed has been endured by the inhabitants of an island only 350 miles from Australia.

* Thus no single nation has sought to bring any significant pressure to bear on Indonesia, the power largely responsible for what must be one of the most flagrant denials of human **rights** in the history of modern decolonization.

* But it seems that the present level of relief, not to speak of the low level of interest in the human **rights** situation, does not match the magnitude of the problem.

* In recent times abuses of human **rights** in relatively distant Uganda, Eritrea and the Central African Empire have been more extensively reported and responded to in the Australian press than reports at least as credible, that have come out of East Timor.

* Perhaps the most disturbing dimension of the Timor tragedy is that none of those countries who are in a position to exert some influence on Indonesia, has shown other than a sceptical and passive interest in reports of this disturbing contravention of human **rights**.

* The case of East Timor presents, in relative terms, the most serious case of abuse of human **rights**, not to mention the right of self-determination, ever to have been inflicted ona people, in the crude guise of integration.

* All the **rights**, property and assets, including moneys, that, immediately before the commencement of the Australian National Railways Act 1975, were vested in the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner are, by force of this section, vested in the Commission.

* I believe that under the law everybody should have the same **rights** as those people who wish to demonstrate.

* Obviously the reference made to that aspect of the legislation which deals with the **rights** of individuals in Queensland and which prevents peaceful assembly is not correct.

* What are the **rights** afforded Taiwan in the agreement.

* Any **rights** granted for  a  wood-chip industry will include requirements on the matters referred to as  a  means of preserving and enhancing the ecology of the area.

* We must have a proper federal system of control, that is, a system under which all the States have their **rights** in an authority and the matter is dealt with on a purely federal and national basis.

* That is a massive abrogation of the basic **rights** of people in our community.

* Similarly in relation to the Coombs Royal Commission findings concerning grievances, **rights** and duties, it would be our intention to explore the implications of these in association with the Public Service unions and other affected groups, bodies and people to bring about genuine reform.

* We would seek to establish a statutory framework concerning the **rights** of staff and to have that incorporated within the Public Service Act.

* That framework would affect things such as a clearer definition of processes for determining services for which the staff are engaged, tenure or conditions of employment, issues reflecting appeal processes, the establishment of equal opportunity and, of course, the enshrining of civil and political **rights**.

* It takes away **rights**.

* In the course of the Committee stage of the debate we will take the opportunity to move amendments designed to improve the provisions of the Bill and certainly to protect the **rights** of members of the Australian Public Service.

* In respect of 1978-79 the two major airlines have agreed to waive their **rights** under clause 8 of the 1961 Agreement and to permit a 15 per cent increase in air navigation charges for this year.

* One wonders why there is not a ban on wheat sales and other export to the Soviet Union- a nation notorious for its suppression of human **rights**, for locking up dissidents in psychiatric hospitals and harassment of ethnic groups.

* It was prepared to act nationally insofar as the preservation of the **rights** of Queensland and Australian citizens was concerned.

* The joint Government parties yesterday unanimously carried a motion commending the Premier  (Mr Bjelke-Petersen)  on his fight for State **rights**.

* That this joint meeting of Country Party and Liberal Members commend the Premier for his untiring efforts and statesman-like attitude in placing before Australians in the strongest possible terms, Queensland's sovereign **rights** and privileges in any CommonwealthState relations'.

* The exercise by any State - that is to say any country - of sovereign legislative authority and propriety **rights** beyond its land territory is part of its international relations.

* It should give us some confidence to think that the doubts can be resolved when, as the honourable member for Farrer said, the negotiations resulted in agreement in regard to the off-shore petroleum leases and petroleum **rights**.

* I submit that very special consideration should be given to the **rights** of Queensland.

* At present, the State governments also claim sovereign **rights** in this same area.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal water's as they existed at federation, the States have no such **rights**.

* In respect of the continental shelf, it declares and enacts that sovereign **rights** for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.

* The exercise by any state, that is to say any country, of sovereign legislative authority and proprietary **rights** beyond its land territory is part of its international relation and is regulated by international law as well as by the domestic law of the State itself.

* Australia, as a member of the United Nations, participated in the negotiations of these conventions, and in relation to other states the Commonwealth of Australia is exclusively responsible for the exercise of the **rights** and duties that the conventions embody.

* As between Australia and states which are not party to one or more of the conventions, their respective **rights** and duties are of course regulated by the general or customary international law, of which indeed the conventions were in large measure declaratory, and in which also the subsequent practice of states has tended to follow and adopt the rules embodied in the 1958 conventions.

* As a matter of internal or domestic law, it is part of the prerogative of the Crown, in the absence of legislation, to determine the areas to which its sovereignty extends and within which it will exercise its sovereign **rights**.

* The .position both under customary international law and in the 1958 convention is expressed in the current rule that the coastal state exercises over the continental shelf sovereign **rights** for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its natural resources'.

* Honourable members will notice that this formula does not accord to the coastal state 'sovereignty' in respect of the continental shelf, but only certain specified sovereign **rights**'.

* These **rights**, moreover, are expressly stated in the convention not to affect the legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas; the same rule exists under customary international law, as the practice of states at present stands.

* How far out, and down, the coastal state's **rights** should be recognised as extending has not so far been resolved.

* The present Bill is concerned rather with the internal or domestic question whether Australia's internationally recognised **rights**, whatever their extent is or may become are exercisable by the Commonwealth or by the States.

* Then a year ago, in an address to the Australian Conservation Foundation,  Sir Percy  Spender, Q.C., a distinguished former Commonwealth Minister and member of this House who later became  President  of the International Court of Justice, expressed the view that the off-shore **rights** of the Commonwealth under the Australian Constitution were as complete and as exclusive of the **rights** of the States as those established by the Supreme Court of Canada as belonging there to the Federation.

* But I should mention also that in August 1969, in the case of Bonser v. La Macchia the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and  Mr Justice  Windeyer look occasion to state their considered opinion on the respective off-shore **rights** of the Commonwealth and the States.

* Sir Garfield  Barwick held that: 
at some time before the adoption of the 1958 conventions on the Territorial Sea and the Continental Shelf, Australia had become an independent nation state, and the **rights** recognised by those conventions accrued in their entirety to the Commonwealth of Australia.

* The Bill asserts what the Government believes to be the **rights** of the Commonwealth, broadly in accordance with the judicial views I have mentioned.

* Firstly, in the formula customarily used where an Act is regarded as stating the law as it already exists, as well as possibly making new law, the Bill declares and enacts that the sovereignty in the territorial sea is vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 5; similarly that the sovereign **rights** of Australia for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the continental shelf are vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clause 10; and that sovereignty in the internal waters of Australia, with the important exception of waters that were internal waters of the States at the time of federation, and still remain such, is likewise vested in and exercisable by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth - this is in clauses 9 and 11, which must be read together.

* Thirdly, the saving provisions of the Bill ensure that the establishment of the sovereign **rights** of the Commonwealth in off-shore areas will not impair existing State ownership and control of wharves and other port facilities, and will not create anything in the way of an automatic legal vacuum, especially in the territorial sea.

* Australian pension benefits outside of this country - a pensioner has in general to have been resident in Australia for at least 20 years after reaching the age of 16 and additionally can only attract portability **rights** in 4 countries: Italy, Greece, Turkey and Malta.

* There are also long-standing reciprocal social security benefit **rights** for Australians in the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

* These are comprehensive reciprocal **rights** as distinct from pension portability.

* The extension of portability **rights** beyond the limited number of countries mentioned was dependent on increasing the number of countries with which reciprocal arrangements could be established.

* -The readers of  Hansard  and the listeners to this debate could be forgiven for being confused about the purpose of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill because what they heard was a speech about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It says nothing about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It was never intended to say anything about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The original Act dealing with Aboriginal Councils and associations said nothing about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Of course, the amendments proposed by the Opposition tonight say nothing about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* That proposed new sub-section makes it clear that when the Act is amended the existing **rights** of local government authorities will be taken into account and not just if there is a proposal to extend local government to that area.

* The purpose of this Bill is to provide for mining companies in the Alligator Rivers region to retain their current **rights** as far as ownership of and access to existing improvements constructed by them when the land on which the facilities have been erected becomes Aboriginal land.

* I would stress that the Bill merely confirms the present position of the companies but settles any doubts about their legal **rights**.

* It was the intention of the original Act to protect the existing **rights** of people who had a prior interest in Aboriginal land, as recommended by  Mr Justice  Woodward in his Royal Commission report on Aboriginal Land Rights.

* The Government accepts the need to avoid any argument over this issue, and is particularly mindful of the commitment of the then Labor Government, to guarantee ownership **rights** of Ranger.

* It is therefore proposed that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act should be amended to ensure that the companies are given **rights** of access to and ownership of facilities erected to date by them.

* Once they leave Taiwan they are put on the active list again without any loss of **rights**.

* Australia's embassies make many and varied decisions in relation to various aspects of economic and financial trade matters, trade aid, human **rights**, international law and nuclear safeguards.

* Australian officials from a wide variety of government departments and instrumentalities are desperately needed at posts abroad, not only to protect Australia's bilateral interests and the **rights** of Australian citizens but also to ensure that Australia's views are represented fully, and occasionally even forcefully, at the ever-growing range of international conferences which take decisions affecting so many aspects of Australia's prosperity and way of life.

* I think the honourable member for Hughes read this section about a buffer zone and fishing **rights**.

* These matters would complement the powers already conferred by the Constitution on the Australian Parliament with respect of marriage under section 5 1 (xxi) of the Constitution, and under section 5 1 (xxii) with respect to divorce and matrimonial causes and, in relation thereto, parental **rights** and the custody and guardianship of infants.

* This Parliament can legislate with respect to parental **rights** and the custody and guardianship of infants only where the infants were born in wedlock and the parents are in dispute.

* They have no clear idea of their **rights** and prospects under the Fraser Government's health scheme.

* Perhaps it means an incursion into and a usurping of the **rights** and powers of the Australian State Governments which, incidentally, are elected by the same voters who elected this Government to office.

* I know what my freedoms and **rights** are, and I do not want there to be anything that may be misconstrued.

* 1 ) Has he supported the view of the Woodward report that an imposed solution to the traditional Aboriginal land **rights** problems is unlikely to be good or lasting, and that, although it will take longer, consultation is more likely to be permanently acceptable.

* There has always been a conflict inherent in the balancing of different individual **rights** or group **rights** in the community.

* We pride ourselves in the modern day and age in having laws that balance the various competing claims to **rights**.

* This Bill seeks to provide a way in which the Commonwealth Police in their sphere of activity will have guidelines to assist them in carrying out their duties and the public will have a much better opportunity to know their **rights**, to be informed of those **rights** and to have clearly defined procedures adopted in regard to interrogation.

* One of the great difficulties that we have had up till now in the law is that the **rights** of persons change dramatically at the time a police officer decides to charge a person.

* The **rights** of such a person change.

* But at present the failure to use our initiative and enterprise for the **rights** of humanity when we cannot do anything by military action is our greatest possible failure.

* I suggest that we should have had produced the file of correspondence throughout the period of the High Court hearing between myself and  Mr Mensaros  the Minister for Mines of Western Australia, in which I repeatedly pointed out to him that State's lack of sovereign powers, the inadequacy of the conditions in respect of which the State granted exploration permits or production **rights** and the inadequacy of the expenditures that were sought from the companies concerned.

* Further results flow from the High Court decisions, and I refer in this respect to the **rights** of the on-shore States to legislate in respect of what is called peace, order and good government.

* The Government somehow wants to get around the situation and to give the respective States the **rights** to continue to operate off-shore and to give title.

* I would not for one minute suggest in respect of Bass Strait, where there is competent development, that the companies should not be granted their full renewal of **rights**.

* The major parts of the Bill concern, firstly, the **rights** of officers of the Australian Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment and, secondly, the disciplinary provisions applicable to Public Service Act staff.

* I turn now to those parts of the Bill- primarily clause 3 1 -which relate to the **rights** of officers of the Australian Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment.

* The Government's intention is that the provisions in this Bill should assist officers to gain appropriate experience outside the Public Service properthat is to say, the central Public Service- without loss of their Public Service **rights**.

* This entitlement, however, will not be at the expense of the **rights** of officers who remain in the Public Service.

* This part of the Bill is based on the report of a sub-committee of the Joint Council set up to review the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, an Act which currently specifies the **rights** of staff who move from the Public Service to some other area of Commonwealth employment.

* It provides for leave without pay from the Public Service, with the preservation of all of the **rights** normally applied to staff on leave without pay.

* It provides that these officers sever their direct connection with the Public Service but retain certain specified **rights** such as the right to apply for transfer and promotion to Public Service positions in accordance with the normal merit procedures set out in the Public Service Act.

* In addition, the Joint Council recommended that, where officers are transferred out of the Public Service to an independently staffed authority as a result of the transfer of functions to that authority, the second tier should apply to cover the Public Service **rights** of transferred officers.

* Greater emphasis is placed on specification of the **rights** of persons against whom disciplinary action is taken, including such matters as **rights** of reply to charges, entitlements to reasons for decisions, extension of appeal **rights** to cover all formal disciplinary action, and provisions enabling findings to be reviewed when new evidence comes to light.

* There will, however, be appeal **rights**.

* Of course there were thousands of teachers outside Parliament House demonstrating in accordance with their **rights**.

* So far as I am concerned, we must stand up for our **rights**.

* The House is aware that I have expressed great and constant opposition to the extension of the **rights** of police forces, etc.. to tap telephones on all but the most important occasions.

* For that reason and because these are windfalls, I say that all Australians have an equal right and I, as a representative of an electorate in New South Wales want to put forward the **rights** of the people in my electorate and the **rights** of the people of New South Wales.

* I stand up for the **rights** of my people in New South Wales and my people in the electorate of Mackellar just as, very rightly, the honourable member for Stirling, for example, stands up for the **rights** of the people in his electorate of Stirling and the people of Western Australia.

* We hope it has a speedy passage and that there will not be too much emotional nonsense talked about States' **rights** and associated matters from the Government benches during this debate, which nonsense would delay the passage of this essential measure through the Parliament and would not add to the body of knowledge.

* Under the amendment to the Standing Orders it would seem that the Assistant Minister has the full **rights** of a Minister in charge of a Bill.

* He cannot have those **rights**.

* Whatever the honourable member might have said subsequently - and I will come to that later - 1 find it impossible to read into this statement a commitment on behalf of the Federal Government to hold prior consultations with the States on the subject of respective legal **rights** and responsibilities in this matter.

* The main principle is the freedom and **rights** of the individual which they consider to be superior to the **rights** of the state.

* The Minister also recognises the need to provide pension **rights** to a greater degree for de facto wives.

* Far too often we have seen parties enter into agreements in respect of matters such as custody and particularly in respect of matters concerning maintenance and the disposition of property and, when the agreements have been put under finer examination by someone who is able to determine more accurately and precisely what sort of settlement should be made, we have found that people have signed away their **rights** without any real understanding of what they have done.

* It conflicts with the sovereign **rights** of the States and it confuses existing Commonwealth laws.

* This proposal offends the principles of democratic **rights** which we believe are so precious to a democratic society, and mean so very much to the spirit and the life of this country.

* The Authority would simply override the **rights** of the States.

* Quite some time ago I remember that I asked the Minister before he was AttorneyGeneral and when he was the Minister in this place representing the Attorney-General, one or two questions about this matter, and from the replies that he gave me at that time it was quite obvious to me that the Minister, who of course is now the Attorney-General, was genuinely interested in the appointment of an Australian ombudsman to protect the **rights** of private citizens.

* I sincerely trust that the appointment of an Australian ombudsman and the 2  deputy  ombudsmen and the establishment of an Australian Appeals Tribunal will ensure not only that justice is done and is seen to be done but also that what has been described as the delicate path between the **rights** of individual citizens and harmony in the machinery of government will be clearly and effectively protected.

* I feel that it is important that the Ombudsman should not be hamstrung in his appointed task of redressing grievances and protecting the **rights** of the ordinary citizen against bureaucratic processes or decisions.

* A frequent criticism of these pans of the Public Service Act is that they do not adequately protect the **rights** of individual employees through, for example, formal **rights** of appeal and perhaps a more direct relationship between the powers and their clear purpose, namely, the efficient and economical functioning of the Service.

* Affected staff will have clear **rights** to have decisions affecting them reviewed.

* These review **rights** will cover the initial decision of a department or authority to identify the employee, any redeployment action, and any decision that redeployment is not practicable.

* I wanted to talk tonight about the struggles of this Parliament to assert its own **rights** and its own power against forces that flow down through history which have betrayed the reasons for its very existence.

* It is instructive to look at the struggles of the 17th century in which the Parliament asserted its **rights** eventually against the monarchy, against Charles I by his ultimate execution, against James II by his ultimate abdication and against any future transgression by monarchs in the arrangements that it made with William and Mary in 1688.

* All these things which place policemen in impossible positions - deciding whether it is a lawful occasion, whether it is likely to cause apprehension and dismay in the ranks of the community or not - are not the kind of **rights** we ought to give policemen.

* I particularly will reject for myself and in any way I can those provisions of it which place upon the lower courts powers of imprisonment, which I do not think they ought to have, and which place in the hands of officials, whether it be the Attorney-General, a police sergeant or someone else, the right to decide whether a case will proceed or not and the right to decide on some of our fundamental and absolutely inalienable democratic **rights**.

* It is a facility that has been employed in respect of the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation.

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide asked about the **rights** of the Opposition.

* In response I say that this Government has demonstrated a greater respect for the **rights** of the Opposition than was demonstrated by the previous Government.

* In addition to the more usual situations, shares conferring **rights** of occupancy of a flat or home unit used as a matrimonial home will be treated as such property.

* -I do not think the Committee needs to be reminded that we are talking about the constitutional obligations and the constitutional **rights** that the Commonwealth has in regard to nuclear codes.

* It said: 
Conventions have been ratified in the past 2 1 months including 3 Conventions dealing with basic human **rights**.

* Nevertheless, it does affect the **rights** of citizens, and that is the most important aspect.

* His **rights** will be affected.

* We then come to the **rights** of virtually every other citizen and the validity of the other redistributions throughout the nation.

* 1 think this is an atrocious situation when we are dealing with the basic **rights** of people and the basic **rights** of people who want to represent them.

* The main argument against retrospectivity is that the **rights** of third parties could be adversely affected.

* As a consequence third party **rights** will be protected.

* Last year the Communist Party paper 'Tribune' called for a mass movement to make land **rights** for Aboriginals the big issue in 1972 to replace the Vietnam war which it claimed was winding down.

* We must recognise that we will not solve their problems in one generation and that the clamour for land **rights** will not in itself overcome their disabilities.

* All he wanted to speak about was **rights**.

* We as responsible Australian citizens have an obligation to hold a balance between our **rights** and responsibilities.

* The Church of England - indeed all churches have done so - has expressed concern about the **rights** of needy people who are not covered by the present system of health insurance.

* As I pointed out, the Church of England has been significantly to the fore in this broad area of concern for people's **rights** in the community and it has been noticeably active, for instance, in expressing its concern about the need for an effective campaign against poverty in the community.

* in respect of export earnings consisting of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property **rights** or eligible knowhow, such earnings exceed $10,000; or 
We adverted to these amendments earlier.

* At the present time, the Bill is defective in that it provides $25,000 or if the whole of that amount consists of consideration for the disposal of eligible industrial property **rights**, or eligible know-how, $ 10,000.

* One of the fundamental tenets of the Government's industrial relations policy is that each member of the community has both **rights** and obligations.

* Those **rights** must be protected and the obligations must be met.

* It is the principal means of giving legal expression to industrial **rights** and obligations.

* While it is not, and cannot be, a complete statement of those **rights** and obligations it certainly is the vehicle which establishes the framework of those **rights** and obligations by defining the roles and responsibilities of the parties to industrial relations and providing for an expression of the public interest.

* However, organisations are meant to protect and enlarge the **rights** of individuals and not to undermine their liberties.

* Like the honourable member for Murray I believe that the amendments giving conscientious objectors fuller **rights** is sound and represents justice.

* It was a complaint about the Government's failure to assert and protect the **rights** of Australian citizens in Yugoslavia.

* It is a matter of public Importance that people who are Australian citizens have been killed overseas in these circumstances, but the rest of the charges made by the honourable member for Moreton concerning the subordination of the Australian Government's obligations to assert and protect the **rights** of its citizens overseas are appropriate and apt only in relation to the conduct, the reputation and behaviour of the previous Government.

* Honourable members will note the report's proposals for legislative changes dealing with the use of the Defence Force in aid of civilian security raise very significant constitutional, legal, civil **rights** and practical issues.

* arranging for the provision of, or providing, the carriage of persons as set out in paragraph (a) and, in addition, arranging for the provision of, or providing, in association with their being so carried, accommodation or meals, or accommodation and meals, either with or without any **rights** to travel services or any services included in a prescribed class of services, for persons who are being so carried, the person does not carry on business as a travel agent for the purposes of this Act.

* This House is asserting the historical and sensible **rights** of this House as far as money Bills are concerned.

* It is no compliment to this House when one side is prepared to be silent when its **rights** are being invaded.

* Why does somebody on the other side of the House not get up and assert what the fundamental **rights** of this House are?

* The motion seeks the assertion of the **rights** of this House.

* I understand that the sole company concerned at present, Lithominerals Pty Ltd, has been granted exploration **rights** to prove the deposits subject to a number of conditions imposed by the Government of South Australia.

* It is supposed to have certain **rights** of its own as a forum of discussion.

* relies too heavily on discretionary powers, rules and regulations and denies effective **rights** of appeal.'

* The definition should be more restrictive and the legislation should contain checks and balances guaranteeing that the civil **rights** of the individual are not infringed.

* We want to know the extent to which this kind of practice becomes the order of the day under a government that seems to treat so indifferently the civil liberties and **rights** of Australian citizens.

* Sending in investigators on suspicion would have had similar effects and, more fundamentally, could in some cases have been a most unreasonable invasion of the **rights** of private citizens.

* The approach in the preparation of the legislation had been throughout to strike a balance between the need to regulate company activities in the public interest and the preservation of the **rights** of companies to carry on business in a private enterprise environment.

* So we have a continuing effort in the government of these parties to balance the **rights** of the individual or private firms with the **rights** and claims of the public interest, but we give preference to the private way of doing things.

* We do not know what to advise people as to their **rights**.

* The Government should take some action to ensure that the **rights** of the merchant seamen who served this country during the Second World War are protected and that they are given a fair go.

* Any person with the slightest belief in democracy and the **rights** of the people of Australia to elect their government would not wish to assume the Prime Ministership in the present situation.

* South Australia has led the way in providing Aboriginals with land **rights**, and in the passage of legislation prohibiting discrimination.

* If we are incompetent and incapable of doing that we at least ought to surrender our **rights** to govern this country.

* Energy is a diminishing asset If the Government of the nation does not act to protect the **rights** of all the people of Australia through legislation of this kind it will have betrayed the people it was elected to represent and to serve.

* Only 2 weeks ago the Australian government asserted its authority to a distance of 200 miles when it negotiated with the Government of Indonesia over certain oil exploration **rights** and in the determination of boundaries on the continental shelf between the 2 countries.

* Since 1962, when the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended to make enrolment for Aboriginal people a matter of choice, the Australian Electoral Office has conducted ad hoc visits to Aboriginal communities in order to acquaint them with their electoral **rights** and responsibilities.

* The Bill makes appropriate provisions preserving existing **rights** to appeal to the High Court under the taxation legislation and to preserve the jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of proceedings instituted in the High Court at the date on which the relevant provisions of the Bill are brought into operation.

* Clauses 125 to 128 of the Bill provide for the High Court to remit pending proceedings or proceedings arising out of **rights** of appeal accrued at the date the Bill comes into operation to a State or Territory supreme court having jurisdiction in that proceeding.

* From the point of view of people's **rights**, those words are offensive.

* It interferes with the civil liberties and **rights** of every citizen in Australia.

* It is the wording of the clause that is offensive because the test is so subjective that it could affect people 's **rights**.

* The Government is frightened to let people exercise their **rights**.

* Calls in support of the right to dissent must be heeded, but they must not be allowed to deteriorate into attacks upon the **rights** and proper liberties of other people.

* To admit such **rights** would ignore the legitimate interests of others.

* That those interests are entitled to protection is recognised in Article  29 (2)  of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which it is stated that in the exercise of his **rights** everyone shall be subject to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing recognition of the right.

* One way of doing such an injury is unreasonably to obstruct your neighbour in the legitimate exercise of the **rights** and privileges that he, as a member of the public, is entitled to enjoy.

* The committee recommended that the law in the United Kingdom should be revised in order to simplify and clarify it, to help the authorities in maintaining order and to give participants in assemblies a greater understanding of their legal **rights** and liabilities.

* The term unreasonable obstruction', as used in the Bill, is an act that constitutes, or contributes to, an obstruction of the exercise or enjoyment by other persons of their lawful **rights** or privileges, where, having regard to all the circumstances of the obstruction, including its place, time, duration and nature, it constitutes an unreasonable obstruction.

* In summary, this Bill is designed to protect the civil **rights** of innocent persons, and the property of those persons, from unlwaful and unreasonable conduct occurring in the course of certain assemblies.

* ensure that all lands vested in the States or Commonwealth wilt be retained and that private **rights** to such land is limited to leasehold, 
I claim to have been, during my entire parliamentary career, completely even-handed on the question of human **rights**.

* Since my election to this honourable Parliament I have been out-spoken in the defence of human **rights** whenever they have been violated, be it behind the Iron Curtain, in Cambodia, Laos and Vietman: in Uganda and other parts of Africa- indeed wherever it has arisen throughout the world.

* The violation of human **rights** wherever it has occurred has provoked my spontaneous condemnation.

* The timing of the announcement of 20 January is beyond me although I must say in passing that I was pleased to hear the firm assurance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  that no deal whatsoever had been done with Indonesia over oil **rights** in the Timor Sea.

* I see the decision as a major blunder and a sad shock to all Australians who believe in fundamental human **rights** and basic decency in international affairs.

* Mr Deputy Speaker,  what we do now will be judged by history and that judgment will justifiably be harsh if we fail to act with honour and a firm determination as we are put to the test and weighed in the balance on the basic and fundamental question of human **rights**.

* We in this society are engaged in a battle for the supremacy of the **rights** of the people and for the supremacy of the **rights** of the Parliament over the abuses of power by a few officials in the union movement.

* It is in fact a fight for the supremacy of Parliament and for the supremacy of the **rights** of the people.

* Last century the miners of Eureka fought for their **rights** on the goldfields of Ballarat.

* Secondly, will he provide advice to customers of the Corporation about enforcing their legal **rights** to repayment of credit charges?

* Secondly, it is he who is the advocate for states' **rights**.

* This so-called champion of states' **rights** -  Sir Robert  Askin - has deliberately suppressed opportunities of local government in his own State and deliberately obstructs a course of action that would assist New South Wales ratepayers.

* The 'Newcastle Morning Herald' editorial of 11 October 1973 expressed the hopes of all ratepayers in the Hunter region when it said: 
As as professed champion of State **rights**, New South Wales Premier  Sir Robert  Askin could have  a  difficult task justifying his stand against local government admission to the Australian Loan Council.

* I can find nothing in the Bill to suggest that wives left by their husbands will be deprived of **rights** that they now have regarding maintenance and custody of their children.

* One of the great ironies in political practice in this country is the way in which the Liberal Party proclaims itself as a party of freedom, of liberty and of standing for the **rights** and the dignity of man.

* It is entirely wrong that responsible, elected bodies charged with preserving democracy should take steps which are designed clearly to intimidate and to prevent the expression of those **rights** within the community!

* We have **rights**.

* He has no respect for the civil **rights** of persons and no respect for the legal **rights** of citizens in a democratic society.

* The facts of the situation are that the Government has decided that no consideration of the **rights** of the individual in this society will be given and that no alterations will be granted.

* They would appreciate the opportunity of considering the actual clauses of the Bill in circumstances where they are not placed in the position of having to dispute with their Government the clauses that they feel should be altered in the interests of civil **rights** and the **rights** of the Australian community.

* The **rights** of people should stand above petty party politics, but in this House it is quite obvious tonight that honourable members opposite are not prepared to give even basic consideration to those **rights**.

* The needs of local government and semi-government authorities have been considered at Loan Council meetings on the basis that the allocation of borrowing **rights** amongst local bodies is again the responsibility of State governments.

* This Bill could, if applied harshly, infringe the **rights** and responsibilities of the State governments.

* Honourable members will recall how often in recent years every attempt by this Party to have a parliamentary investigation into the whole question of decentralisation has been subverted by the Government on the grounds of State **rights**.

* Whenever State governments ask for assistance from the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Government continuously raises the argument of State **rights** as the reason for doing nothing.

* This Budget is being brought down at a time when the Woodward Committee which is looking into the subject of Aboriginal land **rights** has just presented its interim report.

* Land **rights** are a matter to which over the months ahead the Parliament will be paying some attention.

* In the circumstances, rather than retrace the ground which has been covered already so many times in this debate, I want to address myself to the question of Aboriginal land **rights** within the framework of the appropriation brought down in the Budget.

* They show why Lake Tyers has become a source of hope not for the Aboriginal people but for racists and critics of the land **rights** movement.

* In choosing to ignore this advice and instead to hand over Lake Tyers to a group of Aborigines described by their own representative in the Victorian Parliament as having 'at best extremely limited experience in or knowledge of farming operations and probably a complete absence of knowledge of the more vital problems of farm economies', the Victorian Government showed a cynical disregard for the cause of Aboriginal land **rights** to which its spokesmen at the same time were paying lip service.

* lt comes in recognition of the special **rights** and needs of migrants in this country - justice too long denied them.

* Of course, the **rights** of such pensioners who are absent from Australia on the date this legislation becomes operative will be fully protected.

* Pensioners receiving their pensions in Malta, Italy, Greece and Turkey in accordance with the reciprocal pension portability agreements entered into under the legislation introduced by the previous Government will not only have their existing **rights** preserved but will be brought within the new provisions that is they will be able to continue to receive their Australian pensions but the requirement that they live in one of the 4 countries mentioned will no longer apply.

* They have far greater **rights** than any citizen.

* Once we step outside of conformism we have no **rights** - no freedom of speech and no freedom of assembly.

* It documents the alleged devotion of the Soviet Union to human **rights**.

* There are, in fact, repeated blatant denials of the fundamental **rights** which should be accorded to every citizen in 1979.

* Citizens in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are deprived of basic human **rights**.

* Dissidents are imprisoned because of their political views and citizens cannot enforce those human **rights** enshrined in their Constitution.

* If this report is adjudged to be prejudiced, to lack foundation in fact or to utter one intemperate comment, the report, the Committee, this House and this Parliament could stand condemned by every individual concerned with the protection of human **rights** in the world.

* Our Parliament could be ridiculed by institutions in other countries and by world bodies keen to protect the **rights** and privileges, and to promote the responsibilities, of the individual in a complex, competitive and jealous world.

* The human **rights** campaign was designed to replace the old bankrupt anti-communist and anti-Soviet tenets which no longer can serve as the basis for foreign policy ... the same naked anti communism with its corollary of attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries is still there.

* Mr Zorin was commenting on the position of the United States of America and what he considers was its pretended concern for human **rights**.

* He went on to suggest: 
Whether or not Jews in the Soviet Union are the victims of adverse discrimination in citizenship, in **rights** to religious practice, in **rights** to publish, communicate, travel, emigrate and organise.

* Human **rights** in the Soviet Union bearing in mind Australia's support for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the final act of the Helsinki Agreement.

* We received testimony from 25 witnesses with different backgrounds, experience and knowledge on human **rights** in the USSR.

* The human **rights** movement throughout the world was responsible for the ultimate release by the Soviet authorities of Leonid Plyushch and the permission which was granted to him to leave the Soviet Union.

* It will be clear to any reader of the transcript of the public evidence which is available, or from this report, that witnesses were called to give their evidence because of expertise on the Soviet Union and its application of human **rights**, and not for their political allegiance or philosophy.

* It is there recommended that the Australian Parliament establish a standing committee on human **rights** to report on serious violations of human **rights** in any country, including Australia- I emphasise the words 'including Australia'.

* There are several members of both Houses who, from time to time, take action to express a view to representatives of another State on some event or series of events which have occurred, or to condemn a government for denying basic human **rights**.

* In fact, some have presented letters of protest and petitions to USSR Embassy officials expressing views on the lack of human **rights** being granted to individuals in their country.

* It is recognised that it will always be difficult to obtain evidence from governments of other countries of suppression of human **rights** in those countries.

* The appointment of a parliamentary committee for that purpose gives honourable members the opportunity to ascertain whether human **rights** are being ignored in another country and, if affirmed, to register their concern.

* I respectfully suggest to those honourable members that it is naive to suggest that any parliamentary committee investigating a reference of this type- that is, the deprivation of human **rights** in another state- could ever obtain the total evidence which would be available.

* The fact that the parliament may not have been responsible for the payment of the fares of some of those witnesses is, I respectfully suggest, an irrelevant argument to condemn that part of the evidence which has been used by the Sub-Committee to support its findings of the denial of human **rights**.

* The participating states will respect human **rights** and fundamental freedoms including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* I conclude by considering one matter which the Committee was careful to determine early in its deliberations and that is the question whether an investigation by a parliamentary committee into human **rights** in the USSR would have an adverse affect in the Soviet Union on those people whom the Committee was anxious to support.

* Almost without exception witness after witness confirmed that the Committee's actual hearing, let alone its final report and recommendation, was of considerable assistance to those within the Soviet Union who were seeking to establish human **rights**.

* He referred in particular to the Soviet Union being a super power which, because of the enunciation of the **rights** of Soviet citizens in the Constitution, wants the world to believe that those **rights** are enjoyed by every citizen in that country.

* If this report goes some way to demonstrate the hypocrisy and deceit of that regime in its application of human **rights** and therefore of the regime itself, then we have succeeded.

* It would be also my wish that every member of the Red Army Russian Song and Dance Company, presently touring Australia, could return to their homeland with a copy of the human **rights** in the Soviet Union report made to this Parliament.

* We need to resist measures which intrude upon the **rights** of the individual.

* may 1 add the ACT falls back upon organised brutality to coerce demonstrating students, there is more at stake than civil **rights**.

* But are not the **rights** involved in the provision of welfare services just as powerful in their demands for adequate financing as are the **rights** of the people who command and operate our defence Services?

* In fact the Government demands that they should have no equity **rights** in this respect.

* If they should happen to drop dead the day after they move iri, having paid this money, there are no equity **rights** for their heirs and successors.

* No gathering of commissioners with normal cerebral processes would look at the produce, the accomplishments of the Department of the Media and say: 'This is being done with infinite regard to efficiency on the one hand and to political impartiality on the other, and with a general recognition of the **rights** and the position of the Australian taxpayer'.

* On my 1975 visit to Alice Springs I listened to the fears of many tribal elders, and carefully looked through the Alice Springs land **rights** applications sent for my opinion by  Mr Eames.

* These are the people who advised the previous government and this Government on the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation.

* I am sure no one would deny the Aborigines **rights** to fish off Maningrida, Croker Island, Goulburn Island or Elcho Island.

* This is the sort of attitude which is being taken towards the people in the Northern Territory by those who put together the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation and who have pushed it on to the people in the Northern Territory without really consulting them.

* -In recent months mankind right around the world has strongly and vociferously condemned the systematic persecution of civil **rights** dissidents in the Soviet Union.

* There were calls for the boycott of the 1980 Olympic Games unless the Russians were prepared to recognise and respect basic human **rights**.

* Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock),  I believe to the pride of all Australians, was devastatingly trenchant in his denunciation of brutal violations of human **rights** by the Soviet state.

* On Remembrance Day 1978 a small section of the Australian community but an influential section of the Australian community not only chose to forget those who are fighting for basic human **rights** in the Soviet Union, but they callously turned their backs on those freedom fighters in the Soviet Union, the modernday martyrs of 1978.

* deplores and condemns the actions of the Soviet Government, most recently demonstrated in the trial and conviction of Orlov and Ginsberg, in denying the **rights** and liberties of those of its citizens who wish to exercise their democratic **rights** of freedom of expression and peaceful dissent.

* What a day of shame for Australia when one of the two major political parties in the State of Victoria came out publicly and refused to condemn the Soviet Union for its treatment of civil **rights** dissidents.

* I will read from the Melbourne  Sun  on the Monday afterwards, Monday, 13 November, in an article headed 'Surprise rebuff on Red **rights**': 
Another report reveals that the vote was taken immediately after an address by the State  President  of the ALP,  Mr Clyde  Holding, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.

* I do not know whether the honourable member for Melbourne Ports emphasised the importance of standing up on the question of human **rights** and having the ALP adopt an honourable course and support the decision of its administrative commi ttee.

* I believe that the Parliament needs to be convinced that the Bill does not weaken marriage, that it does not destroy the **rights** that attach to individuals -in particular perhaps to a woman who, throughout her life, wants to be nothing more than a wife and mother.

* While obviously not all marriages are permanent or secure, that is the objective to which the law ought to address itself, insofar as it possibly can with fairness to everyone involved - that full and proper recognition be given to the status and **rights** of a woman as wife and mother; that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent; 
The one-year ground, and one year only, on the decision of one person is, I believe, too easy.

* It is also a denial of **rights** of individuals.

* I have some doubt whether this Parliament ought to deny such **rights** to individuals.

* The only use that has been made of this Act has been to limit the democratic **rights** of our public servants.

* Speaking about the **rights** of public servants the honourable member for Parramatta  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  - the then Attorney-General and, strangely enough, now occupying the same position - in July 1969 said: 
A Bill of Human Rights is in truth a statement of political slogans,  or  political principles.

* How can the people of Australia accept the sincerity of this Government, a government opposed to any explicit definition of the **rights** of our people; a government committed to perpetuating all the inadequacies of our Constitution; a government that has done nothing to combat our rising crime rate; a government that is utterly unconcerned about our appalling road toll, a government that plays confidence tricks on our pensioners; a government that blames everybody but itself for the plight of rural Australia; a government that has shown itself not only to be opposed to law reform but also to have no hesitation in using both the law and the Public Service for its own political advantage?

* This Government, like its former AttorneyGeneral, is opposed to any explicit definition of basic human **rights** because such a definition would place limits on it.

* Optimistic ambitions for the future do nothing actually to remedy the situation of the thousands of Australians who are being exploited and compromised daily through ignorance of their legal **rights** and a sheer lack of means to defend them in court.

* I believe the question which people listening to this broadcast, and indeed honourable members in this chamber, will ask themselves is: Does this Bill cut across any of our traditional Australian liberties and **rights**?

* Undoubtedly the case for votes for those of 18 years of age is supported by world opinion, by advanced nations and on the grounds of democratic **rights**.

* It should be divorced from these assumptions and based squarely on the right of citizens of this age to take their rightful place in a democracy and exercise all their **rights**.

* If the Government had acted democratically it would long ago have drawn up the uniform legislation with the States that the Minister spoke about covering all the **rights** that go with adulthood or the age of legal responsibility, such as the right to vote.

* A reading of the newspapers of the Island seems to indicate that the most important thing for the Islanders is the **rights** to land.

* The  Speaker  of this Parliament has a grave responsibility to protect not only the **rights** of members of this Parliament but also the parliamentary institution itself.

* Although the former Government did not recognise Aboriginal **rights** in land, it did recognise the need of many Aboriginals living outside reserves for land to use and develop for economic and social purposes.

* It is not exactly true to say that the former Government did not recognise Aboriginal **rights** in land.

* In the strict legal sense to which the Minister probably referred it did not but in the Northern Territory at the time that that Government went out of office it had approved 1 10 **rights** to land or tenures to land or entitlements to land.

* So it was not quite true to say that the former Government did not, as the 
Minister has said, recognised Aboriginal **rights** in land.

* Indeed we recognised that the Aboriginal tribes and clans in Arnhem Land certainly had unalienable **rights** to the land in which they lived and on which they hunted.

* They took no account of the conflicting needs or **rights** of the Aboriginal clans at all.

* We always sensed that there would be some difficulty in trying to apply this land **rights** principle to Aborigines living off reserves.

* That the Government's action in refusing to allow  Mr Ijaz  Hussain to remain in Australia is a denial of human **rights** and contrary to the best interests of the Australian people.

* The Nauruans have been most anxious to demonstrate, particularly in matters of a civil or criminal nature, that there are available, especially to those non-Nauruan communities, **rights** of appeal beyond the Supreme Court of Nauru.

* That Court consists at the moment of a single chief justice and obviously it is important to the Nauruans to ensure that there are **rights** of access to the appellate court sitting as a full court in matters that are not of special or peculiar interest to Nauruans.

* But he had the cheek to say in this House that those who were sponsoring Aboriginal **rights** and who were campaigning for land **rights**, for social advancement and for a change in the social and economic position of the Aboriginal people of Australia were inspired or led by communists and that it was some sort of deep, dark, Red plot - if that is not a contradiction in colours.

* He says that those who sponsor land **rights** for the Aboriginal people do not know what they are talking about and that they are under Red dominion.

* To stand up and speak for your **rights** as a free Australian is not division.

* The Aborigines who step into the community to assert their **rights**, to show what they stand for and to speak in their own right are speaking as part of the real Australian community.

* Assimilation, identity and **rights** have nothing to do with geography.

* First of all there is the question of land **rights**, it is not a question of freehold, leasehold or anything else.

* In that article all the necessary quotations can be found on the attitude to land **rights** adopted over 2 centuries ago by the British Government.

* The people in North America, from which the general principles of North American legislation flow, were to be dealt with severely if they damaged Indian **rights**.

* We find that a political party goes as far as to raise in the national Parliament the **rights** of these particular men.

* I think that these men are not concerned about their **rights**.

* There is no country in the world where the **rights** of the people are so clear as they are in Australia.

* Look at the **rights** which are given to these young students.

* I suppose that if there is any difference from a civil liberties or civil **rights** point of view that difference would be in favour of the Russian regime which for a number of reasons, one being the effluxion of time, has now reached the stage where at least it allows or is unable to prevent dissent from within and allows dissenters some publicity at least outside the country.

* Much has been said to the effect that there should be a letout for certain individuals because of the **rights** of individuals but those individuals, in accepting Australian nationality, also accept responsibilities to the nation.

* What would our position be if we were to inquire into the question of civil **rights** of the negro minority in the United States?

* We accept on the available evidence that there are serious denials of human and civil **rights** in the USSR, particularly with reference to minorities.

* We would reiterate our view that based on the substantial evidence available the civil **rights** of certain groups,  especially minorities, in the Soviet Union are seriously infringed and fall below that which should be expected in any civilised society.

* I have made the point that there are serious infringements of civil **rights** but that this occurs in probably 75 per cent of the countries.

* For those reasons, whilst I accept completely that there are infringements of civil **rights** in the Soviet Union, I am one of those who feel that the recommendation in paragraph 65 and the original reference of the matter to the SubCommittee can do untold harm to Australia in the future.

* As to offshore minerals other than petroleum, the Commonwealth is of the view that it should proceed on the footing that it enjoys total **rights** outside the 3-mile limit.

* We are standing upon the assertion of the **rights** of this House.

* I have at other times when I was in Opposition said, when money Bills were sent down to the Senate, that it was time that this House asserted its fundamental **rights**, its priority over the power of the purse.

* I still hope that there are some in this House who will assert the **rights** of this place and who will understand that the Opposition is bringing the constitutional arrangements into chaos.

* I would stand for the **rights** of this House against the Senate.

* I think in this stand the resolution can come from only one direction, that is, by the Senate changing its attitude and by this House reasserting its fundamental, historical and commonsense **rights**.

* It is a matter of supreme irony that the main industrial issue dealt with in the Speech followed a homily on individual liberties and human **rights**.

* It states: 
In the area of industrial relations, one of vital importance to the economic and social well-being of the Australian community, my Government will bring down legislation to protect the **rights** of individuals and the community, and establish an industrial relations bureau.

* This Government pledges itself to the protection of individual liberties and human **rights** and against unwarranted instrusions.

* It has begun a violent and carefully timed attack on the Australian work force and on the trade unions which guard its **rights**.

* The Prime Minister has instructed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to resume its interference with the individual liberties and human **rights** of trade unions and trade unionists.

* Traditionally, on questions of the **rights** of the individual and the due process of law, we have been absolutely emphatic that we would not permit encroachment.

* Medibank can come into operation without this legislation, but the operation of private health insurance would be not only much more messy but also less responsible to the needs and the **rights** of members of the community.

* The Prime Minister said that the eventual aim is that Aboriginal Australians should be assisted as individuals, or if they wish, as groups, to hold effective and respected places within one Australian society, with equal access to the **rights** and opportunities it provides and acceptance of responsibilities towards it.

* He went on to say that we recognise the **rights** of individual Aborigines to effective choice about the degree to which, and the pace at which, they come to identify themselves with the Aboriginal society and that we encourage and assist them to develop their culture, languages, traditions and arts so that these can become living elements in the Australian society.

* Should we take over all responsibility in relation to Aboriginal land **rights** and mining **rights**?

* He did not accuse us of failing to protect the **rights** and freedom of the Timorese people.

* It is rare for members to use the Budget debate as a vehicle to defend the **rights** of the Parliament.

* One of the **rights** of private members is their right to question responsible Ministers about Government activities which affect the nation in general or a member's electorate in particular.

* I asked this question of the Prime Minister: 
International Monetary Fund of special drawing **rights** which are being created as a special reserve asset has become a contentious issue in world politics as less developed countries contend that the developed countries are keeping the special drawing **rights** for their own benefit and not using them to help development.

* In these circumstances there is surely at least a firm obligation on the governments of developed countries which are benefiting from the allocation of special drawing **rights** at least to keep up with their obligations to the World Bank which are related to their IMF quotas.

* The provisions of the Bill are to (a) provide for 2 members of the House of Representatives for the Australian Capital Territory elected on the basis of single member electorates, with effect from the first sitting of the Twenty-ninth Parliament; (b) provide for full voting **rights** for both members for the Australian Capital Territory with all the powers, immunities and privileges held by other members of the House of Representatives; (c) divide the Australian Capital Territory into 2 single member electorates, of which one electorate shall embrace part of the Australian Capital Territory proper and the other electorate shall embrace the remaining part of the Australian Capital Territory plus the Jervis Bay territory - to be effective immediately following the expiry or dissolution of the Twenty-eighth Parliament; and, (d) provide  -  (i) for the setting up of a distribution committee, and (ii) for the inviting of suggestions and objections and preparation of a report to Parliament, along similar lines to that provided for the distribution of a State into electoral divisions.

* The Australian Capital Territory was given representation in the Australian Parliament in 1948 on the initiative of the then Labor Government, with effect from the 1949 elections, on the basis that the member representing the Australian Capital Territory had the same voting **rights** as the member for the Northern Territory at that time, namely, that the member could vote only on a motion to disallow an ordinance affecting the Australian Capital Territory.

* The number of electors enrolled in the Australian Capital Territory increased from 11,841 in 1949, when the Australian Capital Territory was given its first representation, to 48,127 in 1966 when the member for the Australian Capital Territory was given full voting **rights** in this House.

* How soon will he answer the three questions that I put on the Notice Paper six weeks ago about his earlier correspondence with the Premier on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It is suggested that the following sub-section be inserted after sub-section (3):  (3a) Where, in proceeding in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the **rights** and freedoms of any person.

* So far as I am concerned, it is right and proper that any such information should be conveyed to the security service, but I have very grave doubts whether it is proper in a society such as ours that there should be an ability to pass on this type of special information to the police that could be prejudicial to the **rights** of the individual.

* I believe that we have here what can be regarded as the chronic difficulty of distinguishing between the **rights** of the people to be protected against too effusive action on the part of the bureaucracy and the **rights** of the individual to be able to sustain his proper position in society.

* Here we have another indication of the fact that it is for the Parliament to exercise caution and to protect the **rights** of the individual, unless its actions are manifestly shown to be in the security interests of the Commonwealth and of the people of the Commonwealth and that they are necessary in the case of narcotics abuse or narcotics use, unless such use has been authorised by an authorised medical officer.

* These arrangements entail new borrowing **rights** and obligations for the Wheat Board.

* The modification to the basic delivery provisions which have served the industry over time are designed to meet the changed needs of the industry by providing growers with a specification of their **rights** to deliver wheat to other than the central receival system.

* He said, in effect, that it was the responsibility of a member to protect the **rights** of the individual, no matter how many influences there might be in the opposite direction and regardless of whether they came from the government or from a powerful clique or group, and that if the member thought that it was right that he should support the individual in his fight against might he had every obligation to act as a liberal.

* I then read out the part of the platform and policy which states that the achievement of certain objectives requires a tax system in which the **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded by minimising discretionary powers and ensuring that taxation adjustment does not have retrospective effect.

* What he did do, which I regard as absolutely wrong, was leave out, either carelessly or by intent, the critically important words in the platform and policy which state that the achievement of those objectivesthis is set out in the preamble- requires a tax system in which the **rights** of the taxpayer are safeguarded in the way that I have mentioned.

* I visited a number of communities recently, and I was impressed by the intelligence of the people, by the fact that they are aware of their **rights** and by the fact that there is an awareness of the world around them.

* I want to touch on the issue of States **rights**, about which the Premier of Queensland is so vocal.

* It is not a States **rights** issue at all.

* It is not a States **rights** issue, yet the Premier of Queensland is saying repeatedly that it is an intrusion by the Commonwealth into an area in which the State has full **rights**.

* Yet the Aurukun people, resident in this nation for over 30,000 years, are denied those **rights**.

* He talked of human **rights** and civil liberties.

* When this Government, through its AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Murphy),  introduces human **rights** legislation and anti-racist legislation, from where does the opposition come?

* Because of the very success of those policies the Opposition has used its numbers to oppose the reform of human **rights**, to oppose anti-discrimination legislation- 
Capital Investment in Australian Film Rights 
The proposal to change the income tax law in this respect was foreshadowed in the policy speech for the last general elections delivered on 21 November 1977 and the key points of the changes were outlined in a statement that the Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr Ellicott)  and I released on 27 April last.

* Underlying the proposed changes is a belief that if investors could deduct their capital investment in Australian film **rights** over two years instead of, as at present, over a much longer period of up to 25 years, there would be greater investment by Australians in the production of Australian films.

* The concession for capital investment in Australian film **rights** will be implemented by amendments to the provisions of the income tax law that have, since 1956, allowed otherwise non-deductible capital costs of acquiring industrial property **rights** used in the production of assessable income to be written off over specified periods.

* For copyrights, which are the relevant property in this context, the costs have been subject to a tax write-off over 25 years, or any lesser period for which the **rights** subsist or are held.

* The amendments now proposed will- in relation to **rights** in Australian films first used for income producing purposes after 21 November 1977- substitute two years for 25 years as the basic write-off period.

* The antiavoidance measures are directed against arrangements to secure excessive deductions by inflating the cost of **rights** or by deflating their sale price when they are disposed of.

* So far from having been required to cede some of the foreign equity in exchange for these great extensions of mining **rights** over ore deposits which are among the very best in the world, Hamersley has rather been able, on the strength of these assurances of reserves, to demand and get premiums of about 500 per cent in selling thin slices of the equity to Australian investors.

* The company granted **rights** by previous governments will have its **rights** properly protected and preserved but it will not have **rights** over the future of this nation.

* The Australian Labor Party Government refused to continue this abdication of the people's **rights** to private, mostly foreign, companies.

* It still believes that it can sell out Australia behind this odious abdication of Australian **rights**.

* It imposes on the Parliamentary Counsel the most exacting intellectual requirements to put down on a piece of paper something which is going to establish **rights**, to establish policy and something which will, it is the Government's belief, make a tremendous contribution to the present difficulties of this industry.

* For example, whereas in Queensland there has been a move in one direction, in South Australia there has been another and there has been a possibility for experimenting in different ways by which the **rights** of the consumer can best be protected.

* Under a Federal system with each of the States enacting its own specific consumer protection legislation, the **rights** of the citizen are best protected.

* I wish to speak on the matter of political **rights** around the world and in Indonesia in particular.

* It is a tragedy that around the world most countries which are members of the United Nations are bound by the Declaration of Human Rights, yet there are violations of those **rights** to various degrees of incidence in more than a hundred of the member countries.

* Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union, Spain, South Korea, Uganda, Argentina and Brazil are among the countries with long records of violations of human **rights**.

* To be held in prison without trial and without recourse to justice is probably one of the greatest infringements of the basic human **rights** of freedom and liberty, particularly when the Indonesian officials admit that such prisoners were not involved with the coup in 1965.

* One of those gaoled last year was Buyung Nasution, a lawyer and the director of the legal aid bureau, who had sought to advise and defend the civil **rights** of so many Indonesians who were victims of the purges.

* It is hoped that that is a sign of progress by the Indonesian Government, and I hope that Buyung Nasution will be able to practise quite freely after his release, without restriction, to assist people to exercise their human **rights**.

* But if we ignore infringements of liberty, freedom and the **rights** of men and women throughout the world we cheapen the respect we hold for our own freedoms and we move closer to the total enslavement of all mankind.

* Clause 13 confers on the Director appropriate **rights** of inspection and access to information whilst respecting the confidentiality of information where necessary.

* That has been done but of course any publicity of this fact has been suppressed in the countryside because it is not in the interests of sectional groups to have the people they are supposed to represent know what has been done and know what their **rights** are.

* He will remember his statement on 25th September last year when he said that his Government would introduce, at the earliest practicable date, legislation to provide for the portability of superannuation **rights**.

* The amendment will not apply in respect of assessments yet to be raised in respect of earlier years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior years where the taxpayer's **rights** are protected by way of objection or appeal to a court.

* Is it not to be given any **rights**?

* Does the Opposition seriously suggest that the Government, for some extraordinary reason, is presenting itself as a campaigner against the **rights** of the trade unions?

* What of the **rights** of the ordinary people?

* What of government **rights** having been elected on a platform which the people accepted?

* Upon what authority do they walk roughshod over the **rights** of the Australian people?

* What became of the **rights** of the majority?

* Such a policy, as the Committee points out, need not be and it is not intended that it would be in derogation of States' **rights**.

* How hypocritical Australia will look in world forums for years to come, when we speak, as we have done in the past, of basic human **rights** and freedom for peoples of the world to determine their own future.

* This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's decisions on the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry as far as they affect Aboriginal land **rights**.

* My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  has already indicated that the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act will be amended to provide for the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to have appropriate **rights** of inspection and information.

* This Bill seeks similar **rights** for the Northern Land Council, as recommended by the inquiry in recommendation 18.2 (s).

* I am aware that moves by Aboriginal people to assert their **rights** as provided by the Aboriginal Land Rights Act have caused some people to become wary and even fearful of the new situation which now prevails.

* The amendments which are now being placed before the House are designed to give further effect to the Government's policies in relation to Aboriginal land **rights** and to allow Aboriginals, as I said in my statement to the House on 25 August last year, as owners of their land, to follow their own lifestyles on their own land to the extent that they choose, to participate in and influence the course of development of and on their traditional land, and to take advantage of the full range of opportunities which development may open up to them.

* The Corporation is empowered to employ its own staff and the Bill also contains safeguards designed to preserve the **rights** and entitlements of employees who are now engaged by the Wool Board and the Wool Commission upon their transfer to the Corporation.

* Up to that time the claims and the **rights** of immigrants were largely ignored.

* They were based upon needs that had arisen by virtue of the fact that for the first time in over 20 years when the Labor Party came to power immigrants recognised or began to recognise that they had **rights**, and they began to ask for those **rights**.

* Once again one would have thought that because we are acknowledging the greater need for language training and because more and more people are learning of their **rights** in this area, there would be an increase in the allocation for language teaching materials, but no.

* We know that migrants often do not know their **rights** and they will not come forward, so these people have to seek them out-  to encourage them to use the health resources available to them.

* They have the same **rights** as every other Australian but this Government is still continuing to ignore their **rights**.

* The Commonwealth is an institution devoted to the promotion of international understanding and world peace, and to the achievement of equal **rights** for all citizens regardless of race, colour, sex, creed or political belief, and is committed to the eradication of the dangerous evils of racism and racial prejudice, 
We affirm that there should be no discrimination based on race, colour, sex, descent or national or ethnic origin in the acquisition or exercise of the right to vote, in the field of civil **rights** or access to citizenship, or in the economic, social or cultural fields, particularly education, health, employment, occupation, housing, social security and cultural life.

* We are particularly conscious of the importance of the contribution the media can make to human **rights** and the eradication of racism and racial prejudice by helping to eliminate ignorance and misunderstanding between people and by drawing attention to the evils which afflict humanity.

* In particular the Commonwealth should seek to enhance the co-ordination of its activities with those of other organisations similarly committed to the promotion and protection of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* We affirm that there should be no discrimination based on race, colour, sex, descent or national or ethnic origin in the acquisition or exercise of the right to vote, in the field of civil **rights** or access to citizenship, or in the economic, social or cultural fields, particularly education, health, employment, occupation, housing, social security and cultural life.

* The sorts of things which have higher priority include States **rights**, amicable relations with the States, the new Federalism policy, the need to develop and to sell our mineral resources, the need to attract investment in mining and the exploration for and development of oil resources, the tourist industry, the pastoral industry and the fishing industry.

* I do not pretend that money should be the be-all and end-all of the commitment to Aboriginal **rights**.

* People have **rights** as well as does property and, in a just society, the dignity and self respect of human beings will be recognised as the mainspring for human activity and aspirations.

* The **rights** of property and the need for conformity in a property dominated society have been elevated above all else and assume qualities of sacredness which in many respects seem profane.

* This Aboriginal, dispossessed and deprived, finds the great virtues of the free enterprise society - greed and selfishness - oppressing him more and more and denying him fundamental **rights**, destroying his self respect and defiling his culture.

* Re-settlement in gigantic blocks of impersonal depersonalising flats or by people being cast indiscriminately into some distant, sprawling, soulless and unattractive housing development only gives sharpness to the edge of my criticism that people are not accorded the **rights** and respect to which they should have an unalienable entitlement as human beings.

* Whatever reservations we may have about methods employed in asserting those **rights** to self-determination and a recognised place in their original homeland- there is clearly a new and vigorous spirit, a new sense of destiny among the leaders of the displaced Arabs, a new confidence in their **rights** to selfdetermination and independence within a Palestine state of their own.

* Despite erratic and inadequate notification of **rights** to claimants, coupled with an appeals body that lacks independence and may have its decisions reversed by the Director-General of Social Security, more than 50 per cent of those unemployment beneficiaries who appeal against termination of benefit are found to have been unjustly penalised.

* Is there anything strange or unnatural about these **rights**?

* All of us know that there have been significant changes in the area of Commonwealth responsibility but by the arbitrary exclusion of the **rights** of the States to operate in a field such as this there is not only a denial of equity but there is also a denial of a pattern of tradition and of effective administrative operation which is not justified.

* Indeed, as far as off-shore mineral **rights** are concerned, it is only the States which have been intimately involved in the past.

* It is intended to deprive the Federal States of Australia of **rights** which have been theirs since the days when they were first colonised.

* Perhaps they have not exercised those **rights** in the past in the way in which they may exercise them in the future.

* But this Bill, in its amended form, will preserve some of those **rights**.

* If the States were to fail to do so, I believe that the **rights** of every individual in Australia would be seriously prejudiced.

* I think the difference between the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock),  the Government and the Opposition on this matter really comes back to an approach to the responsibilities- as supporters of the government see them- and the role of the security forces and our approach in balancing that role with the **rights** and liberties of Australian citizens.

* It is one of the functions of our intelligence and security forces to protect and enhance the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people.

* The difference between the honourable member for Dundas, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and members of the Opposition is simply this: We say that when it comes to balancing those two issues the presumption always has to be and should be on defending the **rights** of the citizen, not on imposing additional and complex responsibilities on the Director-General.

* Its attitude towards the Parliament is that because it is a defence matter none of us have any **rights** at all.

* I am not suggesting that a husband has paramount **rights**; but I would have thought that in many circumstances equity would have screamed out for consultation with the husband.

* There appeared to be very clear **rights** given to the Australian Government under Article 3 of the agreement between the United States and Australia about the United States Naval Communications Station at North West Cape.

* It states: 
I should like to warn the Government that if these amendments are accepted it is quite possible that the position of the Aborigines ideologically in relation to land could be more significant in respect of this country's position in the world than are the **rights** of mining companies or miners.

* As we were travelling together in a car I told him about Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra, who had refused to be used to lead a group of demonstrators for Aboriginal land **rights** in a procession in Melbourne.

* I pointed out to the director of the Swiss company that if Wulaymbuma Wunungmurra had not had that perception and had led the group and been hit by the police with batons while demonstrating for his land **rights** the company director and all his public relations would not have made as much impact in the world as would have the violence directed against an Aborigine while demonstrating on such a matter.

* Undoubtedly the **rights** of the Aboriginal people to land will be swept under the carpet, just like South Africa's apartheid and many of the other racial issues which were ignored in the past and now have become major world issues.

* The Government has shown sensitivity to mining companies and their interests will not count nearly as much in the world's evaluation of Australia as will the extent to which Australia recognises the dignity and **rights** of these Aboriginal people.

* If you reject a man on the grounds of his politics or his religion, he may change them to please you, but if you reject him on the ground of race in any way whatsoever by discrimination in regard to his land **rights**, there is no way in the world he can change his race to please you.

* He knows that the claims of land **rights** have never been accepted by the Queensland Government and that this is quite serious for this country.

* We have given them voting **rights**, drinking **rights** and fornicating **rights** that they never used to have inter-racially, all of which did not cost the Treasury a farthing.

* But this question of their land **rights** may cost something; it may take something from the mining companies or from us or from our future prospects.

* Most Aborigines who are working for their **rights** think it is unfortunate that these sentiments have developed in the Federal Parliament about the Northern Territory.

* He relentlessly pursued civil **rights** reforms, including the Voting Rights Act of 196S, and he launched a massive programme of aid to schools and universities.

* Domestically, he achieved a significant programme of reforms, particularly in the fields of social services and legal **rights**.

* I repeat: No person can show contempt for the **rights** and privileges of one member of the Parliament without at the same time heaping contempt upon the **rights** and privileges of every member.

* Moreover, it is equally correct to say that parliamentary **rights** are inseverable from the **rights** of the whole of the Australian people.

* The purpose of these 2 Bills is to give effect to the Government's proposals for the preservation of superannuation **rights** of contributors to the 3 contributory retirement benefits schemes established under the Superannuation Act 1922-1969 and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1970, namely, the Superannuation Fund, the Provident Account- 
In broad terms, preservation will work as follows.

* In addition, a person who moves to public employment with the States, including State universities, will be able to preserve his superannuation **rights**.

* If they transfer from the armed Services to the ordinary Service or from the ordinary Service to the armed Services, at least their **rights** are protected.

* But their **rights** must be respected.

* Present **rights** of appeal are much more limited.

* We have States **rights** exemplified to an unreal degree to the disadvantage of nearly all in the industry.

* That is the only measure in the Bill that attempts to give land **rights**, but the fact is that it gives no **rights** at all.

* It does not confer **rights** on anybody.

* It guarantees in no way whatsoever land **rights** to Aboriginal people.

* Land **rights** are supposed to be secured to the Aboriginal people under the 
Bill, but nowhere is there a right for anybody to maintain that they, according to this Bill, are entitled to a particular area of land.

* The procedure therefore is completely without any form that gives land **rights**.

* Therefore, one asks this very basic question: Why is this measure supposed to guarantee land **rights** to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory?

* So far I have not been able to find a provision that guarantees land **rights** to the Aboriginal clans.

* Land **rights** are left solely in the hands of a body which is very broadly based and which will, if a dispute arises, I would think, shatter the Aboriginal communities in a place like Arnhem Land.

* Of course we know that over a period the question of title to land and the **rights** of people to particular land under Aboriginal lore would result in a loss of memory on the part of people as to who were the old traditional owners of the land.

* We find in these 2 clauses no basic guarantee of land **rights**; no basic guarantee of natural justice to those who may require some sort of a hearing; and no independent body set up in order to determine matters.

* Those are the bases of **rights**.

* If we intend giving land **rights** we should recognise those facts.

* They will arise in the future particularly when questions of mineral **rights** and the like are important and significant.

* If Aboriginal people, for instance, are to be given **rights** in relation to 2 kilometres of sea how will the area be divided if the Aboriginal lands meet one another at the shore line?

* I raise them so that for the future- as we are laying guidelines for the future- we guarantee the **rights** in the proper way.

* There were three questions here involving national development, the Commissioner for Taxation and the **rights** of shareholders of companies to know when a major interest buys into those companies.

* I raise this matter as one of considerable principle because I think it is a matter of importance that if the Parliament stands by and permits the Executive, whatever Executive is in power, to interfere with the **rights** of the office holders of the Parliament, then we are in effect letting those office holders down, and as they go down the system goes down.

* Members should have the right to protest against the passage of legislation and they should have increased **rights** to incorporate additional material in  Hansard  to save everybody's time.

* Clarification Bill debated here on 10 May 1973, the **rights** were preserved when pregnancy had reached a period of 23 weeks.

* I made the point on that occasion that the fundamental question was whether the **rights** of an unborn child should be recognised during the whole or only part of a pregnancy.

* I shall not read the full article, but in part it states: 
The interests of  Mr D.  R. Colville and of Baron Guy de Rothschild include the following holdings which ate owned (beneficially or nonbeneficially) either by N. M. Rothschild and Sons, in which both directors are partners, or by a company in which N. M. Rothschild and Sons controls more than one third of the voting **rights**.

* I would like to think that in the future the **rights** of individuals will be important, that small things will be important.

* If this Parliament does not concern itself occasionally with the **rights** of individuals then ultimately individuals in Australia may not count.

* Terrence Collins joined the armed Services believing that people like the ex-member- he is almost the ex-member for Riverina- or rather the ex-lieutenant-colonel would do everything in their power to make sure that he was made well aware of his **rights**.

* To the best of my knowledge, this serviceman at least and other servicemen whom I have questioned have never been informed of their **rights**.

* In all their pristine ignorance they have fondly believed that lieutenant-colonels would look after their **rights**, but lieutenant-colonels generally have not looked after their **rights**.

* Women who have just discovered that equal pay does not yet mean equal opportunity, or even equal **rights** to employment when employers are forced to retrench, may question the value of equalities which are not enforced.

* The fact that the Opposition bases its elitist program on the supposed extention of the freedom of the individual illustrates dramatically what a jaundiced concept it has of human **rights**.

* You will be interfering with the sacred **rights** of us Victorians if you make us join with those people from north of the Murray'.

* Honourable members opposite cannot make any case for preserving States' **rights** or anything else.

* But on the question of the constitutional **rights** of the Aboriginal people there is no doubt that the Parliament has absolute and complete constitutional powers and an absolute mandate.

* One of the ways in which we can do this is to recognise that Aboriginal people are distinctive, that they have their **rights** and that these **rights** ought to be respected.

* I say all these things to show that the image that the Opposition is trying to create - of preferment and compatibility, of the supposed exchange of **rights** between the United Kingdom and the Australian Governments - is false.

* He claims that the Authority should have trading **rights** to buy and sell hydrocarbons.

* courses designed to impart an understanding of the **rights** and duties of an Australian citizen and of the way of living of the Australian people.

* These recommendations would allow residential land to be held on freehold basis, except that the Government would retain the development **rights**.

* But what the Opposition seeks in this amendment is an important principle: There should be some statutory recognition of the **rights** of private members so far as the drafting of instruments and amendments in the Parliament are concerned.

* The Opposition thinks this is a time to make the concession, now when the **rights** of private members in Parliament are being constantly categorised as declining.

* The honourable member spoke about the **rights** of this man and said that this man should be allowed to come in here.

* No doubt the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  will give to me some of his high thoughts, but I would suggest to him to go out into the market place and ask the Australian people what they feel about Wilfred Burchett and his **rights** within Australia.

* The Federal Conference of the Labor Party in its industrial relations policy placed human **rights** and values first and provided for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere.

* Our policies strive to encourage, protect and respect the **rights** and responsibilities of all those engaged in industry.

* Those are, firstly, to what extent does this nation require the services of such an organisation and, secondly, to what extent do our responsibilities as a national government demand that we protect and secure the **rights** of the citizens of Australia?

* To protect the **rights** of those people who call themselves Australians and who in the majority are law-abiding citizens, there must be some form of security organisation even if the socalled **rights**- the civil **rights**- of those few subversive elements have to be denied them.

* If telephone tapping and intelligence gathering are to be regarded as denying civil **rights** to those few, it must be remembered once again that in our society it is only the guilty who have to worry about being denied their liberties which normal and good living Australians will retain and enjoy.

* Secondly, this new Austraiian population deserves protection and these people should have the same **rights** and should be encouraged to express their aspirations as all Australians do without fear of recrimination from outside influences.

* We have to be able to protect their **rights** and guarantee to secure them against previous allegiances, as we should for all Australians against the challenges of the few who would want to interfere with and disrupt our way of life.

* If there is an argument it is whether the legislation strikes a reasonable balance between the maintenance of national security and the protection of personal privacy and individual **rights**.

* This naturally strikes fear into the hearts of all States **rights** conscious Premiers, not the least of whom is the Premier of Queensland.

* 1 ) Has the Indonesian Government indicated through diplomatic channels that Australian companies with petroleum and mineral concessions in East Timor will be welcome to stay if they negotiate their **rights** with the Indonesian Government 
The principal weakness in the system is the authoritarianism in the schools.

* The Opposition has had people who have examined this legislation from the view point of industrial conditions, salary fixation, the **rights** and powers of the Commissioner and so on.

* What are the (a) salaries, (b) daily allowances, (c) travel allowances and (d) travel **rights**, etc., for members of the various statutory marketing boards and corporations.

* -The matter that was raised by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)  concerning human **rights** interests me because the fact is that the former Attorney-General committed the Government to the establishment of the Human Rights Commission by 1 July.

* As I see it, there is a need for human **rights** to be uniform throughout Australia.

* It is clear that this Government puts States **rights** before human **rights**.

* Section 123 of the Constitution guarantees the **rights** of States to determine whether their borders will be changed.

* But the Prime Minister sought to ride over not only the Constitution but also the **rights** of the Islanders and of the Queenslanders.

* In moving in this direction, as it has attempted to do in the past, the Government is ignoring the **rights** and responsibilities it ought to have in mind of the individual members of the trade union movement.

* This legislation is important because it relates to the **rights** of individual rank and file members of the trade union movement and to the responsibility that the Government ought to accept to ensure that the proper rules for registration under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are designed to maintain and enhance those **rights** and not to belittle them.

* If the Minister were really sincere in wanting the rank and file membership of the union to have their **rights** protected, he would agree that this is the best possible way of doing that and that it is the best possible way of seeing to it that every member of an organisation can, without fear and without favour, have a view on a particular question and put that view in such a manner that it will count.

* Again that provision runs in the face of the **rights** and responsibilities of the rank and file members of the union.

* One of the odd things about the Minister is that when he wants to attack union officials and appeal over their heads to the shop stewards and to the rank and file membership, he is doing everything he can, in his words, to uphold the **rights** of the rank and file membership.

* Now he has an opportunity to do so but instead he brings in a measure which would deny the membership those **rights** and deny the position of the rank and file members in organisations.

* There are other grounds for objection, and these other grounds strike in the same direction, namely, the removal of **rights** from members of unions.

* There can be other rules of a union, an organisation, that certainly affect the **rights** of individual members of an organisation, and those rules in the case of an amalgamation can be changed in such a way as would affect those **rights**.

* These things can be done under cover of an amalgamation arrangement, and at the same time the **rights** of individual members of a union, an organisation, are further reduced because in relation to those unions which have a collegiate system of election, where there is not direct election by the rank and file, the Minister is inserting a provision which states that for 3 years after amalgamation the rank and file members will not get a vote.

* It is an argument about **rights** and whether or not people ought to be allowed to do certain things.

* Again we get back to the **rights** of individual members about which I thought the Minister would show more concern.

* the repeal of those parts of the National Health Act governing the operation of the existing health insurance scheme after all **rights** and obligations have been satisfied.

* If they are not, it appears to me to be a denial of **rights** to Aboriginals.

* Some honourable members opposite certainly have not forgotten about the State when it comes to criticising that great Queenslander, Joh Bjelke Petersen, who, as a great defender, has safeguarded the **rights** of a small section of Queenslanders whom the Labor Party seeks to steamroll into Papua New Guinea.

* Advance notice is served that I am totally opposed to the centralisation of power in Canberra by the devious method of eroding the powers, and **rights** of the individual - and this is surely the most sacred right of all - and attempting to destroy the State and local authorities.

* They both point to the outer edge of the margin as the limit of the coastal state's **rights**.

* Third, the **rights** claimed by Australia in the Timor Sea area are based unmistakably on the morphological structure of the sea bed.

* As a member of the Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which prepared the report on human **rights** in the Soviet Union, I would like to make a few points.

* That is why the present position in respect of human **rights** exists in the Soviet Union, as illustrated in this report.

* I make one point in relation to human **rights** in the Soviet Union and in relation to the nationality question: I do not necessarily support nationalistic claims, whether they be by people who originated in the Baltic States or in the Ukraine, those of Jews and so on and tend to oppose nationalism.

* I would like to make a couple of points about human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* I think that those of us who have been interested in the question of freedom and the question of human **rights** in the Soviet Union and in other countries know- the report emphasises it in its first conclusions- that there have been positive changes.

* In the greatest number of cases the practice has been that the most effective way is not criminal prosecution but striking at a person's mode of existence- his job level of income and so on- and administrative measures such as the reduction of certain **rights** and advantages.

* There can be no doubt, as all of us see the situation, that the citizens of this country are demanding that some action be taken about their **rights**.

* In all the areas that we might recognise as regions we should have these legal aid and consumer protection offices- not based, as I said, on the concept of waiting in the office for the people to come in but actively agitating out in the community and advising the people of their **rights** and the manner in which they should go about their shopping.

* But some honourable members should be allowed to stand up as friends of the protectists of the **rights** of the individual in relation to privacy, and I place myself in that category.

* The amendment refers to the Government's refusal to restore land **rights** to Aborigines.

* Only in the last 18 months has an Australian government begun to recognise the **rights** of these people.

* The recommendations contained in the report go a long way to meeting the demands of the Aboriginal people within the limits of the terms of the Commission, which were essentially on the question of Aboriginal land **rights** in the Northern Territory.

* The report essentially recognises the **rights** of Aboriginal people to have control over land on which they live through a lands commission of Aboriginal people.

* The report does not deal with land **rights** in the States nor with other areas of recognition of the **rights** of Aborigines.

* However, there is a requirement in this country - and I am sure the people agree - for clarification as to how far people can break or abuse the law and abuse the **rights** of other people by preventing them from going about their affairs or by creating incidents so that industry and business or private matters cannot be conducted.

* I would argue strongly against such a proposal as the States have certain **rights** and they are certainly much closer to the problems associated with the development of this country than is the Commonwealth and they must be taken into consideration.

* It is understood that further appraisal has been deferred until production leases are granted and this is subject to the resolution of relevant Aboriginal lands **rights** issues.

* The Agreement which this Bill will ratify has been produced as a result of extensive discussions at both ministerial and official levels and takes account of the interests and **rights** of all parties.

* Clause 9 relates to the **rights** of officers when a department, or part of a department, is abolished.

* Provision is also made for further appeals to continue to safeguard the **rights** of other officers.

* That Act was passed in 1 928 to preserve the **rights** of officers who became employees of certain statutory authorities.

* It is a denial of **rights** to the local Aborigines.

* They have hunting **rights**, foraging **rights**, and even ceremonial **rights**.

* Even the ceremonial **rights** are divided.

* I would think that the inclusion of clause 40 (2) really takes away from Aboriginals all that they themselves mean by land **rights**.

* But I am one who believes that it should not pass outside the scope of members of this Parliament to decide in relation to those who have breached what we consider to be the **rights**, dignity and privileges of this House.

* The second principle should be to endeavour to preserve the **rights** of migrants to Australia who are not enjoying in Australia the full **rights** that they would have acquired in those other countries.

* In other words, it is important for us to try to protect, for example, the **rights** of certain German pensioners who, because they have become naturalised as Australian citizens, have lost their **rights** to German pensions.

* I shall certainly try, in negotiating this with the German Government, as far as possible to preserve here in Australia the **rights** of former German nationals who have become Australian citizens and are resident in Australia.

* The second is that we should preserve in Australia the **rights** of migrants who have come with pension **rights**, which they might otherwise lose, from their own country overseas.

* The second point is that this Bill if accepted would give away entirely the bargaining position of the Australian Government to protect the pension **rights** of people who have acquired them overseas and who have subsequently come to Australia and become Australian citizens.

* I am simply saying that if the Bill were adopted it would not put us in the position where we could bargain with overseas governments in order to protect the **rights** of Australian citizens who were formerly nationals of other countries.

* Today the Prime Minister in his statement had to undo the harm done by that statement when he talked about deportation not occurring to Australian citizens or there being no abridgement of the **rights** of Australian residents.

* In this Parliament and in many forums around the world, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has expressed in a most enlightened and constructive manner Australia's approach to a whole range of issues, many of which involve the preservation of human **rights** and the prospects and hope for a better and more peaceful world.

* I well recall over all these years- since 1952 when he came to this place- his recognition of the **rights** of people to express their judgment and his hope that their beliefs would see fulfilment and that they would have, as he has in common with us all, the conviction that this country will maintain its heritage and proceed into the future with a safe and secure standard of living for all of the people whom he represents, and whom I and all my colleagues on both sides of the House represent.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of statements made in Darwin by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs concerning the future of Aboriginal land **rights** legislation?

* Will the Prime Minister give the Northern Land Council and this House an assurance that the Government will not in any way, through legislation or otherwise, weaken the Northern Land Council or the land **rights** legislation should the present situation in the Northern Territory not produce a favourable result for the Government?

* I believe that if we move away from that principle there will be no end to a progressive weakening of community values and attitudes towards the **rights** of human beings to choose for themselves their very existence.

* At the end of the day these arguments of the quality of life for both parents and children and the **rights** of women have to be weighed on the scales against the principle of the right of human beings to be born, provided the safety of the mother's life is not at issue.

* I ask leave of the House to incorporate in  Hansard  a table which outlines political **rights** in the member countries.

* A figure '1' labels a country as having the highest level of political **rights** and the figure '7' for all practical purposes, labels countries as having no political **rights**.

* -The table shows the points that are given for political **rights** in the member countries.

* I think that one of the basic **rights** that human beings ought to have is the right to leave their own country.

* When did the conservative parties of this countrythe Liberal and Country parties- ever talk about passing legislation that would enshrine the principles of a bill of **rights**, of personal and human **rights**, in the Australian system of law?

* This question of principle, of constitutional propriety, is not a matter between the House of Representatives and the Senate; it is a matter between the **rights** of the electors of Australia and a government which demonstrably has failed to fill the trust placed upon it.

* On each occasion that the Prime Minister makes the assertion that the Senate lacks the power to defer a money Bill he demonstrates completely his failure to understand the **rights** and privileges of people in a democratic society.

* People have **rights** in war, and one of their **rights** is self defence.

* How long do people have to sustain attack and occupation by foreigners before they get some **rights**?

* I believe that the people of North Vietnam have **rights** because this is basically a civil war into which a foreign power - the United States - has entered.

* There has been no solution to the problem of land **rights**.

* (1) For the purposes of this Act, there shall be a Council, to be known as the Broadcasting Council, which, subject to this Act, shall have and may exercise the **rights**, powers, authorities and functions conferred upon it by this Act and shall be charged with and perform the duties and obligations imposed upon it by this Act.

* The exercise of the **rights**, powers, authorities or functions, or the performance of the duties or obligations, of the Council shall not be affected by reason only of there being a vacancy in the office of a member.

* That quote was not dragged out of the air by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen);  it was a statement made by the Attorney-General in the public media at a time when, it has to be presumed, he understood and had knowledge of the very considerable **rights** and powers that he had under this legislation.

* What we are dealing with is interference with the basic **rights** of the average Australian citizen.

* It is precisely because there is that difference of approach, that different perception of tasks, that the **rights** and liberties of Australian citizens would be made more secure if we adopted the phraseology and the standard set by the Attorney-General when he said that he was prepared to make as much detail as possible available to the Leader of the Opposition.

* I come back to these words of  Mr Justice  Hope: 
The honourable member for Dundas, in order to take a schoolboy debating point, deliberately attempted to misconstrue what was said by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, This amendment will go a long way to securing the confidence of at least half the Australian community who at present are concerned about this legislation and want to see legislation which will mean not only that our security force can have the powers that it needs to act but also that the **rights** and hard won liberties of the people are maintained and are secure.

* I suppose it is something when a Queensland member talks semi-favourably about land **rights** for Aboriginal people.

* We just would not trust it politically with anything to do with human **rights**, particularly Aboriginal **rights**.

* The Opposition does not hate the miners but we know full well that the mining industry has to be brought under very close scrutiny and control, particularly where human **rights** are concerned.

* I recognise the fact that the delay in the introduction of the legislation concerning councils is no reflection on anybody; neither do I lay too many charges of undue delay in respect of the land **rights** legislation as I recognise the great difficulty that is involved in drafting such legislation.

* He is deeply involved in the land **rights** question and, I have no doubt, in the whole operation of Aboriginal advancement.

* What that meant was that this Parliament has no right whatsoever to abdicate its responsibility in respect of land **rights** and hand any control, any possibility of interference, over to any State government or particularly to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* When I hear my friend the honourable member for Lilley almost spraining his elbows and bis arms to pat himself and the Government on the back in this matter I am reminded of the long history of colonial peoples in the world and the efforts of people, even such strange people and nondemocrats as George III, to try to ensure that people should get their proper **rights**.

* On 19 February 1836 the following direction was issued in respect of South Australia provided always that nothing in these our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affect the **rights** of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment of their own persons ... of any lands .

* That is why, for my own purpose, I would say in this instance that we should give no consideration to anybody else's **rights**, whether national or otherwise, to go and mine land at all, until the Aboriginal people can handle the impact.

* We have to do something to protect them against the possibility of being persuaded into getting rid of their **rights** for the time being.

* In matters of land **rights** and the advancement of the Aboriginal people, particularly the protection of this fundamental principle, this Parliament must accept the full responsibility.

* In the 20-odd years since I first became involved in Aboriginal **rights** we have had lots of discussion.

* We have been associated with Aboriginal **rights** from the very beginning.

* Certainly it ought to be a basic, fundamental statement of human **rights** and of the position in which every human being ought to be able to see himself placed.

* Despite the engulfing legality which surrounds the point of contention, I believe that the State governments are not at all concerned for the legal **rights** of their States but simply for the revenue that may accrue from the royalties consequent on any discoveries off their coast.

* I am alarmed that some divisions exist among honourable members opposite, particularly with respect to State **rights**.

* The Minister will clearly be giving a fully detailed statement concerning the Government's proposals, and in that it will become quite clear that a major objective of the Government in these matters is to protect the **rights** of individual employees against opressive actions by unions or by employers.

* So, I suggest to honourable members on both sides of the House that it is not necessary to put pressure on the Australian Government but to put pressure on the State governments, irrespective of their political persuasion, to make them recognise that this is a case where States' **rights** are nonsense.

* It is people's **rights** which are important, and that means all the people along the River Murray in all the States.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* The amendment moved by the Opposition once again demonstrates the length to which the Opposition would be prepared to go if elected to office to usurp absolutely the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* Has the Australian Broadcasting Commission purchased from the Channel 9 network the 1977 EnglandAustralia cricket test series television **rights** for Perth, Hobart and all country television areas of Australia. 
)

* If so, what sum was paid by the ABC for the program **rights**.

* -In the couple of minutes that are available to me, I participate in the discussion that has taken place tonight about the **rights** of people to join and not to join unions.

* In my experience the use of legal definition of accident, injury or disease has been such that the workers have not received their proper **rights**.

* An example of the effect of the amendments can be shown by reference to the Ockenden case, in which the High Court of Australia said: 
I am pleased that this legislation will remove that terrible impost on a worker trying to establish his **rights** to workers compensation.

* We live in a society in which the wage and salary earner has lost the most basic of all human **rights**, which is the right to decide whether and on what terms he will allow another to use his labour power.

* In Canada a dispute between the provincial governments over off-shore **rights** is still not resolved notwithstanding the advisory opinion given by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1967 in relation to British Columbia.

* There had been no determination of the **rights** of the nation or the **rights** of the various States to the areas of our nation beyond the low water mark.

* How ridiculous it is to suggest, as some of them have done, that States' **rights** and the people's welfare will be threatened if this Bill is passed by this Parliament.

* Firstly, the qualifying or vesting period for preservation of **rights** has been reduced from 20 years to 5 years, so that if a woman wishes after 5 years to leave the Public Service for reasons of child rearing, she can do so, return at a later date and have her **rights** preserved.

* Where a public servant wishes to transfer to the private sector his **rights** are preserved if he qualifies for the period of 5 years to which I have referred.

* Have reports from myself and others indicated to the Minister and his predecessors the lack of effective selfmanagement, self-determination, cultural independence, religious tolerance and of Aboriginal beliefs, respect for traditional ritual relations with the land and civil **rights** in State-administered settlements in Queensland.

* Has Australia subscribed internationally to Conventions guaranteeing the **rights** of minorities which require specific programs and policies to ensure that intercultural communication is promoted and developed in a nondiscriminatory way.

* I admit that the States have argued that they have sovereign **rights** in this matter, but does anybody really believe that they have sovereign **rights**?

* Prior to Federation there were no such sovereign **rights** given to any State by  Her  Majesty's Government, and it was not until after Federation and Australia had become an independent nation that these **rights** obviously were conferred on the independent nation of Australia.

* Therefore the States have no sovereign **rights** as far as off-shore legislation goes.

* I believe this is what the Chief Justice,  Sir Garfield  Barwick, made clear when he said: 
At no stage were there any international or sovereign **rights** conferred on the States themselves.

* Calls in support of the right to dissent must be heeded, but they must not  be allowed to  deteriorate into attacks upon the proper **rights** and liberties of other people.

* I doubt whether there is any member of this House who would not agree that one of the fundamental democratic **rights** is that of dissent.

* "Liberal philosophy and practice accent the individual, his **rights** or her differences.

* But I certainly object the moment they transgress the **rights** of individuals who want to move about and go about their normal business.

* As I have said, this Government by its action this afternoon in introducing 3 Bills of fundamental national importance which affect the **rights** of the individual and the financial prosperity of every life insurance policy holder in Australia, and in allowing the time which it has allowed for debate has reduced government in this country to a farce, and the sooner the Government grasps the nettle that we have put in front of it and sends this Parliament to the people, the better it will be.

* He also claimed that the Australian Labor Party was the first party to introduce land **rights** for Aborigines.

* In 1971 the Legislative Council, as it then was, conferred land **rights** on Aborigines under the Northern Territory Lands Ordinance.

* Aborigines were given **rights** on reserves.

* They were given these **rights** and lived under better conditions than at Balanda and elsewhere.

* Although everyone supports Aboriginal land **rights**, great consideration should be given to the delicate situation of people who are training Aborigines.

* This is not a scheme to delay land **rights** for Aborigines.

* He said that he would examine the **rights** to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service of a person imprisoned under the Act.

* I believe that no government could justify a situation in which it denies forever the **rights** of these persons to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service or in other areas because of their criminal record.

* In turn, as against the $384m paid for imported technology to which I have just referred, Japan received only $50m by selling to other countries the **rights** for its own ideas.

* There is a lot of money to be made by countries which are able to patent inventions and then sell the patent **rights**, perhaps to other countries, apart from selling goods that they might produce as a result of that research.

* This again, has brought in quite a few hundreds of thousands of dollars by way of patent **rights** or royalties, as they might be termed.

* Personally, I hope that Australia produces the engine invented by  Mr Sarich  and will be able to reap much greater rewards than would be received by merely selling the patent **rights** to other countries.

* They have made a mockery of the word democracy' for they have created a society where 3 million white people have unprecedented power over the **rights** and freedom of 16 million black and coloured people.

* The Government's proposal is that where a person in the employment of Australia, a State or some public authority is sent overseas in the service of Australia, the authority or the State, he and his spouse are entitled to retain their enrolment and voting **rights**.

* In this particular clause the Government is seeking to facilitate the **rights** of certain citizens to vote in parliamentary elections.

* Even when they have been pursuing their political ends in the most ruthless way, they have always cloaked their tactics with the argument that they were exercising the **rights** of the States ' House.

* But on behalf of the Government I must say that we have abolished discriminations, but above all we have set out to preserve the aspirations as well as the **rights** of migrants.

* State **rights** and control of transport had been protected specifically by the previous government.

* Also where powers had been referred by a State, TAA's **rights** were clearly understood.

* Yet once again the Minister's second reading speech made no mention of this provision or this intended challenge to the States to have any **rights** at all in the transport field.

* He has cunningly contrived to combine that fact with inclusion of the word 'transport' so that TAA will get the **rights** to operate bus services and road transport generally in Papua New Guinea.

* The point which I sought to have clarified today was that, in order that I as a member of this Parliament may exercise the **rights** that are conferred upon me as a member of this House by the Standing Orders of this House, it is important that the rulings of the  Speaker  be clearly given on doubts that any honourable member may have with regard to the interpretation of the Standing Orders.

* It may have had information which he is concerned that we, the elected members of this House, should not see and which we, the elected members, are to be prevented from observing in exercise of the **rights** that we have under the Standing Orders.

* If he did not want to produce the document and if the document was of a special nature there are certain **rights** that he has as a Minister to indicate to the House that the papers are of a character that does not require him to produce them, but he did not exercise that right.

* You,  Sir, are  the custodian of the **rights** of the members of this House.

* Yesterday members of this House exercised their **rights**.

* They exercised their **rights** to peruse those documents, and because of the sleight of hand by the  Deputy  Prime Minister those **rights** have been denied.

* It is in our view your responsibility to see that those **rights** are protected.

* If it is intended by you that when that occurs that waives the first request you should so indicate to the members of this House so they can press their **rights** to have documents incorporated in Hansard as a whole and not small favourable pieces suiting the Minister.

* He, too, has some **rights** in this matter.

* Equality of political **rights** is inherent in a truly democratic state.

* They do this because they know that real political equality lies not in a strict mathematical formula but in giving every citizen, no matter where he lives, the greatest possible opportunity to enjoy full political **rights** and full political representation.

* They could not care less about real political **rights**.

* Patterson) has inferred that the introduction of an averment provision is in some way denying the fundamental **rights** of producers.

* This provision is not designed for the destruction of the **rights** of the grower.

* Any intrusion into the people's **rights** means that the democratic principles are not sustained.

* Every time a decision is made on a personal basis or deemed to be the prerogative of the occupant it is in our view an interference with the normal democratic **rights** that should prevail in any democracy.

* Austraha should have the same **rights**, powers and privileges as now apply in the United Kingdom.

* We would not have any other force indicating that there are some divine **rights** or a higher authority that can in any way interfere with the workings of a parliament or the life of a government.

* We see no need to retain this office as it is now occupied, because the occupant can interfere with the **rights** of a Parliament or the tenure of a government and can decide whether Ministers can continue to hold office.

* Any intrusion or action is a denial of democratic **rights**.

* If an attempt had been made in Great Britain to exercise powers such as have been exercised here in recent years the British Parliament would have passed such further laws as would have even prevented the Monarch from remaining on the throne, or would have interfered with the **rights** of succession.

* It may not be known in the Parliament,  Sir, but  I am a great defender of civil **rights**.

* As a great defender of civil **rights** I therefore must have regard for the feelings of my fellow man or fellow person, or whatever the appropriate expression may be.

* The major parts of the Bill concern, firstly, the **rights** of officers of the Public Service who move to other areas of Commonwealth employment and, secondly, the disciplinary provisions applicable to staff of the Service.

* One of the main provisions of the legislation refers to the present Officers' Rights Declaration Act 1928, which specifies the **rights** of permanent staff of the Public Service who engage in employment with Commonwealth authorities staffed outside the Public Service Act.

* The scheme covers officers who have taken up a position with a Commonwealth authority for a period of up to three years and maintains their **rights** in certain important ways.

* Greater emphasis will be placed on the specification of the **rights** of persons against whom disciplinary action is taken, including such matters as **rights** of reply to charges, entitlements to reasons for decisions, extension of appeal **rights** to cover all formal disciplinary action and provisions enabling findings to be reviewed when new evidence comes to light.

* Some countries which have adopted a Bill of Rights with constitutional guarantees have found that the number of cases in the courts endeavouring to enforce constitutional **rights** so guaranteed have accumulated to a point where it takes a very long time for the cases to come on.

* I suggest that those who seek to put their **rights** into the realm of legal guarantee should ask themselves whether they would be giving the citizens a better and higher right than they have under the current system.

* Four pages of guarantees relating to civil **rights** were, written into the constitution of that country.

* But I think I would rather be living here under the protection of our traditions, our habits of thoughts and our rules of law than under a constitution guaranteeing those **rights**.

* There are not a great many of these reports but it was  a  matter of concern, I know, during the period when I was Attorney-General as to whether there should not be some form of appeal where  a  person's **rights** had been affected by a report.

* Firstly, I think more attention has to be given to the **rights** of the policemen themselves.

* We are worried about the **rights** of appeal.

* We believe they should be given adequate **rights** of appeal.

* We believe they should be given adequate **rights** of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, disciplines and demotions.

* There are certain industrial **rights**, in a sense, which the Bill neglects.

* Contracts entered into before that date will become unenforceable, although a new provision in clause 87 will enable the Court to make consequential adjustments to the **rights** of parties.

* A new clause 73 has been included to deal specifically with the **rights** of parties in hire purchase transactions.

* Papua New Guinea is now exercising the **rights** of nationhood.

* As I have said, **rights**, authority and power create responsibilities and obligations.

* First, the Bill seeks to ensure that racial discrimination should be proscribed by law and fundamental **rights** and freedoms, without distinction as to race, should be guaranteed by law.

* Second, it is proposed that there should be created a comprehensive framework of legal remedies for the enforcement of these **rights**.

* We are going to be able to encourage people to take a different view of the **rights** of individuals because all Australian citizens should have equal **rights**.

* They have been part of the traditional development of the Parliament to protect the **rights** of discussion and to protect people against hasty legislation.

* But when we are asked to surrender all of our traditional **rights**, then our **rights** come before any motion before the House.

* As the honourable member for Bradfield  (Mr Turner),  the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  and honourable members on this side of the House have said so adequately, eloquently and continuously today, we are departing so serously from the traditions of general parliamentary government and democratic **rights** that, we are putting the Parliament itself in a hopeless position.

* Despite this we hear condemnation of the Aboriginal legal **rights** organisation.

* At least now, because of the Aboriginal legal **rights** organisation, when an Aboriginal appears in court he is assured of getting just representation in the court and will not be charged with an offence of which they were not guilty, as used to happen time and again throughout Australia.

* All persons regardless of colour, race or creed should enjoy equal **rights** and freedom.

* These **rights** have been ignored for Jehovah's Witnesses in Malawi.

* In terms of employment in the AGIC women will have the same **rights** and opportunities as men.

* Until recently the Minister for Social Services who is, under the Prime Minister, the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, was regarded as the Government spokesman in matters of this kind, but on 3rd September the Minister for the Interior made a statement in this place that the Government would not recognise traditional Aboriginal land **rights**.

* If the recent legislation dealt with in the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory, which will enable Aboriginals to obtain a title to land in the Aboriginal reserves, is not a recognition of traditional land **rights**, what is it?

* If the statement made by the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs about the sacred objects and sites of the Aboriginals at Wingellina in Western Australia, in which he expressed his concern that these places should not be despoiled and damaged by the mining company or other developments there, was not a recognition of traditional land **rights**, what was it?

* I would like to see the Minister indicate an attitude on Aboriginal land **rights**; the recognition of land **rights** for Aboriginals who live in a traditional way; the recognition of communities of people as at Wattie Creek and the **rights** that they have, because they are communities of people and have retained a good deal of their tribal integrity; a measure of compensation for land **rights** which would be spelt out with legislation which has already been introduced into this Parliament and which will shortly again be discussed.

* It represented a tearingup, as a result of Labor policy, of the **rights** of individuals who had entered into very important engagements in the legal sphere.

* This is a clear example of the Labor Party's much vaunted respect for the **rights** of the little man being seen to be completely nullified.

* Memories are very short but I hope they are not so short that we cannot remember the Vietnam moratorium marches, the anti-apartheid demonstrations, the anti-conscription rallies and the Aboriginal **rights** demonstrations.

* He lost out on the Gurindji land **rights** case after promising 8 square miles of land to the Gurindji tribe at Wave Hill.

* It was in relation to the **rights** of de facto wives.

* They do in fact have certain **rights**.

* I indicated that at least this was consistent with a tradition which was less than commendable of antiLabor goverments - the 1913 Cook Government, the 1923 to 1928 period under the Bruce-Page Government and the 1938 period under the Lyons Government - which gave pledges to the public that people had **rights** in retirement and in certain situations of crisis need, and that the only way to overcome or to satisfy these needs was through a contributory system of social insurance.

* The **rights** of our people demand that we should do nothing less.

* I implore the Minister not to diminish the **rights** of States or to erode the autonomy of local government.

* It is almost impossible to believe that the congenial and lovable Fred Daly quite suddenly becomes a diabolical character who will gag a debate in a split second and deprive honourable members of the normal democratic **rights** they have to express their points of view.

* The Opposition has some **rights** in a parliamentary system.

* One of the **rights** of the Opposition is to have sufficient time to examine legislation, to consider it at a party level and to discuss it with those sections of the community which have an interest in the legislation or will be affected by the legislation.

* It is a total denial of the **rights** of the Australian people, let alone the Parliament, for legislation of such significance to be passed through the Parliament without any real consideration by the Parliament and without any opportunity to examine the contents of that legislation being given to those who are responsible for discussion and putting an alternative point of view to the Parliament on behalf of the Australian people.

* Passage of legislation of this importance through the Parliament - 
It is not my role here to defend overseas corporations, but I suppose it could and should be said that they have **rights**, as do Australian corporations.

* I appeal to all voting Australians to support this move to see that their fellow citizens in the Territories are given the right to vote in referenda so that they can exercise the same democratic **rights** as all other voting citizens and express their points of view of issues which concern them as much as they concern other citizens of the Commonwealth.

* While the acceptance of this proposition will remove one of the main obstacles to full citizens' **rights** to Territorial citizens it will not remove the doubt cast on the validity of Territorial representation which was implied in the remarks of the Chief Justice in the recent High Court judgment.

* We provided for these contingencies and we are now exercising those **rights** as laid down under the Constitution to make the amendments by way of referendum.

* I was recently told- the honourable member for Hume again implied it about my colleaguesthat I did not support federalism and that I did not support States' **rights**.

* My answer then and my answer now is and always will be that I do not; I support people's **rights**.

* They are paramount and they take the place of States' **rights** and they take the place of the Federal Government's **rights**.

* I do not support the **rights** of a State to obstruct and thwart programs financed by Australian Government money, bearing in mind that this Australian Government was elected to office.

* Mr CORBETT (Maranoa) ^^^Notwithstanding all my gallantry I must disagree and be at cross-purposes with the honourable member for Henry  (Mrs Child)  who said that she does not support State **rights**.

* To give her her due, she said that she supports people's **rights**.

* As I see it, in supporting State **rights** members of the Opposition are supporting the State **rights** of the people of those States, and this is the fundamental issue.

* In depriving the States of their **rights** the Government is depriving the people of the States of the **rights** they now enjoy.

* A government with the slightest respect for free institutions and the **rights** of members of the Parliament, a government with an ounce of sensitivity to the public's anxiety on this matter, would at least feel obliged to explain and justify this gross departure from democratic practice, this gross abuse of the law enforcement agencies of the Crown.

* I wish only that as a member of this Parliament he had shown the same respect for its traditions and the **rights** of its members as he has shown himself diligent in political advocacy and the pursuit of personal advancement.

* He was rewarded for - 
ensure that all lands vested in the States or Commonwealth will be retained and that private **rights** to such land is limited to leasehold.

* The individual's conscience does not give him a licence to indulge individual conviction without regard to the **rights** of others.

* The state must not only respect these **rights**; it must also protect the dissenter from other citizens who try to prevent him exercising his **rights**.

* The Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909-1955 gave the Australian Government paramount **rights** over the waters of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo Rivers.

* Negotiations have taken place between the various Federal and State authorities regarding riparian **rights**, land acquisition, water supply for Queanbeyan, the control of the catchment area and the control of flood flows.

* Once again it intends to ask the .people whether they want their local government - the level of government to which it is claimed they are closest- to have access to the Loan Council so that it may enjoy the same **rights** as the States and not be just a Cinderella and a creature of the States to be brought forward and disbanded at will.

* Speaking about States **rights**, sovereign **rights**, national governments, national parliaments and asking people questions, it is my firm belief that under the rather loose system that operates in Australia so far as the States are concerned, it must be understood and it is understood that the Australian Government works in a rather tight straight jacket.

* The **rights** of private members are not the first objective of the Minister.

* But I suggest that gradually, as time has gone by and as honourable members have seen what has flowed from this decision to close the Parliament down at 11 o'clock at night, an increasing number of people have been prepared to return to the old system under which we sat later if the Government's legislative program or the **rights** of private members demanded.

* Why are we talking about taking away the **rights** of the parties to consider legislation properly?

* As I have said, so that the Minister can maintain his reputation, the hours of this Parliament are being distorted and private members' **rights** are being taken away.

* In fact, what is hap pening in this Parliament and throughout the country is that our **rights** are being what I would call 'Whitlamised' away.

* The Government's resources policy rests on five considerationsAustralia's future energy and industrial requirements must be met; full account must be taken of the effect of mining on the **rights** of our Aboriginal people; opportunities should be enlarged for Australians to share in the ownership and development of Australian mineral resources; encouragement should be given for greater processing of minerals in Australia; and efforts must be made to ensure that our resources command a fair price in world markets.

* This motion is typical of Labor Party philosophy to centralise everything in Canberra and ignore the **rights** and responsibilities of the States.

* It should be noted that these States are leaders in extending voting **rights** in line with increasing responsibilities.

* These States, jealous of their State **rights** and justice, would seem justified in demanding votes at Federal elections for their enfranchised under their State laws, but section 41 of the Federal Constitution states: 
It is this point on which I wish to expand.

* It is fortunate that this Bill we are now debating can remove the anachronism and the anomaly of depriving 18-year-olds of voting **rights** while demanding of them adult responsibilities,, rather than having to go to the people to change the Constitution.

* The Commission said: 
By 18 most young people are ready for these responsibilities and **rights**, and would greatly profit by them, as would the teaching authorities, the business community, the administration of justice and the community as a whole.

* Those 18-year- olds will fee] that their **rights** are being neglected or ignored.

* The arguments for lowering the voting age are strong, be they based on social, legal or civil **rights** grounds.

* This certainly accords with his well-known views on the powers and the **rights** of the Commonwealth, and on the role of the States.

* But before that happens this Parliament is being asked to decide its attitude, and in my opinion this Parliament should reject outright the over-riding of States' **rights** which the Prime Minister's proposal represents.

* If the words subject to this Constitution' in section 106 mean the Constitution as passed into law in 1900, then the Prime Minister cannot use the amending power of section 128 to cut down the **rights** of the states under section 106 simply by the device of inserting a new section called 106a.

* Federation and it will be acting to defend the sovereign **rights** of the States.

* I do not want to canvass the **rights** or wrongs of payroll tax,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  but I just say to you that they are the facts.

* I shall now move to deal with specific purpose grants which, it is claimed, distort State priorities and infringe State **rights**.

* If one wanted to work out a formula that would deny to teaching officers a right to recourse to the courts - a right to assert legal **rights** in the courts - one could not chose a better formula than the one chosen by the Minister because it is purely subjective.

* The major provisions concerning the protection of **rights** and functions of the boards have been included in legislation.

* The Bill set a time limit and, by **rights**, the agreement should have been terminated by 30th June this year.

* So if there is a conflict and the Attorney-General says to the Director-General: I believe that I am entitled to have this information in order to know how you conducted a particular aspect of your activities', the DirectorGeneral is perfectly within his legal **rights** to say I am very sorry, Attorney-General; I do not propose to tell you'.

* This very Government, this very AttorneyGeneral  (Senator Durack)-  these people who talk about our system- are creating an exception which could ultimately undermine in very serious ways the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people.

* Do we say that the Director-General is a man of such unblemished character that his judgment ultimately ought to prevail as against the **rights** of the Attorney-General on these very serious issues?

* I am sorry that my erudite friend, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  who one day might even be the Attorney-General, is prepared to vote for legislation which would limit his traditional **rights**, his traditional prerogatives, rather than the **rights** and prerogatives of the Director-General.

* I believe that is a very serious inroad into the whole concept of ministerial responsibility and therefore is a very serious derogation of the **rights** and powers of this Parliament.

* What kind of society do we operate when there are special **rights** for miners?

* Those of us who have a piece of land somewhere on this continent do not own the mineral **rights**, although I understand that in parts of New South Wales they do.

* Honourable members opposite are saying that Aboriginal people must not have special **rights**.

* However, in this country miners do have special **rights**.

* In clause 7 mining interests, mining **rights** and mining are defined in the traditional terms of the miners of Australia whose **rights** transcend those of anybody else, even those who have lived here for countless thousands of years and for whom the land is something spiritual and not proprietary.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  referred earlier to the Magellan **rights** about some seven or 10 miles from Hermannsburg.

* I am fairly confident that if we had exercised our constitutional **rights** to take it over under just terms we could have done so.

* On the other hand the Aboriginal people have no **rights** whatsoever.

* It is useless to point to **rights** any more.

* The land **rights** legislation has been fought over for so long.

* I should think that all the royalties and all the money which have been paid to the 30,000 to 40,000 Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory would not amount to what  Mr Lang  Hancock, for instance, has made out of his **rights**.

* They are simply bodies of Aboriginal people charged with the responsibility of protecting their own people's **rights**.

* I hope that those honourable members who have not been here long enough to remember all the arguments that were put in this place about this matter will take time off to study some of the history of and battles about the land **rights** situation.

* I suppose that out of that action grew the first battle in the courts about land **rights**.

* to finance educational programs and advertising campaigns that would be effective in promoting an understanding by the public, or by sections of the public that have special needs in this respect, of their **rights**, powers, privileges and duties under laws in force in Australia; 
Paragraph (e) talks about statistics and paragraph (f) talks about liaison and co-operation not only with States and their commissions but also with other bodies which are interested in providing legal aid; that would pick up the Fitzroy community services.

* Paragraph (g) refers to research and paragraph (h) to the financing of educational programs to inform members of the public of the **rights**, powers and privileges of which they may avail themselves.

* It gives the opportunity to enter into arrangements with the States as well on the condition that their commissions are representative of the same individual **rights** and obligations that would apply under State law and State needs.

* We are dealing with people 's **rights** and obligations.

* As I said at the outset of my second reading speech, the very need of these people for justice in many cases is denied because of their inability to finance their legal **rights**.

* As most dependent spouses are widows rather than widowers, this is decidedly an improvement in the **rights** of women.

* We paved the way for a better deal for Aborigines, to give them the land **rights** which they have justly and rightly deserved for a long while and upon which question the previous Government see-sawed and wavered because it was afraid of offending big business in this country, of which it was the servant.

* However, what should be of grave concern to this Parliament and to anybody interested in Tasmania's **rights** are the reasons that have apparently caused the Upper House to request the Government of Tasmania to obtain further assurances from the Australian Government in relation to the Agreement.

* Is it because representation in the Government from Tasmania is not pressing sufficiently for Tasmania's **rights** in relation to this very significant acquisition of Tasmania's property?

* The **rights** and privileges of staff affected will be protected and there will be consultations with the Public Service Board and the staff associations concerned.

* Hayden) knows and understands that there are certain circumstances in which GovernorsGeneral not only have an independent authority and power but must so exercise it to preserve the **rights** and liberties of the people of Australia.

* The independent exercise of that power in 1975 was designed quite specifically to protect the Parliament, the authority of Parliament, and hence the authority of the people against an executive that was seeking to trample upon the **rights** of Parliament and the **rights** of the people throughout Australia.

* It was initiated by the then Prime Minister who forced the Governor-General to act in the only way that was proper within his constitutional powers and the only way that honour and the protection of the **rights** of the people of Australia could possibly permit.

* We were fighting for the **rights** of South Australia to Chowilla, and were fighting against this Bill inasmuch as it caused the abandonment of Chowilla.

* Another point is that while I was the Minister for the Capital Territory I perforce had to come to an agreement with the local authorities about legislation concerning the **rights** to sell liquor during 24-hours a day in Canberra, for which I found myself assailed on television some weeks ago.

* The issue originally was not alcohol but the fundamental question of freedom, of human **rights** and of equal **rights** for everybody in the community.

* Certain mining **rights** were applied for but the applications were later withdrawn.

* It forces women into a specific position of oppression in this society in that they are denied their **rights** to control their own bodies.

* It is the question of the need for plant breeders **rights**.

* Australia has been slow to take up the question of plant breeders **rights**, but the same cannot be said for other countries of the world.

* There are many reasons why plant breeders **rights** legislation is necessary, but I will quote only a few.

* If it is right for the inventor to be recognised in secondary industry, it is surely right to legislate for plant breeders' **rights**.

* But many of these new varieties are no longer available to Australia because of the lack of the necessary protective legislation, namely, legislation to protect the **rights** of plant breeders.

* The reason why we cannot obtain these overseas strains is that Australia has no reciprocal legislation to guarantee the **rights** of breeders.

* I ask the Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison)  to use his best endeavours to have plant breeders' **rights** legislation introduced as soon as possible.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a statement of  President  Carter that human **rights** constituted the soul of American foreign policy and that the United States of America would demonstrate its affinity with democratic nations through its allocation of assistance funds and will not hesitate to convey its outrage- nor will it pretend that its relations are unaffected- if human **rights** violations persist in Cambodia, Chile, Uganda, South Africa, Nicaragua, Ethiopia and the Soviet Union.

* I only regret, however, that there are still some who have not understood or openly supported a proper system of administrative review, of which this Bill forms part; for there can be no doubt that in a rapidly increasing Public Service the occasion for ignorance, delay, injustice, inefficiency and lack of humanity to trample upon the **rights** of our people must with certainty increase.

* In the meantime we have heard much about an abortive Bill for human **rights** but the establishment of basic **rights** for the citizen in his dealing with bureaucracy have been neglected.

* I am talking about the **rights** of people in a consumer society.

* This conservative national Government sturdily averts its face from the just claim of the Aboriginal to land **rights**.

* Only in South Australia indeed, and then only under a Labor Government, have land **rights** been granted to Aboriginals.

* In Canada and the United States of America the Amerindians enjoy land **rights** to their reserves.

* This is a most peculiar practice for our society based as it is on recognition of property **rights**.

* There was a White Paper issued by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in London dealing with this particular problem which we have of acquiring land for social good where there must be some subordination of individual **rights** but not a complete overriding of individual **rights**.

* In doing so a balance must constantly be struck between the overriding duty of the State to ensure that essential developments are undertaken for the benefit of the whole community and the no less compelling need to protect the interests of those whose personal **rights** or private property may be injured in the process.

* The present intention of the Government is not to protect the interests of those whose personal **rights** or private property may be injured in the process.

* This is merely a not unreasonable method in most ways to amend the Act which was the instrument of attaining the goals of the previous Government but there are the objections to which I have referred and which I think are of great interest to very many Australians who value their **rights** and who do not wish to be overridden by an all-powerful government - people who need the protection of courts and who need to be sure that this new Commission will not be concerned only with cities, important as they are, whether they are old or new, but be concerned also with the regional development which is an integral part of the Bill and of the program.

* States' **rights**, and then usurp the long established convention that the people's house governs.

* The Government must expect them to defend their **rights** in every way.

* It is that the High Court of Australia must become the highest court of the land in all matters pertaining to Australia and to the legal **rights** and obligations, in Australia, of Australian citizens.

* Whilst in the body of the report there is stress on the need for land **rights** and the central importance of land **rights** for Aborigines to regain their self-identity, which is essential to achieving a healthy life, a healthy community and a healthy individual, that was not listed among the principal recommendations of the Committee.

* I want to put on record, and I believe that this view is shared by the other members of the Committee, that we see land **rights** as being essential to the ability of Aborigines to return to their source of spiritual refreshment and social cohesion, that is, the land with which they identify in a very complex and important manner.

* This is important not for me but because I believe that the proper adherence to the forms of this House and the **rights** of members is something which we should all guard.

* The name Blackburn is imperishably linked in Australia with the cause of human **rights** and civil liberties and, in particular, opposition to conscription.

* In essence the Bill before the House seeks to cover not only transactions in shares but also transactions in assets, including mineral **rights**.

* We should not as representatives of major political parties- let alone as representatives of the largest political party in this country- squeeze out the **rights** of individuals to stand.

* We feel very keenly about the blow which has been aimed at the **rights** of Territorians, and in that I include the people of the Australian Capital Territory.

* When I was elected to this place in 1966 it was on a platform which included full voting **rights** for the people of the Northern Territory.

* It comes as a surprise to me that these men and their Governments for whatever reason, are aiming a blow at the **rights** of the citizens of both Territories.

* I remind the House that the Northern Territory has been represented in this place since 1922 and the representative of the Northern Territory has had full voting **rights** since 1968.

* We beat on the doors and sent a petition to Canberra supporting our demand for basic **rights**.

* We in the Northern Territory seem to have been fighting, certainly ever since I have been a member of this House and since Jock Nelson, the former member, was in this House, a continual battle to obtain the **rights** which we should have as Australian citizens and which I believe we did have in the years from 1907 to 191 1.

* But when the Territory passed to the Commonwealth, those **rights** seemed to be whisked away.

* As my colleague the honourable member for Canberra pointed out earlier, at this time we are really battling to have those **rights** brought back again.

* The people in the Northern Territory should have similar **rights** to those of all other Australians.

* It is asserted in this Convention that aU human beings are born free and equal in dignity and **rights** and that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and without any justification.

* The common law provides few effective remedies against discrimination in the exercise of human **rights**, whether it is based on race or colour or on any other grounds.

* The BUI Will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental **rights** and freedoms.

* In Canada, compulsory evidence gathering powers are given to the human **rights** commissions and similar powers are vested in the conciliator established by New Zealand legislation.

* The Bill represents an important step in the Government's program with respect to human **rights**.

* The educative role is at least as significant and the Bill recognises that there must also be effective and systematic enforcement of **rights** and the promotion of education and research, if the elimination of racial discrimination in this country is to be achieved in fact as well as in theory.

* But we did stress very strongly- indeed some of our amendments were accepted- that we clearly need to protect the **rights** of citizens if this power should ever need to be used.

* Only last weekend we saw Press articles purporting to suggest that members of Parliament had different **rights** in relation to taxation from other persons when, in fact, every person in the community who receives an overnight allowance does not have that questioned provided he does not claim more for expenses than the amount allowed.

* Members who are expected to vote for Government policies in the Parliament should be entitled to exercise their **rights** to challenge matters when they consider it necessary and to express opinions on decisions of a smaller group of their members, no matter what positions they may happen to hold.

* What these Press articles are saying is that the only **rights** that members of the public have in electing members to Parliament- this applies equally to Opposition members- is that they shall vote on election day, that those they elect shall come to Canberra and vote for a leader and having chosen that leader for the next 3 years they will have no right to exercise any authority over that leader or members of the Cabinet.

* 1 ask the right honourable gentleman: Does the Convention provide, inter alia, ownership **rights** for indigenous peoples over land that they traditionally occupy?

* ls the failure of the Government to ratify the Convention related to its refusal to grant land ownership **rights**, within the meaning of the Convention, to Aboriginals?

* Will the Government immediately set up a joint committee of inquiry of this House to investigate the most effective and equitable means of providing land **rights** for Aboriginals in Australia?

* It is very depressing to note the hypocritical manner in which this reactionary and authoritarian Government pays Up service to the civil liberties and **rights** of the Australian people.

* Had the Government given careful consideration to the civil liberties and democratic **rights** and freedoms of the Australian people in this matter it would have rejected outright the substance of the recommendations of the Hope report.

* In short, the real political repercussions of the Hilton blast, as distinct from the personal tragedy, have been the questions raised about civil liberties and individual **rights** through the gross over-reaction of the Prime Minister.

* is liable to lose certain **rights** if, for any length of time at all, he is stood down.

* That section is the form by which there can be an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, designed with the request and consent of the Australian Parliament to enact legislation, which can specifically change the provisions which are now the ultimate sanctuary of the **rights** of the individual in this country- the sanctuary provided by the Australian Constitution.

* In other words, having said that we believe the time has come when there should be an ultimate acceptance of the High Court by all the governments and parliaments of this country, we do not believe it appropriate for this Government to act, as it has acted in so many other areas, in complete disregard of the **rights** and privileges of the States.

* In explanation, he said that in recognition of the Government's policy in relation to human **rights**, and the view that the Passports Act should neither be an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on a person than a court would be prepared to impose, the Government decided to change the practice.

* On a simple cost benefit analysis, the nil costs associated with the Minister's power to withdraw or withhold a passport of a suspected corporate criminal as opposed to the expensive costs of extradition and the loss of investors' money associated with corporate criminals who flee, it would seem that as a result of the proposed new practice in this Bill the Government and the Australian people are paying and will continue to pay a substantial price in the cause of human **rights** and civil liberties.

* It is not a simple question of hiding behind the twin screens, if you like, one being used as an extension of the judicial system and the other the policy relating to human **rights**.

* Many of the GAF workforce are permanent public servants who have built up leave and superannuation **rights**.

* Yesterday during Question Time in this House we heard the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  call for human **rights** in the Soviet Union, a nation as far from Australia's influence as possible.

* But since his Government took office it has been noted for fine words and not for inspiring actions to promote the **rights** of the original trustees of his own country, its own Aborigines.

* He does not have the courage to stand up for the **rights** of the people he is supposed to serve, either by defying the Prime Minister as  Senator Bonner  did on one occasion or by defying the Cabinet, his Party Caucus, his mining mates or whoever it is who makes his promises a pose and who makes his credibility a high vacuum.

* There is nothing more hypocritical than this Government pontificating about human **rights**.

* The Land Council has to go through the procedures that are very clearly laid down in the land **rights** legislation to consult with the traditional owners and obtain their consent before any action is taken and also to consult with any Aboriginal communities which may be affected by the agreement and this is what is going to happen from now on.

* The allegations and transcripts that are now emerging from the members of the Northern Land Council are most serious allegations of denials of Aboriginal **rights**.

* The Australian Labor Party rejects this Government's disregard for the **rights** of Aboriginal Australians.

* The constitutional right of the Commonwealth to legislate for the Aboriginal people was established in 1967 in a referendum in which the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly in favour of Commonwealth **rights** in this field.

* On the question of Aboriginal land **rights** he has recognised the need for a more rational and sympathetic approach to this question.

* as an Aboriginal land **rights** commissioner to make a report on the best means of achieving the Government's aims in this area, and, in doing so, the Government is only falling into line with what has been done in a number of other countries which have had to face the injustices that have been done to their indigenous people.

* The Bill will succeed only if due acknowledgment is made of this fact and if the procedures adopted give adequate, legal and automatic **rights** of public participation.

* It was our policy, I believe correctly, that since the Northern Territory in particular is rapidly proceeding towards full independence- it has a new constitution and the same **rights** as other States of the Commonwealth- therefore it would not be proper for a committee of the Federal Parliament to involve itself in its activities.

* The **rights** of citizens and the **rights** of public servants, whose activities we have been expressly established to observe, must be taken into account.

* We should ensure when we are looking at security matters that we do so knowing that we believe in the declaration of human **rights**; that we want to protect the privacy of the individual and his right to conduct his own life in his own way, provided always that he works within the law.

* What we have sought is to achieve self-management for those communities and also, when the reserve lands which had been set aside for those communities were abolished, security of that land for their traditional **rights** and their **rights** of use and occupation which they had enjoyed for so long.

* What is offered is nothing more than an attempt to declare **rights** as seen by some members of this Parliament.

* I think the legislation in its present form protects those important **rights** of the individual to serve in a cause in which he believes but at the same time protects the public interest and as far as possible ensures the maintenance of good international relations between Australia and other countries.

* A halt must be called somewhere along the line because what is happening to him could easily be the first step in the erosion of the democratic **rights** of all Australians, which are the **rights** that thousands of Australians went away, fought for and were either killed or maimed in supporting.

* We do not want to cut off certain votes and, as is proposed in later Bills, place other restrictions on the **rights** of people simply because it helps the Labor Party which argues that under such a system the result could be known by midnight of the day of counting.

* In view of the legislation sponsored by the Government to give recognition to basic human **rights**, what is the justification for the Government to withhold passports from public servants and others seeking to travel to Southern Rhodesia and Taiwan.

* They deliberately use points of order as a means of stopping us from having our democratic **rights** as members of this Parliament and putting our case before the Parliament.

* That report should soon be completed and when it is, I will be releasing it because I have been appalled and stunned to discover the extent to which honourable members opposite, who now say that they are concerned about the **rights** to confidentiality of the individual and the secrecy of personal information held in Government departments, permitted information to be released to all sorts of outside agencies.

* This is not just a matter of what we did or what the Government did; it is a question of Australia's interests in relation to our credibility and our standing in the community of nations on the question of the preservation of human **rights** and on the question of self-determination.

* It is highly desirable that we maintain good relations with Indonesia, but I suggest that these relations should be based on a mutual respect for basic human **rights** and the right of selfdetermination for all nations.

* It is only through the activities of a small band of people who have been prepared to speak up for basic human **rights** and particularly through the actions of  Mr Jim  Dunn- shame on those who seek to frustrate his actions- coupled with the advent of the Carter Administration that we now have been able to get the United States of America interested in the Timor question and in looking at the allegations of atrocities and of the use of American military aid in Timor.

* What the people are saying is that the arbitrary, high-handed intervention in the **rights** of the individual is something which is anathema to Australians.

* This Government is pursuing a course of action which denies the **rights** not only of those the Government likes to call the big men but of thousands of Australians - the Australian who owns his own home, the Australian who is paying a bank, a hire purchase company or a land development company for his land or his home.

* I thing it is utterly disgraceful that there should be this intervention in the **rights** of the small landholder in Australia.

* For that reason I believe that the whole of this acquisition is arbitrary, is denying the **rights** of individuals and should be rejected.

* I am sure that you are concerned about the **rights** of landowners and about the **rights** of householders.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government an attitude on barter arrangements between China and an Australian exporting firm such as those that have existed with a number of British exporters for whom marketing **rights** in Great Britain were reserved exclusively by China following the use of the original British technology?

* At present, the various State Governments claim sovereign **rights** in respect of such resources from low water mark to the outer limits of the.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at Federation, it has sovereign **rights** in this area.

* In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth conceives to be its legal **rights**.

* At present, the State governments also claim sovereign **rights** in this same area.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at federation, the States hare no such **rights**.

* In February 1969 Cabinet made a very clear decision that the Commonwealth would legislate to assert total **rights** over the seabed outside the 3-mile limit.

* Of course, minorities do have **rights**.

* The matters which affect adult **rights** in Australia usually fall within the province of the State parliaments.

* But by the end of the next month men and women of 18, 19 and 20 years of age in South Australia will not only have adult **rights** in the general sense; they will also have the right to vote at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of that State.

* 1 had asked: 
On what matters and what dates (a) has each State Parliament enacted, and (b) has each State Government proclaimed or will it proclaim legislation giving adult **rights** to persons under 21 years of age.

* This Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years shall be of full age and capacity except for certain specified matters including conditions, **rights** and obligations of employment.

* Under the heading 'Western Australia' the Attorney-General informed me that some adult **rights** had been given to minors in the age group 18 to 21 years and that they had been given the right to vote for the State Parliament.

* Since then the Western Australian Labor Government has announced that it will give complete adult **rights** to 18- year-old men and women.

* It is quite likely, therefore, that by the end of next month, when those who have adult **rights** will also gain the right to vote in South Australia for the State Parliament, those who have the right to vote at 18 years of age in Western Australia for the State Parliament will also have adult **rights**.

* The provision was put there in connection with the voting **rights** of Aborigines, not of persons under 21, but it is clearly applicable to the age issues as well if section 41 of the Constitution is interpreted as 1 have suggested.

* Therefore I would urge the Government, gracefully and promptly, to give voting **rights** to those citizens, just as such citizens will have that right in this year's United States elections, as they have had in the British and will have in the Canadian elections, as they have had in Papua New Guinea, as they have had in Western Australia as they will have in every future South Australian election.

* The Australian Labor Party will back them in seeking their **rights**.

* One of the tragedies in the change of government and change of attitude is that the Northern Territory, which one would hope would continue to advance towards achieving equal represen tative **rights** in every sense with the original States under the Constitution, is now being pulled back.

* It seems that the administrative direction which emanates from the office of the Minister for the Northern Territory  (Mr Enderby)  in Canberra is far more significant in determing the opportunities and **rights** of individual citizens in the north than it was formerly.

* I do now believe that it is likely - considering that this is the site of the Federal Parliament - that there will ever be an occasion when the Australian Capital Territory should enjoy the same representative **rights** in the States House as do the States around this continent.

* The Prime Minister is no doubt aware that members of the Jewish community in Syria are being subjected to persecution, including deprivation of human **rights**.

* I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make suitable representations through appropriate diplomatic channels and the United Nations Organisation to alleviate the desperate plight of Jewish people in Syria and ensure for them the preservation of their human **rights**.

* This means that Australia will inevitably have to grant fishing **rights** to other nations, working under Australian control and conditions.

* I suggest that that places those countries in an advantageous position when negotiating with us over fishing **rights**.

* It means that thousands of Australian citizens are currently being denied their legal **rights**.

* That is, citizens whose legal **rights** and whose applications had been approved and had been dealt with were simply awaiting an allocation of funds.

* People on criminal charges because of a lack of means are not being represented at all and that, I believe, represents a fairly serious restriction in terms of civil **rights** and civil liberties being dealt with in accordance with the due process of law.

* I would have thought that the **rights** of people to legal aid under the Family Law Act are a major factor.

* I think that it is reasonable and proper that a Government which, over a considerable period, has consisently claimed that the **rights** of exservicemen should be paramount, has claimed also that it is not easy or not possible to maintain a volunteer army, and has based its case before the electorate on this type of platform should accept the amend men!

* The Opposition expressed this morning, in a motion to which the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  did not reply but which related to him, our feelings about the procedures that have been adopted in trying to crash through the **rights** of honourable members and to force Bills through at the rate of one every half-hour and sometimes through the Committee stage in 2 minutes.

* In so taking responsibility he has, as every honourable member will recognise, curtailed the **rights** of honourable members to study legislation and to speak.

* The purpose of the letter is to provide a degree of reassurance to the Republic of Korea of the manner in which Australia intends to exercise its prior consent **rights** and to handle administrative problems that might arise from multiple labelling, that is the attachment of different national nuclear safeguards conditions to material as it is transferred internationally for processing purposes on its way to the end user.

* That a select committee of this House be established to inquire into and report on extending and guaranteeing Aboriginal voting **rights** and obligations for the Federal, State and Territory Parliaments.

* On 19 October 1961 the House of Representatives ordered the printing of a report of its then select committee inquiring into the voting **rights** of Aborigines.

* The Committee then asked the superintendent at Cherbourg to circulate to the residents a document setting out their voting **rights**.

* Most New South Wales Aborigines were exercising their long-established voting **rights**.

* The Electoral Office was asked to have service and exservice personnel informed of their **rights**.

* They had to get a ticket exempting them from the jurisdiction of that Act in order to have many of the **rights** of citizens that the rest of us enjoy.

* That was probably with good reason, because after all, as I have already stated, no one had taken the trouble to explain to these people their **rights** and obligations.

* Yet this sort of shameful interference with the democratic **rights** of Aboriginal citizens to enrol and to vote goes on with impunity.

* Papua New Guinea has shown us how illiterate peoples can be made aware of voting **rights** and responsibilities and how voting procedures can be simplified.

* Looking at the background of ASIO, no member of Parliament can say that in the past it has not abused its prerogatives and has not- in many cases wrongly, on a number of occasions illegally- jeopardised the fundamental **rights** of many thousands of Australian citizens.

* There is no compelling reason for parliamentarians having to balance the **rights** of the ordinary Australian citizen and the **rights** of a security intelligence organisation or to make any presumption in favour of that organisation as against the **rights** of the 
Australian citizen.

* I believe that the first duty of any government instrumentality or any government police force is to preserve and enhance the **rights** of the Australian citizen.

* Legislation which by its very definition tends to reduce the **rights** and liberties of the Australian people is bad legislation.

* There must be responsibility universally accepted and shared in return for **rights** comprehensively available and enjoyed.

* Finally, there is the plain fact that **rights** universally enjoyed must be accompanied by obligations universally accepted.

* The principle of community responsibility embodied in this legislation and the fact that the **rights** of people are universally covered and that there is 24-hour cover for everyone in the community are aspects of the scheme which must receive the support of this House, and Parliament as a whole and also the support of the community which when they see the benefits that they will receive under this scheme will welcome it with open arms.

* If it is pressed, it can lead one only to suspect that it is part of the plan which can now be seen to be emerging in such Bills as the Grants Commission Bill and the earlier Electoral Bill to take **rights** and powers away from the States, often by indirect means, and to introduce measures designed to alter the electoral system and to secure maintenance of the present Government in office for an indefinite period.

* In keeping with the Government's commitment to civil **rights** and administrative justice, this Bill seeks to provide a proper legislative basis for passport policy and a clear legislative framework for the exercise of ministerial discretion, which must continue to be an essential element in the administration of this difficult area.

* In the not too distant past, it was argued that the need to carry a passport was an infringement of basic **rights**.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, so far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country or the **rights** and welfare of its citizens.

* I am aware that this policy has caused inconvenience and even distress on some occasions, but I have found it necessary to retain it as a practical means of protecting the financial **rights** of a spouse or former spouse.

* However, in recognition of the Government's policy relating to human **rights** and the view that the Passport Act should neither be used as an extension of the judicial system nor be expected to impose any more restraint on an individual than a court would be prepared to impose, this practice will be discontinued.

* In brief, these are, with certain exceptions, persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial **rights** has been obtained; persons in respect of whom the authorised officer has reason to believe that there is in force a warrant for arrest issued in Australia; persons whom the authorised officer has reason to believe are required to remain in Australia under a court order, or under a condition of parole or of recognisance, surety or bail bond; persons who owe money to the Commonwealth as a result of circumstances arising from previous overseas travel; persons whom the authorised officer believes already to be in possession or control of an Australian passport in force- unless there are special reasons- and persons in respect of whom the Minister has decided that issue of a passport would threaten security or welfare in another country.

* Sub-clause (c) provides for the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare.

* Under proposed section 1 14, the court may make such an order or grant such an injunction as it thinks proper, including an injunction for the personal protection of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage; for the protection of the marital relationship; in relation to the property of a party to the marriage, or in relation to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home; and to make an order relieving a party to a marriage from any obligation to perform marital services or render conjugal **rights**.

* That means nominee companies which hold shares on behalf of people, particularly foreign interests which do not want their proprietory **rights** disclosed.

* It deals with the **rights** to exercise the votes to control companies by shares.

* In addition to that there must be a national register of all foreign interests in Australia showing specifically whether the interest takes the form of shares or any other proprietary **rights** or any con tractual **rights**.

* Actual ownership, that is in terms of proved proprietary **rights** is 62 per cent and the degree of control is 83 per cent which is 21 per cent greater.

* These **rights** are only partially protected by current legislation.

* The Government proposes the permanent protection of these **rights** by an amendment of the Constitution so that they may never foe taken away by the enemies of democracy.

* It is in this document that we must provide permanent guarantees of the **rights** and privileges of the Australian people.

* Gold will no longer be the Fund 's numeraire or unit of account for expressing the values of currencies used in Fund transactions and of the Fund's special drawing **rights**.

* It is well understood, however, that this will be an evolutionary process; the second amendment explicitly requires that special drawing **rights** may only be allocated if there is a global need to supplement the existing stock of reserve assets, and in such a manner as will avoid exacerbating excess demand and world inflation.

* The increase in Australia 's quota involves enlargement of Australia's potential drawing **rights** from the Fund which are available for use at a time of balance of payments need.

* I commend this Bill to the House and draw the attention of honourable members to the desirability of early approval of the Bill in order to enable the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  to exercise the proposed increased voting **rights** for Australia at the next regular elections of executive directors of the Fund and the Bank in September.

* We do not want to see any weak-kneed approach to the position as to what are alleged to be Queensland's **rights** because we are concerned about what has happened already in Queensland in two areas- Aborigines and human **rights**.

* is of opinion that, as a matter of priority, legislation should be introduced to protect the **rights** of ex-nuptial children and, in particular, insofar as the Commonwealth Government is concerned, to remove the word 'illegitimate' from all existing Commonwealth legislation and to amend existing Commonwealth legislation to ensure that ex-nuptial children have the right to participate in the same benefits and entitlements that any other child in the community is able to receive.

* But quite clearly the reason there have been no such longitudinal studies in Australia is that no funds have been provided for the purpose and largely because the community, knowing its attitude, has felt that it would be a gross intrusion on the **rights** of the person to inquire into what has happened to the ex-nuptial child as it has grown older.

* But he is not eligible for portability **rights** until he has resided here for 20 years whereas a resident of Australia, if this Bill is passed, will be eligible to go overseas at any time and take his pension with him.

* To have such a cavalier attitude towards the **rights** of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the welfare of migrants or pensioners.

* It intends to use the pension **rights** of persons who intend to return to their homelands to win pension **rights** from the homeland of pensioners who have come to Australia.

* The intended role of the Senate was to protect the **rights** of the States, however, this has not occurred.

* It is vital that the Organisation should be independent from secret political control because this is the key to the **rights** of the individual.

* The first is the protection of the **rights** of the individual.

* I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that this independence so clearly laid down by this House will not be abridged by secret terms and conditions of appointment because the independence of the Director-General of ASIO isperhaps paradoxically- the key to our individual **rights** and liberty.

* the Executive Committee of the Australian Constitutional Convention be requested to give priority consideration to a means of providing citizens in Australian Territories with voting **rights** in referenda equal to those of their compatriots in the Australian States.

* 1 ) What land **rights** have been claimed in the Lake Nash region.

* What **rights** are now guaranteed by law and surveillance for Aboriginals on properties which include part or the whole of their traditional land.

* Will the legal and other costs of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress in enforcing the **rights** of Aboriginals at Lake Nash be met by the Government.

* There is no doubt that this legislation was a landmark and I am very pleased to be a part of the Government that brought legislation in this form into effect and gave land **rights** to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.

* The Bill is designed to provide for the adjustment of the southern boundary of the Ranger project and to provide for environmental information and inspection **rights** for the Aboriginal Northern Land Council.

* This Bill is important because it seeks to protect the interests of the Aboriginal people who live in the region and whose **rights** are affected by uranium mining.

* Reference was made by the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  to the specific provisions that I have mentioned briefly relating to the provision of environmental information and also the inspection **rights** that the Northern Land Council will enjoy as a result of this legislation.

* When we give **rights** to people to go in and to inspect other people's records and activities and when we give them the right, as is to be given under the Environment Protection (Northern Territory Supreme Court) Bill which is part of this cognate debate to be able to go to the court to protect those **rights**, there is no doubt in my mind that provision must be made to ensure that information that might be gained but which perhaps is not relevant will not be divulged willy-nilly.

* The principles of freedom and equality of opportunity are inalienable **rights** inherent in liberal beliefs.

* 1 ) (a) Voting **rights** at the state level are a matter for each individual State Government to determine and are outside the sphere of responsibility of the Australian Electoral Office.

* My Department in conjunction with the Australian Electoral Office is studying the question of all migrants being placed on an equal footing in relation to their voting **rights**.

* Here we have a Party that denigrates the Senate, that is always speaking against Senate committees and alleged Senate interference with the **rights** of Parliament, that is dedicated to the abolition of the Senate - 
If honourable members opposite think that we are going to fall for a confidence trick like that and that the Opposition will support this legislation without a vote and without a fight at this stage and then be able to throw that up because of some cheap, tawdry, insincere deal involving sending this to a committee for 3 weeks then they have bargained wrongly.

* What is the reason for suddenly having this obsession about senatorial **rights** and the **rights** of that chamber?

* I can understand that they are not in the least interested in legislation that cuts down the **rights** of others, **rights** which they from their positions of eminence no longer regard as necessary.

* This clause is yet another way ki which the **rights** of free assembly are being curtailed.

* Earlier tonight I heard the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  quoting evidence that in this country we have no **rights** of assembly.

* My Party and I will look closely and critically at the basis on which this tribunal will act in order to ensure that there will be a consideration of all factors affecting the **rights** and responsibilities of members of this Chamber.

* Therefore in the opinion of this House, legislation should be introduced protecting the **rights** and standing of the Aboriginal people in the tribal lands affected by the Agreement, and providing for the recognition of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Aurukun area as those Aboriginal people who have common spiritual affiliations to a site on the land and who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to forage as of right over that land; and providing for the recognition of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs as applied in relation to the people of Aboriginal race at Aurukun, and to sites and areas of land at Aurukun.

* Everybody in the world should have equal **rights** according to the Christian ethic that all men are born equal and entitled to equal opportunity.

* Is there any real need to tell us what the situation is in central Europe and eastern Europe concerning civil **rights** and human **rights**?

* But it would not be a bad idea if a person such as he were to stand up in this House and say something about the **rights** of human beings in Timor being trampled on.

* It is one of the great misfortunes of this planet at the moment that of its 1 50 countries or thereabouts there is only a handful of them in which human **rights** and civil **rights** prosper, but they are being trampled on every day all round the world and not the least by people such as the honourable member for Mackellar and the kind of political party of which he is a member.

* I for one have always stood up in this place on behalf of people and their **rights** as individuals against the intransigence of the law and the law makers against conscription and such like and on behalf of the trampled peoples of the world.

* I am like the honourable member for Mackellar, as are my colleagues on this side of the House, in that I despise the trampling of civil **rights** and human **rights**.

* His  Government likes to maintain a high profile posture on questions of political processes and human **rights**.

* Yet the Government does nothing about the undemocratic political processes in Australia or about human **rights**.

* For example, last Thursday the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  in his capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General, had the following to say about human **rights**: 
That is quite untrue, quite improper and not in accordance with the law.

* The question of Australia exhibiting all the political instability of a banana republic is equally as vital as that of human **rights**.

* It records the **rights** they enjoy and the obligations they undertake in common with Australian citizens and other migrants.

* As in other migration agreements the **rights** of Yugoslav settlers as residents and as workers are set out.

* To do less is to cheat and distort that expression and to deny the **rights** of present and future Australians.

* If the Government had, additionally, announced that there was still another $500m of International Monetary Fund unconditional drawing **rights** available to the Government- making a total of $ 1,000m- and if the Government had done that some time ago in the firmest terms it just may have been possible to stave off the problem which has arisen.

* As I said previously, it is belittling the professional status of teachers and it is disregarding the genuine **rights** of parents, citizens and all those in the community who not only pay the piper but also have a definite interest in the educational process.

* There are to be **rights** of appeal as far as promotions are concerned, but there is to be no right of appeal against this discretion which is to be 'given to this one man.

* There is cause for suspicion from a reading of clause 16 of the Bill that the Commissioner - the one-man authority - will have the right to intrude into such fields as the determining of teaching **rights** and class sizes.

* It affects the average Australian to the extent that he becomes indifferent to the **rights** of others- 
Just as the Minister for Defence was when he made the stupid statement, that those directly affected do not oppose it -  and thereby loses a precedent for respect of those **rights** he regards as his own.

* The cry has been to get legislation for land **rights**, to formalise land **rights** and to give effect to our commitment to provide land **rights** for the Aboriginal people.

* As well as that one must say that this legislation will be a blueprint for Aboriginal land **rights** throughout the whole of Australia.

* It is hot possible for this Parliament to legislate in respect of land **rights** in the States.

* What is important is that a blueprint for that development is established so that hopefully there can be some development towards land **rights** for Aboriginal people throughout Australia.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  says that legislation for land **rights** in the Northern Territory is the prerogative of the Legislative  Assembly in the Northern Territory.

* We are trying to establish in a permanent way the **rights** of the Northern Territory Aborigines to the land which they have been deprived of for so long.

* We are trying to establish their traditional ownership **rights**.

* We are trying to establish the **rights**, we are trying to establish the interests in a permanent way, of a section of that community.

* Of course some people will be upset, but I think that is just one of the consequences of trying to re-establish the **rights** of these people.

* Clear and unequivocal assurances were given by the Prime Minister and the Minister that the Aboriginal peoples at both Aurukun and Mornington Islands would be given **rights** to determine their own future and that those **rights** would be made secure by the land passing to them.

* It would not take him very long and he has travel **rights** as a member of parliament.

* The platform of the Australian Labor Party, on the basis of which this Government attained office, made clear that Labor's industrial policy places human **rights** and values first and provides for the development of full human dignity in the industrial sphere, lt emphasises the right of full employment; real economic justice; freedom and security; the right to work in just and favourable conditions; freedom from unemployment and freedom to choose employment.

* The fact of the matter is that he knows the man is entitled to a trial and yet he, an eminent Queen's Counsel, highly paid and highly skilled in the law, one who should be here to protect the **rights** of the citizens, stood in this Parliament at question time today and said that a man was guilty of treason but he, the senior man in the Department which administers the law, was not prepared to lay a charge against him in this country.

* Today it appears, the Australian Government can exercise the same prerogative, with equally limited **rights** of appeal, to stop or discourage left-wingers (or right wingers) treading the road to Moscow, Hanoi or Salisbury.

* You will not give justice to people and you will not protect their legal **rights**.

* There must be a balance between the **rights** of the consumer to obtain the best and cheapest goods and the maintenance of the technological base in Australia and the employment of Australians.

* Not privileges but **rights**.

* We in the Opposition accept that no person should be denied the opportunity of ascertaining his or her substantive legal **rights** simply because of lack of means.

* In a society which can afford it, the exercise of **rights** should be available to all.

* This is one reason why we believe in cooperative federalism and why we suggest that the existing system throughout the States should be supplemented so that the needy receive their just legal **rights**.

* I repeat that their **rights** ought not to be denied because of lack of means.

* I believe that the existence of an independent legal profession is vital for the adequate protection of the individual against the state- that point was made very well by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  and the proper protection of individual freedoms, **rights** and property.

* There is no head of power under the Constitution entitling the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws generally with respect to legal aid, but it may be supposed that it can legislate to provide legal aid as an incident to the enforcement of **rights** under legislation of the Commonwealth Parliament- for example, under the Bankruptcy Act or under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* He is given a limited discretion not to investigate complaints, on grounds related to, for instance, vexatiousness, lack of interest in a matter complained about, or other **rights** of appeal to a tribunal or court.

* This seems to me to infringe a little on a person's civil **rights**.

* Another point which I think infringes on a person's **rights** is the matter of the bank account which is referred to in this legislation.

* It is a gross interference in the **rights** of unions if they have to tell the Commission where they keep every cent.

* That is a gross interference with the **rights** of unions.

* It seems incredible,  Mr Speaker,  that to date representatives of welfare organisations such as the Young Men's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Australian Red Cross Society that served in all theatres of war with distinction, such as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore, have not been recognised and given the opportunity to participate and have the same **rights** as a returned person under the War Service Homes Act.

* Surely then these people who were under no obligation to go to war are entitled to the same **rights** and privileges as the returned serviceman or service woman.

* -What we are dealing with in this Bill is a question that has significant ramifications for the States, the **rights** of 
States and the whole financial relationship which exists between this Federal Government and the State system.

* We support strongly the system of State **rights** and there is no doubt about our position.

* For the information of honourable gentlemen, I present the texts of the following conventions and protocols in the field of human **rights** to which Australia has become a party or is about to become a party by accession or acceptance: 
Let the unions run their own affairs', you yelled.

* But in the context of our argument that could only mean that you want to prevent the rank and file from having the **rights** which the law now guarantees.

* I believe that the rank and file should have enforceable **rights** to effectively control their unions' policies and paid servants.

* I have never heard you object to the law giving your union monopoly **rights** to enrol plumbers and gasfitters.

* But if you don't accept the sections of the Act that provide protection for a union 's membership against the possible tyranny of their paid officials, and if you object to those laws which protect the ordinary plumber and gasfitter against rules that are 'oppressive, unreasonable or unjust', and which give him a legal right to force you to observe the union's rules, then why don't you try to persuade your members to allow your union's registered **rights** to be taken over by some other organisation and try working outside the Act?

* You did not like what I said about the **rights** of the rank and file and shouted something about democracy.

* When referring to special drawing **rights** the Treasurer mentioned that he sees in them the main reserve asset of the reformed monetary system.

* But I believe that special drawing **rights** can and should have a role far more extensive than that.

* I believe that statutory drawing **rights** are one such vehicle.

* Finally, I do see and accept much of the merits in the concern which is expressed about the difficulty of establishing the value of statutory drawing **rights** in terms of a basket of currencies.

* Yet 1 believe that concept of statutory drawing **rights** is imperative of resolution both in terms of statutory drawing **rights** becoming a main reserve asset of a reformed monetary system and also a possible alternative currency of international exchange.

* I believe that the Committee of Twenty is very important to Australia and that the action that has been taken in establishing statutory drawing **rights** to be worth while.

* I would hope that an extension of the role of statutory drawing **rights** might permit them to be not only the means by which there can be a restoration of international balance of payments equilibrium, nor only that there might be a new worth while reserve asset of a reformed monetary system, but that also there might be a new valid, available and stable international unit of currency which can be used in international trade arrangements.

* But some clauses of the proposed legislation, while they may be superficially attractive, will have the ultimate effect of denying voters their basic **rights** and heavily disadvantage minor parties and independent candidates.

* I believe it is quite disgraceful to suggest removing **rights** such as postal voting.

* We felt that it was very important not only that the **rights** of the citizen should be protected but also that the **rights** of a honourable member to be identified with a petition should be protected.

* In particular, great regard has been given to the questions of Aboriginal **rights**, the safety of mining and milling, the operation of reactors, reprocessing, enrichment, disposal of waste products and the spread of nuclear weapons.

* But I have no doubt that these figures will increase as this position **rights** itself.

* Even in those totalitarian countries the opportunity is taken to examine the **rights** of an individual as a useful member of society.

* They follow the concept of having a look at the **rights** of the individual, lt has never been done here and that is the great tragedy of our prison system.

* However, such action could well be a safety valve in our democratic system providing it is kept within certain limits and does not infringe the **rights** and safety of other citizens.

* They set out in detail an analysis made by that learned gentleman of the way in which a senator's **rights** and responsibilities are exercised, in part, through his election for a term of 6 years.

* Rather, it is an excuse in order to manipulate this Parliament and the people of Australia towards the destruction of a two-House system of government containing within the upper House a protection of the **rights** and privileges of individual Australians.

* What utter nonsense it is for honourable members opposite to talk of introducing a charter of **rights** or responsibilities when they, by the introduction of Bills of this character, are seeking to destroy those **rights** and the liberties of individuals.

* I know,  Mr Speaker,  that you will disapprove of the move that is contemplated because as the chief custodian of the Parliament's **rights** and its obligations under the Constitution of the Commonwealth you will see to it that the Constitution is not abrogated in any way.

* The administration of these provisions has not been fully effective because they do not provide an adequate legal framework, nor do they contain protection of the **rights** of staff against arbitrary action.

* These procedures and principles together with the appeal provisions to which I will refer shortly will offer the protection to the **rights** of individual officers which does not exist under the Public Service Act.

* It is therefore correct that the Austraiian Government has sought a regime which will ensure protection for the traditional fishing **rights** of the local inhabitants of the Torres Strait, and has obtained the provisional agreement of the Government of Papua New Guinea to the establishment of a Protected Zone for this purpose.

* A number of voluntary organisations and ethnic groups in Sydney and Melbourne have been approached to establish a welfare **rights** service on a pilot basis for a period of twelve months.

* The organisations concerned have been asked to submit proposals for welfare **rights** services appropriate to the needs of the people they serve.

* A further nine pilot welfare **rights** services will be introduced when the relevant organisations have completed the preliminary planning.

* Welfare **rights** officers will be employed by relevant organisations to assist particular groups of people to be better informed about social welfare and related services and to help those requiring help to exercise their **rights** to such services.

* Training will be determined according to the particular needs of each welfare **rights** worker.

* Prior to this year it was the practice of the ABC and commercial stations to play videotape recordings of Perth football matches on the evenings of the match days on payment to the local football authorities of a negotiated fee for the **rights**.

* This year however negotiations for these **rights** failed, although the ABC was able to arrange for direct telecasts of Perth football matches to be transmitted on the ABC's country stations throughout Western Australia.

* As indicated in the answer to Question 1, the ABC has never been able to negotiate with local football authorities **rights** for direct telecasts of football matches in Perth city areas.

* In less than 2 years one can point to the following: The Federal court system has been restructured; there has been a fundamental revision of Federal administrative law; legal aid has been restructured in such a way as to increase cooperation with the States and to make sure that effective aid is available to those most in need; the first Ombudsman has been appointed and has commenced work; the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been given a wider jurisdiction and has commenced operation; legislation has been introduced to reform the law on criminal investigation and to establish a human **rights** commission; numerous references have been made to the Australian Law Reform Commission; and work is nearing completion on important new legislation on freedom of information and the use of government archives.

* The **rights** of the House belong to each member and should not be transgressed by a government or by anybody getting the numbers and saying: 'I am going to make certain that what you said in the House is going to be the subject of crossexamination in a court'.

* If a member transgresses the **rights** of individuals, we, as a parliament, can deal with that member and can expel him.

* But to inhibit us on the basis that perhaps we are not allowed to say something, because if we do we can be the subject of legal action which will be the subject of cross-examination, I think, is an inhibition of our **rights**.

* I do not want to alter it now, but I want to say that if and when it goes to the Privileges Committee, members of the Committee ought to look at the **rights** of each and every one of us in this chamber on the basis that those **rights** are in no way interfered with unless the House unanimously agrees that such action can take place.

* In preserving these we also preserve our national heritage, our way of life and the **rights** of every person in this land to enjoy the beauty of the scenery, the landscape and the natural habitat.

* It is a complementary vehicle for giving effect to a land **rights** policy.

* The land **rights** legislation which this Government has passed, following the essential principles of the Woodward report, operates in traditional areas in the Northern Territory.

* It seeks to strike down the very abuses of human **rights**, of which the honourable gentleman spoke- the discriminatory actions and legislation of the Queensland Governmentbut it does it in such a way that it creates a right in the hands of any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander in Queensland to protect himself against discrimination by reason of the provisions of this legislation.

* The **rights** of human beings are the fundamental things for which a society is created.

* Has it come in recognition of the basic **rights** of people?

* It is not worried about the basic **rights** and freedoms in a society; and you cannot have basic **rights** and freedoms in our sort of society unless you have at least the minimum economic adequacy to support yourself.

* They will have to live here for 20 years before they can take their pension **rights** overseas, and then there will be qualifications about the equivalent or reciprocal arangements wilh other countries.

* Surely some fundamental decisions will have to be made about making a person's basic **rights** and entitlements consistent with his self-respect and economic self-sufficiency.

* But life in any society requires a constant balancing of **rights** and interests.

* This will be a difficult job and there are bound to be considerable disputes and difficulties about entitlements and **rights** but I do not think the Authority should have a permanent existence.

* In accepting and acting upon the Textiles Authority's findings and recommendations, the Australian Government has had regard to its **rights** and obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles (The Textiles Arrangement) and the Australia-China Trade Agreement.

* The land **rights** question on the whole brings to us the authentic voice of Aborigines because the people with a claim to land in reality tend to be authentically Aboriginal.

* The tragedy of valid action on the question of land **rights** is that the States of Western Australia and Queensland are not taking the fundamental action that they should be taking and action on this question is virtually confined to the Commonwealth.

* We also say that we consider Arnhem land belongs to Yolngu people and we must retain **rights** to restrict entry and this should be written into this Bill, If it is not and the permit system comes under the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Legislation then the Administrator of the Permit system must ask the Yolngu (traditional owners) before he says yes.

* In all cases I have found the land owners anxious to preserve their property **rights** and in Western Australia, at least, the law effectively enabled them to do it when the land was in  bona fide  and regular use as a farm or grazing property.

* I think that was an extremely sensible statement by  Senator Chaney  pointing out that it is not unknown in Australia for land owners to have **rights** as against mining companies and therefore there was nothing outrageous in the proposal that they should have some authority over the land which will be declared to be theirs when they are confronted by a mining interest.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory must know that a Bill such as this, if it is supported widely in the Northern Territory, represents an immense movement of opinion in the Northern Territory compared with what existed in August 1 952 when I made a land **rights** speech in this House- so far as I know it was the first one- and the whole speech was regarded as rather ridiculous.

* He seeks to deny this Parliament the right to ask the Australian people to determine whether individual citizens' **rights** should be guaranteed in respect of the election of members of all parliaments throughout Australia.

* Electoral boundaries should be drawn to suit the convenience and to guarantee the **rights** of citizens, not to allow the manipulation of political power that we have seen in this country in the past.

* However, it does not necessarily follow that it is also in the national interest to favour inventive, technology-exporting countries by extending monopoly **rights** to them.

* The office must inform the applicant of his **rights**.

* At present, the State governments also claim sovereign **rights** in this same area.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except in respect of internal waters as they existed at federation, the States have no such **rights**.

* Are we to be able to act as a nation, or as 6 States which have another government negotiating for them but necessarily bound by the **rights** those other 6 governments claim?

* Now we read that the Tasmanian Government has given what are reported to be exclusive fishing **rights**' in waters where Commonwealth fishing laws apply.

* The key parts of the Bill which were rejected represent a severe setback in the attempt by this Parliament to establish protection of people's **rights**.

* The point has been properly taken by some of the major national inquiries into health insurance funds in this country that consumers do not have representation on open funds, and accordingly there is a bounden duty incumbent upon a government to ensure the protection of the community's **rights** in the operation of those funds.

* It is blind opposition of the members of the Liberal and Country Parties in this House and in the Senate, their total commitment to the private health insurance funds and their indifference to the **rights** of contributors which has caused them to obstruct the passage of those amendments which would have been so crucial to the effective administration of private health insurance.

* We now have the 12- mile limit for fishing **rights**.

* In the field of determination of fishing **rights** there are tremendous problems.

* It is necessary for the Commonwealth to assume financial responsibilities if there is to be an exercise of its sovereign **rights** beyond the 3-mile limit.

* I acknowledge that the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  asserts the necessity for one government to have sovereign **rights** over the area between the low water mark and whatever might be the ultimate limit of Australia's territorial sea, but I do not believe that that is the way in which we will be able to overcome the day to day problems of administration.

* That is the legislation we are debating now- will give organisations with existing **rights** 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels.

* -The point is that the Minister said last Tuesday night that all those programs had been approved by our Government- that is by the Labor Governmenton 27 September last year and that the amendment will now give these **rights** for only 12 months after the date of approval.

* In a general way, I believe that where major sporting telecasts are won by commercial organisations which cover only part of the country, it is important for the ABC to be able to secure **rights** to cover those parts of the country which are not covered by commercial organisations.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views: 
Surely that is the issue and the defence of the Prime Minister that was put up by the honourable member for Evans was not, I feel, a defence but in fact an indictment because he placed the whole of the responsibility on the Prime Minister.

* He knows, as I think we all know, that this matter is part of a pattern of casual disdain for State **rights** which has been growing.

* I want every American free to stand up for his **rights**, even if sometimes he has to sit down for them.

* It is a question of justice and the **rights** of all Australians, lt is not a question of power; it is a question of equality among Australians wherever they happen to live.

* The people themselves rightly believe that arguments about centralism and States **rights** are irrelevant to their needs.

* That they in fact welcome this change, having regard for the fact that it demonstrates an increasing tolerance of and respect for the **rights** of individuals to think their own way through their own lives, free from information-withholding restrictions which people of one religion or one standard of morals may seek to impose on either the majority or minority who do not hold the same views; 
If Australia is to have collective bargaining, let the legislation plainly and unmistakably spell it out, together with the **rights**, obligations and privileges of the participants and the protection for the public from the monopoly power of unions and of employers.

* Tasmania, until recently under a Liberal Government, is ready to grant 18 year olds full civil and voting **rights**.

* Is he able to say which overseas countries and which Australian States provide voting **rights** for 18 year olds in the election of Governments.

* That Bill followed discussions which took place between the Commonwealth and the State Attorneys General with a view to ensuring that there would be a system of human **rights** that would, in effect, cover all law within this country.

* Indeed, the Labor States of New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, do not want to go with the Commonwealth into a human **rights** commission which would be broadly based.

* There are currently in train arrangements for discussions to take place one hopes in the reasonably near future that will lead to a more broadly based approach to human **rights** in this country.

* I think there is one aspect at which we should be looking, and that is whether there could be evolved a declaration of human **rights** that could be adopted by this Parliament and also by every other parliament in the country.

* Honourable members will know that in Canada there is a declaration of human **rights**.

* It would be a good thing in this country if we were able to use the covenant on civil and political **rights** to formulate legislation which formed the basis of a declaration of human **rights** in this country.

* The other purpose for which such a document could be used is as a guide to human **rights** committees or commissions which would hear applications from members of the public who claimed that in some way their human **rights** were being infringed.

* If the decision was one that was capable of being enforced by some order which could be registered, say, in the Federal court or some State court, a human **rights** system could be evolved in this country which would be broadly based and effective.

* I have in mind that there could be a human **rights** committee, for instance, established under State legislation in New South Wales- just to take an examplewhich could have jurisdiction conferred on it by a Federal Act.

* That committee could administer a State Act and a Federal Act relating to human **rights**.

* By that method there could, as I say, be a broadly based situation where human **rights** could be enforced across the board.

* One sees no evidence of planning to combat them in the interest of people's social and economic **rights**; one sees only a sort of smug calmness on the part of the Government - no doubt the product of total ignorance.

* The Labor Party's policy is that, having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of nuclear power in particular, until Australian sovereignty, the needs of our environment, the economic welfare of our people and the **rights** and wellbeing of the Aboriginal people are understood we will not assist in any way the Government's actions to carry out uranium mining in the Northern Territory.

* Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people, and the **rights** and well-being of the Aboriginal people.

* The platform of the Australian Labor Party that all parts and all the people tal Territory and the Northern Territory to be represented by senators with full voting **rights**.

* If Australia ratifies the agreement it will have a quota in the fund which will be the basis for any drawings for or contributions to the fund of special drawing **rights** of $300m.

* On that occasion I said: 
The establishment of the Woodward Royal Commission and the consequent introduction in 1975 of the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill was a direct result of the 1972 commitment by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  that a Labor Government would legislate to give Aboriginals land **rights**, 'not just because their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are demeaned while the 
Aboriginal people are denied their rightful place in this nation'.

* That pledge came after 23 years of neglect of the Aboriginal people by the Liberal-Country Party coalition and in particular their outspoken claims for land **rights**.

* It is hoped that the Government will see fit to accept these amendments in the spirit in which they will be movedthat of representing to the people and, in particular, the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory a bipartisan policy on land **rights**.

* However, let me take as my starting point the claim made in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in the case of Millirrpum v. Nabalco and the Commonwealth in 1968, which is known as the Gove land **rights** case.

* In the interim report of the commission established to investigate how land **rights** could be granted statutorily,  Mr Justice  Woodward, who was a counsel in the Gove land **rights** case, pointed out that the Aboriginal concepts related to land owning have no parallel in European law.

* I seek leave to have incorporated in  Hansard  an extract from the first report of  Mr Justice  Woodward on Aboriginal land **rights**, entitled  Aborigines and Their Land.

* We might ask: What is this land **rights** Bill?

* It is about traditional Aborigines and about maintaining their **rights** over traditional land.

* I would Uke to have seen the Aborigines in the reserves having full mining **rights**, but I would not Uke to have seen them with the ability to barter those **rights** away in such a fashion as to bring in intensive industries and destroy their communities.

* The Bill deals with traditional land and the **rights** of traditional Aboriginals are worth protecting.

* An Aboriginal is perhaps in some ways less ready to trust another Aboriginal - 
That is the concept of the majority at 21:   is one of properly **rights** in and power over children, as much as of a duty to protect them.

* We are in the course of redefining the **rights** and obligations attaching to the most personal and fundamental relationship that can exist between 2 people.

* This is a serious intrusion on people's fundamental **rights**.

* Even though these people may be few, the **rights** of the few are as important as the **rights** of the many.

* Obviously the conservativism of his Party room, the dead weight of the Country Party plus the State **rights** principle broke his heart.

* We have to surrender the State **rights** principle.

* I know just from a simple knowledge of the facts that the civil **rights** of the people are not exactly non-existent but pretty close to it.

* Some honourable members opposite hold tender attitudes towards State **rights**, but a responsibility lies with us.

* If they had been able to continue in their occupation without prejudice to their entit lements as pensioners or their **rights** in any other way, or without being sacked simply because they had reached the age of retirement, they would have led a fruitful life for much longer and would have continued to contribute to society.

* The people would then know with certainty what their legal **rights** are.

* If either Peko or EZ defaults, then the other of them shall have a pre-emptive right to take over the **rights** and obligations of the defaulter.

* Further, the Federal Government is failing in its obligation to encourage Aborigines to enrol and exercise their democratic **rights**.

* Are the methods adopted to protect those who invent, and apply for patent **rights** over that invention, considered to be satisfactory.

* Whose responsibility is it to search patents, both in Australia and overseas, with a view to establishing sole **rights** to that patent.

* If so, can he propose a better method to protect those people who apply for patent **rights**, and pay many hundreds of dollars to seek sole patent **rights**, only then to discover that the process is inefficient enough to fail to establish sole **rights** in a particular field.

* This clause provides for undue intrusion on the **rights** of the individual citizen, again with minimal protection.

* I believe 7 days to be totally insufficient and that inadequate protection is provided under clauses 17 and 18 of the reasonable proprietary **rights** of a person who owns his own house and block of land.

* Under the guise of nationalism this Bill will restrict the **rights** of individual investors and restrict the **rights** of individual landowners, providing undue intrusion into the opportunities of each of the citizens of our towns and cities around Australia.

* The first thing I noticed was the rather curious way in which countries with totalitarian regimes and with poor domestic records of respect for basic individual **rights** and freedoms always seemed to be most concerned about the preservation of human **rights** in other countries.

* Basically, I stated that resolutions from international organisations regarding Israeli practices should be approached as Middle East rather than human **rights** issues.

* My other approach to this subject was to criticise those who, at conferences such as this one, use double standards in treating this issue solely as a human **rights** issue.

* I made the point that countries like the Soviet Union should put thenown house in order before voting against Israel on human **rights** issues.

* They can have no credibility while they and other such regimes continue to violate basic human **rights** in their own countries.

* None of these countries can boast of supporting democratic freedoms or even the most basic human **rights**.

* It was the PLO of course, the champions of human **rights** at the IPU conference.

* The PLO delegates also were supporters of human **rights** at this conference.

* Every communist country, almost every Third World country, all Arab countries voted unanimously against Israel ostensibly on human **rights** grounds.

* I just hope that this kind of behaviour which contradicts and prevents the free flow of ideas, policies and philosophies at such conferences is not universal because I fear that if it is, these international meeting places may do more harm than good for the cause of human **rights**.

* The Minister acknowledged that he was conscious of the need to find the right balance between excessive government involvement in business matters and the protection of the **rights** of the consumers.

* We are interested in the **rights** of children as well as the **rights** of women and the value and worth of the family unit, rather than the concept of sex without responsibility.

* I do not at all deny the **rights** and the problems of the mother but 1  refuse  to ignore the **rights** of the child.

* In clearly making that provision it recognises the sanctity of life and the **rights** of the child.

* Indeed, the **rights** proposed by this legislation should go further to include not only public servants but also others who are temporarily posted overseas in similar circumstances.

* Problems will arise because of the number of people involved and the **rights** of those people.

* There are the questions of traditional fishing **rights**, seabed resources and territorial seas around islands.

* The islanders could have obtained independent advice as to their present and future **rights** and their entitlements in respect of future development of any resources.

* It is understood that the normal traditional fishing **rights** will be preserved.

* It is clear, arising from that, that there has to be a continuing process because it has got to deal not only with the Islanders' **rights** as they now are and the maintenance of those **rights** as they must be maintained; there also has to be the future situation as to what problems may arise and how they are best dealt with.

* We are not attracted-  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I hope you do not take personal umbrage at this- to the fact that the Queensland Government in our view is not noted for its ability to protect the **rights** of people.

* It makes the point at times that it proposes to intrude into the issues of what are people 's **rights**.

* I think it is very important when dealing with this on a national basis with another government, as we are, that if there is to be a question of future **rights**, that that be the subject of negotiations and discussionsconsultation certainly between both governments- but with the advice and consent of the people concerned.

* It is not good enough to have national **rights** protected by treaties, or the subject of negotiation by treaties, to be the subject of what we would say are some of the appalling decisions that have been made by Queensland Government officials in the past and at present.

* Having said those things and having adverted to the fact that we applaud the progress that has been made between our two governments, we hope that the future for the Torres Strait Islanders is a bright one in the sense that their future will be one of progress and that they will have the **rights** of determination which must be recognised and have not to the present been recognised.

* It was pointed out in the second reading speech that when alterations are made to most Acts of Parliament existing **rights** are maintained.

* Unfortunately there are certain circumstances, though not in the majority of cases, where immediate divorce is desirable and almost necessary to safeguard the **rights** or even the lives of people concerned, if you like to take it to that extreme.

* Surely it is reasonable that people who are entering the institution of marriage must have some respect for the **rights** of the other party.

* But its intent is to protect the **rights** of the party who is not agreeable to a divorce and who may quite reasonably believe that the passage of time could bring about a reconciliation of the parties.

* It is better to take a long time than to make the wrong decision and ignore the **rights** of individual citizens, which is what the proposal to establish an airport at Galston does, because let there be no question that if this proposal is proceeded with, not only will a great area of bushland near Sydney be destroyed, but goodness knows how many hills will have to be bulldozed down and how many valleys filled up.

* I believe there is an accent in our law towards the protection of proprietary **rights** as against the protection of personal **rights** that has historically been to the detriment of our legal process.

* But many people historically have reflected upon and criticised our law for too great attention being given to the protection of property **rights** as against personal **rights**.

* Once again we are restricting the right of appeal in cases of personal **rights** as against those of property **rights**.

* Why go this further extent and only restrict it to death or personal injury in cases where the individual's personal **rights** have been affected?

* I believe again that we are perpetuating an accent in the law upon property **rights**.

* But as I have said a number of times, the Bill fails to take the opportunity to ennunciate to the nation at large that this Government and the law are based upon concern for both property and personal **rights**, not property **rights** to a greater extent than personal **rights**.

* Again, there is the tendency- albeit in accordance with legal principle- in some cases to treat matters relating to the criminal law as being in a slightly different category from those relating to proprietary **rights**.

* Under our democratic system the people have a number of basic and inalienable **rights**.

* One of the most significant of those **rights** is that of the concept and application of Australian citizenship.

* For those people it is of special significance to become an Australian and to be vested with the **rights** and privileges which that concept entails.

* The proposed amendment to section 19a and proposed new section 19b purports to do this and to that extent are clearly unobjectionable from the point of view of State governments since positive initiative is required by State governments before their **rights** can be affected.

* State **rights** are further protected by provisions inserted by the previous Government in section 19a, which required the consent in writing of the Premier of a State to the establishment and operation of intrastate airline services and also permitted the Premier to revoke this consent.

* That was irrelevant -  that sovereign **rights** in respect of the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the Continental Shelf contiguous to the coast of the States are wholly within State authority.

* In what other place but Australia and under a government such as this could we have a situation as is defined in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act where a sovereign national Parliament agrees not to exert its sovereign national **rights**?

* How is this Government to speak in national terms if it is not prepared to assert its undoubted **rights**?

* We will see that we arc respected among the other trading nations for our ability to demand our **rights** and get them.

* A total of 140,000 miles of the north west shelf, under the terms of prospecting **rights** granted by the State of Western Australia, has been given to one firm - Woodside Burmah.

* The Arab nations and the Moslem world, where most of the current world oil production happens to be, have got together and decided to assert their **rights** and their status.

* That will show the earnestness of the Commonwealth in its approach to the attainment of human **rights** for all people in Australia, particularly with regard to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders.

* That Act seeks to entrench certain basic human **rights**, in favour of Aboriginal and Islanders in Queensland.

* That legislation is available to every individual who wants to use it to support his personal **rights** or defend himself against any administrative or legal action brought against them contrary thereto.

* It shows the force of this particular law, which can be used to support the personal **rights** of individuals.

* 6 of 1978 for the creation of a local authority area at Aurukun and Mornington Island and to authorise the granting of long term leases to secure the traditional **rights** of the Aboriginal residents.

* As from the time of that inauguration, the administrators will cease their functions and the councils will be fully self-governing authorities in their own **rights**.

* The residents of Aurukun and Mornington Island have security of tenure for their land and have been granted their traditional **rights** in a way which no other Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community in Queensland has achieved.

* What has happened,  Mr Speaker,  is that the Commonwealth selfmanagement legislation has been a catalyst for the advance of human **rights** for the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland.

* The Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978 might very well be regarded as the flag flying at the masthead of human **rights** in Queensland.

* As I have said, those two communities, as a result of Commonwealth action, now enjoy **rights** which other Aboriginals and Islanders in Queensland do not enjoy.

* He did it in respect of the referendum to give **rights** to Aboriginals.

* The Labor Party adopted this united front on the question of the **rights** of Aboriginals.

* To them State **rights** are more important than the advancement of Aboriginal people.

* He finds, with the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Nixon),  that the most important thing, in his opinion, about any subject is probably the protection of property **rights**.

* We have had select committees on voting **rights** and a select committee on the grievances of the people of Yirrkala.

* Some of this flows from the fact that people have to prove their **rights**.

* Aboriginals should not need to prove their **rights**.

* I do not believe there will be any real solution to the economic or social status of the Aboriginal people of Australia until we accept the salient fact that somewhere in Australia we have to establish an unalienable land **rights** system.

* I believe it would have been easy to give the Gurindji people some **rights** to the land they presently Inhabit.

* My experience of 15 years of the Commonwealth Government and watching it at close quarters - disapproving of most of its politics but respecting the administrative capacity and competence of the country - is that it is only when we turn all these skills to this problem and put aside enough financial resources that we will bring forward the material advancement of the Aboriginal people of Australia in the way in which we have been able to advance most, but not all, of their legal **rights** over the last 10 or 12 years.

* With the growth over the years of the power of public and private bureaucracies, particular care needs to be taken to protect individual liberties and human **rights** against unwarranted intrusions.

* We have heard in this place and in public debate about the impinging of government bureaucracy on the **rights** of individuals.

* My Government is acting also to protect and expand political **rights** and strengthen the responsibility and responsiveness of governments to their citizens .

* This Government is conscious of the encroaching bureaucracy and of the power that the bureaucracy has to impinge on personal **rights** and freedom.

* At the moment moves are being made, I believe most insidiously, by some of those large corporations to restrict the **rights** of individual businessmen- in fact I believe eventually to force them out of business- so that the oil industry and the retailing industry of petroleum products will become totally monopolised by a very few large companies.

* The Queen mentioned in her opening address that the Government has certain legislation in hand to correct the monopolising power of big unions and the way they are able to extend and impinge upon the **rights** and freedoms of their members.

* I think the provisions that the Government is planning to introduce in this session of Parliament will do no more in their totality than allow the individual in society to have **rights** and freedoms that I believe every Australian citizen has the right to expect.

* 107 - Indigenous and Tribal Populations, 1957 is dependent upon clarification as to precisely what action would be required in the Australian context to give effect to the provisions of the Convention concerning recognition of **rights** of ownership of land which indigenous populations traditionally occupy.

* That is where this legislation really is a farce as an influence on inflation because obviously if it takes that length of time to help consumers and business people to determine what are their **rights**, it will take all that time before it will have any effect on prices, insofar as that is an objective, and have an effect on inflation.

* In his reply to the Question, the Foreign Minister, said: Now that we have the two UN Conventions on Human Rights, which were presented for signature in 1965, it is to be hoped that the time will soon be past when infringements of human **rights** can be regarded as a purely national concern'.

* The ownership of inventions, trade marks and designs creates important monopoly **rights** recognised to a greater or lesser degree in most countries.

* Laws in Australia in the past have tended to concentrate on the narrow legal issues of the regulation and grant of those monopoly **rights**.

* -Having just listened to about half an hour of verbosity from the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who sits opposite, I state that I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed **rights** at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts.

* The honourable member suggested that this Bill is a preposterous imposition on the **rights** of individuals.

* This comes about because traditionally the married pensioner has had his pension **rights** adjusted in relation to half the income of the married couple.

* When the Mataungan and Tolai people in Rabaul stand up for their **rights** we can mobilise great forces of police.

* contains objectionable intrusions upon individual **rights** and privacy, and 
fails to provide adequate **rights** of appeal, legal aid and representation'.

* When I am dealing with municipal law I am not dealing with local government law; I am dealing with the community, the municipal law of this country, and it stands in prospect of affecting the **rights**, the attitudes, of people under the municipal law and as a consequence of that the international convention must be ratified.

* When a nation is at war one can understand the sense of urgency, the need to not be troubled by fustian considerations or the niceties of considerations, individual **rights** and of liberty.

* The thrust of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act is now being felt and it is now becoming apparent that it cuts across the understanding of the traditional Aborigines about their land **rights**.

* We acknowledge the **rights** of honourable members to debate them.

* -The ownership of inventions, trade marks and designs creates important monopoly **rights** which are recognised by and large throughout the whole of the industrialised world.

* These two measures which we are discussing this afternoon are a further step to impress upon the community the benefits which can be obtained from exercising property **rights**.

* The reduction of the publication date by 12 months means generally that patent **rights** which are not effective until publication become available to the inventor at that earlier point.

* The services affected, of course, are extensive and I can give some examples of the sorts of services which could and may well use the new trade mark **rights** in respect of services.

* Generally under these amendments the marks which are registered as service marks will gain protection throughout Australia and Norfolk Island, although I understand that there are some cases where the **rights** of protection and of obtaining relief will be limited to some geographical areas.

* They speak of women's **rights**.

* They speak of the **rights** of women to control their bodies.

* The Lusher motion is not about the **rights** or wrongs of abortion, it is about whether the Commonwealth Government should use taxpayers' money to pay for these abortions.

* Has any action been taken by the Government to ensure that authorities do not abuse the basic civil **rights** of people concerned in these inquiries?

* If any action has been taken to protect their civil **rights**, can he indicate to the House what it is?

* But the sub-clause is deemed to be appropriate so that the **rights** of individuals and parties to claim a privilege, such as a solicitor and client privilege, will still apply notwithstanding the earlier provisions in the clause.

* Let us look at some aspects of the legislation as it affects States' **rights**.

* We have not heard a word from the Premier of Queensland about this legislation, which guarantees that no State's **rights** will be permitted to interfere.

* There would be no question of State **rights**.

* When the Commonwealth enters the field and covers it, no States' **rights** are left in that field.

* Normal democratic **rights** such as freedom from arbitrary arrest, unwarranted search and seizure, and the presumption of innocence are thrown out the window.

* We are aligned with other people's needs, other people's **rights** and other people's duties.

* Many of us in the Labor Party regarded it as a fundamental abdication of our **rights** and our duties.

* There has been no discussion about the **rights** of authors to royalties on books.

* Gavin Souter, in an article quite recently, pointed out that it would cost a mere bagatelle in terms of national expenditure if authors were to be given royalty **rights** on books that came off the shelves of lending libraries.

* For some years now, the Maltese people - the Minister knows about this; 1 have been to him on a deputation- have asked for reciprocal **rights**.

* They have asked for reciprocal **rights** in respect of social services which other British citizens, such as those in the United Kingdom, receive.

* I think it is appropriate to divorce the statements that were made by the 3 left wing unions from the problem of the land **rights** of Australian Aboriginals.

* I feel it is appropriate to point out that in that instance the Government was anxious to ensure that the Aboriginals had every conceivable opportunity to present their case in order to protect whatever legal **rights** they had.

* The next point I want to make is that if the Aboriginals want to pursue their **rights** in the High Court they have every right to do so.

* So, as the honourable gentleman has noted, at the meeting in Cairns recently, which the Minister for Social Services attended on my behalf, the case was put to the State Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs that the Commonwealth would take the initiative, no matter what the decision might be in this case, to protect the recreational and ceremonial land **rights** of the Australian Aboriginals and that this Government would do all it could to ensure that the Aboriginals had adequate opportunities for business enterprises.

* For a country which once led the world in granting **rights** to women about the time this Parliament was established we have often since lagged behind the rest of the world.

* This House can make a significant contribution to **rights** for women by, among other things, passing legislation to provide much better adult education facilities, to establish equal pay for work of equal value, to provide for family planning clinics, to build child care centres and to reform those laws which discriminate against women both socially and financially.

* He has said that it is a question of asserting the **rights** of this House over the Senate.

* It is not only in these matters that the Prime Minister has trampled upon the **rights** of people.

* Civil **rights** are going down the drain.

* The strange thing is that this sensitivity to State **rights** does not appear to hinder us in our contributions to the rural community, very many of which are provided in areas of exclusive State powers.

* Why do not we plead State **rights** when we pass $25m through the States for marginal dairy farms or when we pass $ 12.8m through the States for irrigation works in Queensland?

* Therefore, in the opinion of this House, legislation should be introduced protecting the **rights** and standing of the Aboriginal people in the tribal lands affected by the Agreement, and providing for the recognition of traditional Aboriginal owners in the Aurukun area as those Aboriginal people who have common spiritual affiliations io a site on the land and who are entitled by Aboriginal tradition to forage as of right over that land; and providing for the recognition of traditions, observances, customs and beliefs as applied in relation to the people of Aboriginal race at Aurukun, and to sites and areas of land at Aurukun.

* The operative pan of the motion is the request for legislation to be introduced protecting the **rights** and standing of the Aboriginal people affected by the Aurukun Associates Agreement Act 1975 of the Parliament of the State of Queensland.

* It would be fair to say that Queensland follows the classic Australian pattern in acknowledging no Aboriginal land **rights**- I accept what is now happening, and has been happening for some time, in the Northern Territory- and regarding Aborigines in fact as a conquered people who may be dispossessed with impunity from what they regard as theirs.

* Aurukun has a Presbyterian mission and the board of the Presbyterian missions asked the Premier of Queensland 'to withdraw the Bill pending consideration of it by the Aurukun community' and 'to ensure that the negotiated **rights** of the Aboriginal people are safeguarded'.

* I noted this when I was a member of the select committees on the grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines and the voting **rights** of Aborigines.

* I took with me to Europe to meet the principals of the Swiss company owning mining **rights** at Gove 2 young Aboriginal men.

* When I was a member of the Select Committee on aboriginal voting **rights**, our committee came down the Queensland coast taking evidence.

* We all, including  Mr Bjelke-Petersen,  have humbly to learn how to deal with Aborigines and we might begin by listening to them, acknowledging land **rights** and treating them unsentimentally and with dignity.

* My Government has not negotiated any agreements involving areas of sea-bed and continental shelf over which State **rights** are claimed.

* On the view of State **rights** taken by my Government, no difficulties would arise if it did.

* I am just building up the case of a deliberate attempt on States' **rights**.

* I want to pursue the point of the absolute absence in this legislation of any respect for State **rights**.

* We are aware of what is contemplated and we will not tolerate this manoeuvre which strikes at State **rights**.

* I believe that this Bill does not interfere with the **rights** of practising Christians- the great majority of our population- nor does it interfere with family life.

* Here again I believe that this Bill does not interfere with their **rights** or views, nor does it engender irresponsibility, a throwing away of values and a destruction of the basis of our society.

* The legal rules, for instance, governing the property **rights** of husband and wife are quite irrelevant in families where all property has always been pooled.

* Precisely because children are automatically members of a family and can have no choice in the matter, and be-  .....  they  lIe  subject  try  parental authority their  - -------- j  - - --- ~j--- j~ -------- -------  "j : - ~ -  interests must be guaranteed by the state, as it must guarantee the **rights** of a member of any association which exercises effective power.

* In some legal systems, a wife's status is more like that of an object of property **rights** than of a party to a contract.

* The legal **rights** of married women against their husbands were considerably extended in this country in the 19th century as part of a general emancipation of women, in custom as well as in law.

* Nevertheless, a husband is still legally obliged in principle to support his wife, and she has special property **rights** against him.

* It states that the Family Court, which I concede may need looking at from time to time, shall have regard to the need to protect the institution of marriage and family life generally, the need to protect the **rights** of children and to promote their welfare, and the means available to assist parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation and the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage.

* I believe the right to strike carries with it, like all **rights**, certain duties and responsibilities.

* The right to strike is one of the prized and protected **rights** of the Australian worker, but only when negotiations have failed and there are no other weapons open to the worker to pursue the justice he seeks.

* Is it because the Government wants control of the media so that we cannot object to the programs that are being put on because we are not paying television licence fees and therefore have no **rights**?

* You will not protect my **rights** to speak.

* You have to protect my **rights** to speak in the chamber and not let my time be taken up by this stupid, ridiculous point of order.

* One would have thought that the honourable member, coming from an electorate in the far north of Queensland, an area concerned about the development of that State and more specifically about the harnessing of the resources and the capacity for development of the area he represents, would have made a forthright and aggressive speech on the **rights** of the State of Queensland in relation to the allocation of Commonwealth money.

* The Queensland State Government is not concerned about the education and the **rights** of young people and just how valuable education is, not in the mean and narrow context all too often applied to churning out inputs for industry but in terms of stimulating and fostering the development of creative minds.

* The Commonwealth Government knows full well that with such incompetence at the State Government level it can ignore pretty much the sorts of moral **rights** of the State of Queensland.

* The Australian people expect the Fraser Government to proceed with my Government's legislation to secure land **rights** for the Aboriginal people and to override discriminatory laws in the States.

* But over the last 20 years there has been a great advance in the attitude of the Australian people towards the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* That realisation could not be sheeted home to any government in particular, but over the last three years or so there has been a constant chiselling of the progress of the Aboriginal people and of the **rights** that have been established for them.

* I just remind honourable members of four issues involving the lands and the **rights** of the Aboriginal people.

* During that period the land **rights** legislation was established!

* Its purpose was to give permanent **rights** to the Aborigines and to establish absolute, unqualified obligations on the part of the Australian people.

* It also established the **rights** of the Torres Strait Island people.

* Diamonds have been discovered in the north-west part of the Kimberley Ranges, and so there has been a move to unsettle and to take away the **rights** of the Oombulgurri people in particular.

* We on this side of the House support a measure which will give land **rights** to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.

* That is to say, 23 per cent of the Northern Territory is subject to claim under these Bills and particularly the land **rights** Bill.

* Again the question that inevitably comes up is the question of the **rights** of existing holders of interest in Crown lands off reserves.

* The **rights** of traditional owners to decide what should happen on their lands is a matter of great significance.

* Those of us who sympathise very much with the claims for Aboriginal land **rights** naturally feel that the Aboriginal people should have the right to say whether mining ventures should be conducted on their land.

* Do they understand that this could be a means whereby Aborigines in other parts of Australia could obtain title or **rights** to land in the Northern Territory?

* Do they understand that people of the Torres Strait Islands for instance could gain **rights** to land in the Northern Territory?

* When I cross-examined Aboriginals in the land **rights** case I got the same impression coming back to me.

* True it is that the Aboriginal people ought to be entitled to be free from interference with their traditional fishing **rights** and the like, but if this provision remains people will be excluded from the areas.

* The fact that atrocities are taking place in other countries surely should not stop any of us, and, I hope, some honourable members in the future, taking up these questions of human **rights** in other countries, if our voices in the Australian Parliament mean anything at all.

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has already stated publicly that if the proposed legislation and the lease arrangements which will be legislated for by the Queensland Government are not satisfactory to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth will use its constitutional powers of acquisition in order to ensure that the **rights** and interests of the people of the two communities are fully protected.

* On the same day, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  gave 'a completely unequivocal assurance' that the **rights** and prerogatives of the two communities could and would be safeguarded.

* I believe that a 'single buying agency' should be set up, as was recommended in the 1973 report of the Tariff Board concerning motion picture films and television programs, with the exclusive authority to buy exhibition **rights** for British and foreign films, series and specials for Australian television.

* Once the programs had been bought overseas the 'single buying agency' would then conduct a domestic auction in Australia and the highest bidder would acquire the Australian domestic **rights** from the agency.

* elect Government are to be given their democratic **rights**, it is of immense importance that the electoral system is a fair one.

* My attitude as an elected representative is that the electoral **rights** of people of Australia are paramount and these must receive proper consideration if we are to suggest that the electoral system of this nation is a democratic one.

* It must be acknowledged that city people will not sit idly by and allow their **rights** to be eroded.

* I believe that, because of the gerrymander that has taken place in Queensland, because electorate loading has been permitted under sections of the Electoral Act and because there has been an attack on the **rights** of city people, there has been a reaction.

* I repeat what I said earlier: Although all the people in the cities did not vote for me, I will be standing up as I am today, demanding the **rights** of the people who live in the cities and demanding that the value of their vote be the same as that of people living in country areas.

* The Commonwealth might have exercised its ordinary **rights** as owner of the land to remove the tents put there without its authority.

* It was therefore felt on this advice that the situation required a specific law which could clearly enable people to identify their **rights**.

* The legislation does not restrict the traditional **rights**, such as the right of freedom of speech and assembly; nor should it.

* He says democracy is frail in Australia because one chamber of this Parliament is prepared to exercise its **rights** which it was guaranteed under the Constitution.

* We have learned that the right answer is to set the individual free to aim at equality of opportunity, to create a society in which **rights** and duties are recognised and made effective.

* He could not resist the opportunity to attack the Queensland Government and its very fine Premier who so often, to the Prime Minister's acute embarrassment, has exposed the motives of this Federal Government to destroy State governments, to usurp their **rights** and to centralise all control in Canberra.

* I would like to talk on many other matters, but I do want to say that the people of Queensland are sick and tired of a government which is trying to take away their **rights** and which loses no opportunity to denigrate their Premier and their Government and to impose a system that is not democratic but is the very antithesis of democracy.

* Did he promise the Administrative and Clerical Officer's Association on 3 May 1974 that he would introduce legislation to implement the recommendations of the Joint Council re action to protect the **rights** of employees suffering pecuniary loss following departmental restructuring.

* In Part IV of the principal Act normal civil **rights** are proscribed in respect of access to information, search and arrest, proof of intent and access to declared areas.

* Secondly, there might be conflict between Aboriginal land **rights** and provisions of this Act.

* We thought it a most inappropriate bit of legislation, not only due to its penal clauses and its infringement on human **rights** but because it would also be used to maintain conflict by this blanket of secrecy which has dogged the whole process ever since it started.

* Are the Government's proposals discriminatory to the extent of providing for 3 different categories of Australians in relation to pension **rights**?

* The parties participating in the Pahs Conference on Vietnam, with a view to ending the war and restoring peace in Vietnam on the basis of respect for the Vietnamese people's fundamental national **rights** and the South Vietnamese people's right to self determination, and to contributing to the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world .

* complete denial of the **rights** of this body.

* But we are also giving him some prerogative **rights**.

* The honourable member for Capricornia made some remarks about those **rights**.

* Don Dunstan, the Premier of South Australia, as follows: 
I believe the redistribution as proposed for Victoria represents a gross injustice to the electoral and political **rights** of all Victorians.

* The result has been to make Australia's working women rather fearful of pushing for their legitimate **rights** as working contributors to our society.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* Legal aid means giving **rights** to people.

* People will be denied their **rights**.

* Equality before the law and equal access are basic human **rights**.

* There could be some grounds for argument in that proposition but we have to look at the situation of people needing advice on their **rights** and what they are about when it comes to what the Government calls dissolution.

* It is a question of **rights**.

* The Government's contemptible meanness has not only caused political embarrassment but has also denied people their **rights**.

* Litigation and human **rights** do not run to a time table with a monthly allocation from the Treasury.

* The Government does not put in a penny but it demands that such people do when they fight for their **rights**.

* It is a question of combat and **rights**, skill and ability to get justice determined by somebody who is impartial.

* Government members have put themselves on record as supporting women's **rights**, the equality of women, giving women opportunity and a decent go.

* Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young families, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career **rights** for women who stay out of the work force longer to look after children.

* It is their **rights** which are at stake.

* The problem of framing appropriate legislation for protecting the **rights** of individual unionists while facilitating easier amalgamations has proved to be a vexed one.

* We believe it is about time someone stood up in the the defence of the **rights** of the ordinary, common people of Australia.

* It is not prepared to recommend discriminatory treatment about the **rights** of Aboriginal people to drink.

* Private members' **rights** were infringed.

* The collegiate system does not preserve the **rights** of the smaller States.

* Local authorities in Australia have only borrowing **rights** at the Loan Council level.

* One can only be impressed by the strength of their convictions that the Bill does not satisfactorily achieve land **rights** and' that it will cause serious friction.

* I do not want to enlarge on the remarks I made at the time of the first amending Bill this year, other than to say that it is consistent with Labor Party policy from before 1975 when we introduced land **rights** legislation and it is consistent with the stand that we took in 1 976 when the principal Act was carried.

* We will concede that there are **rights** for mining and minerals and that Australia has an urgent need for them.

* At page 1302 of  Hansard  for 1 1 September 1975 he is reported as saying: 
We can accept those particular sentiments as legitimate, but we just wonder whether they reflect the priorities of the Government in Aboriginal affairs and whether mineral development and State **rights** are being allowed to ease out Aboriginal **rights**.

* The Minister, when speaking on the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, said on 12 December 1973, as reported in  Hansard  for that day: 
He was showing again his concern for State **rights** with regard to minerals.

* We have felt uneasy, as I believe people at Aurukun and other places have felt uneasy, that this concern in some way may have weakened his resolve in approaching States on matters of Aboriginal **rights** and his part in framing legislation for land **rights** in the Northern Territory.

* We are concerned to have his assurance that the Opposition 's amendments, which we bring forward for the second time this year, will receive due consideration and that the sentiments reflected therein will be given due weight when Aboriginal **rights** vis-a-vis mineral **rights** are considered.

* I do not want to concentrate on the **rights** or wrongs of that case or the activities of the department.

* I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  charts, ranked by nation, showing a comparative survey of freedom and giving details of political **rights** and civil liberties published by Freedom House in the United States.

* Notes to the Table 1 The scales use the numbers 1-7, with 1 comparatively offering the highest level of political or civil **rights**, and 7 the lowest.

* PW 1/8) that while dealing with the fundamental **rights** and guaranteeing protection and privacy of home, the complainant stated that:  ... our telephones were tapped.

* Australia is in no position to take a self-righteous posture on the subject of human **rights**.

* The greatest danger to human **rights** in our quarter of the globe is unquestionably in Indonesia.

* One of the terrible things about these matters affecting human **rights** is that they remind us that the State can be and often is a destructive force fuelled by a passion for orthodoxy and uniformity.

* It appears that in this House one has to continually stand up for his **rights**.

* The Liberal Party approach, as outlined in the Treasurer's Budget Speech, is short-sighted, inadequate and has no philosophy of basie **rights** or justice either for individuals or industries.

* Everybody recognises and acknowledges the **rights** of employees and the **rights** of unions.

* There can be none, ff all persons in the community are to be equal before the law and to have equal **rights** before the law, they must also have equal obligations before the law.

* It can be said that we on this side are the ones who, in this case, are seeking to uphold the **rights** of individuals, be they members of a union, be they employees, be they any other members of the community.

* It is the Government which is seeking to take away established **rights** of individuals in Australia, **rights** which have been, as I have said, with Australia and with the people, apart from Queensland, for the whole of this century.

* I wish to stress this aspect, particularly as it relates to Aboriginal affairs and Aboriginal land **rights**.

* Outside the Northern Territory and other Federal Territories, the Government today has washed its hands of any responsibility for land **rights**.

* In reply to the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  this morning, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  said that land **rights** is a matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State Government operating under its own legislation'.

* Without consulting the land **rights** body in Western Australia and without consulting the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning, the Western Australian Government intends to hand over to the Minister for Health and Community Welfare the absolute control of entry by diamond prospectors, including the De Beer group from South Africa.

* One can imagine what sort of cognisance he will take of Aboriginal feelings and sentiments when it comes to consulting people on the **rights** of entry of mining prospectors to their land.

* In the 1975 election campaign we were assured by the parties now in government that they intended to implement Federal policy on Aboriginal affairs, to implement Federal policy on land **rights** and to implement the recommendations of the Woodward Commission and the Ranger Committee of Inquiry.

* It has done nothing to amend any weaknesses in Federal law, which could restore land **rights** to Aboriginals.

* Unless Aboriginals live in Federal territories, it seems that the Government has no intention of taking any notice of their **rights**.

* Those States that have co-operated with the Federal 
Government, with the enlightened mission authorities and with the Aboriginal communities have voluntarily handed over these **rights**.

* But Queensland will not even countenance land **rights**.

* He says that if the Government gives to Aboriginals the **rights** that he is already exercising improperly there will be a black take-over of Australia.

* It is not that that is eating  Mr Bjelke-Petersen;  it is mineral **rights**.

* They will already be in the hands of the State Government and it will have its hands on the mineral **rights**.

* His superannuation **rights** start only from the day on which he became a member of this House of Representatives.

* I was endeavouring to arrange something to protect the **rights** of a member of this House.

* 1 ) What have been the results of programs initiated by his Depanment to educate Aborigines on their voting **rights** and how to use them.

* The Government is to be condemned for its continued confrontation with the State governments and the undermining of their **rights** and responsibilities.'

* Is the Government's attitude regarding the **rights** of the people of Guinea-Bissau towards self-determination the same as the Government's attitude towards the future of Portuguese Timor; if not, what are the differences.

* The criticism is made, quite regularly, that when the Department of Transport has to make a decision on some aspect of civil aviation policy, whether it be landing **rights** or something else, what Qantas says goes.

* The power and the **rights** of the patient are at stake in the face of the alternative Labor health scheme.

* From an historical point of view one cannot be blamed for having a deep concern about the future **rights** of the people of the Australian Capital Territory, and the Northern Territory.

* I find it really hard to believe that, after responsible government has been in existence for so long in this country and after the democratic battles of the past, which went on for so long in this country and in other countries, we now have to start all over again and start fighting for the same basic democratic **rights** involving something like 300 000 Australian citizens.

* There is now a group of people whom I can only describe as political troglodytes or power hungry legal eagles who seek to turn the clock back and play petty politics with people's basic **rights**, people who for the sake of some cheap political advantage, for the sake of influencing a referendum result are prepared to deny basic **rights** to or disenfranchise 300 000 Australian citizens.

* We have been pushed around a lot in the last couple of years and I can assure the people who are interested in that exercise that the people of the Australian Capital Territory will not sit back and take kindly this attempt to deny them their **rights**.

* They will be over at this Parliament House demanding their **rights** as have the people of Australia throughout history.

* Most of the debate about the Constitution these days is about State **rights** or about federalism.

* If our Constitution does not protect the people in their basic **rights** it is time we had a Bill of Rights which did protect them.

* As I said, the debate has not been about individuals **rights**; it has been about State **rights** and about Federal powers.

* I think we have to start interpreting the Constitution more in terms of the **rights** of the individual and if it is deficient it is time that we wrote something into it or adopted a Bill of Rights which would cover these things.

* When those people arrive in the Territory they are not asked to give up the **rights** they have enjoyed in other parts of the Commonwealth; and why should they?

* That money is being used for the purpose of making a phoney legal challenge to the **rights** of the people of Canberra.

* I can assure those political troglodytes, as I call them, and legal eagles who seek to deprive the people of the Australian Capital Territory of their **rights** that we will not take such a challenge lying down.

* The people are not in the mood to have taken from them **rights** which have been hard won after years and years of struggle.

* As I have said, I am sure that the people of Canberra will be prepared to speak up for themselves and will demand that those people who seek to take away their **rights** justify their actions, if they can do that.

* I agree with the view expressed by the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  when he said that people are getting fed up with the cheap political posturing that goes on between the States and the Commonwealth, the lack of principle which underlies their actions, the complete disregard for basic human **rights**, and the concentration on some cheap temporary political gain at the expense of other people.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* I am concerned about one of the more important reports dealing with the **rights** of Aboriginal communities.

* Will the Minister act to safeguard the political **rights** and right to reinstatement of public servants who unsuccessfully seek public office?

* There was the failure of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land **rights** legislation to face up to the issue and place on the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory the responsibility finally for many areas which are of some importance.

* I say that land **rights** is the principal issue.

* Land **rights** is the principal issue.

* If it decided to give special fishing **rights** along the shores, would this legislation stop it?

* I know this conflicts with treasured and traditional attitudes to mineral **rights**.

* In this country the mineral **rights** belong to the Crown.

* But if they start on the premise that property, State **rights** and that kind of legalism transcends human **rights**, they will find no answer.

* That there is widespread oppositionto the National Service Act arising from the denial of basic human **rights** and liberties.

* We also want time to incorporate in the legislation not just land **rights**, the taking over of reserves, but also a stronger control of reserves by the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland.

* For instance, the Bill does not provide, as some of the land **rights** legislation for the Northern Territory provides, that no person, not being an Aboriginal or Islander, shall enter a reserve without permission of the Aboriginal council or without the consent of the Minister.

* The second reading speech of the Minister refers to land **rights**.

* Yet land **rights** have been the cry right from the days of the first dawning of a national voice for Aboriginals in this country.

* Land **rights** virtually are ignored in the Bill.

* It is concerned at the very tame approach to land **rights**.

* Surely, with all the glowing praise for land **rights** legislation in the Northern Territory in the recent address by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to the National Aboriginal Conference and with the Minister's own praise for land **rights** in Western Australia, we could at least have hoped for some foreshadowing of land **rights** legislation here.

* Is it not remarkable that a government which expresses itself to be so concerned for the **rights** of the States, so anxious to accommodate State sensitivities and so determined to maintain proper Commonwealth-State relationships should not only arrive at this miserable decision but also should convey it in such an improper and offensive way?

* That, in the opinion of this House, measures need to be taken to protect civil liberties and human **rights** including: 
a Bill of Rights and Constitutional guarantees of human **rights**; 
I have just learned that we will have only 15 minutes in which to discuss this very important matter.

* We desperately need a Bill of **rights** and a constitutional guarantee of human **rights**, a proper system of legal aid and reform of the law so as to better protect civil liberties.

* The fact is that no progress will be made in achieving genuine democracy in this country unless we look at trying to protect the **rights** of the individual.

* The learned Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  mentioned a moment ago that we have a plethora of parliamentary committees; but we do not have any committees dealing with the **rights** of people and how the laws we pass affect them.

* It is most important to have a committee that looks at the **rights** of the citizens who are coming forward and saying that they are being affected by laws that the Parliament is passing or failing to pass.

* We were promised a human **rights** commission in 1976.

* We entered into the endorsement of a human **rights** covenant which said more than that.

* In entering into that covenant, which was a United Nations covenant, we said virtually that we would guarantee human **rights** for our citizens.

* There is a wide range of such **rights**, but honourable members will notice that the thrust of what I am saying today relates to a proper system of legal aid and the question of people having human **rights**.

* In 1973 the Labor Government was anxious to implement laws that would have guaranteed **rights** in accordance with the international covenant.

* We still do not have those **rights** in any statute form.

* As honourable members would know, the **rights** in a State such as Queensland are not in accordance with the **rights** of the international covenant.

* There are the **rights** of human assembly, of free speech and of demonstration.

* We have to have genuine and effective methods whereby people are entitled to exercise those **rights**.

* If we had a Bill of **rights** that set out the position a citizen would have access to clear statutory protection.

* The only weakness in having a Bill of **rights** is that another government can do away with it.

* Much stronger emphasis would be placed on human **rights** if those **rights** were entrenched in the Constitution, which they should be.

* I think every Australian would ask: Why do we not have the **rights** set out in the Constitution?

* There have been legal decisions that clearly indicate that the elementary right of one vote one value does not apply in Australia, yet that is contrary to the human **rights** covenant in regard to what is called equal suffrage.

* If one looked at the most stringent tests which were recently announced regarding eligibility for legal aid one would see that we are not giving any real substance to the **rights** of a citizen in this regard because he will not have a chance to get any lawyer to represent him or to prepare his case in such a way as to enable him to be able to stand up against all the resources of a bureaucracy or government.

* One matter that has been brought to my attention- it obviously was not in my mind when I first put this motion on the Notice Paper- goes right to the whole question of human **rights** and the **rights** of citizens.

* That is a breach of article 14 of the human **rights** covenant.

* We are prosecuting hundreds of members of the Greek community in a fashion which is denying them human and legal **rights**.

* People are being denied their **rights**.

* This Government has never actively pursued human **rights** legislation.

* I want my colleague the honourable member for Hawker  (Mr Jacobi)  to support my motion because he has something important to say in respect of human **rights**.

* We could certainly have introduced legislation in this place to protect the **rights** of people.

* In the other place today there will be a discussion on the **rights** of our intelligence people to get information on citizens.

* Let us be very clear that in international forums Australia should be seen to be a genuine democracy and a country that believes in the **rights** of our people.

* Let us legislate to guarantee those **rights**.

* At present if someone dares to march down the streets of Queensland without a permit he has no **rights** under an international covenant, and that is contrary to the real issue of what I am talking about in this motion.

* A Greek citizen accused of conspiracy has no **rights** to legal aid under the terms of Article 14 of the United Nations convention.

* I particularly hope that in respect of the legal aid matters I have raised they will be dealt with expeditiously and will not be hidebound by some administrative decisions which deny people their **rights**.

* That Government has never accepted the concept of land **rights**.

* Once born, no matter how prematurely, I accept that the individual has all the **rights** most or all of us assume it has, even though a new born baby, and particularly a premature baby, in a practical sense is totally dependent on another person or other people, not necessarily its natural mother.

* Before birth we are confronted with a pregnant woman who also has **rights**, **rights** that might be in conflict with the **rights** of the foetus she carries within her.

* My assumption is that the carrying mother's **rights** are paramount.

* I beseech the House to bear in mind that this individual, like every other and like the 6 million Jews who were killed in the war, has the same **rights** as anybody else.

* I hold no brief for the man, other than that he be given the same **rights** as anybody else.

* It is a measure which, if carried into force by vote of the people, will have a long and far-reaching effect on the respective **rights** and responsibilities not only of this Parliament but also of the Parliaments of the various States.

* For example, I find it anomalous that the Commonwealth should have a power in respect of family law matters covering divorce, property **rights** arising out of divorce situations, marriage and so forth, whereas the States retain legal responsibility for such matters as legitimacy and adoption.

* We believe that this is a measure which uniquely affects the **rights** of the States and therefore the States have a right to communicate their views not only on the principle involved but also on the means by which the Government has chosen to implement that principle.

* What we do assert is that because it goes so fundamentally to the **rights** of the States they are entitled to express their views to this Parliament before the measure is passed.

* Territory Supreme Court legislation, the Aboriginal land **rights** legislation and many other moves are all important factors that fit together.

* -One of the more interesting pieces of materialist philosophy is what might be called the transcendental **rights** of mining, the sovereign **rights** of rnining, which are superior- in the view of people such as the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns)-  to any other right of any other person in this country.

* The situation is that under this legislation we are transferring to the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory the ownership, in a particular form, of the lands to which they have traditional **rights**, but we are not transferring the absolute **rights**.

* My friend from Lilley points out that there must be no interference with the **rights** of renewal.

* It is really not an Aboriginal land **rights** Bill.

* It deals with the mining **rights** on Aboriginal lands.

* In fact, one has almost all the land **rights** which we are now trying to obtain for Aboriginal people.

* There is no suggestion at this stage that we should take from people their present **rights**.

* Many people in this country have acquired **rights** over land by simply occupying it in the past.

* If we are really genuine about transferring the **rights**, the proprietorship of this land to the Aboriginal people, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in the present sense.

* I support my colleague the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  in what he had to say about those other tilings which again put certain **rights** above the **rights** of Aboriginal people in towns and on Crown lands.

* Therefore, if we have to decide a new formula, introduce subsidiary legislation or something of that nature to bring about a different deal in relation to mining **rights**, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in their present form because I believe it offends the spirit of the legislation and it will make absolutely certain that there are large parts of the Northern Territory on Aboriginal domain which will never belong to the Aboriginal in the strict sense.

* I say that we should not take away the **rights** that we have.

* There is no thought of concealing from such persons their **rights** under the law.

* The privileges of the House are precious **rights** which must be preserved.

* I strongly suspect that the issues involved are not of concern at all to any Territory government but of concern purely to the governments of the States of Queensland and Western Australia which seem to be suffering from an embattled complex- a complex that they have been beleaguered in some way by the Federal Government, that they have to stand up and struggle for their threatened State **rights** so called.

* The amendments are all concerned with States **rights**.

* In support of my contention that this is not a move by the Territory authorities but is purely a move by the States of Queensland and Western Australia which are so vocal on this matter of States **rights**, let us look at some of the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, the complementary and consequential legislation for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* In recognising land **rights** we will ensure: 
That traditional Aboriginal owners gain an inalienable title to their land, that they also determine how their lands are to be used and preserved, that they have the same **rights** as any other owner to determine who enters their land whether the person is Aborigine or non-Aborigine .

* In respect of Aboriginal land **rights**, the document contained the statement that I have just quoted.

* The Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly also stated: 
There are, as the honourable member for Dundas  (Mr Ruddock)  indicated by way of interjection, certain provisions for other people to give  the  **rights** of entry to Aboriginal land.

* The Minister should take account of this reaction if he really means what he says, that is, that he is acting for the Aboriginal people and not for States **rights**.

* One of the incidents that makes us particularly uneasy about this defence of States **rights** and the falling in with the wishes of the states occurred in Mareeba in Queensland.

* It would act as trustee until the future establishment of an Aboriginal housing society in which the **rights** and responsibilities would be then vested.

* We believe that they represent a holding operation which is the sort of caution we think the Minister should have before he strengthens the position of the States in these matters and certainly which he would be ill advised to ignore before he has had the fullest consultation with the Aboriginal people, the land councils and other bodies, as the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly did before it brought down its land **rights** legislation.

* To have no plan for any other airport is an act of cowardice in the face of the **rights** of people in the area.

* The Labor Party introduced the land **rights** legislation in 1975 following the Woodward report.

* The incoming Liberal-Country Party Government introduced its own style of land **rights** legislation.

* I think it can be said in all fairness that, although we differ on the emphasis in and the areas dealt with by the legislation on the question of land **rights** there has over the last four or five years been what could in some respects be called a bipartisan policy.

* People can talk about health, education, housing and all sorts of things but unless the Aboriginal people who still live in tribal communities are given land **rights** the other things do not seem to matter a great deal.

* I understand that there have been attempts to get the Commonwealth Government and the two States to agree on a central area for the Pitjantjatjara which would satisfy their land **rights** claims.

* A number of years ago the South Australian Labor Government took the first step in establishing land **rights** for Aboriginals when it set up the Aboriginal Lands Trust in that State.

* So it was necessary for other legislation to be introduced to give effect to land **rights** claims in a way similar to that which the Commonwealth Government has introduced for the Northern Territory.

* Of course the question of mineral **rights** will be given attention.

* From the remarks made by the present Premier of South Australia and by the Liberal member representing that area, there is a possibility that mineral **rights** will be excluded from the .operations of the new Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill when it is introduced.

* I hope that in his discussions with the new South Australian Government he will do his utmost to see that this question of mineral **rights** is not taken out of the Bill for these people who, as I say, are still in a tribalised state.

* I sincerely hope that the Federal Minister, in his discussions with the South Australian Government, will ensure that the full **rights** of these people are protected and that he will use his influence with the South Australian Liberal Government to see that they are protected in a manner similar to the way in which the **rights** of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory have been protected.

* He talked of the need to protect and enhance the **rights** and the civil liberties of every Australian.

* It is ail very well - everyone must applaud the sentiments that he uttered - to say that the task of the law maker is to strike a balance between the preservation of important fundamental **rights** and the abuse of them, but the exercising of these **rights** does sometimes produce conflict.

* It is written into the Bill of Rights in the United States of America that one can do this, that and the other and that he has **rights**.

* In this pamphlet he discusses **rights** and the law as they stand at present.

* Mr Justice  Hope describes that law and describes how traffic offences are used, and the question of **rights** in respect of the distribution of leaflets.

* I would suggest that this restatement should be of two kinds, the **rights** involved should be stated pos/lively.

* The **rights** being so stated, the restrictions, if any, with which those **rights** are to be qualified, and the enforcement of those restrictions, should be carefully considered and the right should not be whittled down further than is absolutely necessary.

* Full voting **rights** for the representative of the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives - 
That is clear; it admits that there is a member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives and that he ought to have full voting **rights**.

* and full voting **rights** for the representatives of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate.

* What it suggests is not that the Australian Labor Party will make sure that there are Senate representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory but that if there are Senate representatives for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory they ought to have full voting **rights**.

* It is not only a House of review, as it has often been termed, but also a chamber in which the States, as separate entities, are endowed with a parity of representation designed to enable them at the legislative stage to protect those **rights** reserved for the States.

* As I have indicated already, the functions of the Senate are basically of a dual nature - firstly, as a House of revision and review in general legislation matters and, secondly, as a guardian of the interests and **rights** of the States.

* Alternatively, the Parliament may, of course, under the provisions of section 122 allow Territory representation in the Senate by senators with full voting **rights** but the number of such representatives is wholly within the discretion of the Parliament.

* It is very likely that a large percentage of the Australian electorate could be disfranchised and its voting **rights** taken away.

* We ask you to support us in every way to make sure we retain our **rights**.

* Cease being an agent of Petersen and fight for the **rights** and freedom of your people.

* Queensland is not out of step with this Government, it is out of step with every other Government in Australia on the question of land **rights**.

* The setting up of the Trust was a recognition of Aboriginal land **rights**.

* The Liberal Government in Victoria transferred land **rights** at Lake Tyers and Framlingham to its Aboriginal people some years ago.

* But land **rights** are not in question.

* It is probably a difficult few weeks for the encumbent Government to start changing political attitudes that are well established, but there is plenty of reason at this end of things and 
If one can easily live with the judgments of Menhennitt and Levine which determine the legality of abortions in the States, one cannot logically believe that a separate life begins at conception and, therefore, one must believe that abortion on demand does not impinge on the **rights** of anyone but the mother.

* I submit that this evidence dictates the right of the foetus to be born, the **rights** of the mother and the obligations of doctors and legislators.

* It is my view, based on my belief that a separate life follows conception, that the right of the foetus to be born transcends all other **rights**, excepting the most extreme cases of risk of the life of the mother.

* In all the recent criticism of this motion regarding women's **rights** and doctors' responsibilities not one critic has yet put in a plea for the foetus.

* Regarding the **rights** of the unborn, I think in this year, the International Year of the Child, when we are celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the United Nations of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, we should have a close look at that Declaration.

* Quite clearly from the passages I have quoted from the Geneva and United Nations declarations it can be seen that the obligations of the medical profession and the **rights** of the unborn sit together and together constitute an obligation for legislators.

* But there are other **rights** to consider also- the **rights** of the pregnant woman.

* If we accept that the foetus lives, the **rights** of both the foetus and the mother cannot be protected at once; and I give my priority to the unrepresented and unprotected unborn, with the exception stipulated in the motion.

* Fewer and fewer can be justified in terms of strict medical necessity, in terms of morality or in terms of the **rights** and obligations of all parties to the procedure; and these arguments should all determine our attitude to funding.

* I have raised other questions relating to the **rights** and obligations of the parties involved in an abortion and they lead me to conclude that this Parliament has an obligation to act within its constitutional constraints to restrict the payment of medical benefits for unnecessary abortions as this is the only way we can challenge what has become a massive abuse of the sanctity of human life.

* Sir Reginald  Ansett 's Avis rent-a-car company, which previously had sole **rights** as national operator, missed out when outbid by its two competitors.

* However, Budget and Hertz paid their high prices on the clear understanding that the terms and conditions of the tenders protected their exclusive national **rights**.

* Suddenly, Avis appears likely to gain a national operation at a much lower cost, without having to service less profitable, or marginal, airports as its competitors, Budget and Hertz, are forced to do by the very terms and conditions they thought protected their exclusive national **rights**.

* The original tender document C3/79/10 contained in appendix B 'Terms and Conditions to be observed by Concessionaires', section 6 'Assignment of Rights' stated as follows: 
The concessionaire shall not assign or sell any privileges or **rights** arising under this authority or sub-let any part or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agents on airports.

* One would expect that in view of the enormous controversy that had raged around car rental **rights** at airports, the details of the tender documents would have been meticulously examined and mulled over to ensure that there was no confusion in anybody's mind as to what were the conditions of tender.

* The Operator shall not without the approval of the Secretary assign or sell any privileges or **rights** arising under this authority or sub-let any pan or parts of the business, except that he may appoint persons as his agent or franchise for the purpose of conducting the business at any of the airports.

* Because ours is a free society of many differing views, because there exists among persons of goodwill a genuine difference of opinion concerning the **rights** of a foetus in its early stage of development and because all people I respect support, among other appropriate and relevant statements, the Catholic Church's Second Vatican Council Declaration on Religious Freedom, I find myself, as a parliamentary representative, unable to support legislation, which makes criminals of those who do not share my faith.

* It could have been applied with considerable effect in Queensland to establish and preserve the basic **rights** of Aboriginal people in that State.

* In spite of that, not only was the authority under the Racial Discrimination Act not adopted but also the evidence is that the Minister prevented it from being adopted in defence of Aboriginal **rights**.

* By itself that might not have seemed so significant, although it is certainly worrying; but in association with other matters for which the Minister has been responsible, clearly what he was seeking to do was to impose a fiscal discrimination, a fiscal prohibition, on the Land Fund Commission which was very rightly seeking to exercise the authority available to it to protect the **rights** of Aboriginals in Queensland.

* Furthermore, the evidence of the letter makes it clear that despite the undertaking that the Prime Minister gave that there was concern- by implication, that the Government was still committed to achieving land **rights** for Aboriginals in this area- when he said to the Parliament that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was still considering what steps to take on the matter, he had no intention of considering the matter further.

* They are the policies- policies of assimilation, policies of restriction and policies designed to prevent the Aboriginal people from establishing a clearer sense of cultural identity and the achievement of land **rights**, freedom and independence; those things which importantly go with acquisition of land and land **rights**, but more importantly for Aboriginals.

* He expressed concern about racism and yet he erected fiscal barriers to ensure that the Land Fund Commission would not be able to protect the **rights** of Aboriginals in Queensland against the incursion of the racist policies of that State Government.

* The penalty it is going to pay arises because it is not prepared to stick to the elaborate fiction that the Minister likes to broadcast that we have a government concerned about Aboriginal **rights** and welfare.

* The real reason for this is that the Queensland Government asserts that it is opposed to Aboriginal land **rights** because it believes that it leads to a dispersion of Aboriginal residents in mission areas and, presumably, it is not able to impose as much control as it would wish over Aboriginal people.

* Nevertheless, in the drafting of these provisions care has been taken to ensure that proper safeguards exist for the **rights** of the defendant.

* Last night I talked more generally about this matter and referred to the fact that other legislation that is before the House, the Northern Territory land **rights** legislation, will certainly weaken the power of the Commonwealth over sacred sites because it is intended to hand back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly a prerogative over this matter.

* In referring to our own Government, it would be essential that the closest consultation with the States takes place, bearing in mind the dual jurisdiction that applies between the States and the Commonwealth under the constitutional **rights** in this field.

* For those with a sense of justice, for those who believe in the exercise of political **rights** by all people irrespective of race or creed it is a moment of achievement.

* As the Papua New Guinea Independence Bill simply states: 
On the expiration of the day preceding Independence Day, Australia ceases to have any sovereignty, sovereign **rights** or **rights** of administration in respect of or appertaining to the whole or any part of Papua New Guinea.

* Was an agreement signed by representatives of Australia and the People's Republic of China enabling a Chinese Consulate to be opened in Sydney with appropriate **rights** for Australia to open a Consulate in China.

* In this election year the Minister not only wants to sweep aside the **rights** of private members but also wants to prevent a discussion of matters that are of terrific importance.

* We did not do the things that are done here today such as depriving private members of their **rights**.

* If we did not oppose every move to whittle down the **rights** of private members we would be giving away **rights** that will never be recovered.

* The suppression that exists under this tired and decadent old administration will go by the board because the Labor Party will give to private members the **rights** to which they are entitled.

* So I place on record my opposition to this infringement of the **rights** of private members.

* 1 would like to see the honourable member for Mallee rise in his place and speak vehemently in defence of the **rights** of private members, as he constantly was doing so vehemently when he sat on this side of the chamber.

* However the Opposition will move to amend this legislation because it firmly believes that the Bill in its present form will infringe upon the **rights** of the individual and exacerbate racism in this country.

* Both Bills seem to give expression to the same obsessions -to break down the long-established system of British common law, to lay down a means of prosecution that will ultimately destroy the professed objectives of the legislation and to use oppressive abuse of power against the fundamental **rights** of the individual.

* They mean that persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin shall enjoy the same **rights** as persons of another race, colour or national or ethnic origin.

* It is a denial of human **rights**.

* I submit this represents a blatant attack on the **rights** of individuals and denies a person privacy to which he ought to be entitled.

* I believe, for the reasons I have stated, that it violates certain human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* The Opposition will move amendments in the Committee stage, not designed to condone racism but intended to dismantle what could well become a legisltive monster that would be more suited perhaps to a totalitarian type of dictatorship where the **rights** and privileges of the individual are of no consequence but where the **rights** of the state are supreme.

* I understand that members of that chamber, who apparently are more likely to defend their **rights** against the tyranny of ignorance - that is exactly what it is - in fact are increasing their facilities at the expense of members of this chamber.

* In February 1 973, the former Government appointed an Aboriginal Land Rights Commissioner,  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward, to inquire into and report on 'the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional **rights** and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to **rights** in or in relation to land' in the Northern Territory.

* Mr Justice  Woodward presented his first report in July of that year and in it recommended that a northern and a central land council be established to consider the preliminary views he set down in that report, and to present to him, with expert legal advice, the views of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory on their land **rights**.

* In essence, although the Commission did not fully endorse the submissions made by the land councils, the Aboriginal people accepted the scheme of land **rights** proposed by the Commission and urged that legislative effect be given to it as soon as possible.

* It is not intended that the **rights** to be established by this legislation should be watered down but that out of public scrutiny and whatever amendments may be required the best practicable instrument for effectuating the Government's purpose and Aboriginal aspirations will be arrived at.

* It is relevant to draw honourable members' attention to a closely parallel proposal for the recognition of the land and sea **rights** of the Eskimo people of Canada which is now before the Government of that country.

* Though some of the Indian people of Canada, as of the United States of America, earlier had some recognition of their **rights** in land through treaties, the Eskimo people, like the Aborigines of the Northern Territory, have had no legal recognition of their traditional **rights** in the domestic law of their country.

* Moreover, the creation of these, Land Trusts will achieve the primary objective of any Land Trust scheme which is the vesting, under Australian law, of **rights** corresponding with traditional Aboriginal **rights**, without risk that the **rights** conferred are not sufficient to cover traditional Aboriginal **rights**.

* I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this last mentioned aspect of land **rights**.

* This Bill deals with the recognition of traditional land **rights** and it is proper that the traditional claims of all groups to land outside the reserves should be assessed by the Commissioner and dealt with according to the procedures laid down in the Bill rather than by the arbitrary decision of any government.

* Preservation of Existing Rights 
Existing **rights** in land will be fully protected.

* This provision protects the **rights** of those holding leases on Aboriginal land, like the mining companies at Gove and Groote Eylandt and the mission at Hermannsburg, while ensuring that the title can pass into Aboriginal hands when the lease expires or when the holder negotiates its surrender and the issue of a new lease from the Land Trust.

* The main differences between this Bill and that presented last October by the previous Government are, briefly, that: We have clearly defined the nature of the Aboriginal land **rights** we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those Aborigines with traditional **rights** to use and occupy that land- 1 might add, a fundamental provision strangely missing in the Labor Government's Bill.

* Some people have watched with interesteven suspicion- the statements which have been made by the Government on its intentions to legislate for land **rights**.

* Some have expressed surprise that a Liberal-Country Party government should have made the decision to grant land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* Let there be no more surprise, because the Government's proposals to recognise Aboriginal land **rights** in legislation is one more expression of the Government's commitment to liberal and progressive reform.

* Securing land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory is a significant expression of this objective.

* It is an objective that will be pursued in a way consonant with the **rights** of other Australians.

* The introduction of legislation to grant land **rights** in the Northern Territory is an essential, progressive measure in the social and political history of Australia.

* Is this because the Premier of Queensland has been a very good Queenslander and has stood up for the **rights** of that State against this Government despite the intimidation that has been thrown against him by this Government?

* I have been surprised and very disappointed that Queensland members in this House have been prepared to take him to task for defending the State **rights** of Queensland.

* I pay a tribute to Jo Petersen for the way in which he has stood up for the **rights** of Queensland and for State **rights** generally against a centralist government which is prepared constantly to defer - I use that word because it cannot be said that it will not do anything - work on this important project.

* I commend the Government upon safeguarding the **rights** and the responsibilities of the 6 States in this regard.

* Under a Labor Government, particularly if the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren)  was the Minister the States would have few **rights** and even fewer responsibilities in regard to housing.

* I have had no discussions with Queensland State Ministers on these matters, but my department contacted the Queensland Mines Department on 29 March 1977 seeking information about reports published that day concerning the granting of exploration **rights** over the Oakey Creek area in the Bowen Basin in Queensland.

* When a charter which is designed to balance corporate responsibility and personal **rights** is given to a security organisation the ultimate purpose of that charter is the defence of a country.

* When it operates badly human **rights** are endangered.

* 1 ) Will he review the decision to withdraw tuberculosis pension **rights** from ex-servicemen.

* For the information of honourable members I present material received in January 1979 from  Mr Justice  Staples concerning human **rights** together with the text of a statement by the Attorney-General relating to the material.

* The justification for the Senate was the preservation of State **rights**, not the destruction of votes for city people.

* It is because of a double dissolution caused by senators who are elected on the basis that they will look after State **rights**.

* What about his **rights**, his children, their educational facilities?

* The expression to which I refer is 'those fundamental principles of human **rights** and democracy in this nation'.

* He used very strong words concerning the Legislative Assembly and the powers that are given to it in this Bill He has insinuated that the Assembly will control these rnining interests and the land on which Aborigines will have mineral **rights**.

* It is completely wrong to say to this Government that the Legislative Assembly members will hold the Aboriginal land **rights** with regard to minerals in the hollow of their hands.

* Whilst the Minister may say that that is not likely to happen, I think the experience in this Parliament in the last two years has been that where circumstances have arisen where the Government has taken action, subsequently to find that it was either improper or actually illegal, this Parliament and the community have been totally ignored and their **rights** ignored.

* In some cases where people have actually taken legal action successfully they have found themselves wasting their money because retrospective legislation has been pushed through the Parliament in order to deny them the **rights** to which the courts have said they were legally entitled under the law at the time.

* Firstly, Labor- I am now referring to the industrial wing as well as the political wing of the labour movement; in other words, the Australian Labor Party and the unions- recognises only too well the vital necessity to strike a balance between the need to maintain a labour intensive industry with high technology and the **rights** of consumers to the best and cheapest cars.

* But it needs a government which is nationalistic in outlook- not lapdogs, not sycophants of large companies- to exert our **rights** in this way and obtain signed guarantees.

* It was significant not only for the fact that it introduced amendments to strengthen the principal Act and the **rights** of consumers in so many other directions but also because of the comment that he made, which I read into  Hansard  again.

* The emphasis that originally pointed to the importance of examining the **rights** and interests of students and children of our country has been translated into a concern for schools rather than for children themselves.

* The relevant sections of the United Nations Charter are as follows: 
Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* The people of the Territories have been able to exercise their democratic **rights** and elect people to this Parliament to represent them.

* I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Australia, as a member of the United Nations and as a country that participates in world debate in respect of the **rights** of human beings in all countries and in all territories, has subscribed to the human **rights** provisions, particularly in respect of Article 25 which states: 
-Listen to the Queensland representative.

* What right have people in Queensland to dictate as to the **rights** of others in this country?

* We are spending millions of dollars putting a proposition to the people saying to them that we have an act of Parliament that will interpose the words 'and the Territories' after the word 'State' in section 128 of the Constitution so that under that section people in the territories will have the same **rights** to vote as people in the States have for House of Representatives elections.

* We are spending millions of dollars on presenting a case suggesting that the people of the Territories are to get democratic **rights** but these **rights** perhaps will be denied by judicial interpretation.

* As I say, irrespective of what happens on 21 May, in other words if there was a resounding majority decision to give people in the Territories their basic **rights**, a High Court decision made before or after that date will remove those **rights** by interpretation.

* What was the cost of the **rights** to televise each type of sport.

* It was made quite clear there that, in respect of any company or individual which had found uranium up to that date, the **rights** of that company or individual would be honoured and that companies which still had permits to explore would continue to do so.

* Nevertheless we are delighted that he has again demonstrated how little care he really has for the **rights** of honourable members on this side of the House.

* I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to vote in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the **rights** and the protection of women under this new Family Law Bill.

* The Australian company which has the patent **rights** to manufacture an article may export only to a limited area.

* I ask the Minister what he has done about the loss of control over our mineral **rights**..

* It protects the **rights** of the workers of Australia.

* He is frightened that this section might show the working people of Australia that they have **rights** against people of privilege who pull them out on bans that work very much against their best interests as breadwinners; as people who want to go to work; as people who want to buy consumer goods, and as people who have children to raise.

* I hope that his views and what he sees as being the **rights** of individuals do not reflect the human values of all Government supporters.

* He believes that those people who would seek to preserve anything in Australia against the rape of those who would make profits have no **rights** and should be looked on as nuts.

* He has stated his attitude with regard to Aboriginal land **rights**.

* They would know 10 times more about Aborigines, Aboriginal **rights** and Aboriginal lore than all honourable members opposite put together.

* You,  Mr Speaker,  are the one who ought to determine what are the **rights** of the Parliament and of its members in carrying out their various responsibilities.

* Mr Speaker,  you who are our spokesman and the defender of our **rights** ought to assert yourself very strongly against the executive decision that chose to make this an order of the day.

* In our submission we made the point that Labor policy is committed to legislation and constitutional reform to protect individual **rights** and the right to privacy.

* So, we can go one step further and ask what are the conditions which cause a nation to grant diplomatic recognition so that **rights** such as these can be exerted in the host country, Australia, by representation here.

* If it can be said in any way whatsoever that a nation such as Yugoslavia, or any other nation, has the right to representation here, a right to representation by virtue of Article 22 of the Vienna Convention, such **rights** ought to be considered or ought to apply in respect of a nation such as Taiwan.

* I suggest to the House that recognition and the **rights** that accompany recognition are **rights** of convenience.

* They are nothing else; they are totally **rights** of conveniency.

* Having done that, the Opposition now is willing to accept the absence of **rights** for others because it is so anxious to kow-tow in order to get diplomatic recognition.

* So those **rights** were accorded.

* and to prevent people from recognising their **rights** or even from having an information centre available to them.

* I therefore strongly urge this Government to work towards the removal of all restrictions affecting the **rights** of our cattlemen to export their produce in the form demanded by the purchaser.

* It will stop at nothing to deny people their **rights** and will bend the law and give instructions to public servants who are frightened to disobey.

* We on this side of the House say that that sort of option should be written into properly negotiated treaties whereby Australia's legal positions and obligations are clearly understood and the **rights** of those countries with whom we would be seeking to act in unison would be clearly set out.

* -I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Having regard to earlier statements made by the Minister on a timetable for the introduction of legislation to give effect to the granting of land **rights** to Aborigines in the Northern Territory, can the Minister inform the House of the current situation?

* The **rights** of occupancy of the Air Force base, Butterworth, were transferred by the United Kingdom authorities to the Malaysian Government on and from 1st April 1970.

* Furthermore, before the white man came to the Rabaul area retention of land **rights** was by brute force.

* The House is debating amplification of the recent announcement by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  on Aboriginal land **rights**.

* We stand for corporate **rights** and ownership in respect of those lands which are already designated as lands set aside for Aboriginal purposes.

* It is quite a sensible thing to say: 'You can have corporate **rights** if you have the capacity to run your Aboriginal reserve, to own it and to utilise it'.

* Before the land **rights** zealots go out they are not only confused; they are bewildered and depressed.

* We make no apology for -the fact that we intend to put our alternative programme to the people of this country because it is not only idealistic but it is also in keeping with the programme which operates in other countries where there are indigenous people, if ever there was an occasion of anti-Australian statements it was the no land **rights** for Aborigines speech delivered on Australia Day by the Prime Minister.

* I am in contact with Aboriginal people, as are several of my colleagues here, and know that every Aboriginal organisation throughout Australia now feels that it is time to come together to achieve the objective of land **rights**.

* These are the same land **rights** which are given almost universally by other countries with responsibilities to indigenous people.

* The same **rights** have already been conceded under the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust Act 1966.

* Back in 1594 the Laws of the Indies were proclaimed giving **rights** to traditionally occupied lands.

* In Canada in 1763 there was the Proclamation of the Crown on Indian land **rights**.

* In New Zealand in 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi established the **rights** of Maoris to the full, exclusive and undisturbed possession of their land and estates, forests, fisheries and other properties.

* The Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders has decided by resolution to launch a national campaign urging the granting of Aboriginal land **rights** and, in particular, the granting of full title and **rights** to compensation with respect to all existing Aboriginal reserve land throughout Australia, and the provision of land for all Aboriginal individuals and groups seeking to live on, use and develop land in their traditionally occupied areas.

* They will never be able to do this until land **rights** are conceded to them.

* The Government will certainly do everything to maintain the **rights** of individuals to go about their business unmolested.

* I would like to say a few words about the complicated laws which exist in Australia at present and the difficulties encountered by individuals in endeavouring to understand them and exercise ' their own **rights**.

* I appreciate that there are people with legal training who can go into the courts and protect the interests of their clients in a legal action, but the system is getting out of hand somewhat inasmuch as the expense of undertaking legal action is getting beyond the means of certain indi-  and Property) Bill 
I think that when considering the other proposals of this legislation, such as referral to a full bench for deregistration, one only has to look at some of the disputes involving the Transport Workers Union of Australia and at the **rights** of the individuals in this matter.

* The article refers to  Mr Wran's  addressing shipbuilding unions and people in Newcastle and states: 
Then the Planning Committee went on to quote from the report of the Woodward Aboriginal Lands Rights Commission as follows: 
-The House will appreciate that the Labor Opposition has a very sincere, genuine and enduring interest in this question of Aboriginal land **rights**, since it was during the period of the Labor Government's administration that the first land **rights** legislation was introduced into this Parliament and the debate continued for a substantial period, notwithstanding opposition and frustrating delays that were prompted by the then Opposition.

* I am not talking about general legislative **rights**, I hasten to assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder).

* In respect of Aboriginal affairs and land **rights**, there is undoubtedly an antipathy towards the recommendations of the Woodward report on the part of dominant members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly.

* It seems to me that the legitimate interests of Aborigines will be protected if their traditional fishing **rights** are preserved and their right to the privacy of their land is clearly  recognised by the establishment of a buffer zone of sea which cannot legally be entered by commercial fishermen or holiday makers.

* We had evidence from anthropologists who stated that Aboriginals assert **rights** of ownership over the sea in the same way as they claim ownership over their land- through myth, ceremony and sacred objects.

* It will simply mean that, whilst the Aboriginal people will have **rights**, they will not have ownership of those 2 kilometres offshore.

* The Aboriginal communities will have to apply for their **rights** against the great weight of vested interests and the establishment.

* Let it be clearly understood that the honourable member for Perth, for one, is not prepared to uphold the principle that the Aboriginal people should have land **rights** in respect of those two kilometres off-shore.

* Finally, I believe that the recommendation which has been made to the effect that there should be a continuing committee will have the effect of pre-supposing the inability of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  to administer the land **rights** legislation.

* I believe it would be highly competent of him to do that in regard to land **rights**, as he has been doing recently in respect of alcohol and health problems affecting Aboriginal people.

* As announced on 7 December 1972 action in relation to applications for exploration licences over areas in Aboriginal reserves in the Northern Territory has been suspended pending the implementation of government policy of granting land **rights** to Aboriginals.

* Are the people ; the ordinary working people ; to be denied their **rights** because there is no form of price control for the benefit of the consumer today although there is rampant negative price control in Australia?

* That was bad enough, but in the writing of the lease there was an extension so that when it is necessary for the company to have extra facilities available it will have the **rights** to those facilities.

* I do not think that if we were to assert the paramountcy of Aboriginal **rights** to the land in this situation Nabalco would leave this afternoon or tomorrow or before its 42 years were up.

* This legislation is not about Aboriginal land **rights**.

* It is about miners' **rights**.

* I suppose that was one of the first instances in which Aboriginal land **rights** were claimed in a court.

* I think the time has come when we should say that Aboriginal **rights** to land are superior to the **rights** of miners to the use of that land.

* There is an increasing feeling by women that their aspirations and **rights** are being frustrated by the present political, economic and social structures of this country.

* I refer to the matter of public importance debated this afternoon about the Government's failure to protect the **rights** of the Aboriginal community at the Yarrabah reserve in Queensland.

* I am not endorsing one-armed bandits for Queensland; I am simply trying to point out that the **rights** that people have depend on which side of that non-existent invisible line they happen to live.

* The Queensland Premier always tries to latch onto the old slogan of States **rights**.

* But in any objective sense or analysis at all the levels of government the States have the least claim to any so-called **rights**.

* It is to those communities to which **rights** belong.

* However, the Queensland Government's record in acknowledging local government **rights** and a certain amount of local government autonomy would be, without a doubt, the worst in Australia's history.

* If the Queensland Premier waves the banner of States' **rights**, he must be prepared to accept responsibility for those **rights**.

* There was, of course, an opportunity for the Leader to speak in the Grievance Day debate this morning, if he chose to displace the **rights** of private members in that respect.

* ( 4 ) In exercising his **rights** under sub-section ( 3 ), an Aboriginal is not entitled knowingly to disregard any reasonable requirements of the lessee of the pastoral lease in connexion with the bore waters on the land.

* "(6) A person who, without just cause, proof of which lies upon the person, prevents or obstructs, or attempts to prevent or obstruct, an Aboriginal from exercising his **rights** under this section is guilty of an offence against this section punishable, upon conviction, by a fine not exceeding $ 1 ,000.

* The Opposition still feels the need, as it did at that time, to establish more definitely and more securely the **rights** of Aborigines to their traditional land.

* This is a reasonable concession to Aboriginal **rights**.

* There is no Godgiven infallibility to those people who put down roads or town plans that they have done it with full prior knowledge and consideration of Aboriginal **rights**.

* The Atomic Energy Act and its application to this question of land **rights** in the Northern Territory has been debated earlier this year.

* This document, which was signed by several hundred Czechoslovak citizens, was published widely in the Western press on 6-7 January 1977 and deals with the question of human **rights** and civil liberties in Czechoslovakia.

* Sections of the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe dealing with the protection of Human **rights** and with the principle of noninterference in other countries' affairs are set out below.

* VII on Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which clearly places an obligation on all signatories to promote and respect human **rights** and civil liberties in their respective countries.

* Sovereign equality, respect for the **rights** inherent in sovereignty 
The participating States will respect each other's sovereign equality and individuality as well as all the  **rights**  inherent in and encompassed by its sovereignty, including in particular the right of every State to juridical equality, to territorial integrity and to freedom and political independence.

* Within the framework of international law, all the participating States have equal **rights** and duties.

* They will likewise in all circumstances refrain from any other act of military, or of political, economic or other coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by another participating State of the **rights** inherent in its sovereignty ana thus to secure advantages of any kind.

* Respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief 
The participating States will respect human **rights** and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* They will promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other **rights** and freedoms all of which derive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his free and full development.

* The participating States on whose territory national minorities exist will respect the right of persons belonging to such minorities to equality before the law, will afford them the full opportunity for the actual enjoyment of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms and will, in this manner, protect their legitimate interests in this sphere.

* The participating States recognise the universal significance of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms, respect for which is an essential factor for the peace, justice and well-being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation among themselves as among all States.

* They will constantly respect these **rights** and freedoms in their mutual relations and will endeavour jointly and separately, including in co-operation with the United Nations, to promote universal and effective respect for them.

* They confirm the right of the individual to know and act upon his **rights** and duties in this field.

* In the field of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms, the participating States will act in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* The whole thrust of the Opposition 's case is based on the **rights** of the people in this country.

* This legislation means that those **rights** can be seriously interfered with.

* We do not think that people are entitled to have their **rights** interfered with unless there is a good and valid reason so to do.

* In this Bill there are all sorts of intrusions into people's **rights**.

* The matters raised in this Bill are matters of great concern to every citizen of this nation because they affect the basic legal **rights** of every man, woman and child in Australia.

* It is certainly far more expensive than a one-man centralist dictatorship, which is a very cheap form of government, but for the preservation of basic **rights** and for a country as widely diverse as Australia the Federal system in my judgment is the only system.

* In considering the question of recognition, just as for the question of representation at the United Nations, we must also pay regard to the status and **rights** of the people of Taiwan.

* Peking of course, denies' that the people of Taiwan and their Government have any independent status or **rights**.

* There is a lack of trust of the Arab nations and a hatred of the PLO and the tactics it has used, which have gone beyond what is normal warfare and a people's right to attempt to win back their **rights**, if that is what the Arabs think they are doing.

* They have the gall, the temerity, to talk that way about Israel- a country which has all the civil **rights** and freedoms that we have in Australia.

* The **rights** of minorities in these countries are virtually nonexistent.

* I mention particularly the **rights** of the Jews who live in Syria and Iraq.

* In Israel there was public debate about the **rights** of the Arabs.

* Some claimed that they were not getting the full **rights**, and maybe they were not; but there was a free debate at which the Prime Minister was on the podium and was cross-examined and attacked by Arabs.

* I preface my question to the Minister for Education by saying that the Minister will understand that among some schools there is some misunderstanding as to their **rights** in approaching the Schools Commission.

* Can the Minister inform the House of the **rights** of any given school in Australia in approaching the Schools Commission for benefits?

* In February 1969 Cabinet decided that the Commonwealth should legislate to assert total **rights** over the sea-bed outside the 3-mile limit, lt deputed the Minister for National Development to inform the States Mines Ministers of this decision.

* First of all, the then Minister was sent to negotiate and inform the States Mines Ministers that the Government intended to legislate to assert total **rights** over the seabed outside the 3-mile limit.

* Since then the Government has decided to legislate to assert total **rights** over the off-shore limits from the low water mark.

* Even in the Governor-General's Speech it is admitted that there was some dispute between the States over **rights** in respect of off-shore legislation.

* In his Speech on behalf of the Government, the Governor-General said: 
At present, the various State governments claim sovereign **rights** in respect of such resources from low water mark to the outer limits of the shelf.

* The Commonwealth believes that, except for internal waters as they existed at Federation, il has sovereign **rights** in this area.

* In order that this may happen, my Government will ask the Parliament to pass legislation to assert and establish what the Commonwealth concedes to be its legal **rights**.

* On 3rd March 1970 it was admitted that there were legal doubts and disputes between the State governments over the sovereign **rights** in respect of territorial waters.

* The main cause today of industrial disputes is failure to consult - management standing on the so-called sacred **rights** of managerial prerogatives and saying that the worker is nothing but a servant, that the manager is the master, that the old 18th century relationship between master and servant still survives and that no spiritual, temporal or any other power of the Parliament, unions or anybody else should interfere with this long-established but longoutmoded so-called right of managerial prerogatives.

* The failure of the Government to guarantee the basic human **rights** of Aboriginal Australians.

* -No individual should be deprived of his **rights** or his freedom in the terms in which they have been defined by a number of international charters and treaties and, in particular, as they were defined 30 years ago, on 10 December 1948, when the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and proclaimed the resolution which is now known as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* I would like to outline generally the history of the development of human **rights** over the last 40 years.

* I include the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman),  a very even-handed man, who has taken an approach on human **rights** in this chamber.

* We should not turn away from any opportunity to influence the leaders and people of a country that does not respect human **rights**.

* If by peaceful means, by complaint, by public identification, by criticism or by example we can break down the bigotry, prejudice or denial of human **rights** in another country, we must act accordingly.

* The events prior to and during the Second World War had a substantial influence on the awareness of and the respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms in the preparation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* The 26 signatories to the declaration of the United Nations made on 1 January 1942 expressed their commitment that complete victory over their enemies was essential to defend life, liberty, independence and religious freedom, and to preserve human **rights** and justice in their own lands as well as in other lands.

* The conclusions reached at Dumbarton Oaks included the belief that the United Nations should 'facilitate solutions of international economic, social and other humanitarian problems and should promote respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedom'.

* The Charter of the United Nations which was subsequently adopted refers to the problem of human **rights** in its preamble and in a number of Articles.

* For example, in the preamble the peoples of the member nations expressed their determination 'to reaffirm faith in fundamental human **rights** in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal **rights** of men and women and of nations large and small'.

* The objectives include the following: 
Universal respect for, and observance of, human **rights** and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.

* THE INTERNATIONAL BILL OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable **rights** of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, 
Whereas disregard and contempt for human **rights** have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, 
Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human **rights** should be protected by the rule of law, 
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Chaner reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human **rights**, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal **rights** of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human **rights** and fundamental freedoms, 
Whereas a common understanding of these **rights** and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, 
Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these **rights** and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

* All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and **rights**.

* Everyone is entitled to all the **rights** and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, binh or other status.

* Everyone has, the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental **rights** granted him by the constitution or by law.

* Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his **rights** and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.

* They are entitled to equal **rights** as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.

* Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural **rights** indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.

* Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human **rights** and fundamental freedoms.

* Everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the **rights** and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized.

* In the exercise of his **rights** and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the **rights** and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.

* These **rights** and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

* Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the **rights** and freedoms set forth herein.

* Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human **rights**'.

* It then proceeds to state in clear and unequivocal terms the **rights** which every member of the world society should enjoy.

* It is worthwhile quoting Article 1, which states: 
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and **rights**.

* The Declaration is not an international bill of **rights**.

* The decisions taken in 1947 and 1948 were not to spell out one international bill of **rights** but to have a number of instruments to define and state a bill of **rights** applicable to all nations, the first of which was the Universal Declaration of Rights.

* The other parts of the international bill of **rights** are the international covenant on economic, social and cultural **rights**, the international covenant on civil and political **rights** and the optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political **rights**.

* We have not yet ratified the covenant on civil and political **rights**.

* In the course of his address he stated: 
The question of human **rights** is too important a matter to be dealt with in terms of rhetoric and gesture; too important to be subordinated to political manoeuvre or made a matter of public relations.

* The Minister went on to say: 
The Government is conscious that we have not yet ratified the covenant on civil and political **rights**.

* This is a matter we hope to rectify- like most things, human **rights** begin at home.

* New legislation will shortly be introduced to give effect to the Government's election commitment to establish a human **rights** commission relating to Commonwealth laws.

* Briefly, those reasons are as follows: Firstly, the importance of human **rights** in the interrelationship of people throughout the world.

* Another example is in very close proximity, namely, the action of the New South Wales Government in continuing to close its eyes to the denial of basic human **rights** to Noel Latham of Broken Hill.

* A third reason is that the covenant is now becoming a litmus test for governmental sincerity over human **rights**.

* It is becoming evident that any government which does not ratify the covenant will have its credibility challenged if it seeks to make comment on the human **rights** issue in other countries.

* Since 1948 much has been done to implement the terms of the human **rights** covenant.

* For example, the International Conference on Human Rights at Teheran in 1968 substantially advanced the cause of human **rights** in the world.

* This was recognised at the twenty-third session of the General Assembly of the United Nations when it was resolved that the conference had made an important constructive contribution to the cause of human **rights** and that its results should be translated into effective action by all states, by the competent organs of the United Nations and by other relevant international agencies and instrumentalities.

* It is evident that many states still choose to ignore the terms of these human **rights** documents and to deprive their citizens of one or more of the basic human **rights** and freedoms to which all people are entitled.

* This Parliament has been engaged in the defence of human **rights** and the propagation of the belief in freedom and in **rights** for all people.

* For example, in October 1977 the sub-committee on human **rights** in the Soviet Union of the Parliament's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence widened its initial terms of reference to include the following:  .

* human **rights** in the Soviet Union bearing in mind Australia's support for the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the final act of the Helsinki Agreement.

* The sub-committee on human **rights** in the Soviet Union will shortly prepare a report on the subject of human **rights** in the USSR.

* Honourable members will recall that  Dr Pluysh  was a leading mathematician who was arrested for his human **rights** activities and for his efforts imprisoned for approximately four years in a psychiatric institution.

* Referring to the provisions of Chapter V of the Constitution of Kenya relating to the fundamental **rights** and freedoms of citizens and particularly Article 83 thereof which sets limits to derogations which may be brought into operation under the Preservation of Public Security Act; Section 3 of the Kenya National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act; the provisions of Articles 2(1) and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified by Kenya on 1 May 1972), and the provisions of Articles 9, 11(1) and 1 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
We in Australia can play a much greater role than we have in the past in ensuring that more nations subscribe to and practice human **rights**.

* I suggest that the House examine the determination relating to the parliamentary First Division officers in the light of its clear responsibility to assert once more the **rights**, the independence and something that we have been talking about a great deal- the dignity of the Parliament.

* Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to the realisation, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with organisations and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural **rights** indispensable to his dignity and to the free development of his personality.

* I normally agree with the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  on many matters involving civil **rights**.

* Perhaps he has entertained the Parliament a little but really he has insulted the judiciary of Australia and has suggested that the judiciary does not know the first thing about human **rights**, whereas I believe it is the fundamental protector of human **rights** in this nation.

* One relates to the deception of the Government in respect of Bills and issues such as human **rights**.

* On the fundamental position in regard to an area of appeal in relation to human **rights** the Government grandstands, gets the legislation through, makes a great song and dance about it, passes one Bill through both Houses, then proceeds not to proclaim it.

* And that this is an unfair imposition on the human **rights** of all people who wish to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

* A citizen has **rights** and privileges but surely he also has responsibilities.

* Many people in this country today speak about the **rights** and privileges of people but not enough people in Australia - I include many academics and clerics - speak about a person's responsibilities.

* If we talk too much about **rights** and privileges and not enough about what goes with them we tend to weaken the fibre of this nation.

* So when we talk of the **rights** and privileges of people such as Burchett we must also emphasise the responsibility of citizenship and service which they owe to the community.

* Is there any difficulty in the Commonwealth negotiating with adjacent countries on matters concerning the sea-bed and the continental shelf, when questions involving the **rights** of the Commonwealth and the States may be unresolved?

* Other speakers have outlined the justification for the production of the report on human **rights** in the Soviet Union and some of its findings.

* A major area in which the Soviet Union represses human **rights** concerns ethnic minorities.

* A further example of repression of human **rights** is the restriction on a citizen's intention to permanently move to another part of the Soviet Union.

* The West cannot ensure Soviet compliance with the human **rights** provisions of our report or of the Final Act of the Helsinki Agreement.

* Indeed, one of the key aspects of the Agreement is that, for the first time, good relations between nations are linked explicitly with observance of internationally agreed upon principles on human **rights**.

* One of the most notable international efforts to counter human **rights** violations in the Soviet Union has been the campaign against Soviet abuse of psychiatry for political purposes.

* The report makes several recommendations on what the West can do to secure improved human **rights** in the Soviet Union.

* Australia should insist that a regard for human **rights** be part of Australia's relationship with the Soviet Union.

* It should take the opportunities presented by bilateral discussions or negotiations between the two governments and cultural, academic and scientific exchanges between individuals to express its disapproval of Soviet breaches of human **rights** commitments.

* However, Australia's international position with regard to human **rights** will be much stronger once the Australian Government ratifies the international convenant on civil and political **rights** which it signed in 1973.

* The Soviet Union sometimes claims a lack of understanding in the West of its case on human **rights**.

* The Soviet Union of course is not the only offender regarding the violation of human **rights**; there are some other nations where attention needs to be directed.

* What the report highlights is that basic human **rights** of any kind at all are denied to anyone who dissents even slightly from the Soviet Government.

* I commend this report, as other speakers have done, to the reading of anyone who has just the remotest interest in human **rights**.

* I thought that as the member for the Northern Territory he might have been able to explain to us how it is that when the Opposition approaches the voting **rights** of those people who are entitled to a vote it says that their electorates should be gerrymandered, and when it comes to the voting entitlements of those people who are not entitled to vote it says they should not be able to vote at all.

* The Piltdown men opposite would tell us that, because a group of politicians amongst whom the Labor Movement was almost totally unrepresented, if not totally unrepresented, almost 80 years ago decided to devise a Constitution whose purpose would be to preserve the property **rights** of the wealthy citizens of that day, to withstand the scourge of the Peasants' 
The honourable member can leave it to my interpretation.

* We were all cautioned very much to be on our guard lest these malevolent characters interfered in the sa.-red things called 'State **rights**' and the '**rights** of voluntary bodies'.

* Every time we stand in this House and say that the Commonwealth should be doing more we have thrown in our faces the words: 'State **rights**'.

* There is no argument about the **rights** of the individual.

* I suppose it would be a daring thing for a Liberal Government ever to assert that any person has distinct **rights**.

* Private profit has **rights**, States have **rights**, but individuals do not have **rights**.

* As far as the education of handicapped children is concerned, there is no statement of **rights**.

* The thing that bothers me most is that nobody in Australia is settling down to look at the whole field of handicapped children, let alone the whole field of general welfare, and asking: 'What are **rights** of the people that we should be looking after?

* The usual Liberal reply is that these are State **rights** and never mind about individual **rights**.

* Indeed the more limited is the capacity the greater the need for that child's **rights** to be recognised by this Government, by a State government or by somebody - just so long as somebody does recognise it.

* Their **rights** arenot comparable with the right, of a normal child.

* It is all humbug to go on raising the matter of State **rights**.

* Why do spastic children not have at least the same **rights** as normal children enjoy?

* Once again, it is the country citizen who becomes the second class citizen because many of the advantages and many of the **rights** which the city handicapped ch id has the country handicapped child does not have.

* I would remind the Minister that Article  23(1)  of the United Nations Comvention on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory, reads: 
Parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of **rights** and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.

* They are, firstly, that full and proper recognition be given to the status and **rights** of a woman as wife and mother; secondly, that there should be full and proper protection of the wife and children in the event of the dissolution of a marriage; and, thirdly and lastly, but not least, that there is need for children to be reared and cared for by a present parent.

* I find in this Bill a code which will be common to all States of Australia and which takes pains to protect the **rights** of wives.

* At least one eloquent body on women's **rights**, the Women's Electoral Lobby- an organisation whose members are never slow to find themselves discriminated against- has now stated emphatically that discrimination does not exist in the Bill.

* The allegation frequently heard in this chamber, that after this Bill passes women will lose their **rights** to maintenance and will be forced to support themselves, is arrant nonsense and a total misrepresentation of the facts.

* I point out that a deal of simulated emotion on the **rights** of young people to vote does not really carry the argument forward.

* As part of the Commonwealth Parliament, we should promote changes in the law over which the Commonwealth has control to give these adults full **rights**, obligations, liabilities and responsibilities in matters such as the making of contracts and wills.

* Perhaps we should consider making the age of 18 the cut-off date and raise to 18 years the age limit in respect of certain **rights** such as the obtaining of a drivers licence.

* In other words, we should not be looking at this as a piecemeal matter and as something to pander to the demands which have been made strongly by a few in the community but we should say that 18 years of age is to be the age of adulthood and therefore 1 8-year-olds must accept all the **rights** of adulthood in Australia and all the responsibilities that go with being an Australian citizen.

* We do not want sympathy; we do not want anything other than our **rights** as  Her  Majesty's Opposition to express a point of view, and we intend to fight for these **rights** if we feel that we have been treated in an inadequate fashion.

* I hope that in the future he will do his job properly without seeing a necessity to buffoon and try to ridicule and belittle people, some of whom are perhaps not as adequately equipped as he is to stand up for their **rights** but simply are people sincerely trying to do a job which they have been sent by the people who have elected them to this Parliament to do.

* What worried me so much as a South Australian was that we had thought that the previous Liberal -Country League Premier of South Australia had succeeded in negotiating certain water **rights** for South Australia.

* We thought that he had negotiated and obtained greater water **rights** for South Australia from the yield of the River Murray.

* It is a constant debating point to suggest that in Australia there is a constitutional guarantee underpinning citizen **rights**.

* Basically, what we confront in Australia is the monarchical idea that all people are simply subjects and the **rights** that they obtain have to be deliberately conferred.

* In the United States, where ultimately the position of citizens will go to the Supreme Court if a citizen's **rights** are infringed, the whole" process of malapportionment has been brought under challenge and scrutiny.

* It is a pity that constitutional **rights** do not guarantee the equality of citizens in Australia.

* In Australia there is no guarantee of those **rights**.

* The need for further development of the Bretton Woods arrangements has long been recognised, and the most recent innovation has been the establishment of special drawing **rights** which, in themselves, offer some alternative to the United States dollar and gold as an international reserve asset.

* The primary purpose of this Bill is to modernise and make uniform, so far as concerns the mailand Territories of the Commonwealth and the premises of the Commonwealth wherever in Australia they may be, the law which protects the **rights** of the public against disorderly assemblies.

* Resort to disorderly assemblies and demonstrations, often in deliberate disregard of the **rights** of others, has made it necessary for this Parliament to review, so far as its own powers extend, the existing law of public order.

* But the **rights** we enjoy in a free society must be exercised with proper respect for the **rights** of others.

* I have drawn the amendment up and I put it to this House because I regard this matter so seriously and because I want to indicate how strongly I feel about the position of local government authorities which are entitled, I believe, to an obligation to receive specific and well defined funds in exchange for the realisation that the existing States have **rights** which must be preserved.

* That Australia joins with and supports the United States of America, France, Britain, the Netherlands and a significant and substantial committee of Polish dissidents in condemning the puppet trial in Prague of the Czech proponents of Charter 77, Vaclav Havel, Jiri Lederer, Ota Ornest and Frantisek Pavlicek and the further arrest of Pavel Kohout and the further secret police interrogation of former Czech Foreign Minister, Jiri Haiek and calls on the free world to support the campaign of those fighting for the restoration of human **rights** in Czechoslovakia.

* All of these things need to be clarified, but in clarifying them we should be guided by a basic concern about democratic **rights** and about civil liberties in our community.

* that there be certain **rights**, for example not to be subject to retrospective criminal offences, or the deprivation of basic procedural **rights**- which must remain inviolate whatever the character of the emergency.
