## Contexts in which the word "anzac" was used in the hofreps during the 1960s

* There were only eighteen working days in April, because Easter fell in that month, and because of the Anzac day holiday, but imports for the month, according to official figures, were worth 86,800,000.

* "Anzac", which was built at Williamstown, was laid down on 23rd September, 1946, and completed on 22nd March, 1951.

* Not on Anzac Day, not on Christmas Day, not on Easter Monday, but on May Day.

* Recently, after all these years, the Government gave him an Anzac medal but at the same time took from him his Glucodin which his doctor had been prescribing to treat his war caused injury.

* To try to do so in the week of Anzac Day seems to me to exceed what I would call a reasonable attitude.

* I have pleasure in telling them that the Government has decided to erect a second replica of this memorial on the flanking side of Anzac Parade in front of the Australian War Memorial.

* But the Belgian Government has seen fit this year to issue a medal to commemorate this occasion and has conferred it on all British troops who served in Belgium in 1914, 51 years after the event, and one year longer than the time that has elapsed on this occasion when we suggest that this Anzac Medal should be issued to the people who, in the first instance, were to have received it, but who did not receive it.

* If that reasoning is followed, it means that any man who takes part in an Anzac Day march and is photographed next to a man who may be a Communist - many Communists are returned soldiers - runs the risk of being labelled a Communist collaborator.

* With the advent of Anzac Day, it might be appropriate to make the comment, particularly with a Japanese trade delegation here, that the question arises as to who won the war and who lost the peace, especially when we find that the gentlemen who are coming along today are proposing something which very greatly resembles the greater South East Asia co-prosperity sphere.

* But in the short term, the period up until the end of 1971, by which time the British will have withdrawn from Malaysia and Singapore, we decided in September in principle that we would retain in the Malaysia-Singapore area two squadrons of Mirage aircraft, two naval ships and an Anzac battalion, and that we would participate in arrangements for the conduct of the jungle warfare school in Malaysia.

* The fleet comprises the aircraft carrier " Melbourne ", three Daring class destroyers, four Type 12 frigates, the " Anzac ", which is a Battle class destroyer used as a training ship, six coastal minesweepers and three submarines on loan from the Royal Navy.

* Recently I travelled to Papua and New Guinea to take part in the commemoration of Anzac Day.

* During this period, the stevedoring company kept close liaison with the shippers of all cargo, including the produce merchants, as to the effect of the delay and, since the following Monday was Anzac Day and no work would be performed, it was considered best in the over-all interest to sail " Wanaka " at 1.30 p.m. on Saturday and maintain her schedule.

* Within three months the fall of Singapore increased the number of Anzac prisoners of war to 20,000 men, and their sudden loss was due to policies of pitch and toss.

* As this area is part of the Camp Hill site I suggest that before members vote on this motion tonight or, if the vote is not taken tonight, tomorrow, they walk on to the front steps of this Parliament and look down on the view to the lake and up Anzac Parade.

* Anzac ", a destroyer which visited Malaya, Borneo, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Thailand.

* Also, Anzac Parade has been constructed and in the past four years we have been spending money on the National Library.

* For example, in my own electorate, the Miranda sub-branch of the Returned Service League has instituted a very worthwhile scheme whereby books and not floral wreaths are placed as tributes to the fallen on Anzac Day.

* A ceremony has been arranged at Anzac House, in Sydney, for next Wednesday morning, when  Mrs. Edmondson  will hand over the Victoria Cross to  Major McGrath,  the Director of the Australian War Memorial, and I express the hope that many people will find it possible to be present on so notable an occasion.

* The loss of holiday pay for Anzac Day was due to the actions of the Sydney branch of the federation.

* This firm had what has come to be known as the Anzac spirit - a spirit that was bold, vigorous, dynamic, cheeky and libertarian.

* It might consider completing the Commonwealth offices adjacent to Anzac Square to provide accommodation for many Commonwealth departments which are at present occupying rented premises.

* The honourable member should realise that the statement was released during a period of about 3 weeks when the House had adjourned for Easter and the Anzac ceremonies.

* I visited the New Zealand battery alongside our battalion in its encampment at Bien Hoa, and this unit joined together with us on the morning of Anzac Day in the most moving commemoration of that anniversary that I have ever attended.

* Does the right honorable gentleman agree that it is not beyond the capacity of statesmanship or his own abilities to phase out uneconomic producers over a period, to convert to other use the land involved, and to provide generous compensation, so clearing the way for an Anzac partnership in peace as in war?

* Anzac Day falls in a week or so.

* In September  1960  the destroyer " Tobruk " was holed by the destroyer " Anzac ".

* I have come to it because I envisage in this National Capital a national complex with the war museum and Anzac Parade in their present situation, with on Capital Hill a corresponding museum of peace and of peaceful achievements and an art gallery, and in the centre the National Parliament by the lake with the new National Library on its left-hand side and the new High Court buildings on its right.

* These are Christmas Day, Anzac Day and Good Friday.

* Anzac ".

* I recall one occasion when I visited the Territory as a member of a delegation to an Anzac Day ceremony.

* Yesterday, a small group of people, not representative of the Waterside Workers Federation or the executive of the federation, or of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, came to Canberra in order to make representations about the loss of holiday pay on Anzac Day this year.

* I am having a look at the matter-- 
The proposal submitted to the Committee involved the erection, at an estimated cost of $7m, of a 17-storey building on Commonwealth owned land in Anzac Square to provide office accommodation for various Commonwealth departments.

* As that is the date of Anzac Day, a number of requests have been received from ex-servicemen for the payment to be made on 24th April rather than 26th.

* 1  am happy to say that the first section of the Anzac memorial is on its way to Albany, where it is expected to arrive during the next few days.

* Finally - and this is of the utmost importance - it has been estimated that over 100,000 people could assemble in front of a new lakeside parliament house on great occasions such as Anzac Day, and a private area could be provided on the lakeside site of the building as at Westminster.

* I should like to inform the honorable gentleman that a considerable sum is being spent on Anzac Parade which we hope will be ready for the Anzac celebrations next year.

* The union and the Australian Council of Trade Unions did not raise the question of loss of holiday pay for Anzac Day, but the Opposition is now trying to create a ground upon which again the Communists within the Sydney branch of the federation- 
I regret that many of the recommendations of the Tariff Board have not been carried out.

* There is clearly a case for our establishing and operating an Anzac shipping line across the Tasman.

* For all of these reasons it has been decided that Australia would move suitably to commemorate Anzac but not in the form of a medal, which would be difficult to arrange under Royal Warrant.

* Everyone knows that it was just as silly for the Liberal Party to try to make out that if one marched in an Anzac Day procession with a former fellow soldier who happened to be a Communist one was dis.cribed as being a Communist.

* The name " Anzac '" is, 1 am sure, imperishably enshrined in the minds of the people of this country.

* It is my intention to spend Anzac Day with Australian servicemen in operational areas.

* I ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the fiftieth anniversary next year of Anzac and a proposed visit to Gallipoli by Australian veterans.

* He compared them with the Battle class destroyers, "Anzac" and "Tobruk".

* Will the Minister explain how he can agree to suspend the provisions of section 52a on the one hand while on the other hand insisting that the provisions of the Stevedoring Industry Act are mandatory in their application to payment for Anzac Day for Sydney waterside workers?

* Can he say why a prize-winning Australian documentary film called " Anzac ", although extensively advertised as the Australian feature of the Anzac programme at 10 p.m., was withdrawn from the Television Channel 7 programme in New South Wales at a late hour on Anzac night, and replaced by an old film called " Five Graves to Cairo "?

* Can he say whether this Australian feature was acclaimed as the best documentary on the Anzac campaign, was awarded a bronze medal for general excellence at the Melbourne Film Festival and was referred to by the television station as a film which was certain to be lodged with the Australian War Memorial as one of our historical records?

* The most noticeable work in the last 12 months has been the construction of Anzac .Parade which I think has added greatly to the display of the Memorial.

* It was at the landing at Anzac and played a proud part in both World War I. and World War II.

* So a lucky country such as Australia - one of the richest countries in the world according to standards of living - could perhaps carry on the Anzac tradition of self-discipline, self-sacrifice and service in another field just as noble and just as challenging.

* This is particularly manifest on, say, Anzac Day, but it is not so apparent on, say, Anniversary Day.

* I address a question to the Minister for Air concerning the participation of troops in Anzac Day parades.

* I understand that the Defence Committee ruled in 1946 or 1947 that contingents from the Navy, the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force should not take part in Anzac Day parades in capital cities.

* personnel participate in Anzac Day parades, as well as the Navy and the Army, which now provide uniformed contingents of serving personnel?

* Anzac ", which is used for seamanship training.

* I am sure he made the remark to which I shall refer in no spirit of vindictiveness, but the fact remains that he directed attention to the absence of Labour members from a meeting convened at Anzac House on, I think, 26th June.

* The Prime Minister sees only glory in Anzac.

* We have, of course, the great Anzac tradition.

* It is one of the finest equestrian statues in the world today, and now that it is to be erected in Anzac Avenue I am sure that we are all delighted.

* I offer the suggestion that a tablet should be placed on the base of the statutary, stating the various units of the Desert Mounted Corps, because to name only the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division would not make a complete record.

* I am perfectly sure that if members of the Corps cannot attend the unveiling, they will certainly make every effort to see it when it is erected in Anzac Parade.

* It will be remembered that in that letter I said we would sit for 4 weeks and then have 3 weeks recess, occasioned by Easter and Anzac Day in juxtaposition.

* I ask the Postmaster-General whether he will suggest very politely to the Australian Broadcasting Commission that special programmes on the national stations attacking Anzac Day and all that it stands for, and that slogans such as 'Let's Quench the Anzac Spirit' and 'The Anzac tradition is gory not glory' are resented very strongly by those who represent the servicemen who paid the supreme sacrifice so that such critics might have the freedom of speech that they have today.

* Will the PostmasterGeneral suggest also to the ABC that there are 363 days in the year other than Anzac Sunday and Anzac Day when such antiAustralian programmes can be put over by people who unfortunately and unnecessarily are suffering from a frustration complex?

* Australia has a proud Anzac tradition.

* Had it been hoped that these galleries would have been completed by the fiftieth anniversary of Anzac, due to occur next year?

* An additional public telephone is to be installed at the post office and also at the corner of Anzac and Cambria avenues.

* As we were told that this Bill is complementary to the one we have just discussed, I submit that I am in order in stating that I received the following letter yesterday from the organisation at Anzac House, Collins Street, Melbourne - 
My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

* If so, does he intend to follow in the footsteps of  President  Nixon by ending the present system in Australia and returning to an all volunteer system, thus preserving the spirit of ANZAC?

* I would like Parliament House to be on Capital Hill, with nothing to obstruct the view from it over the lake, up Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial.

* - "Melbourne", "Vampire", "Vendetta", "Voyager", "Anzac", "Tide Austral" (on loan to Admiralty), "Lachlan", (on loan to R.N.Z.N.

* They like to get out on Anzac Day, with their medals on and their chests thrown out.

* Is he aware also that the restoration of the clock and all work associated with it is to be completed by Anzac Day?

* Obviously, the 50th anniversary of Anzac is a very important occasion.

* Recently, we had the spectacle of the Government bringing members back from all over Australia for two days in the Anzac Day week.

* When one looks at Camp Hill from the other side of the lake - Anzac Parade - one sees that it is backgrounded by Capital Hill.

* But we look from this side of the lake up Anzac Parade to the War 
Australia has had the closest accommodation with New Zealand.

* At this time we are considering what might be done by way of a joint Anzac contribution to the future stability and defence of South East Asia.

* I was just about to say that probably every member of the Parliament has been the guest  speaker  at an Anzac Day service and has undoubtedly echoed the words: 'Lest we forget'.

* In view of his reply to me last year that the Government was not prepared to strike a special medal to mark the occasion in 1965 of the fiftieth anniversary of the Anzac landing at Gallipoli and his indication that the Government was considering alternative means of celebrating the occasion, will he state if any specific plans have now been made?

* Unfortunately, I cannot give the honorable member the assurance he desires because certain matters are at present under negotiation in relation to the Anzac range, but I can assure him that the welfare of the riflemen will be given every consideration.

* The holing of the "Tobruk" by the "Anzac" in September 1960 was caused by the malfunctioning of gunnery fire control equipment.

* His  father was an original Anzac who served in that campaign.

* Mr. Deputy Speaker, the 50th anniversary of Anzac will be commemorated on the 25th of next month.

* I saw 10,000 indigenes at an Anzac service.

* Gallipoli has a very special significance for Australia and the Commonwealth Government has provided substantial assistance for the current project sponsored by the Returned Soldiers' League for a visit to Gallipoli by a large party of Australian and New Zealand returned soldiers from two world wars, including a number of the original ANZAC contingent.

* Has the Commonwealth provided 20,000 as financial assistance for the Gallipoli pilgrimage on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Anzac in April 1965?

* Can the Minister for the Interior give the House any information on the re-erection of the Anzac memorial which formerly stood at Port Said, and which it is planned to place in Western Australia?

* In view of the significance of Anzac Day and the desire of exservicemen in receipt of war and service pensions for earlier payment, I shall see that arrangements are made for this payment on 24th April as suggested.

* In September I960,, the destroyer " Tobruk " was holed by the destroyer "Anzac"-.

* ' 
This matter has been considered recently by the Government, but it is felt that the issue of a medal to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Anzac Day would not be of a significance commensurate with the relatively large expenditure that would be involved.

* A rally of ex-servicemen was held in Anzac House, Sydney, on 26th June last and honorable members opposite who live in Sydney were conspicuous by their absence.

* The Diamantina is 23 and Tobruk and Anzac are 18 and 17 years old respectively.

* Anzac " holed H.M.A.S. "

* If we are to take the attitude that that is all they are doing, all the Anzac Day speeches and the pious platitudes that we hear are so much humbug.

* I tended to favour the lake at that time because I felt that it would have been quite a beautiful position, but I did feel that it would have lost the expansive view that we get from the present Parliament House when we go out on to the front steps here and look over Parkes Place across the lake to Anzac Avenue and the Australian War Memorial.

* and of the State Associations of Australia, and the British Commonwealth, to attend the 92nd Annual Prize Meeting  m  the renowned Anzac Rifle Range in the 106th year of the Association.

* The meeting will take place at the Anzac Rifle Range, Liverpool, from 29th September to 3rd October.

* Anzac Parade and up to Mount Ainslie would be cluttered up and spoilt.

* These men are dying at the rate of twenty a week in repatriation hospitals, in homes, in Anzac retreats and other places.

* As 25th April, 1965, will be the fiftieth anniversary of the events at Anzac, will the Government give special consideration to the striking of  a  special medal to commemorate the occasion?

* one stands at the War Memorial on the other side of the lake, one can gaze down Anzac Parade across the lake, up the magnificent vista of open lawns separating the War Memorial from the present Parliament House and look over the top of this building and see the top of Capital Hill.

* As I see it, the first item of general business tomorrow is the notice by the honorable member for Capricornia  (Mr. Gray)  that he intends to present a bill for an act to provide for the striking of an Anzac medal for members of the Australian Forces who served on the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915.

* By way of preface, 1 say that from time to time suggestions have been made that the Commonwealth should proceed with the issue of what was known as the Anzac Star, sometimes called the Gallipoli Star, to members of the Australian Forces who served at the landing or in the Gallipoli area during the year 1915.

* The country can drift into these things and the Government seems to be able to find the wherewithal to pay for them, but when Government supporters are challenged directly to take up certain and specific duties to people about whom they make wonderful speeches on Anzac Day, they find the cost is something which appals them.

* That is what everybody said about them at the time and it is what has been said about t hem ever since on Anzac Day.

* 131 Anzac Parade, 
I am sure that in saying that Stuart Howard was speaking for a good many people in this country.

* We have given away our national prestige and the things that we talk about on Anzac Day.

* If all goes well, I hope to introduce it shortly after the House resumes after the Anzac recess.

* Will the Government proceed with the completion of the Commonwealth Offices building adjacent to Anzac Square?

* My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence and is supplementary to a previous question about an Anzac Medal.

* When the Minister states that too long a time has elapsed to justify the issue of an Anzac medal, is he aware that the Government of Belgium has issued, 51 years after the event, a medal in connection with the defence of Antwerp and that British troops who took part in that campaign have been permitted to accept the medal?

* When the Minister states that the issue of an Anzac medal to Australians would be unfair to the troops of other nations who served on Gallipoli, does he consider that the action of France in awarding a Gallipoli medal to French troops is unfair to Australians who also served there?

* Poets have written much about the qualities of Australian soldiers.It was Ogilvie, a Scot, who wrote, in his poem, " The Anzac " - 
The latest report of the Repatriation Commission shows that between 1925 and 1940 about 134,000 World War I pensioners have ceased to receive pensions either because of death or cancellation of pensions.

* Tonight I will refer to the case of an Anzac who served on Gallipoli continuously for 5 months from about 12th May 1.915 until he was seriously wounded on 3rd October 1915.

* No doubt the Minister for the Army is aware that the Queen's Prize shoot, attended by over 3,000 riflemen who fired 140,000 well-aimed shots, has just concluded at the Anzac Rifle Range, Liverpool, New South Wales.

* Will the Minister give to the riflemen of New South Wales an assurance that the Anzac range will be preserved?

* Nevertheless, the honorable member for Maranoa and I feel that we arc expressing the wishes of all the Desert Mounted Corps associations in saying that although we have not changed our opinions we are proud to know that our memorial has been selected to represent the first Anzacs as a whole and has been re-erected in Australia at Albany, the point of departure of the first Anzac convoy of which, incidentally, I was a member, in the original 7th Battalion.

* On Anzac Day - a very hallowed and sacred day in the history of Australia - the 'Sydney Morning Herald', in a leading article, had this to say: 
I wish to speak on the provision in the estimates for the Department of Works of an amount of money for the re-erection of the Anzac Memorial, which was formerly erected at Port Said.

* Being the point of departure of the original Anzac contingent, Albany has a significance to the people of the two countries.

* The Government hopes that production of the medallion and lapel badge will be sufficiently advanced to permit at least some of them to be distributed by Anzac Day.

* The medallion, with the name of the recipient inscribed, will be issued to the surviving members of the Australian defence force that served on the Gallipoli Peninsula, or in direct support of the operations from close offshore, at any time during the period from the first Anzac day in April 1915 to the date of final evacuation in January 1916.

* It will be bordered on the lower half by a laurel wreath above the word ANZAC.

* Anzac Commemorative Medallion and Badge - Statement with respect to Conditions of Eligibility and Applications.

* I think that in 1946 the Defence Committee of the day did give instructions that participation by serving members of the armed forces in Anzac Day celebrations should be on a voluntary basis.

* Anzac Day is a public holiday for the services as it is for the public, and many members of the Royal Australian Air Force do participate on a voluntary basis in marches, as well as providing speakers and bands and fulfilling other requests.

* Is it a fact that members of the Australian Imperial Force who served at Anzac between 18th March, 1915, and 8th January, 1916, have never been given any medal or clasp to signify their services?

* Is he able to say whether English and all other allied servicemen and civilians who served at Anzac during this period have beenissued with a medal to signify their service?

* But to allow the two moves to be linked so blatantly has a mercenary smell - good enough for a Loan Council haggle in Canberra, but hardly a good postscript to the 50th anniversary of ANZAC.

* In reply to a question last year the Prime Minister indicated that the Government was not prepared to strike a special medal on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Anzac landing in 1965, but he did indicate that the Government was considering alternative means of celebrating the occasion.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that one of the streets to be renamed is the cherished and revered Anzac Parade, a memorial drive dedicated to Australians who have paid the supreme sacrifice in defence of this country, and the name of which has never been changed on the occasions when many other distinguished visitors, including  Her  Majesty the Queen, drove along it?

* Will the Prime Minister use whatever persuasive influence he might have with the New South Wales Government to see that the proud name of Anzac Parade is not altered either on next Saturday or on any other occasion?

* Referring to the Anzac Day issue, the honorable member for East Sydney used the expression " hostages ".

* That organization, not guided by, and not in consultation with, this Government, but acting as an independent authority, decided in its wisdom that in this instance those men who forfeited their attendance money on either 24th April or 26th April should not be paid for Anzac Day.

* 25th April - Anzac Day march in Melbourne.

* 28th April - Anzac Commemoration Service at Frankston.

* 21st September - Preliminary Grand Final, 
The Anzac Star, as it was originally known, was a bronze eight-pointed star with a circular centre inscribed " Gallipoli 1914-15" and with a crown above.

* Those who left after that date and served at Anzac were, rather absurdly, to be excluded from this award.

* At the time when the decision was being taken to issue the Anzac Star, what is known in the circles of those interested in this matter as the " unfair charge " was made.

* A good deal has been said about Anzac Day.

* Anzac Day is an occasion which is honoured by every section of the community.

* Our men who have gone overseas have been Australia's greatest ambassadors, yet the honourable member for Reid said: 'AH you glory in is Anzac'.

* We celebrate Anzac Day but on that day we do not glorify war.

* My opinion is the same as the opinion of the Government of the other half of Anzac - that is, the Government of New Zealand - whose troops are in Vietnam.

* Can the Prime Minister advise the House of the position in respect of the Anzac commemorative medal, the issue of which was announced by the Minister for Defence some time ago?

* I thought it stood for freedom of speech, freedom of association and the kind of speeches' honorable members opposite all make on Anzac Day, the kind of things the honorable member for Wimmera will say at Warracknabeal next Anzac Day - if he is invited.

* W. B. Tennent, whom we can perhaps classify as a fellow Anzac, since he comes from New Zealand.

* As it has been the custom for the Minister for Territories to arrange for a 'parliamentary delegation to visit Papua and New Guinea for the commemoration of Anzac Day, I ask him: As this year is the 50th anniversary of Anzac, has the Minister arranged a suitable delegation for this special occasion?

* I refer in particular to the siting of the new structure for the Bureau of Mineral Resources which, being in such close proximity to Anzac Way, is believed by many to mar that aspect of our development.

* Leaving out of consideration Christmas Day and the Easter period, in my opinion the three greatest days in our calendar are Australia Day, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.

* On Anzac Day some people even placed a notice on a Cenotaph stating that we should outlaw war and not glorify it.

* Anzac Day does not glorify war.

* We observe Anzac Day in order to give thanks for the men who were ready and willing to lay down their lives so that we may today, and for centuries to come, I hope, live in peaceful occupancy of this great free country.

* I know that interest in Anzac Day is dwindling.

* All I can say to him is that our future and even our present have been 'made possible only by the sacrifice of the men we honour on Anzac Day.

* The sacrifice of these men should be recognised on Anzac Day in greater measure than it is today.

* No one should say that Anzac Day is a day on which we glorify War.

* In every community in Australia people talked about the Anzac spirit.

* If the Anzac spirit meant anything it meant self-reliance; standing on your own feet; standing for yourself and protecting the country against everybody.

* With Anzac Day approaching, and the minds of exservicemen being directed towards an incident of such significance as the sinking of the "Emden" by the "Sydney", this is an appropriate opportunity for consideration to be given to the preservation of this mast.

* I refer to his announcement that repatriation pensions and allowances will be paid on the day before Anzac Day, and I ask whether it is necessary to make any special arrangements to cover the Easter period.

* "Tobruk" and " Anzac ", 2,400-ton ships, correspond with Battle class destroyers in the Royal Navy. "

* The Daring class vessels, from the point of view of endurance, though ten years newer than " Anzac " and " Tobruk " and 200 tons bigger, have only the same endurance and represent no advance at all in sea-keeping capacity. "

* Frankly, I had thought that the Anzac Memorial, as I think it was known, was a memorial to the First A.I.F.

* Then there was an incident involving the holing of " Tobruk " by " Anzac " in a throw-off shoot.

* As far as preserving the spirit of ANZAC is concerned, I would remind the honourable gentleman that during the 1939-45 war the Labor Party, which was then in Government, also found it necessary to use national service and conscription.

* I ask the Minister for the Navy to reconsider his decision and to do as Lord Nelson did, if necessary, and turn a blind eye to the members of the association who, on Anzac Day and other solemn occasions during the year, like to gather together behind their banner and march just as other ex-servicemen do.

* One sees the truth of this statement on such an occasion as the dawn service in Port Moresby on Anzac Day.

* These instances clearly establish precedents to justify a decision to issue now the Anzac Star.

* Even so, New Zealand must share with Australia the blame for not having issued an Anzac award.

* The  fiftieth anniversary of Anzac will be celebrated this year very widely throughout Australia.

* Special prominence will be given to the Anzacs in the marches through the cities on Anzac Day.

* Has the Minister considered a request from the Kogarah Returned Services League to have the 18th Light Anti-aircraft Regimental Band released from camp to play at the League's Anzac Day ceremonies, and, if so, what decision has the Minister reached?

* In fact before the drought started my district had 60 inches of rain from Anzac Day 1963 to 1st July 1964.

* It is a false argument to suggest that the new parliament house should be placed on the lakeside site, so that as the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Birrell)  suggested, on Anzac Day 100,000 people would be able to gather in front of it or be in its precincts.

* Surely in the planning of Canberra we have provided in front of the Australian War Memorial an area in which the people can gather on Anzac Day.

* Is it a fact that over 40 years ago the then Commonwealth Government and the State Government of Queensland came to an agreement whereby an Anzac Memorial Square was established in Brisbane?

* Is it possible for the frontage of the Anzac Square project to be completed by the 50th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli?

* In view of the facts that in 1965 Australia will celebrate the golden jubilee of the landing on Gallipoli and that the Government has permitted to be brought forward from the General Business section of the notice paper two items which were lower in order than the private member's bill which I had listed with a view to securing the award of an Anzac medal, will the Prime Minister inform the House whether he favours the granting of such a medal on the occasion of this jubilee?

* That no penalty is paid on Public Holidays, i.e., Xmas Day, Boxing Day, New Years Day, Labour Day, Anzac Day, etc.

* Melbourne " is in dock and the submarine has gone, but we still have " Anzac " and " Vendetta ".

* As I think I have mentioned to the honourable member on more than one occasion, the Army has a requirement at the Long Bay Rifle Range, especially since increased training requirements at Holsworthy are involving the closure of the Anzac Rifle Range there.

* If we continue along the track that we have been treading, I suggest that next Anzac Day we think about the 60,000 men in one war, and the 30,000 in another, who made the supreme sacrifice so that we could remain free, and then we ask ourselves whether, as politicians, we are not just tossing away day after day the very principles for which those fellows died.

* The Anzac Square scheme in Brisbane was originated very many years ago - 1 think at the end of the First World War.

* A committee representative of the Queensland Government, the Brisbane City Council and the Commonwealth Government agreed to build Anzac Square as a State war memorial.

* I trust that when the Commonwealth building is constructed on the site bounded by Ann Street and Creek Street and adjoining Anzac Square, everything will be done to preserve the symmetry of the square.

* "Anzac" have special complements in the training role.

* The suitability or otherwise of such a Programme for Anzac Day, which fell on the Sunday, was being considered by A.B.C.

* I am aware that there is to be an unveiling of the Desert Mounted Corps memorial on 19th April at Anzac Parade, Canberra.

* The memorial was found to be unfit to use so the Governments paid for the redesigning of the memorial so that one could be erected in Albany, Western Australia, and the other in Anzac Parade, Canberra.

* A number of honourable members have more than a passing interest in this matter and I know that they will welcome the decision to support the additions to the present offices in Anzac Square, Brisbane.

* Is it a fact that waterfront, employment proceeded normally on Wednesday, 24th April, the day preceding Anzac Day, and on 26th April, the day following Anzac Day?

* If so, what explanation has the Minister to offer for the highly provocative action of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in refusing pay for the recent Anzac Day holiday to thousands of waterside workers, of whom from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, are ex-servicemen?

* The first was to play bowls, and the second was to lay a wreath on the cenotaph at Broken Hill on Anzac Day in memory of those who had -made the supreme sacrifice for their country.

* They arrived -back -at Mascot about midnight -on Monday, Anzac Day, :25th April, and then had  to  -take -the bus :back to Wallsend.

* I see from my notes that the destroyers " Anzac " and " Tobruk " engaged in mortal combat there. "

* Tobruk " was hit by a practice projectile from its sister ship, " Anzac ", and had to be put in dry dock.

* the Government says, " We have the pentropic force, we have "Anzac", which holed another Navy vessel, and we have this and we have that".

* As late as October, 1957, the Minister for the Army  (Mr. Cramer),  when presenting prizes at Anzac rifle range, Sydney, said, amongst other things - 
I agree, but the statement was made by the Minister for the Army.

* This week, the meeting is being held on the Anzac range at Liverpool to celebrate the centenary of the clubs from 1860 to 1960.

* In 1919 the State and Commonwealth governments and the Brisbane City Council came to an agreement whereby Anzac Square was to be developed and a war memorial was to be provided.

* I hope, too, that architecturally the construction will1 retain ihe integrity of Anzac Square.

* The Commonwealth must show that it has the willingness and the capacity to keep pace with the good work that has been done by the State Government in relation to its part of the Anzac Square arrangement that was mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane.

* The waterside workers have certain closed days each year - such as Anzac Day, Christmas Day, Good Friday, Labour Day and picnic day, on which they cannot be picked up - but on the other holidays they can be required to work.

* Only a couple of days ago the annual Anzac Day ceremony was carried out at the Australian War Memorial, and the newly completed Anzac Parade, along which one looks from the War Memorial to Parliament House, was used for that ceremony.

* Although most of us have been back in Canberra a matter of hours only and were not privileged to take part in the Anzac Day ceremony here, we have heard the remarks of many residents that the ceremony was greatly enhanced by lae use of the newly developed Anzac Parade.

* This is the vista 1 should like to see from a new parliament house: A lovely stretch of water reminding us that we owe our physical origin as human beings to the sea - itself created by a beneficent God - and then the stately lines of Anzac Parade leading to the National War Memorial to remind us of the debt we owe, and will always owe, to those who have made it possible for us to sit in a democratic parliament and to make dispassionate decisions such as we are doing at the moment.

* And if the mists sometimes swirl from the lake and obscure for a moment the view up Anzac Parade, let it but remind us that even the wisest men can lose for a time their sense of obligation to the needs of their fellow men, both young and old, without which there can be no real democratic government.

* After all, the name " Anzac " is not unknown, and it typifies defence cooperation between Australia and New Zealand.

* For example, it would be a good thing if the visit of the New Zealand Prime Minister to Australia in the coming week were made the occasion of the issue of the Anzac medal, about which we have talked for a long time.

* He was a popular speaker at Anzac Day ceremonies and at other functions.

* I was impressed by his recollection of something that he saw in Anzac Cove at a spot where the cliff jutted out.

* On that cross was a placard bearing the words - 
George Bowden referred to those words at Anzac Day ceremonies.

* Is the Minister aware that more than 2,000 exservicemen are engaged as members of the Waterside Workers Federation on the Sydney waterfront and that that core is claimed to be the main component of the discontent in Sydney arising out of the non payment of the award public holiday entitlement for Anzac Day this year?

* Is the Minister aware also that industrial trouble occurred on the Sydney waterfront on 23rd April, that there were no stoppages on the 24th or 26th April, but that because of the stoppage on 23rd April the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, within its powers under section 52a of the act, cancelled the public holiday entitlement of the waterside workers for Anzac Day?

* The Government has received a number of suggestions for the observance of the jubilee of Anzac, and has taken decisions on some of these suggestions.

* At the request of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, the 
Government decided last November to mark the jubilee of Anzac by the inauguration of a ceremonial way in Canberra from a point near Lake Burley Griffin to the Australian National War Memorial.

* The Government has also authorized the Australian News and Information Bureau to make a documentary film to show how the spirit of Anzac has influenced the nation over the last fifty years.

* Should the Government decide that the jubilee of Anzac should be celebrated in any additional fashion, appropriate announcements will be made when the decisions have been taken.

* I should like to interpolate here that in making these statements I am very mindful of what members of Parliament, including myself, said last Anzac Day.

* It is all very well for parliamentarians to espouse great ideals and strike attitudes on Anzac Day, and talk about the glories of the people who made sacrifices in war and of the sacrifice borne by those they left; but the only worthwhile and practical way to put all these high-sounding sentiments into practice is to do the decent thing by people who are in receipt of, or should be in receipt of, repatriation benefits.

* Unfortunately, when next Anzac Day comes around, I will have to face the war widows in my electorate with the knowledge that nothing has been provided for them in that respect.

* We have to look pretty hard at the position of those people - and you have to look the people themselves in the face when they come to you and ask, " How can you say the things you say on Anzac Day, yet do this miserable thing to us now? "

* The programme listed by Station ATN in its advance programme schedules for presentation on Anzac night was " Five Graves to Cairo " and this programme was presented as scheduled.

* I have been informed that station ATN did endeavour to purchase a filmed programme " Anzac " but was unsuccessful in obtaining the film.

* I understand that the film " Anzac " won an award at the Melbourne Film Festival in 1960.

* The honorable member will know that because of further developments in the Holsworthy area the Anzac rifle range will ultimately, and in the not too distant future, have to be closed.

* Indeed, negotiations have been, and are being, conducted with the National Rifle Association for some improvement in the facilities of the range so that it will probably be able to cater for the needs of the Association once the Association will not be able to use the Anzac rifle range.

* We speak of the spirit of Anzac and the great brotherhood of the servicemen.

* In political terms, the presence of Anzac forces in the two Commonwealth countries provides a guarantee to the governments and the people of both countries that they have not.

* Let us come now to the latest dispute - the Anzac Day dispute.

* There were 32 men involved in this dispute over hostages, which occurred in the period preceding the Anzac Day holiday.

* The next day was Anzac Day, which is a no-work day generally, except that some men are provided by the union for the loading and discharging of passengers' luggage, for which they are paid two and a half times the normal rate.

* The men who stand off on Anzac Day, which is regarded generally as a public holiday, are paid on the basis of what is called a six-hour minimum.

* On the Friday following Anzac Day the port again worked normally.

* Here we have the condition, which is accepted in every other industry in Australia, that where the men work normally on the day preceding Anzac Day and on the day following it they shall be paid for the holiday.

* The men still lose the four days' attendance money, but, according to the decision of the authority, they are to be doubly penalized by the loss of pay for the Anzac Day holiday.

* If the men were paid for Anzac Day, as they should be, they would get 3 9s.

* It is a double penalty and, of all holidays, it involved Anzac Day.

* If anybody in this country is entitled to the Anzac Day holiday, surely it is the men who served in World Wars I. and II.!

* Had there been no provision for the substitution of the loss of attendance money in lieu of suspension and had these men worked normally the day before and the day after Anzac Day, they would automatically have received their pay for the Anzac Day holiday.

* The Government must rectify this matter and see that these men on the waterfront are paid for the Anzac Day holiday.

* Does not the Minister think that he has got himself into an intolerable position in relation to the question of payment for work on Anzac Day on the waterfront?

* What answer has he given to  Mr. Yeo,  of the Returned Servicemen's League in Sydney, relative to his strong letter saying that Anzac Day should be paid for in any industry?

* The Minister has told us to-day that he is utterly powerless, and I believe that is so, but the people will expect him to do something about this question of the payment of wharfies for work on Anzac Day.

* It is strange that these old diggers parading through the streets on Anzac Day have no special decoration to show that they participated in that campaign.

* The Gallipoli Legion of Anzacs suggests that if the proposal is agreed to, any Anzac who wants a medal, or rosette, whatever might be decided upon, should apply to the Services Board for it.

* The fourth notice is of a motion by the honorable member for Capricornia  (Mr. Gray)  concerning the issue of an Anzac medal to Gallipoli veterans.

* I recall the attitude of  a  man whom I named in this Parliament - a very senior officer in the Air Force - who refused permission for a charter aircraft to take off from Williamtown aerodrome to take members of the Wallsend bowlers' club, known as the " Wallsend Flying Bowlers " to Broken Hill on Anzac week-end, 1960.

* Epstein had taken him as a model of the spirit of Anzac.

* I believe that the three greatest days in Australia, leaving aside Christmas Day and the Easter period, are Australia Day, Anzac Day and Remembrance Day.

* If it had not been for the circumstances that brought about our observance of Anzac Day, and the spirit of Anzac in this country and throughout the world, we would not have an Australia Day and certainly not a Remembrance Day.

* But we must be glad we have aggressive instincts and use them constructively, not destructively, and the mistaken ideal of Anzac will gradually die away.

* The importance of Anzac Day is gradually diminishing.

* Now the afternoon of Anzac Day, it has been decided, will be devoted *.o sport.

* I noticed during the last 
Anzac Day that some places are holding the dawn service only and leaving the rest of the day open so that people can get away for their sport and good times.

* Therefore, there must be a fresh awakening in the spirit of Anzac in this country.

* The spirit of Anzac is essential.

* The true Australian like the pioneers and like the Anzac spirit, I believe, will lead this country on to greater and greater nationhood.

* They will see the "Anzac" and the "Tobruk", too.

* I refer to the practice of sending delegates from the Parliament to Anzac Day ceremonies in Papua and New Guinea and I ask the Prime Minister: Is it correct that a present member of this Parliament was at the actual landing at Gallipoli?

* Will the Prime Minister consider sending  Senator Sandford  to join the Anzac pilgrimage to Gallipoli as a representative of the Commonwealth Parliament on the 50th anniversary of Anzac.

* The Desert Mounted Corps was composed of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division.

* Unfortunately, the medallion will not be available for the coming Anzac Day but I would hope that it would appear shortly after.
