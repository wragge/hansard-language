## Contexts in which the word "crisis" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* It would, in my respectful opinion (and in this I am expressing the majority view among reputable lawyers in this State), have been nothing short of a calamity if during the very great constitutional **crisis**, New South Wales had possessed a Governor who had subordinated the constitutional authority of a Governor to the purely opportunist demands of those who found the constitutional restrictions irksome.

* Inflation around the world is a difficult problem and available figures for most countries have not yet registered the impact of the higher oil prices resulting from the energy **crisis**.

* The mineral boom, a downturn in our population growth, the energy **crisis**, rapid inflation, a wages explosion, import competition from newly industrialised countries, particularly in Asia, and the world recession altered the equation of past success.

* More than any other single issue it was the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party that caused the health cost **crisis**.

* Government supporters have spoken only with regret and apologies about this Bill and no wonder because, despite the **crisis** facing rural industries in Australia, the Government has not been able to bring forward legislation which can seriously tackle the problem.

* The recovery would be stimulated also by the improvement in consumer confidence consequent upon the resolution of the constitutional **crisis**, the impact of easy money and lower interest rates and the flow on of high levels of activity in housing to consumer expenditure on associated items.

* At present the 2 major **crisis** cities are Sydney and Melbourne.

* At present there is a world energy **crisis**, of which all members of this House are aware.

* Their present predicament is just as serious and challenging as was any **crisis** in the last war when huge sacrifices and countless billions of dollars were spent to bring it to an end.

* As members of this House recognise and realise not only Australia but the whole of the world is going through a fuel and energy **crisis** and if the aircraft that are being acquired by Qantas, TAA and Ansett have a higher carrying capacity it should be possible for fewer trips to be made or fewer schedules to be operated as between say, the major capital cities- Melbourne to Brisbane, Melbourne to Sydney, Sydney to Melbourne and so on.

* Freights between here and overseas have also increased, in the main because of the oil **crisis** and other costs.

* At present there is no overall energy **crisis** or shortage in the eastern States.

* I refer to the fact that there is a world energy **crisis** looming.

* Constant speculation by the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  on some great **crisis** forming to make it necessary for them to knock back the Budget is just so much hogwash.

* The men and women of the defence servicesthe Navy, the Army and the Air Forcewho whether on duty or off duty responded bravely to the **crisis** and displayed outstanding heroism in bringing practical assistance to their fellow Darwin citizens.

* This is the greatest **crisis** that has ever been experienced in this industry.

* Few people in this country could afford the cost of that sort of **crisis** if it occurred to them.

* I am sure that the honourable member for Moreton and the other honourable gentlemen who sit opposite do not believe that the commander of an Australian force should be there by a convention but believe that his position should be there by a statute of this Parliament in which his powers are laid out by the elected representatives of the Australian people so that in the event of a **crisis** he may thoroughly command the Australian forces.

* As was pointed out by honourable members from both sides of the House just recently, the wine industry faces a real **crisis** next year, with the next vintage.

* At present the only part of the meat industry where reasonable prices prevail is in the pig meat industry, but for all parts of the Australian meat industry there is emerging a **crisis** which needs to be recognised by all members of the Australian community.

* **Crisis**, chaos, industrial anarchy, communists, fascists, centralists, spendthrifts, misers and a host of other phrases roll glibly off the tongues of these men as they continue on the same path of dividing the nation in Opposition as they did for 23 years in Government.

* It may well be justified or alternatively running itself into a major **crisis**.

* Already the wool industry has reached a **crisis** point with costs threatening to swamp the already minute margin between costs and prices.

* The special savings bonds introduced by the Treasury which attracted subscriptions to 10 February of $565.2m have caused a very great **crisis** because of the very high rate of interest which they carry.

* It is perhaps the most extraordinary quirk of history that the socialists in our midst- that group of people which theoretically maintains the highest standards and regards all others only as the flotsam and jetsam of society- demonstrated in that very real situation, as distinct from the morass of innuendo and half truths which we normally hear from them, how they failed utterly to face a real **crisis**.

* Fortunately during these **crisis** years there were Premiers like the honourable Joh Bjelke-Petersen from Queensland who were aware that the Labor Administration was catapulting us into the bottomless pit of disaster.

* He was a chief negotiator of the Korean truce and in 1956 his hand guided the super powers towards the peace that followed the Suez **crisis**.

* On the contrary, a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of welfare assistance rather than viable support to take growers over the hump of any particular **crisis**.

* Or is the **crisis** due to the Fraser Government-promoted stagnation in another way?

* The **crisis** which is facing Queensland at the present time is the worst it has known.

* This situation is creating a very serious **crisis** in non-government schools, but these distress letters that we get, whether they are from Catholic, Anglican or any other type of school, invariably come from the State of New South Wales because the State of New South Wales, which has had a long term Liberal Government, acknowledges no obligation towards them.

* However, while costs continue to rise and profits to fall, it is the cost-price squeeze essentially which is causing the **crisis** facing the rural sector.

* By his statements during the first **crisis** involving the now discredited Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  he has caused division.

* It is no exaggeration to say that the blame for the accelerating inflation and the **crisis** that exists in this country lies directly at the feet of the Prime Minister and the members of the Labor Party, only five of whom are present even to sit in on this debate.

* It is important that the people of Australia recognise that it is absolutely vital that this matter should be considered in the context of the **crisis** of confidence which has emerged from the actions of the Government in respect of the dismissals of the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  and the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr Connor);  the refusal of the Government to answer questions in this House about the loan-raising activities; and the refusal of the Government to tell us the circumstances of the involvement of the Reserve Bank of Australia in these loan-raising negotiations.

* It is extraordinary to think that we had to wait for three days of parliamentary sittings before we could hear about it because there was certainly an international **crisis** to the north.

* I notice that in all the speeches that have been made by the new members and by the older members, no reference has been made to the constitutional **crisis** and the role of the Governor-General.

* One would have thought that at some time in this debate tonight we would have at least had some discussion on the **crisis** in primary industry and the steps which this Government intends to take in the future to alleviate the problems, but all that we have heard about, as has been usual in the last few weeks, is buck passing and waiting until the industries of Australia come to this Government with some plan.

* I believe this is most important for the morale of the Services in the light of the present serious **crisis** in recruitment and manning.

* We have been talking about an energy **crisis**.

* Firstly, there was the matter of the Commonwealth Public Service, its pay and conditions; secondly, the **crisis** in primary industry; thirdly, the malnutrition among Aboriginals exposed by the Australian Medical Journal; fourthly, the rising interest rates as they affect home builders in particular; fifthly, the denial and delay of entry permits for New Guinea academics - and this is still continuing today, as we found out during question time; sixthly, the rise in urban land prices; and finally, the rein traduction of a waiting period for war service homes.

* I mention Sydney and Melbourne because this is where the **crisis** exists now.

* We ran into some trouble in 1961 through applying the brakes too hard but I remind the honourable member for Lalor, who was critical of the Government's handling of economics and finance, that no less an authority than the 'London Financial Times' praised Australia for the way it handled its financial **crisis**.

* It demonstrates the degree to which the American Government took note of the statements and the damaging effects which these statements by 3 senior Ministers had on our relationships with the United States, a country which came to the rescue of this country in its gravest moment of **crisis**.

* It is not the sort of welfare initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of welfare initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and women who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that nature because of some sort of **crisis** that has occurred in their life.

* For these reasons this Government stands condemned on the **crisis** it has created within the Australian housing industry.

* As I see the situation, it is one of **crisis** in the cattle industry today.

* There was a world economic **crisis** during 1974 and 1975.

* To my mind the unfortunate feature of this legislation is that it is directed against a section of society which, if it has not already been proved, will be shown by history to have displayed to the nation during the Vietnam **crisis** the deepest sense of nationalism that any Australians have ever before displayed.

* The Government has been concerned about the future of this industry for quite a considerable time, and its concern goes far beyond the **crisis** that we have seen in recent times.

* But this is a fundamental issue and it is of growing importance because in the world today we face a **crisis** in hydrocarbons and we in Australia have many problems to solve.

* What bare faced impertinence, what gall for a Government to give such advice to people facing the gravest financial **crisis** in the history of their industry.

* This means that in the next 12 months there will be substantially more container vessels carrying cargoes than there have been in the last 12 months, In all these circumstances and in view of the **crisis** in the Australian wool industry I think it is regrettable that an added impost should now be demanded of Australian wool growers.

* The recent oil **crisis** and the other things that have happened in the world have all made the task of economic management extremely complicated and highly complex.

* At the moment we have an economic **crisis** which we inherited from our predecessor.

* I hope that by this time next year the States will recognise that if they do not come to the party and really co-operate with the capital costs of nongovernment schools we will reach the **crisis** which the honourable member for Lilley predicted and within the next few years we will not have the availability of educational facilities in the nongovernment school sector which this country, in my opinion, should be committed to retain.

* Our Government for the first time responded to the **crisis** situation in many rural areas and among many self-employed people.

* This is a further example of the Government's complete disregard of the Australian shipbuilding industry which, at the moment, is going through a **crisis** in respect of continuity of employment in the shipyards.

* I indicated that at least this was consistent with a tradition which was less than commendable of antiLabor goverments - the 1913 Cook Government, the 1923 to 1928 period under the Bruce-Page Government and the 1938 period under the Lyons Government - which gave pledges to the public that people had rights in retirement and in certain situations of **crisis** need, and that the only way to overcome or to satisfy these needs was through a contributory system of social insurance.

* Nothing you can do with the figures can hide the fact that we are in an inflationary **crisis**.

* I know that all honourable members will join me in a tribute to the natural disaster organisation for its handling of the Darwin **crisis**, and to the Darwin people themselves for their fortitude and undaunted spirit.

* I do not believe that we could ever be fierce enough in the defence of our freedoms and of the standards which we require to ensure that the systems of authority within our community are answerable; even at times of **crisis**, they can be made accountable.

* There are some fundamental causes for that, including slower population growth, the energy **crisis** and other factors.

* I would have appreciated it if he had told the Parliament in his speech, which immediately preceded mine, that, after  Mr Menzies-  he was not then  Sir Robertthe  Prime Minister of Australia had been given the important task by the British Government of negotiating with  Colonel Nasser  following the Suez Canal **crisis**, he came back to this Parliament or he had printed in a book that in Egypt  Colonel Nasser-  the honourable member for Bradfield served as a diplomat in Egypt and would be more aware of this fact than any member of the House, but withheld it from his speech- was virtually in charge of a police state.

* Unfortunately, the States have been under increasing pressure to provide sufficient hospital beds, and they have been so preoccupied with trying to keep up the supply of **crisis** medical facilities that they have not had the courage, shall we say, to divert or they have not been willing to take the risk of diverting some of those funds into the preventive, rehabilitative and educational sides of medicine which this new program will implement.

* While I was there in the anteroom, waiting upon the Governor-General and the then Prime Minister who were having discussions, the GovernorGeneral 's private secretary,  Mr David  Smith, said in conversation to me that they already had a plan to solve the constitutional **crisis**.

* In view of the energy **crisis** and the continuation of the increase in the price of fuel, will the Minister undertake, immediately and urgently, a study to determine the effects of emission controls over the last few years, not just the stage proposed for next year, and report to the Parliament and to the nation?

* The Labor Party has brought this matter of urgency before the Parliament as early as possible because, notwithstanding the fact that we all know that our Government has communicated with the governments of Pakistan and India, the Labor Party felt that members on both sides of this House would seek to identify themselves with the views already expressed by the Government in the way in which on previous occasions they have sought to identify themselves with the Government in some international **crisis**.

* A few moments ago, the honourable member for Macarthur  (Mr Kerin)  mentioned the assessment made by the Development Aid Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as to the cost to lesser developed countries of currency changes and the general impact of the present energy **crisis** and the figure he quoted I think was $10m, presumably American dollars.

This of course is a means to try to stop me from getting the true message across to the wheat growers of this country, and it is typical of the almost dreadful tactics of the Opposition to try to cloud the issue confronting the great wheat industry of Australia.

* We feel that we could make a far more useful contribution to this debate if the Government were not so secretive about these things and if we knew of the real **crisis** confronting Australia's manufacturing industries.

* But if highlanders are to vote for what they think is in their best interests - and they are entitled to think that - but say that self-government will not be given to other areas until they are ready for it, then the Government has a real **crisis** on its hands.

* Thus in 1971 a backbencher was able to claim that during his 2 years in Parliament there had been no full scale debate on urban development, pollution, conservation, education, road safety, transport, social services, the rural **crisis**, tariffs or immigration.

* The oil **crisis** remains basically unresolved and the industrialised nations of the Western world face a further massive dose of cost-price inflation in the coming months.

* Listening to the speeches of honourable members one would imagine that not a single person got a visa in the **crisis** at Damascus.

* The Ministry of 24 members could be brought here to form a quorum and to carry legislation which may have some bearing on the constitutional **crisis**.

* The policy of this Government became 'All the way with LBJ' and Australia found that it was committed because it was felt that in a time of **crisis** the United States of America might come to our aid.

* They are tired of a government that gets its policies from the gallup poll; that reacts to every test of leadership and statesmanship by playing on every prejudice and fear lying dormant in the community; that acts in every national or international **crisis** only in terms of the political advantage it can squeeze out of it - whether it be China, South Africa, Bangladesh or French nuclear tests, or whether it be poverty, industrial relations, racism or rural depression.

* Finally, how would he feel about the recruitment of the ineffectual member for Barker,  Dr Forbes,  who failed abjectly to sustain his rural electorate during the rural **crisis**?

* It is the Government's firm view that there needs to be a continuation of support to help fruit growers in what is quite a critical economic **crisis**.

* There will be a new energy **crisis**.

* There is a world fuel and energy **crisis** developing, particularly in the developed countries of the world.

* I predict- others who are better informed on the energy **crisis** will appreciatethat the two modes of transportation which will come back in a very big way in this country towards the end of this century and certainly in the twenty-first century are sea transport and rail transport.

* With regard to the Government's very sorry record in relation to the Lebanese **crisis** the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  and myself have raised issues repeatedly in this place concerning the Government's inaction, its deception of the Lebanese community in Australia and its failure to assist the passage of an adequate number of refugees from this sorry nation to Australia.

* Vacillation is the order of the day in regard to the **crisis** of our times.

* At various times, sometimes on small matters and sometimes on matters of **crisis**, the Government has said emphatically to the Parliament of the nation: 'This is urgent.

* This has been possibly drawn up by economists, but the Australian Labor Party's point of view is that if bad policies have caused the present **crisis** the Federal Government must accept responsibility.

* The regrettable thing is that despite the magnitude of the **crisis** at this point of time there is every indication that it will deteriorate even further because, despite the aid which has been provided by this and other countries- 
There has been a tremendous increase in trade.

* Since then we have had an energy **crisis**.

* The terms of reference for the subcommittee were: 'The significance of the domestic **crisis** in Lebanon for the fragile Middle East situation and the possible international repercussions'.

* In March 1976, a time when Labor Party policies were still applying and when there was a grave international economic **crisis**, the unemployment figure was 278,000.

* As a matter of fact, the dispute which caused last week's petrol **crisis** in Victoria ended in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when Commissioner H. Neil ruled that members of the Transport Workers Union would make deliveries from the Esso Spotswood plant.

* The **crisis** which has shattered the Government in the past 10 days stemmed in large measure from interpretation and implementation of defence policy.

* Even the rural **crisis** that we are sometimes debating is another interesting example.

* Because it claims to have made more revenue available to the States it believes that the States can surmount the **crisis** in education without further assistance.

* There is a **crisis** in the coal industry and the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  and the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr Connor)  have clearly shown this.

* There then came a great **crisis** in the prawn fishing industry because there were no prawns anywhere in the area for some months.

* Japan above all nations has been caught in the energy **crisis** brought about by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

* The result of all this is extreme fluctuations in work loads and, under the complicated arrangements that are inherent in the present scheme, these are producing **crisis** situations in the Australian Government Retirement Benefits Office and organisations employing large numbers of staff, such as the Post Office.

* The rural sector- or sections of it- continues to experience **crisis** conditions.

* I agree that this sum of $US41m should be contributed so as to make these greater reserves available but at the same time we should have taken the opportunity to look at the whole problem of international liquidity and to ensure that Australia makes its proper contributions in the councils of the world to make sure the world does not proceed on an ad hoc basis from one **crisis** to another.

* At the moment we have not only the historical pressures moving people from rural areas to city areas but also the rural **crisis**, the diminution of prices and.

* It seems pointless to build up our intelligence services within the Department of Defence when at a time of **crisis** demanding top class intelligence, all the Minister can do is recapitulate superseded Press reports.

* At a time when there is a serious downturn in private sector investment- in fact, a **crisis** in capital mobilisation- the provisions of this Bill are destructive and damaging to the future development of the industry in Australia.

* If it had we would not have reached this **crisis** situation.

* Unquestionably we are at the point of greatest danger since the Cuban missile **crisis** of 1962.

* In his statement the Minister showed that he is aware of the predictions that have been made by people in many other countries, namely, that the world is likely to face an energy **crisis** before the year 2000.

* But I yet hope that I can persuade him to accept the view with respect to recurrent grants that there is a very real **crisis** facing schools throughout Australia and that some of the non-government schools are in a position of almost total collapse.

* Today we have a constitutional **crisis**.

* The first 2 Australian warships to anchor there were called away in reponse to the **crisis** in Timor, the first shattering of any dream that Australia faced a long term period of tranquillity.

* Australia did not feel the full effects of the energy **crisis** a couple of years ago because previously the former Liberal-Country Party Administration had encouraged oil search and there had been a measure of success.

* Every **crisis** sends more people into unemployment.

* In my electorate we have what could become a **crisis**.

* Honourable members will remember that after the Iranian **crisis** Australia found itself without its traditional supplier.

* All of a sudden, there is a **crisis** where the entire population of a country may be wiped out because the great national and international governments and agencies were more concerned about diplomacies than the sanctity of human life.

* I believe that most of the wool brokers in Australia are doing their best to try to help wool growers to restore their profitability, and I believe that if it were not for the efforts of the private sector to assist generally the financial operations of primary producers, the rural sector would have been in a far worse **crisis** over the last few years than has been the case.

* The eastern seaboard of the United States of America has been talked about for many years- particularly recently in the light of the oil **crisis**- as being highly prospective for oil and gas exploration.

* We will stand solidly behind our' Leader in the **crisis** which has now blown over because  Mr Fischer,  I understand, has stated in Singapore that money was never mentioned at any interview he had with the Labor Leader and that he is going to issue writs against the Murdoch Press.

* So now the Minister and the nation have on their hands a **crisis** in the Post Office which will not be settled easily.

* I think this Parliament must be dismayed this afternoon to find that in this **crisis** situation there is no positive approach on the part of the Government.

* But there is plenty of evidence that there is a complete failure now even to make a tacit approach to settle this **crisis** with any advantage at all to the public, the nation, or anyone else.

* Urban decay and an energy **crisis** will be solved by technology, not by returning to a simpler way of life.

* We have almost a **crisis** of information at the moment.

* The current **crisis** in Australia is however much more severe than the Government or the Treasurer admits.

* It is a **crisis** evidenced by the highest prolonged inflation in Australia's history and by the highest unemployment since the great depression of the 1930s.

* It is a **crisis** which eats away at the security of every Australian, at our confidence and at our way of life.

* The principal source of this **crisis** has been the immense growth in Government spending since 1972.

* Despite the claims of the Government that overseas factors have been a significant cause of the current **crisis**, the International Monetary Fund in its July report, the report of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released last week and the Treasury in Budget Statement No.

* If this **crisis** continues or gets worse, as I believe it well may, we shall all suffer- the Government, the Opposition and more important than either of us, the people of Australia.

* Today I propose to discuss the Opposition's view of the nature and seriousness of the present **crisis** and to set before the nation the measures we believe are necessary to get Australia out of that **crisis**.

* We hear a lot about a **crisis** in Australian education.

* The Opposition raises this matter of public importance to draw to the attention of the Australian public and members of Parliament the **crisis** situation that has been caused by the attitude of the Government.

* A year ago, as the **crisis** was worsening, in trying to show that he was true blue to the Labor Party's beliefs he came forward and said: If the unemployment figure should ever reach 250 000 I would resign.

* We believe that the goal of limiting proliferation of nuclear weapons while at the same time easing the world's energy **crisis** is best accomplished by Australia agreeing to provide uranium for peaceful purposes and under the most stringent conditions.

* The simple fact is that nuclear energy is the only readily available alternative most countries have to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the oil **crisis**.

* I urge the Government to take steps immediately to mount an extensive advertising and communication campaign, at whatever cost, explaining the seriousness of the economic situation, explaining the Government's economic strategy as I have briefly outlined it here and explaining why it is absolutely vital that we all work together in this **crisis**.

* At present new great power relationships are emerging, new super power defence concepts are being discussed as SALT II gets under way, the international monetary and trade situation is increasingly complex, the oil **crisis** has raised new and uncertain problems, and the broader matter of resources and energy intrude more into foreign policy.

* There is change in Western Europe symbolised in Britain's **crisis** and the French decision to float the franc.

* The recent Middle East **crisis** raised a new element of uncertainty in relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

* We have the power to do it and having the power we must fulfil the responsibility to introduce these things; to give people a sense of security and to assure them that the community is concerned about their welfare and that in times of **crisis** need especially there will bc adequate support for them.

* Since the Australian economy was hit by the international monetary **crisis** last year the Government has acted to steer the economy back towards a proper course.

* That there was no loss of life along the Murrumbidgee during the recent record flood is a credit to the State Emergency Service, the flood warning system and the many voluntary organisations including service clubs, rescue clubs, church groups and the Country Womens Association, which helped in the **crisis** as the record peaks moved down the river.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  when introducing the motion complained that the Government had done nothing for local government, an area where there is a real **crisis** in rural areas.

* I advise honourable members oppositeI say this in all seriousness- that if they think there is an unlimited supply of funds for members' travel while this **crisis** is on they are in for a very severe shock.

* We have found that in urban communities which are over-centralised the **crisis** that has occurred has really taken place to a greater extent in the 2 major cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

* Secondly, Australia along with other countries shortly is going to face a **crisis** in liquid fuel.

* This country is in a **crisis** state.

* This has resulted largely because of increased import prices for crude oil since the oil **crisis**.

* We have yet to learn what impact the energy **crisis** will have on food production.

* In education appropriate to today's society Australia has lagged because past Australian governments have not been sufficiently interested to recognise the **crisis** and do something about it.

* The energy **crisis** resulting from the Middle East activities could spark off a world involvement.

* There was a change of heart by the Cabinet but the decision was reversed in the Caucus in a substantial manner following a **crisis** spread over about 4 days.

* The reports I have seen do not forecast that a **crisis** will occur, as such; rather, they stress the importance of adequate energy supplies for future economic development.

* The Western world is suffering a **crisis** of insufficient liquidity unprecedented in modern history.

* The first subject is the rural **crisis**.

* Let me turn to the rural **crisis**.

* My electorate, the city electorate of Adeaide, is being affected by this rural **crisis**.

* Industries, such as the vine fruits industry in my own State and indeed the sugar industry in the State of my colleague, the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  are now facing an even greater **crisis** than they would have faced in the present rural **crisis** for other reasons of prices on the world market.

* Why should not  Mr Hawke  and others tell the workers to use their only weapon - their right to withhold labour - in a **crisis**?

* I feel that when we are talking about an energy **crisis** and looking to the future we should remember that wood is a renewable source.

* Perhaps we are just paying lip service to the energy **crisis** and are not taking the proper and appropriate action that we should be taking at this point of time.

* For example, in the electorate of the honourable member for Moore  (Mr Maisey)  2% of land on an average - if the Commonwealth average applies there - changed hands each year before the present **crisis**.

* This is illustrated by the mounting **crisis** which is spreading throughout rural Australia arid is characterised by organised marches and protest meetings of farmers and rural workers.

* Migrants are the most savagely affected group, apart from Aborigines, in Australia and are particularly affected by this unemployment **crisis**.

* He knows full well that what I said was a complete endorsement of Government policy on this, -because we argued in this Parliament for most of last year on the wheat **crisis** that there had to be some control on production and if the industry had a larger peak it was obvious that the first advance payment would have to be reduced.

* It is regrettable that some members of the Press- those wily fabricators of the scare tactics and cataracts of **crisis** and tumult- have endeavoured to inculcate in the hearts and minds of the Australian people the fact that the Government has departed from its planned program.

* But in truth, it has not been the 'farm' which has been sold- not the industries like wheat or wool or fruit or dairying or gold, the industries which have faced the **crisis** and hardships of recent years.

* Australia 's policy is based squarely on our recognition of Australia's obligations as a country well endowed with energy resources to make those resources available to other countries, many of which have no real alternative, in the wake of the world energy **crisis**, than to turn to nuclear energy as a means of supplying electricity to their peoples.

* A severe **crisis** in the Indonesian economy almost certainly would herald a period of political instability with obvious implications for Australian security.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister has spoken on at least 2 occasions - the last time in this House on Tuesday afternoon - but did he speak on the **crisis** in rural industry?

* That means that the dead hand remains because while it is run by Government officials who have no personal responsibility for any issue and have no personal interest in the airline we will get this delay, this retarded reaction to any **crisis** with the result that a company which has made substantial profits and given substantial contributions to the airline industry in Australia is now faced with a deficit, retrenchments and all the problems that lead to a major disaster.

* lt is a fact that the steel industry throughout the world has suffered from a minor recession and that this has been accentuated in some degree by the world monetary **crisis**, particularly as it involves the relationship between the United States and Japan.

* There is no field where such new policies and intitiatives are more urgent than this industry which finds itself in a deepening **crisis** as a result of the Fraser Government's policies.

* It is amusing under these circumstances- or frightening I suppose- that the Prime Minister takes this opportunity to remove himself from the scene, to go overseas in an attempt to bring the rest of the world back from what he sees as the brink of economic **crisis**.

* think we have in Australia at the moment is what Professor Henderson recently described in a lecture given in Melbourne as 'too much instant government' - acting when the **crisis** is on you instead of preparing to avoid a **crisis**.

* There is the **Crisis** Centre at the Way side Chapel at Kings Cross.

* The Government's decision not to provide funds for any new projects under the Act will prolong the **crisis** of Australian cities.

* Members will recall that the Committee tabled on 2 December 1976 a report entitled  The Lebanon **Crisis**- Humanitarian Aspects.

* However, we regret that the most recent discussions were substantially affected by the recent oil **crisis**.

* Notwithstanding the immediate problems arising from the oil **crisis**, we welcome the new spirit of flexibility and pragmatism in international monetary negotiations which has arisen as a result of the Rome deliberations.

* But exacerbating this, as was also mentioned by the honourable member for Phillip, has been the energy **crisis** and the deeds of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pushing up the cost of their scarce commodity- the hydrocarbons, the energy and fuel upon which we have become so dependent.

* The Government recognises that the present **crisis** in the wool industry calls for a number of measures which in aggregate represent a concerted approach to the urgent problems affecting woolgrowers.

* Does he believe that an economic **crisis** is due in part to the interest rate squeeze induced by bank lending policies?

* We cannot say that there is any **crisis** with respect to future supplies because at present the Japanese are seriously investigating deposits, for example, at Marandoo and Deepdale.

* Having created the greatest constitutional **crisis** in Australian history the Opposition has now unleashed forces that nobody can effectively control.

* Evidently members of the Australian Labor Party have been very concerned about the **crisis** in the wool industry and have been doing a lot of study on the subject to enable them to make their contribution to the debate.

* We realise the **crisis** in the wool industry.

* * I feel that the Country Party members have a bigger responsibility in this matter and 1 hope that they will live up to it because there is no doubt that there is a **crisis** in the wool industry.

* It is here that the **crisis** has arisen through a lack of sewerage, transport, opportunities and housing.

* There is a growing awareness of a world energy **crisis**, and major industrial nations such as Japan and the United States of America, having depleted seriously their available resources, and being already heavily dependent on imports, particularly of crude oil, are now turning to 'resources diplomacy' to provide for their future needs.

* One other aspect of the problems of the aged is the **crisis** that is facing government nursing homes in the States.

* If our national activities and energies during those critical months- at the political level, at the administrative level, at the business level, at the industrial level- were to be distorted and dissipated by the engineering of a wholly artificial, wholly unnecessary and a wholly irresponsible political **crisis**, the harm would be great and the guilt immense.

* At a time of world energy **crisis** of incalculable proportions and a time of Arab gunboat oil diplomacy of the most callous and calculated kind, when a world depression is almost a foregone conclusion in the face of that diplomacy by the Arabs, Australia requires from the Minister 2 things: Firstly, a clear, simple and accurate statement of Australia's domestic oil supplies and future domestic demands.

* -Last night when I spoke on the adjournment I was trying in what I thought was a fairly moderate tone to engage in some intelligent debate on the **crisis** towards which this country is moving.

* When it came to power it decided that it was going to negotiate new contracts in Japan, but because there was a political **crisis** in Australia and it had to be resolved in 24 hours it did not matter what happened to the coal industry.

* It was prepared to provoke the gravest and most divisive constitutional **crisis** that this country has seen.

* I shall give a quick run-down on the industrial actions that have caused the present **crisis**.

* I have outlined briefly some of the industrial troubles that have plagued the oil industry this year and caused the **crisis** that now exists.

* It is beyond dispute that the basic cause of the present **crisis** is the industrial action of the oil industry unions.

* He said quite clearly that the current **crisis** in health care lies not in the global amount spent on health care in this country but in the unholy mess that this Government has made of our health care system.

* It is not an equitable situation and it could lead to a **crisis** in Australian radio and television, particularly in country areas.

* It may not be pleasant for a works' manager to be informed of his own shortcomings, but surely this is preferable to making the discovery only after these have produced a **crisis**.

* I believe this is industrial brinkmanship deliberately designed to create a **crisis** in an election year.

* This Government with its laissez-faire capitalistic attitude allows free enterprise monopolies, land sharks and finance companies to exploit the community at will, and only when a **crisis** arises does it acf to overcome a situation which competent planning could have avoided.

* The Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister may like to claim that they are responsible for solving the problem but there is a repetition of the **crisis** that developed in this Parliament as far back as 1970.

* If the Prime Minister had had the wisdom to include 'his friend',  Senator Murphy,  in a 3-man or a 4-man dictatorship, I venture to suggest that we would never have heard of any event called the Murphy Affair, and the Prime Minister would not have faced his first major **crisis** relating to his credibility in this country.

* The economic **crisis** in which we find ourselves is not merely the result of fortuitous circumstances; it is primarily the result of the misdirection of policies initiated by the present Government.

* Will he also confer with the South Australian Minister for Transport to seek a temporary easing of the load limits between Port Augusta and Pimba during this and any future Commonwealth railways **crisis** on the central Australian railway system?

* For many years education had been suffering **crisis** after **crisis**.

* The first duty of the Fuel Authority is to overcome the deficiencies imposed upon Canberra by the neglect of previous governments and by the failure of private enterprise to maintain a consistent supply of fuel in times of **crisis**.

* Because at the moment the real **crisis** exists in Sydney and Melbourne, we must meet the **crisis** in these areas.

* I point out, first, that at this time when our country is heading for an economic **crisis** the more powers that can be held in the hands of the Commonwealth - particularly taxing powers, which can help in economic planning - the better for this nation.

* In a time of an oil **crisis** the Government has rendered Australia - 
Of course there is a housing shortage in Australia.

* There is a serious housing **crisis** in Australia and there is a boom in housing which, together, put a very unreasonable strain on available resources.

* It is true that we are facing a fuel **crisis**.

* By being locked into import parity we will suffer as the Iranian **crisis** pushes up the oil price set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

* In no other way can the **crisis** in education be solved.

* Other issues were raised by last week's **crisis**.

* There is also the very important question of ensuring that a rational system operates that avoids the excesses of ad hockery where people, Ministers and governments react time and again to a **crisis** situation, a situation that just calls for some remedial action.

* Businessmen have been hesitating for several weeks in their investment decisions because they could see the impending **crisis** building up as a result of the recurrent statements, the recurrent threats, the intimidation of the Opposition in terms of what was going to happen to the Appropriation Bills.

* Personally, I believe that if the **crisis** comes to a head from the Rhodesian quarter those people, black or white, would add something to our Australian character and community.

* That all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'This House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia 's economic **crisis**, in that: 

 Mr Robert McNamara, the  President  of the World Bank, has repeatedly given a warning.

* The underdeveloped world faces a **crisis** which calls for urgent action and not lengthy deliberation by advisory councils and bureaucratic reshuffles, as we have seen to date with the working of the aid agency in this country.

* From the time of the energy **crisis** when the increase in the price of oil had such a tremendous impact upon the economies of European and North American countries, the problem of inflation, and with it unemployment, as one is interacting against the other, has been a difficulty which all of those countries have had to face.

* In our secondary school system there is a terrible, deep and prolonged **crisis**.

* I think only one thing will attend to the mounting **crisis** in this country.

* I ask honourable members to look, for example, at the rural **crisis**.

* The big man who is grazing cattle who is in no real state of **crisis** does not need it so much.

* The oil **crisis** of 1973 had a major destructive effect upon most developed Western nations.

* The Commonwealth, of course, by its migration policy has created a **crisis** for the States.

* There were 7,300 fewer houses built when the need for more reached **crisis** proportions.

* I am grateful that the Minister visited Bangladesh during the **crisis** there.

* He might also not have heard that there is an energy **crisis** in the world, that  President  Nixon this week has put an embargo on the use of heating oil in the United States of America, that the war in the Middle East is threatening oil supplies for Europe and that we are in the hands of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, King Faisal and  Colonel Kadhafi.

* At the time of this, his first major visit, to South East Asia - and this is the tenth overseas trip that he has made since he assumed office some 13 months ago - certain parts of Australia were facing a very grave domestic **crisis** caused by flood inundations in Queensland and which was of tremendous importance to the Australian people.

* I refer to the Royal Australian Air Force, the Army, the civil emergency authorities in both States, the State police forces and to an almost uncountable number of volunteers who joined spontaneously with the authorities to meet the **crisis** and worked tirelessly to sustain people during that period and then to cope with their immediate rehabilitation.

* The policy recognises Australia's obligation as a country well endowed with energy resources to make those resources available to other countries, many of which have no alternative in the wake of the world energy **crisis** but to turn to nuclear energy as a means of supplying electricity to their peoples.

* Finally, the Conference concluded that enough information is available to make everyone aware of the energy **crisis**, and aware that definite action is required now, especially in the area of nuclear power.

* Those are the conclusions of the finest brains involved in the energy **crisis**.

* Whenever there is a **crisis** anywhere, either in the trade unions or in the industry, in relation to the supply of fuel we are the first victims of it.

* I then went on to deal with the oil **crisis**.

* Now the Government, in its usual fashion, waits for the **crisis** and then moves, and moves ponderously.

* But when he says that the Labor Government has induced an equipment **crisis** within the Services, I think that is just simply nonsense.

* There is no doubt that not only, as we have pointed out in this Parliament previously, are the unskilled and semi-skilled people bound up in the enormous **crisis** and problem of unemployment, but also we have the professional people involved in it here as well as in many other countries.

* What I was saying was that in view of the fact that there has already been a softening of the Government's attitude in relation to the payments that are to be made for the 1969-70 season - and whether it is to be 20% or 40% I am not clear and I ask the Minister in all sincerity to clarify that point - would it not be reasonable, in view of the **crisis** in the countryside, to use the credit which the Treasurer has made available to him to pay the $1.10 on the 1969-70 pool and start off afresh?

* The present **crisis** caused by the action of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and those in the Senate who have been prepared to follow him is in the grand line of the great constitutional struggles of the past- of 1640, 1688, 1 832 and 1 9 10.

* This must be emphasised: In this grave constitutional **crisis**, this crucial dispute between the 2 Houses, none of the electoral options available are in any way relevant to the issue at stake.

* the Government was unprepared for the **crisis** that occurred in the industry.

* Queensland's share of this allocation would have built approximately 30 houses  -  30 houses spread over the whole of the State to ease what the Government called a **crisis** in housing.

* We have reached **crisis** point.

* They know that it is a fact that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in their Party room a few weeks ago that every major **crisis** that has been caused, has been caused by the Prime Minister himself.

* This in turn led to the sequence, of Press reports which produced the **crisis** in the Government.

* If they should be used then probably they should be prescribed only for very limited periods in **crisis** situations such as pre-operative conditions.

* What I am saying is that since the **crisis** in the Lebanon developed the Government has been in close and continuing consultation with leaders of the Lebanese community in Australia.

* He set out once again a list of reasons why he would have persisted with the economic **crisis** into which he and his three successive Treasurers led Australia in spite of the consequences to the nation.

* If so, what action is planned to protect those employed in the industry and to avoid a worsening of the **crisis** which exists in that State.

* We all might suffer from an energy **crisis** sometimes when we have to get out of bed and go to work.

* It is only in times of **crisis** that one sees the real value of the Australian, how he can work with his fellow man and how all Australia can mobilise itself.

* One article headed 'Financial **Crisis** Looms For Rural Industry' was written by  Mr Tom  Connors of the 'Australian Financial Review', lt was reprinted in the 'Ricemill News'.

* It reads: 
As a result of the Federal Government's decision to increase land line charges many country radio stations will face a financial **crisis**.

* He said that if a **crisis** arises in the future, at least we will have done the work.

* At that time a record number of our primary industries were facing an economic **crisis**.

* In today's world, the ever growing energy **crisis** highlights the world reliance on oil and natural gas for energy needs.

* They tend to side-step the issue and talk about some supposed constitutional **crisis** that is now in the past.

* In addition, we are increasingly faced with environmental problems that must be balanced against growth objectives and, along with the rest of the world, we will need to adjust to the widespread ramifications of the coming energy **crisis**.

* I thought that, at some stage, he was almost coming to one of the points of **crisis**.

* That **crisis** has now passed.

* One headline was 'Grim **Crisis** Plan Ahead'.

* Sydney and Melbourne these days are drawing migrants from a countryside in **crisis**.

* It would not be an exaggeration to say that this country faces its worst economic **crisis** since the war.

* It is an economic **crisis** which many will find hard to accept because it was only such a very, very short time ago that we could say of Australia, without any fear of contradiction, that it was indeed the lucky country.

* Recently, because of the emphasis that has been given in the community to the energy **crisis** and to the premium on the traditional sources of fuel, we have had an inquiry into the possibility of the factories - particularly the factory in the honourable member's electorate - making perhaps solar energy units that might be incorporated in government houses in, say, the Northern Territory or even the Australian Capital Territory.

* In the letter  Mr Healey  states that a grant has been made to the community aid service of the municipality of Blacktown to help the operation of its community cottage, which is a refuge for women in **crisis** situations, the grant being $10,585.

* Ever since the world oil **crisis** came about we have had problems keeping our existing markets.

* The report of the Committee deals with this matter in a number of places and then talks about the need for Australia's efforts regarding our Lebanese community to be devoted to the integration of the Lebanese who arrived in Australia during the Lebanon **crisis**.

* They blame, for example, the petrol **crisis** on the oil companies or the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

* It is also necessary that we recognise the energy **crisis** and the impact that it has had on our trade opportunities, the slackening production rates, the shortages of importable products and the problems of increased costs in shipping and bunkering which affect freight rates.

* It will not be an easy problem because the **crisis** in currency and in world trade that has been precipitated by President Nixon will have devastating consequences, particularly for Australia.

* The Australian Labor Party is essentially a party of protection and it takes the long view; 
That is, the Royal Australian College of Surgeons - discovered that this **crisis** has become a defenceless, non-combatant casualty In the complicated Commonwealth-State status struggle, which ls strangling the efforts of Australians for advancement.

* As far as the allegation about blackmail is concerned, we are concerned to have tankers so that if there is an oil **crisis** at some time or another involving other countries whose tankers normally would be carrying Australia's crude oil we will be in a position, if need be, to deal with the suppliers of crude overseas on a nation to nation basis using Australian tankers.

* The best answer that I think can be given to the honourable gentleman's question about the capacity of  Mr Gruzman  to express the opinion that he expressed on the constitutional **crisis** was delivered in the  Australian  newspaper by Professor Blackshield who gave that answer in a very learned article published in the  Australian  newspaper this morning, I think, and who on Sunday gave a talk in the capacity of  Guest of Honour  for the Australian Broadcasting Commission.

* We made a start in this area during our short period in government by setting up the Priorities Review Staff which has now, I understand, been absorbed in or lost in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet- the estimates for which we are now debating- which is acting as a task force in a typically Liberal way by directing its attention to the latest policy **crisis** area which arises-  ad  hoc-ism stop-and-go-ism.

* If in 1966 the Government could blandly claim in election material that the North Vietnamese going into South Vietnam posed a threat of invasion to Australia then possibly it could think about what sort of a threat could exist if the economy of India is not able to sustain the type of strain which is being placed upon it by this **crisis**.

* The nuclear power industry may forestall the **crisis**, if we are lucky, for 40 or 50 years, but what then?

* We find it is stated that the loan is for temporary purposes and the exigencies arising out of the current world situation, the international energy **crisis**, to strengthen Australia's external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia in regard to the supply of minerals and energy, and to deal with current and immediate foreseeable unemployment in Australia.

* I am not for one minute suggesting that in a time of **crisis** such as this the situation ought to be under the sole control of the local executive, but we did state something which ought to be borne in mind continually.

* This Government is caught in a very serious predicament; it is in a **crisis** situation in the housing industry.

* There can be no doubt that the 2 **crisis** points at the moment are Sydney and Melbourne which are suffering from all the ills of over-centralisation - soaring land prices, lagging services, air and water pollution, lack of recreational space and so on.

* The Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system, .

* I do not want to get too far into the whole question of the constitutional **crisis** but what I should like to deal with is the question as to whether there ought to be a threat against persons who wish to discuss the need for action.

* I think it is important that if there is to be discussion of the constitutional **crisis** which occurred last year, that discussion ought to be allowed to range as widely as possible.

* The Department had the ability, the experience, the enthusiasm and the expertise to act quickly and decisively in response to **crisis** situations.

* What the Governor-General did on Remembrance Day will go down in history as one of the greatest travesties on political law, on democracy, that has ever been witnessed in this country, because if the Governor-General of this country is to be given the right, under the powers of the royal prerogative, to sack any government that he chooses, as he did on this occasion, no government could survive in a time of economic **crisis**.

* I and other Opposition speakers pointed out during a recent urgency debate on the economy that all the measures taken by this Government have imperilled- severely jeopardisedthe recovery planned in the 1975-76 Budget, which plans were seen to be working in spite of the hampering of the constitutional **crisis**.

* Australia today is facing a **crisis** of leadership.

* In a situation of, say, economic or another form of **crisis**, that would make the position of government impossible.

* He referred to the oil **crisis**, beef prices and so on.

* The world situation is really that Australia has been partially isolated from the major oil **crisis** because we have our own supplies.

* The danger of a world nuclear war by accident is much reduced because of the impact of the Cuba **crisis** which has not been forgotten.

* In any world **crisis** the following countries will consult immediately: The United States of America, Britain, India, Japan, Australia and other members of the Commonwealth.

* So I am stirred to rise in this debate because of the **crisis** in the wheat industry caused by the extraordinary, strange and outrageous policies of the present Liberal-Country Party Government.

* It is aggravating the **crisis** in the building industry where over 71 ,000 jobs have been lost since May 1975.

* We face a world of economic **crisis**, a world of over-production.

* In view of this **crisis** and the prospect of other closures, will the Minister formulate national guidelines for the production and marketing of coal so as to minimise the adverse effects of cut-throat competition between the overseas owners of New South Wales underground mines and the open cut mines of Queensland?

* The Commonwealth first entered this field in  1970  to help arrest a financial **crisis** which had developed for many independent schools.

* He is stubbornly unwilling, perhaps emotionally unable, to see a situation not as superficial and temporary but as a **crisis** of the system itself.

* I refer to the previous questions concerning the serious **crisis** facing the countryside due to the shortage of fuel, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland.

* Not to admit its mistakes, not to take the people into its confidence, but to cut back funds for unemployment benefits and to conceal the real dimensions of the unemployment **crisis** by abolishing seasonally adjusted figures.

* On AM on Thursday there was a report drawing attention to grave anxiety among senior businessmen and economists about the state of the Australian economy and the Government's floundering and chaotic measures to deal with the **crisis**.

* 18/1972:  1.1 To enable RAAF pilots to be trained in the use of specialised navigational equipment, and to maintain the standard of efficiency which would be expected of the Service at a time of **crisis**, it is essential that high speed, low level, cross-country exercises be carried out by military F4E (Phantom) jet aircraft operating out of Amberley m non-controlled airspace.

* It is not a constitutional **crisis** that we face at the moment Let no one be misled by those who say that it is a constitutional **crisis**.

* There may be a political **crisis**; it is certainly not a constitutional **crisis**.

* The political **crisis** has been brought about by the actions of dishonest men within a dishonest Government.

* The dairy industry is in a **crisis** state with markets dwindling, with nothing being done, dairy stabilisation eliminated and no money is available for the dairy industry.

* No statement has been made in Parliament about the problems associated with international charter operations or about the present **crisis** which exists at Qantas on the possibility of additional layoff of staff.

* Had that request been acceded to some time ago we might well not have had the **crisis** situation which has now developed to the extent that it has this Government scared stiff of the reaction of the Australian population because of its past total inaction.

* This has been going on for the last 12 months, at a time when there has been a world energy **crisis**.

* In fact coal today, thanks to a Labor government and thanks exclusively to a Labor government, is Australia's major export earner and it will continue in that role despite what may happen in the way of a world economic **crisis**.

* Tales are going around- I am not in a position to say whether they are true or untrue- that the banking liquidity **crisis** has been caused by the Reserve Bank's charging these quite exorbitant rates to the member banks and that this is a fundamental error in policy.

* If one thinks back to 1970, the real **crisis** for the States at that time was the enormous interest bill, the enormous debt sinking fund requirement, and the disproportionate situation between the States and the Commonwealth Government in relation to the Commonwealth's part in the annual expenditure of funds.

* I give notice that I will press for this as soon as the present economic **crisis** is under control.

* It is shameful that when unemployment is a major national **crisis** a profitable public enterprise should be restrained from reaching its employment potential, simply so that international profiteers can operate with the Government's blessing.

* In this year of **crisis** for Australian farmers it is interesting to see how this Government is prepared to stand idly by while agricultural science courses are sabotaged.

* What is the **crisis** in pre-school education?

* The Government was faced suddenly as if it had fallen out of bed on the wrong side with the prospect that the New South Wales Government would sooner or later do the same thing, certainly with the approach of the oft talked about **crisis** in education.

* It is going to administer the teaching service of the Australian Capital Territory and of tha 
These are aspects of the F111C **crisis** which should not be glossed over by the Government.

* The article is entitled 'The Inflation **Crisis**'.

* Why will it not ease the liquidity **crisis** which is causing the private sector to lose confidence and causing it to reduce the supply of goods and reduce employment?

* There is a record public sector debt and **crisis**.

* It was Keynes who said: 
If that was not sufficient, only a few weeks later we had the **crisis** relating to the Australian Research Grants Committee.

* I ask: In view of the substantial cutbacks which are occurring in our mineral export contracts, and the resulting further reduction that will occur in our level of exports, and noting the substantial outflow of invisible earnings, with detrimental effect on the balance on current account, can the Treasurer assure the business sector of the economy that he will not pursue an intensification of the prevailing budget  strategy which will lead to an even greater balance-of-payments **crisis**?

* Then essentially, over a short period of time, it was elevated by the public media and by the commentators into a **crisis** situation, but it never was a **crisis** situation.

* I remember  Sir Robert  Menzies, when he was Prime Minister, coming back from an overseas conference on the Suez **crisis** in 1956 and giving a report to Anthony Eden on what he had discovered on his trip up the Nile with the late  President  Nasser.

* I want to quote some extracts from a very thoughtful contribution by Frank Brennan in his book Canberra in **Crisis**'.

* Nobody wants to talk to him now because the policies that he enunciated then have proved, in the present world oil **crisis**, to be the right policies for Australia.

* Warwick Fairfax and many others - to stab his enemies for him while Billy waited in the background until the **crisis** which others precipitated came to a solution.

* The honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr Brown),  who seems to be the prince of complacency in this place when it comes to any matter of consideration, ought to examine whether these meagre amounts and this meagre approach by the Commonwealth will solve the education **crisis**.

* We have a teacher **crisis** on our hands.

* A teacher **crisis** is with us.

* This situation came about partly through bad seasons in the Northern hemisphere raising the prices of our exports, partly through the energy and materials **crisis** which is occurring in the United States and elsewhere - these are events external to Australia - and partly because of the sound policy of the Liberal-Country Party government in the past.

* This was a time when few people, particularly those in government bodies, could stand up and seek praise for their efforts because it was a time when government authorities - local, State and Federal, had no alternative but to respond to the **crisis** of the hour.

* At that time I said that if the cyclical downturn in the Western economies which was being predicted by the best economists in the Western world occurred and if the energy **crisis** remained unsolved there was no way that the ripples from these 2 effects would not wash Australia's shores as well.

* There is a **crisis** in our economy but I hope that by concentrating on it we do not forget our defence system.

* But as great as that obligation is, it will not distract us from the equally important task of revealing the depth of the **crisis** which this country faces and the extent of the damage which this Government has done to this country.

* It is at these **crisis** points that Commonwealth funds should be applied.

* I visited Cuba in 1962, 10 days before the missile **crisis**, and from that day onwards I have taken some interest in Cuba's history.

* Something of a **crisis** has developed in this area.

* But to bring on a debate and to take up the time of this House by suggesting there have not been effective remedies to overcome the private sector investment **crisis**, socalled, when one can read out a list of about 1 5 remedies, all of which have been effective in overcoming the fact that private investment is less than it ought to be, is, I repeat, to take up the time of this House unnecessarily.

* 'The Federal Government move away from this area will create a **crisis** of care for certain needy people which cannot be overlooked'.

* I said then that this cyclical downturn in addition to the energy **crisis**, if it remained unresolved, would inevitably cause an economic downturn in this country because it was not possible for us to become an economic island, to live alone in the world and not be affected by the ripples coming from the shores of other countries which were badly affected by inflation.

* What is involved is not an economic **crisis**, painful and perhaps mismanaged as that may be, but precedents which will determine the health of our parliamentary processes for generations in the future.

* In March we heard the honourable member for Dawson make this statement in the House:  lt is obvious  than   the Government has lulled lo warn the wheal grower.-, the public ami the taxpavers in sufficient time of the **crisis** that has arisen.

* I wish the Parliament would set to and do some homework on it or establish a select committee to examine how we can develop the civilian defence capacity of Australia with its tremendous resources in every town, in workshops, in naval yards and so on, into a viable defence capacity which does not waste people's time but which still can be an effective mobilisation point for the nation if ever we come to a point of **crisis**.

* We are living in a time of **crisis**.

* One of the unfortunate things about a **crisis** like this is that it does not bring out the best in human beings.

* I summarise by saying that we do have a housing **crisis** in this community, that this Bill does not help it in any way, that our problem is a shortage of serviced land, that housing construction costs have increased but in no way has that increase been at the same rate as the increase in the price of land.

* Apart from the possible impact on the Australian motorists, in terms of pricing, there has been no general appreciation of the new world situation which we are now entering following the developing world energy **crisis**.

* But it is a situation which in situations of **crisis** has to be faced, and this situation is fast approaching with Tasmanian shipping.

* We can see what could happen and what would have happened if the previous Government had been in power during the recent energy **crisis**.

* There was, we were told, absolutely no reason for Australia to be affected by the economic **crisis** that had affected every Western economy as a result of the October 1973 Middle East war.

* Australia should be more concerned with an overall analysis of the oil **crisis**- or in popular jargon, with the recycling of petro-dollars.

* Australia should be more concerned with our relationships with Japan in terms of the economic consequences of the oil **crisis** than attempting to try some form of blackmail.

* I remember when he was either in the United Kingdom or going through to Canada and he was asked to be the  chairman  of the committee dealing with the Suez **crisis**.

* The BAF, or bunker surcharge as it is sometimes known, was introduced at the time of the oil **crisis** when fuel prices rose sharply, and at such frequent intervals that ship operators were unable to absorb the cost.

* I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to the **crisis** in the dairy industry.

* We have people on both sides of the political spectrum who say the world is in an economic **crisis** and that the economic system under which we live has run out of wars to bolster its industries and to solve its employment problems.

* The alternative Budget introduced by the Labor leader would therefore involve a balance of payments **crisis**, a severe cut in corporate investment and profitability, a 180-degree turn in monetary policy and a significantly faster wage growth.

* If they do not take part in it, what the Minister himself called a **crisis** situation when he was speaking to the Victorian Dairyfarmers Association on 26th May this year will not be overcome.

* In the course of that speech in Melbourne the Minister said: 
Any legislation to help rural industries brought down at a time of **crisis** within those industries must receive the earnest consideration of all members of the Parliament, including the Opposition.

* Tariff Board and its academic, financial and Press supporters, the 2 supporters it has here and possibly the Commonwealth Treasury - all completely unprotected people and, I suppose, therefore highly economic and efficient - would cause a serious economic **crisis** in Australia.

* Any intelligent observer would realise that to effect any real changes for the better in the many areas of **crisis** and the mess we inherited as a result of a lack of sensibly directed public programs would involve some unpopular decisions.

* A trumped up phoney **crisis** about the appointment of  Senator Gair  to be ambassador to Ireland was used as the pretext to threaten to refuse the Government the funds to carry on.

* We know very well that the performance of the other countries to which the honourable member for Gellibrand referred has been relatively much better than Australia's performance, even bearing in mind that each of the other industrialised countries was subject to the consequences of the oil **crisis** when we were 70 per cent self-sufficient.

* Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been drawn to the recent report of the International Energy Agency which confirms authoritative predictions of a world liquid fuel **crisis** in the 1990s?

* As the critical problem of fuel and energy will be no less acute - 
They found in 1973, as undoubtedly we found, that both Acts had been overlooked and forgotten until a **crisis** stage was reached.

* The whole of the rural countryside is in' a **crisis**.

* Although a large proportion of Australia's most important export industry is faced with financial disaster and even extinction, the Government has made no effort to inform the Parliament, the wool growers or the taxpayers of this nation of its proposed actions in the immediate future to counter this **crisis**.

* I say to the Minister for the Navy that what he has said is nonsense because as most honourable members well know, the place of the Minister for Primary Industry at the present time is in Australia, in this Parliament and particularly at the helm in the **crisis** we are facing.

* We will shortly see whether the Opposition is able to muster up 48 in a **crisis**.

* A more disturbing aspect of this question of oil production is that we are now in a position to say that in 5 years ' time Australia will face its own oil **crisis**.

* This Government, faced with the **crisis**, has decided to opt out of the situation altogether.

* -The honourable gentleman is spot on about what is being suffered in South Australia at the moment, and that is a **crisis** of confidence.

* There is no relief of the liquidity **crisis** facing many businesses.

* Surely this is another example of a **crisis** being allowed to develop and then a panic button being pressed.

* The Government's ill-conceived economic policies and its failure to implement a rational housing policy have in large measure created the present **crisis**.

* On 25 December 1973 the Minister said: 
But on 14 February this year the national president of the Housing Industry Association - a man with a very sound knowledge of matters relating to this industry which is critical to Australia - warned that this country faced a **crisis** in housing not paralleled since the immediate post-war period.

* I have complimented him on numerous occasions and I believe that when the history of this **crisis** is written he will stand high in the minds of the people.

* The Minister has introduced this wool scheme as part of a complex of measures which the Government claims is the answer to the rural **crisis**.

* All of these institutions have done particularly well in the last 2 years despite the rural **crisis**.

* In his second reading speech, the Minister said: 
Minister say today that there is no **crisis** in rural reconstruction and that there is no problem in New South Wales.

* I sum up in this way: The **crisis** is worsening and the time for action is now.

* It is because during this Government's period of office we have had more idle resources in this country than at any other time in the country's history, that we have had the deficit problems that are forcing Australia this year into what can be described only as a mounting fiscal **crisis**.

* Finally, does the Minister agree that if easy carry-on finance is not soon made available outright grants will have to be made available to the industry as the **crisis** worsens?

* The world energy **crisis** highlights major world reliance on oil and natural gas for its energy needs.

* It does not matter that there is a **crisis** in the oil industry.

* The Opposition in the Senate has failed to pass these Bills, notwithstanding that the nation is now entering the third week of grave constitutional **crisis**.

* The Australian defence aircraft industry has for a number of years been limping from one **crisis** to another.

* He had something to say about the energy **crisis**, but really his was not the responsibility of solving it.

* The present Government has not only failed the nation in the important areas I have mentioned; it has also been responsible for the development of the worst **crisis** in the rural sector of this nation for more than 30 years.

* The biggest business in the nation is facing a **crisis**, the magnitude of which is obviously not realised by the Government.

* No businessman in this country would ever be working on his business at 2 o'clock in the morning unless there was a **crisis** in the business and he was going bankrupt, or something like that, and he wanted to find a few more dollars.

* The energy **crisis** of the last few years has had profound implications for international relations and quite clearly is of major concern to the future economic growth and well being of mankind.

* When **crisis** threatens an industry associated with the rural sector of this country the Commonwealth Government acts quickly to make finance available by way of subsidy or grant.

* The honourable member for Adelaide shakes his head, yet he knows that at that time those people brought this country to a **crisis** stage which was very similar to the situation we faced at the end of 1975.

* It has caused us to face a **crisis** of supply for our traditional markets, for.

* The Opposition insists on stating the proposition in its own way and making the point that, in view of the Opposition, the Government is ignoring the **crisis** in the whole communication industry in most parts of the world.

* I ask the Minister for Northern Development: When does the Government intend to assist effectively cattle producers in Australia to overcome the greatest financial **crisis** this industry has ever experienced?

* The ANZ Bank index shows a severe recession in 1961- the result of the Menzies credit squeeze- a shallower trough in 1966-67, a sharp deterioration in 1971 ending in about April 1972, a splendid expansionary phase throughout 1973, a decline during the world-wide recession following the oil **crisis** of 1974, and the beginning of recovery in late 1975 and early 1976 when the effects of the Hayden Budget were still working.

* The present masters of our national destiny, the purveyors of outdated economic shibboleths, these misguided men, would have us believe that whatever the cause of Australia 's economic **crisis** the blame is not theirs.

* I do not want to delay the House any longer on these events which led to this **crisis** in the democratic process of this country where the Prime Minister by his action and his colleagues by their actions brought us to a situation in which it was necessary for us to put the question to the Australian people.

* He concedes that wool prices are the lowest for 23 years and the growers are in **crisis**, but he has no new policies and no firm answer to that.

* The activities of the greatest monopolies which have caused the **crisis** are ignored completely.

* Growers across the nation who are in **crisis** - 100,000 of them - want to know.

* The wool industry has been in a state of **crisis** for a considerable time now.

* The Fraser Government's failure to respond to the **crisis** in the Australian motor vehicle manufacturing industry, with appropriate policies to improve consumer demand and provide a viable future with resulting employment security.

* This legislation has been introduced as an emergency measure to meet what must be regarded as a **crisis** in Chamberlain Industries, in particular, and in International Harvester Co. of Victoria.

* Further, if this intrusion is to be allowed has consideration been given to the effect that it will have on the prospects of rural workers, already displaced and about to be displaced due to the rural **crisis**, obtaining employment in industry and commerce in this country?

* It is put to us that the Country Party and the coalition Government have not been looking after the interests of the primary producer in this period of **crisis**.

* Two days before the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  introduced this Budget, the  President  of the United States announced measures which have precipitated a great international currency **crisis**.

* Even if this were deemed undesirable to canvass, he has not even been able to indicate the possible consequences to trade, particularly wool, not only directly with the United 
My question to the Minister for Minerals and Energy deals with the world fuel **crisis**.

* We are considering extended hours of sitting on certain days with a legislative program that is uncertain and in an economic climate that is at **crisis** point.

* It is illuminating to consider, for example, that if a rigid system had been established, say, in 1973, it would almost certainly have broken down in the face of the pressures brought about by the recent oil **crisis**.

* In the meantime they ought to face up to the real issue that is confronting this country- the constitutional **crisis** for which they are responsible.

* They certainly did receive exorbitant rises and their salaries moved to a level which in many respects is fundamental to the current health **crisis** in Australia.

* I felt very much for those people engaged not only in the activities associated with the flood **crisis** itself but also in the clean-up in the days thereafter when people were cleaning the rubbish out of houses.

* But it is a recognition of the fact that this organisation was not perfect and that, in responding to the greatest **crisis** which the civil defence authorities have ever had to face, it found that considerable room for improvement existed in a number of fields.

* I am sure that the Australian Government will co-operate with the Queensland Government and its civil defence authorities in order to learn from the problems that were faced in the immediate past and so to ensure that in a similar **crisis** in the future we will have benefited from that experience.

* In a letter to the Prime Minister the Secretary of the Labor Council,  Mr John  Ducker, said that the downturn in manufacturing industry had caused a **crisis**.

* The **crisis** that this country faces, irrespective of whether it has a monarchy or is a republic, without a vast constitutional amendment, is simply the question summed up so eloquently by  Sir Robert  Garran when he quoted what J. W. Hackett once said.

* The debate then went on from the subject of tractors to the effect of the rural **crisis** on the cities.

* The fact is that if the Government had not made advance payments amounting, as he said in his speech, to between $650m and $700m, for wheat, much of which was unsold, the **crisis** would have been much more severe.

* Is is a fact that, due to the great increase in the number of unemployed, benefit payments have been delayed because of the failure to increase the staff of his Department to meet this **crisis**.

* If there is a **crisis** today in industrial democracy it stems, as  Sir Isaiah  Berlin suggested in a rare interview, from:   .

* The function of education in a world in **crisis** is to develop people who can fashion a new and inspiring civilisation - people who have the moral and intellectual qualities, and the sensitivity to produce a renaissance.

* Excessive wage demands had caused Australia's unemployment and inflation **crisis**.

* You cannot blame the oil **crisis** for inflation in Australia.

* The constitutional **crisis** led to its achievement of government.

* The wise, the wealthy and the powerful are now deserting the suburbs and moving back into the intermediate areas of the large cities because they can see the coming impact of the energy **crisis** and its implications for urban transport.

* The outer suburbs are facing a monumental transport **crisis** which will not be easily solved because of the land use patterns that have been established and the preference for single dwelling units.

* Let us not forget that this Commission is the Government's answer to the wool **crisis**.

* In view of the reports that several European countries have announced somewhat dramatically that foreign trading in their currencies has been suspended; in view of the very strong possibility of revaluation of those European currencies and the attendant possibility of a movement in the international valuation of the Japanese yen; and in view of the international paper which is held in those currencies by the Federal Government and certain of its instrumentalities, can the Treasurer inform the House to what extent and in what detail this **crisis** is being followed by Australian authorities?

* It is ludicrous that today when the energy **crisis** is a major global problem, possibly the global problem for the rest of the century, with the horrible spectre of trade wars before us once more, Australia has difficulty in rising above the level of federal-State bickering to develop a national policy.

* The Europeans are seeking massive government support to see them through the **crisis**.

* He has indulged in empty, generalised rhetoric, but in none of the hard details which are necessary at this time of economic **crisis** in this country.

* We want to make sure that not only these people but also all people in the community who suffer adversity, whether it is a **crisis** need or something more deepseated than that, can feel secure in the knowledge that a system of support is available.

* Sometimes in **crisis** situations there has to be some oiling of the machines and operations have to be streamlined.

* There should be provision in the Act to enable these new repeater facilities in times of **crisis** in a given area actually to go on the air from the transmitter in a purely local capacity to provide vital and often lifesaving communications and information.

* Again it took the  Australian Financial Review  to bring to light the fact that BHP had put in a submission which, in effect, asked the Government to dump the shipbuilding industry, asked the Government to give BHP the opportunity to take short term advantage of the record depression that exists in world shipbuilding yards and which followed the energy **crisis** in 1973.

* The time has come in the light of the **crisis** which has occurred when the Government should set up a royal commission to inquire into the conduct and activities of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and indeed the Council of Aboriginal Affairs itself.

* Time and again Labor has come to power in times of **crisis**, and this occasion is no exception.

* In view of the discontent and disillusionment of the people of Darwin at all levels- a feeling that is reaching **crisis** point and constantly being expressed through the' honourable member for the Northern Territory and myself- will the Minister inform the House why the rebuilding of the residential areas of Darwin is making little progress?

* How does the Minister regard the suggestion made on the 'AM' program this morning by an independent member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, that the Government could be deliberately retarding the building of houses and concentrating on what - 
And this, with a prescience, prophetic insight, that Quick and Garran would not have claimed for themselves, gets to the heart and the root of this present grave **crisis**.

* It is a burden which has created hardship and it is a burden which has led directly to the present economic **crisis**.

* Is there any **crisis**?

* Firstly, we wish to ensure that the immediate situation which we face because of the Middle East **crisis** is dealt with adequately and properly so that we may preserve for the Australian people proper supplies of very important fuel.

* The resolution of the political **crisis** involving National Assembly members is somewhat unclear.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* As a result of that, the independent schools face a **crisis** situation.

* At the moment, this nation faces a certain difficulty- a constitutional **crisis**, if honourable members like- and the question that arises is: Who governs Australia?

* -The honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Webb)  has referred to the failure of the Government to deal with the **crisis** of growing unemployment.

* After all, the  Speaker  had an important message to the effect that the House had noted that the Supply **crisis** was over, that the House had no confidence in the caretaker Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, and that the House in fact reaffirmed its confidence in  Mr Whitlam  as Prime Minister.

* History will prove again- as the **crisis** that occurred in December 1972 can change governments- that in May 1974 the anti-government vote increased in Sydney and Melbourne because of the hysteria that was created by an economic slump which was affecting not only this country but all countries in the Western world.

* I remind you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  that before you came into the Parliament- no one would be more mindful of this than the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  if I can jog his active brain- Edward Ward when sitting on the front bench reminded the House in the presence of  Sir Robert  Menzies that  Sir Anthony  Eden wrote in his memoirs, which can be found in the Parliamentary Library, that he had received a letter from  Sir Robert  Menzies after visiting Nasser during the Suez **crisis** and that  Sir Robert  Menzies wrote: 
I cannot quite hear the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  but I seem to remember that he also interjected on that evening.

* Those honourable members should not apologise to me for being intemperate but they ought to apologise to the country people for not taking notice of their needs and not doing something about the **crisis** as it is at the present time.

* Is the Government honestly neutral in the **crisis** in the Middle East  or is it  giving a measure of support to the Arab nations?

* I am not saying that the Tasmanian apple growers should not be helped; but I repeat that it is not the function of the Australian wool growers - to help them in the urgent **crisis** in which the wool industry finds itself today.

* I refer to the impending **crisis** in fuel oil availability.

* This **crisis** has highlighted the folly of past decisions and indecision as a result of which our railway systems, and for that matter our coastal shipping services, have been allowed to degenerate to a level where their role bears little resemblance to the proud role they played in establishing this country in its formative years.

* We believe that the home building industry is really at a **crisis** situation.

* It has brought into this House the most vicious industrial legislation that this country has ever experienced, all to meet a phoney **crisis**.

* There were not sufficient fire engines to deal with a Jumbo crash or anything above a Fokker crash during the major part of this **crisis**.

* The situation that exists at the moment is nowhere near as bad as it was in the depths of the **crisis** while the Opposition was in government.

* We do not have to look to the banks, or to the Scotts or the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia for signs of this trend, for this message that unless there is quick appreciation of this problem - far quicker than it would seem is applying to this present Government at the present time if the answers of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  at question time this week are any indication - we are heading for a serious economic **crisis** with rising unemployment, even worse unemployment than we are experiencing right now.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The Opposition pretends that it is gravely concerned at the unemployment **crisis** in Australia.

* Yet, we see a plundering of our resources which is reaching world **crisis** proportions and nothing is done about it.

* This is why there is a **crisis** in education at present.

* Last season an estimated crop of 470 000 tonnes would have created a **crisis** but for several factors, particularly the high incidence of downy mildew, which resulted in a crushing of 412 000 tonnes.

* This Budget will further split the nation and worsen the artificial **crisis** which has been foisted on the countryside.

* The root of the **crisis** lies in the agricultural sector.

* It is my intention to demonstrate this inter-dependence and to pose basic policies to end what is demonstrably a false **crisis**, a needless depression in the Australian countryside at this time.

* But first let us examine the papers on national income which the Treasurer used as the basis for his budgeting and then establish what the Government intends to do about the **crisis** in half the nation.

* Our present substantial overseas balances could disappear as a consequence of the present world currency **crisis** which makes the Budget already out of date.

* However, the Government is most concerned not only that there is a marketing **crisis** in the dairying industry but also that the production downturn flowing from dry conditions across most of southern Australia has led to an even lower expectation of production this year than was earlier indicated.

* As a result producers are even worse off than had been originally thought 
In conclusion let me say with all the sincerity that I have that this nation is rapidly reaching a **crisis** state in terms of its hydrocarbons, and particularly oil.

* -The new agreement will not meet the **crisis** that confronts the public housing sector in Australia.

* There is no argument at all that in relation to these costs Sydney has the greatest **crisis** of any city in the nation, particularly with respect to land costs.

* In order to assist companies to maintain their operations and to curb the employment rundown the Australian Industries Development Corporation has recommended to the Government a return to the previous annual tax payments at least until the present **crisis** is over.

* A major feature of last October's conflict in the Middle East from our strategic point of view was the manner in which the United States of America and the Soviet Union successfully managed the **crisis** in their relations and used their influence to limit the conflict.

* Secondly, we have not yet felt the impact of the oil **crisis** which will add at least $1, 250m a year to our international current account bill in 1974.

* This legislation is to that extent the victim of the domestic economic **crisis** which is occurring in Australia, no part of which has effectively been imported.

* It is not always the fault of the Government of the day that some sections of our economy are facing a **crisis**.

* The Labor Party believes that the **crisis** which would be caused by such a rejection should lead to a long term solution.

* The result of the Prime Minister's rush to judgment before next year's jobs **crisis** and economic decline is that the incoming government will, for the first seven months of its term, face a Senate elected two years ago.

* This is symptomatic of a political system in a deepening sense of **crisis**.

* Quite plainly a very severe **crisis** exists here.

* There is no sign that the Government has recognised the dimensions of the **crisis**.

* Unless the Government recognises the extent of the **crisis** and acts to stem the tide, the building industry faces years of chaos and continued decay.

* So obviously this is getting close to a **crisis** situation.

* Anybody who looks at television programmes - just to discuss as an aside the private sector of education - will have heard the Catholic Archbishop of Hobart, Guilford Young, say that 20 of his schools are bankrupt and they will have to be closed, producing a **crisis** in primary and secondary education in the State of Tasmania.

* There is a very deep-seated **crisis** in education.

* Many people regard the great urban **crisis** - as it is called - as the problem of the decade.

* Both of these factors add to the balance of payments **crisis**- that the Government had to borrow a massive $ 1,800m to $ 1,900m from abroad last year to prop up the dollar and to avoid a further devaluation.

* I think that all honourable gentlemen and ladies, irrespective of their views, will concede that that was a date when there was no **crisis**, as has been described by members on both sides of the House and indeed by every editorial observer.

* Is he aware that there is an extreme **crisis** because of under use of resources in this sector of the construction industry?

* He will be aware that the dairy industry will face a **crisis** situation after 1 July, when the present underwriting ends and the new production year begins, at least until the long term arrangements for the industry are developed after  Sir John  Crawford reports at the end of August.

* It is no good if a political **crisis** has to be generated every time there is need in the agricultural sector.

* The House is aware of the current **crisis** at the Mount Lyell company.

* On that occasion, I pointed out that a record number of our primary industries were facing an economic **crisis** and that this record sum of $21 5m would be spread out so thinly that in places it would have little or no useful effect.

* The Minister never mentioned that the people hardest hit by the **crisis** in primary industries are being bounced from the Federal Government to the State Governments and back again to the Federal Government.

* Before the recent action of the United States of America to stem its monetary **crisis** was the devaluation insurance rate fixed by the Reserve Bank at the rate of 10c per Stg100 a month?

* The article deals with the **crisis** which faces Britain's health services.

* It is premised on some basic misunderstandings of the nature of the economic **crisis** which faces the Western world and the nature of the problems which face Australian society.

* The company then telexed the Minister, repeating all these terms such as 'play down' and 'undertakings' which he had concocted with them, and requiring of him that, as the official Minister of the Government, he intercede either directly or indirectly through another department, with the PJT to apprise it as Caltex requested- the word is 'apprise'- of the issues surrounding the real supply **crisis** and how the companies were entitled to fix the precedent of recovery of premiums above the OPEC price.

* When the former Minister for External Affairs and former honourable member for Forrest,  Mr Gordon  Freeth - the present Ambassador to Japan - introduced his infamous new Government line on the proposed Soviet security treaty in the Indian Ocean, etc., in 1969, I was the first in this Parliament to place on record strong criticism of our linking ourselves in any way in  a  security treaty with the Soviet Union, just as I criticised our involvement with the United States of America in Vietnam and our involvement with the United Kingdom in the Malaysian-Indonesian **crisis**.

* Springs is growing very fast - the problem in relation to the aged and the housing and welfare of them will not reach **crisis** proportion.

* Back in 1975 in what was a fairly heated campaign, if one might say so, in what was a campaign in which the Labor Party sought to generate a phoney constitutional **crisis**, the people of Australia were looking to real value.

* I believe that this Bill will disturb every Australian who cares about the victims of the economic **crisis**.

* Let us look at the energy **crisis**.

* One of the in phrases that anyone can use is 'the energy **crisis**'.

* It can be shown that the so-called energy **crisis** in the United States of America is really a business **crisis** or, more properly, a policy **crisis**.

* The current energy **crisis** in the United States is the fifth annual energy **crisis**.

* This year, the villains are the Arabs, when in truth the largest oil companies, acting in cahoots with an administration which is now passing judgment on itself, are promoting a **crisis** in their own interests.

* Why, in the latter part of last year and in the early part of this year, did the Government permit the Reserve Bank to allow the trading banks to move into speculative investment loans whereby a liquidity **crisis** arose only to be covered by certificates of deposit at high rates of interest?

* But the point is that the job has been run in a rather ad hoc sort of method and college councils and college staff have felt over the last 3 years that almost every day brings a new **crisis**.

* All evidence suggests that a half Senate election will not resolve the present **crisis** but will merely prolong it for a further 3 months pending a dissolution.

* The **crisis** in the Australian Opera was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition.

* Did he receive reports from the Minister for Defence before he left us and the Minister for the Interior following their promise to 10,000 farmers, who marched in Melbourne to protest against the continuing **crisis** in the countryside, that they would convey to the Prime Minister without delay the farmers' protest and their request for action?

* -Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the Sente Select Committee report on the Mount Lyell **crisis** which was handed down last Friday in the Senate?

* Mi UREN (Reid) (2.24)-There is a **crisis** in the building industry.

* I have been prepared to accept the view that up to date the Government may have been wise to sit out this sort of **crisis**.

* The Government has not stumbled into a constitutional **crisis** on the floor of the House.

* The present Government **crisis** has been produced by one simple fact - the disintegration of Cabinet government in this country.

* This Bill we have before us is just another example of the ricocheting from one **crisis** to another which is the story of Commonwealth-State relationships, and we hardly even get the chance to discuss the sad position of local government finances in this Parliament unless the matter is brought forward as a matter of public importance by the Labor Opposition.

* I hope that from the year 1971-72 onwards we will have more formal relationships and that we will not be ricocheting from one **crisis** to another in this field and that we will not have Bills such as this one being brought up in the dying, hours of the sittings.

* Can we really believe that such excessive sensitivity is helpful, that impartiality conquers all, that the best contribution we can make to resolving the Middle East **crisis** is to shut not one but both eyes to it?

* But the refugees can and must be settled and rehabilitated and, indeed, this is the only long term and permanent solution to Arab terrorism as well as the overall Middle East **crisis**.

* Yet only one of them, the rural **crisis**, had even a passing reference in tonight's report by the Prime Minister and none of them was actually assisted by his tour.

* The simple truth of the matter is that what this Government has determined upon is not merely to create in Australia a state of bungle by accident; it has set about creating a state of economic **crisis** by purpose.

* I hope the Government will approach those three years with that principle pre-eminently in mind because throughout the world democratic party systems are going through a time of very great **crisis**.

* Many things are the legacy of the Hayden Budget and one of these unfortunately is that the Hayden Budget in its overall contract produced a housing and accommodation **crisis**.

* According to the ABC he criticised the Federal Government, saying that it was creating a long term defence **crisis** by adopting short term policies.

* In support of my remarks on health let me refer to the fact that some weeks ago a number of doctors in Queensland sent a petition to the Director-General in Queensland stating that there is a **crisis** in this region; that there is an urgent need to improve the situation by taking health care away from the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islander Advancement and giving it to some more appropriate department.

* But at present, with coming recessions, the energy **crisis** and rapidly increasing unemployment throughout the world it is important that we look at the purchasing power of other nations.

* Everywhere the city Is in **crisis**.

* It is well known that in the event of any international **crisis**, if we as a nation are committed to war, the CMF would form the bulk of the Army.

* Islam's resurgence internationally is related to the oil **crisis** of 1973.

* Acting in concert, these countries caused an international economic **crisis**.

* But it could be considered unlucky because the Corporation walked straight into an almost **crisis** situation.

* I would appeal to the Ministers in the State Government and also to our Federal Ministers to act upon that provision more in the future because in my area the beef **crisis** is very real indeed.

* I add that in the sort of world in which we are living at the moment - a world where there is an energy **crisis** - it is plain to people who look at the problem that it is quite possible, in the near future, that Australia will not be able to import the fuel that it needs.

* The last point I wish to nail is this so-called energy **crisis**.

* The Minister persistently uses the words 'energy **crisis**'.

* There is no **crisis** in energy throughout the world; the **crisis** is in the shortage of liquid fuel.

* In no way would uranium mining or a nuclear power industry assist in the liquid fuel **crisis**.

* In fact the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development sees this socalled 'energy **crisis**' around the world as a magnification of the energy problem.

* The statement of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations about the seriousness of the Australian unemployment **crisis** is a dramatic admission of the failure of the Government's economic policies.

* They find that when they can borrow money - there is a shortage of money because the Government has created a liquidity **crisis** - the cost of land has gone up, the cost of building has increased and the amount they borrow leaves a deposit gap between what they have to pay and what they can borrow.

* We realise that because of the oil **crisis** and the slowdown in economic activity in, for .example, Japan, the housewife in Japan has less disposable income with which to buy foodstuffs.

* While arguments in favour of solar energy are attractive, the plain fact of the matter is that this energy source is not capable of commercially meeting the energy **crisis** which is looming large as the world's oil sources dry up.

* -Is the Minister for Trade and Resources aware of the **crisis** in the southern and western coalfields of New South Wales?

* The present **crisis** was prompted by the former military dictator coming back to the country.

* The political lesson is simple in theory, but difficult to apply: We approach **crisis** as an independent nation, attempting to exercise our own judgment in the best interests.

* Since the Board's financial **crisis** stems from this Government's high interest policy, can the increase in water rates be avoided by a Commonwealth grant?

* I mentioned overseas capital, questions relating to national development, education, the **crisis** in the primary industries, the need for a real policy of decentralisation of population, the need to deal with urban problems, the need to deal with immigration and the need to achieve a national identity which involves the quality of life and films which we make ourselves.

* The only time there was an increase in the pension rate was when there was an election or a **crisis** in the Party.

* As such it provides an important stimulus for that industry to recover from its current state of **crisis**.

* I ask the Minister for Education: Has the pattern of grants for education by the Australian Government produced the **crisis** in education in New South Wales alleged by the New South Wales Minister for Education,  Sir Eric  Willis, or is this another attempt by a State Minister to blame the inadequacies of his administration upon the Australian Government?

* Australia has an energy **crisis**, but what is the Leader of the Opposition saying?

* Is that the way to resolve our energy **crisis**?

* We discover that the import bill for August is the highest for any month in the year and the balance of payments deficit the worst since the great constitutional **crisis** of December 1975.

* The particular **crisis** facing the industry today has been caused by these contracting markets in addition to a huge increase in dairy farmers' production costs and in factory costs.

* I have mentioned some of the reasons for the **crisis** in the dairy industry.

* Throughout our economic **crisis** the Government's chief weapon has been the lie.

* The **crisis** of confidence amongst businessmen in AlburyWodonga is a consequence of this Government's vacillation as the future of that growth centre is already evident.

* Does the Treasurer know of reasons for a statement that there are mounting signs of a coming global financial and monetary **crisis** which could wreck the economy of the world?

* None of the quiet tedium that we have heard from the honourable gentleman today can hide the simple fact that this country is, and has been for some considerable period, in a position of economic **crisis** and chaos; that this chaos has been perpetrated by the Labor Government of which he is now the most senior Minister with financial responsibility; that the Government does not have the policies or the capacity to resolve the problems which mount as the days and months go by; and that this Government should resign while it still retains a modicum of respectability throughout the Australian community.

* I should like to refer to the energy **crisis**, the problem of the Aboriginal settlement at Mornington Island and, finally, the urgent need for a national youth community cadet scheme to assist in the evergrowing problem of youth employment which simply will not go away.

* Bearing in mind that impartiality between the communities in Lebanon is very important, but that humane and timely aid to the people is even more important, will the Australian Government encourage and even support nonGovernment welfare organisations to dispatch medical teams to Lebanon, to work in any areas where they are needed and welcomed, as recommended in the report entitled 'The Lebanon **Crisis**- Humanitarian Aspects' tabled in December 1976 by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.

* In November 1975 the Leader of the Opposition proposed to resolve the Supply **crisis** by having a half Senate election.

* That is why we face this **crisis** situation now.

* There are no 'instant coffee' solutions to the land **crisis**.

* We are aware that there is a world fuel **crisis**.

* With the present world energy **crisis** and with Australia's huge deposits of coal, whereby we can generate our own electricity and provide our own means of motivation for rail transport we should be getting on with the job instead of allocating such paltry amounts.

* On 13 November 1972 the then Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Whitlam,  put the following questions to the Australian people: 'Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into **crisis** after **crisis**, embarrassment piled on embarrassment week after week?

* Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week 's **crisis**, next week 's blunder? '

* This is a government in **crisis**; it is a government split by deep and bitter division.

* The energy **crisis** internationally had only a limited impact on the Australian economy.

* There is a **crisis** of confidence in South Australia.

* The only obstacle that is holding up investment and development in South Australia, as the  Deputy  Prime Minister has made clear, is the State Government's ban on uranium and the Government's consistent obdurate refusal to apply the normal principles of a free enterprise environment which will enable that State to get up and go- 
Deficiencies in our urban public transport systems have been at **crisis** level for several years.

* As is outlined in the speech delivered by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  today nuclear energy is the only viable alternative that most countries have available to meet their essential needs of electrical energy in the wake of the oil **crisis**.

* The present mock **crisis** has been orecipitated by the actions of 2 New South Wales health funds, the Medical Benefits Fund and the Hospitals Contributions Fund, plus several other smaller societies.

* We have seen in this Budget more than any other probably this Government relying more and more on some sort of faith in the free market process to bring the economy out of the present incredible **crisis**.

* I ask the honourable gentleman whether he said to the Young Labor Association conference on 25 January of this year that excessive wage demands had caused Australia's unemployment and inflation **crisis**?

* The Labor Party did not believe at the time of the **crisis** that troops should be used in the Gazelle Peninsula and in the final analysis they were not.

* The initial Press **crisis** is one in which the former Prime Minister, like the flowers that bloom in the spring, has nothing to do with the case.

* Australia has argued strongly within the present series of MTN discussions, as well as bilaterally, for increased liberalisation of import trade barriers and domestic dairy support and export regimes, especially by the EEC, Japan, Canada and the United States whose dairy policies collectively have been a major factor in the present **crisis** in the world dairy market.

* It was a product of the **crisis** in Commonwealth-State financial relations and like most things conceived in haste in eventually turned out to be illegitimate.

* It is a sad commentary because I understand that it was written prior to the second 1974 Budget and prior to the deepening unemployment **crisis**.

* What action does the Government intend to take to assist the people of Queenstown in their present **crisis**?

* Delays of up to 14 days were common and that **crisis** lasted for a few weeks only.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* That might turn sour for the Prime Minister simply because it is the collective opinion of sporting organisations around Australia that the condition of sport in this country has reached **crisis** proportions.

* The meetings were held because of the present **crisis** in the industry.

* I refer to the **crisis** in the Middle East.

* But the matters that I propose in this motion are relevant to our main responsibilities as members of Parliament and we would be recreant to those responsibilites if we did not consider them in the present frightening state of **crisis**.

* If nuclear energy is denied to the world there will be an energy **crisis** and a starvation **crisis** and all the tensions which can lead to war.

* I can assure the honourable member that it will be the intention of this Government to overcome the inflationary **crisis** that is wrecking the whole social and economic structure of this country.

* I, like other honourable members and concerned people, am worried that very often in debates such as this we talk a lot about the environment and create the illusion that a great deal is being done when in fact little is being done and that which is being achieved is often being achieved in a **crisis** atmosphere; where large sums of money are needed to save something in respect of which the public conscience cries out that it should be saved.

* .Australia is having difficulty with employment and economic **crisis** seems endemic.

* The honourable member for Riverina went on to illustrate the position of a family enterprise which as a result of this **crisis** - and 1 presume he is talking about the **crisis** we have heard him to be so vocal about in recent times - sees the end of an occupancy of a farm after 5 generations of, I presume, ownership.

* I conclude by drawing attention to this paradox: We are faced with the strong possibility of disaster from a world ecological **crisis**, but little danger from foreign invasion.

* The Japanese and United States energy **crisis** has been canvassed widely.

* Some writers are now suggesting that the United States may not face an energy **crisis** for 15 years and that there may not be a major foreign policy problem for the United States if that country follows less inept policies.

* director of the United Nations resources department, recently stated that what the United States faces now is 'not a **crisis** of resources, but a lack of planned development'.

* Failing that, the **crisis** will be all too real for every country.

* With costs continually rising and the salaries of teachers increasing, a **crisis** has developed in independent schools in many of our states and Ml credit is owing to the Minister for Education and Science, who is now at the table, and particularly the Prime Minister for the emergency action that they took so that the schools would know what they were able to do in the new term which was to open early in the new year.

* When called upon in times of **crisis**  Sir Owen  Dixon served with equally great distinction in other spheres.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to weekend Press reports that the Kangaroo Point shipyard of Evans Deakin Industries Ltd faces a **crisis** which could result in the closure of the yard and the resultant unemployment of up to 1,500 skilled shipyard workers?

* How serious was the Prime Minister when he expressed concern in New York about the world food **crisis** and Australia's capacity to produce more grain?

* Does the Prime Minister agree that such an increase- 
That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare In the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* They are even used by officials during times of **crisis**.

* Of course, this situation is related to the fact that there is a **crisis** in the steel industry.

* Revolution in an advanced capitalist country can become a possibility only if there is a serious economic **crisis**.

* I conclude my contribution to the Budget debate by saying that the Labor Government has created that serious economic **crisis** and that there are some people in the trade union movement with political beliefs of a communist philosophy who are exploiting it to the utmost to bring about that quiet revolution and to destroy free enterprise in this country so that a climate is created where ALP socialism will be the only alternative because private enterprise will no longer be.

* On how many occasions during the 3 years of Labor Government did the honourable member for Port Adelaide speak on the **crisis** in the Australian shipbuilding industry?

* For example, the present **crisis** in the Administrative College in which over half of its staff is about to resign seems due to the application of an Australian perspective to the role of a public servant.

* More than at any time, I believe, since Federation Australia needs to re-examine and learn the lessons of the constitutional **crisis** of 1975 and to make sure that that dark day- 11 November- is never repeated in this country.

* There is cause for real concern in the approach of this Government to the coming **crisis**.

* The Minister says that his project will meet our **crisis**.

* It is quite obvious to me that there is very much a **crisis** of confidence in the industry.

* This **crisis** is caused not only by confusion over present policy, but by uncertainty over future policy.

* What is clear to all of us is that we are facing a real **crisis** of unknown proportions.

* The time to start equipping ourselves to cope with that **crisis** is now.

* Today they are deemed to be due to the oil **crisis**.

* We met the oil **crisis** and the oil hike of 1973.

* Nobody gave us the excuse that inflation was due to the oil **crisis**.

* Honourable members on the Government side need not come in here and bleat about the Government's troubles being due to the fact that the rural man is doing well and that there is a sudden oil **crisis**.

* Two of the most urgent needs are an all out effort to reopen Australia's major beef market and in the meantime provision of finance to carry producers through the **crisis** period.

* In an article titled 'An Ecological **Crisis**' published this year in the 'Professional Engineer', it is claimed that the Aswan High Dam in Egypt appears to be an ecological disaster.

* The article slates: 
It is true that administration expenses are to be the responsibility of the States, but the objective of the scheme is to ensure that primary producers will be able to have some opportunity within this amount to embark on rehabilitation at a time when the rural **crisis** generally has so adversely affected them.

* One of the first crises- it was a period of **crisis** in the Labor Party at that time- that confronted Caucus when I was first a member of it was whether we would allow the postal charges to pass in the Budget session.

* Surely, as Laski went on to write, the mere fact that we do not know the limits of the royal power, that it remains to be invoked on one side or the other in the twilight zone of **crisis**, is sufficient evidence to indicate the difficulties of the position.

* We also are not in a position to oversee the proper development of our energy resources, not only to protect Australia from the energy **crisis**, but also to see that our major trading partners are given as much assistance as is commensurate with Australia's domestic requirements.

* For the wool industry, with market uncertainty, seasonal unpredictability and the cost increases induced by Labor caused inflation, the **crisis** ahead is such that we certainly cannot bear that sort of practice once more.

* In view of the answer given earlier today by the Minister for Minerals and Energy, I now ask the Prime Minister: In view of the fact that the Royal Commission detailed no action to overcome fuel shortages quickly through rationalisation of deliveries, will he immediately take action to set up an emergency committee involving the oil companies, distributors and sellers in order to speed deliveries and so protect the livelihood of many Australians affected by this **crisis** in the areas where fuel supplies are now exhausted?

* The nation has another **crisis** on its hands- at least there could be another one by now, I have not checked the newspapers during the last hour.

* There are evident today world-wide classical symptoms of an economic **crisis**.

* This hill-billy government with its hill-billy economics is more ill equipped to face a major **crisis** than any former Australian administration.

* There is no **crisis** on this occasion.

* Who would have thought that in a matter of a few months we would have seen the wool industry completely united and the Government acting in such time to try to meet the **crisis** that the industry is facing?

* The beef industry is now going through a **crisis** which will require for a long term solution- short term patching up methods may be possible- a totally new approach to marketing of beef whereby the producer sells his beef at a price, not in an auction where he takes what is offered.

* There is no place for scabs in a situation of national **crisis**.

* The energy **crisis** of the present time has not occurred only over the last 2 or 3 weeks with the diplomacy used by Arab states in making their message known to the states of Europe, to Japan or to any other country.

* We saw the uncertainty of three Treasurers, ministerial sackings and the then Government going from one **crisis** to another.

* I ask the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development whether he has noted a statement by the Victorian Minister for State Development and Decentralisation that the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation faces a cash **crisis** and will be out of money in a few days' time because of a delay in the signing of the appropriate financial agreement.

* Firstly, it is nonsense to suggest that nuclear energy is a permanent answer to the world 's energy **crisis**.

* So we would have no permanent solution to the energy **crisis**; all we would have would be a permanent poisoning of the whole of the earth's surface and a permanent risk to future generations yet unborn, for thousands of yearshundreds of thousands of years- to come.

* Once that is done we have a permanent answer to our energy **crisis**.

* As the Government fumbles with ihe economic policy, willi the automation **crisis** and with job pressure from imports, it still wants to give the impression that the unemployed are to blame.

* Sinclair) as far as it goes, indicating that another $1.5m in food, shelter and medical supplies is being donated by the Australian Government to assist in this **crisis**.

* This expenditure has meant that all sorts of development projects in India have had to go by the board because that country's budgetary effort has been distorted by this sudden and unexpected expenditure on 9 million people who haderupted over their borders into India as a result of the **crisis** in East Pakistan.

* That seemed to me to be one of the valuable features of the aid that was given by Australia in that earlier **crisis**.

* But I ask that there be a restoration of the idea of adequacy of effort which seemed to me to be one of the characteristics of a former Foreign Minister when this sort of **crisis** occurred.

* I would remind honourable members that the Chifley Government during the time of Britain's **crisis** put through United Kingdom aid Acts amounting to 45 m in the days when the basic wage was 4 5s a week.

* My worry is that the **crisis** conditions in the supply of teachers at the moment are such that I would have rather seen a much more systematic study of what was required and then an indication placed before this Parliament of what the dimensions of the problem are.

* The massive increase in oil prices by the members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1973, the food **crisis** of 1973-74 and shortages of some basic raw materials created a feeling of insecurity on the part of many importing countries about the supply of essential primary products.

* The suggestion made by  Mr Nixon  (Country Party, Victoria) in the House of Representatives that the proposed increases in postal charges should be deferred until their effects on inflation could be determined is one of the few sane suggestions which has been made in Canberra with regard to the current economic **crisis** and the shock minibudget designed to deal with it.

* The oil **crisis** of 1973 precipitated the fundamental recognition that the world was facing an energy **crisis**.

* The recent events in Iran, as I have just said, have confirmed that the energy **crisis** is still a fact of life.

* The simple fact is that nuclear energy is the only readily available alternative most countries have to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the oil **crisis**.

* The world energy **crisis** has meant that adjustment must be made to other sources of energy in the wake of dwindling world supplies of petroleum.

* The Catholic education on the central coast of New South Wales is approaching a **crisis** situation and will need very heavy support from both the State and Commonwealth Governments if it is to survive.

* It states: 
Public housing policy has long been aimed at several worthy objectives; basically these are: redistribution to the poor via permanent habitation at concessional prices and rentals; rescue in emergencies for households or individuals at some point of **crisis**; the provision of choice of habitation, especially for the poor, by increasing low cost options and keeping the market diverse and competitive.

* The Government is conducting a blatant program to cover up the real extent of the unemployment **crisis**.

* The world economy has been shaken by the energy **crisis**, inflation and severe recession, and both our economies have suffered as a result- more so than most other developed countries.

* The million or more people who read the "Sun" every day are under no illusions now about Sydney's homes **crisis**.

* Or is the **crisis** due to the Fraser Governmentpromoted stagnation in another way?

* Almost every significant **crisis** in the world today can be traced back to the political incompetence of Western nations this century.

* The **crisis** of conscience was the war in Vietnam.

* The **crisis** of conscience was not conscription, not military service, but participation in the Vietnam war.

* I must say that I regret the rather macabre way in which these programs are being portrayed on television, yet perhaps in the result there might be a recognition by many who see their meat only hanging in a butchers shop or in a supermarket deep freeze of the very real **crisis** that prevails in many of the farming areas of Australia.

* So, as I have said, the research on our speeches, the seeking of solutions to the great problems - and I could mention Commonwealth-State relations, the improved Government performance that is needed, and the **crisis** in the countryside - and all the necessary study and reading which go with these functions and with these problems are relatively neglected.

* Warwick Fairfax and many others - to stab his enemies for him while Billy waited in the background until the **crisis** which others had precipitated came to a solution.

* If we are to avoid the impending transport **crisis** of the next decade it is vital that our urban public transport investment program begun in 1973 be restored.

* A matter of public importance was moved by the Australian Labor Party at the time of the Harrisburg **crisis** but this is the first time this issue has been raised.

* Today there is need for protection of industry and probably more so while the international currency **crisis** is going on and while there are uncertainties about trade because all sorts of unfair and devious practices will come into being.

* I have heard of a world **crisis**.

* We are fast reaching a **crisis** situation.

* That Government has not shown one skerrick of concern, one bit of indication that one solitary initiative is to be taken to cope with the present **crisis**.

* The matters that have been discussed this afternoon all add up to the fact that there is a **crisis** in housing.

* Port Huon Waterside Workers have responded to the urgent **crisis** in the Export Industry with a sustained high loading rate and careful handling which makes this the best port in the Commonwealth for the export of apples.

* If that decision were, correct for our currency, at the time, which undoubtedly the Government thought it was, following the **crisis** with respect to the strong currencies, notably the United States devaluation which had an appreciating effect of about 11.01 per cent on Australian currency, how could it possibly be right to do nothing then?

* You have stopped oil exploration in this country when there has been an international oil **crisis**.

* As the season progressed the market strengthened considerably and in the last 3 months of the season the Corporation's purchases averaged only 10 per cent of offering and at one stage in June, just before the temporary **crisis** over the guaranteed price, the Corporation was buying only 3 per cent of the total wool at sales in late May or early June of this year.

* First, the Fraser Government's abandonment of national responsibility for water is not a temporary departure because of the present economic **crisis**.

* a great deal of doubt should be cast on the representativeness of Government members when educational matters are being debated.It becomes far more understandable that over the past decade they have denied the existence of a **crisis** in State education.

* I want to assure the people there that as far as I am concerned there will be no personal attacks because I believe that the Labor Party's policy will stand on its own feet and that this Government will be condemned for the economic **crisis** in this country.

* If at the same time it imposes cuts upon the States so that they cannot supply these services it is merely producing a **crisis**.

* It is becoming increasingly clear to the people of this country that the poor state of the economy, which was accepted to be the case in December 1975, at the time of the election, was due not to policies of the Labor Government but to the world economic **crisis** which had overtaken all the developed and under-developed nations.

* Of course it was precisely because a previous Administration took no account of the economic consequences of its decisions that Australia got into such very great difficulties when oil search was stopped dead at the very time when there was a major oil **crisis** in the world, when mineral development and exploration were stopped dead, and when manufacturers in Australia lost their domestic and overseas markets as a result of most rampant inflation.

* -The estimates for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which are before the Committee are indicative of the totally inadequate response of the Fraser Government to the **crisis** situation that exists in our community in respect of unemployment.

* What is the financial **crisis** today?

* I remind the House that that period from 1972 to 1975 was a period of great **crisis** for home owners in Australia and for the housing industry.

* There would have been a tremendous outflow of funds from various institutions, and we would have had a real liquidity **crisis** on our hands.

* Is there a **crisis** of business and consumer confidence in South Australia?

* The failure of the Government to deal with the **crisis** of growing unemployment.

* If so, does the Minister recognise the appeal in the concluding paragraphs as directed at the Government to avert a **crisis** of waning morale, adequacy and efficacy in Australia's health services, research and teaching as compared with those of Britain and the United States.

* Has his attention been drawn to statements by the Annual Conference of the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce that Australia has reached a **crisis** point in worn tyre disposals and that motorists will be expected to pay for tyre disposals.

* I have provided detailed statistics on the growing housing **crisis** in Australia, especially for low and lower-middle income earners.

* There is a real **crisis** situation, and we have to make housing available for those people.

* Now that the Government has refused to intervene in a shipping dispute that has had far reaching effects on wheat payments that are so urgently needed in this time of financial **crisis** - as the Minister for Transport told the honourable member for Mallee yesterday - will the Minister take up with the Minister for Agriculture the problems of delayed wheat payments with a view to trying to alleviate the serious financial position of primary producers created, first, by government policy and, secondly, by another industrial dispute?

* As a nation we are now confronted with massive inflation and severe economic instability, the highest interest rates since federation, excessive increases in direct and indirect taxation, a **crisis** in the housing industry unparalleled since the immediate postwar period, record levels of industrial unrest, a severely reduced defence capability, a massive erosion of the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners, uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries, an immigration policy which has heaped confusion upon confusion and a breakdown in communication between the Government and the major constituent groups in the Australian community.

* The Government's ill conceived economic policies have also precipitated a serious **crisis** in the Australian housing industry.

* The **crisis** facing India and Pakistan is the frightening prospect of a war.

* The Press statement made by the Minister for Health a little while ago tonight indicates that the **crisis** in medical research will continue in this country.

* He has not solved the medical **crisis** now and, by moving the allocation of some of the $1.7m extra forward from the end of the next triennium to the beginning of that triennium, he will only accentuate another medical research **crisis** in 1978, the last year of the 1976-78 triennium, without solving the medical **crisis** at the moment.

* In other words, the lack of adequate controls and protection for the investor has led to a **crisis** of confidence where Australians would rather save than invest in Australian enterprises.

* This is a government deep in **crisis**.

* The political **crisis** in Iran led to a cessation in oil supplies from a nation which last year produced 10 per cent of the world's oil supply.

* The **crisis** in Iran has inevitably affected decisions about other energy resources such as coal and uranium.

* The United States, Japan and Western Europe are now likely to expand their coal programs to reduce dependence on oil more quickly than would have been expected before the **crisis**.

* While the **crisis** in Iran graphically shows some of the hazards in predicting the energy outlook, there are other complexities which could affect the situation.

* Even at this late stage there is still time for the Government to ensure that Australia need not fear the energy **crisis** which threatens to become a common occurrence for the remainder of this century, but it will have to do a lot better than produce a document that might as well have been written by oil companies in board rooms.

* It reads: 
Do the problems created by the **crisis** in East Pakistan and the influx of refugees into India threaten the maintenance of international peace and security in the terms of Article II (2) of the United Nations Charter.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Has the Minister for Transport any plans to relieve the Bass Strait shipping freight **crisis**?

* An admitted official figure of 445,000 unemployed can be seen only as a national **crisis**.

* It is only that part of the unemployment **crisis** that refuses to be submerged by the Government's crude campaign of bluster and moral blackmail against so called 'dole bludgers' and its continual fiddling of the figures.

* As I have pointed out, this is only part of the story, part of the **crisis** of unemployment in Australia.

* The unemployment **crisis** is more than just a matter of depressing statistics.

* The Prime Minister called in aid the oil **crisis** of 1973.

* The world faces not so much an energy **crisis** as an oil **crisis**.

* This reacts against beef producers, particularly in a time of **crisis**, and represents another bashing of primary industry.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in tha South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* They have left the **crisis** at home.

* Mr 
But the question is why has this matter suddenly erupted in the Parliament at a time when the Parliament is in the grip of constitutional **crisis**, at a time when the Opposition has a special visitor- a privileged visitor; its star performer in Australia-  Mr Khemlani.

* You are the people who are presenting a **crisis** to the social and economic fabric of this nation.

* Instead of resolving this issue, instead of facing up to the reality that the irresponsible behaviour of the Opposition is bringing this country to a halt, is precipitating a situation of social and economic **crisis**, the Opposition spends its time threshing about like a whale that has been beached, looking for some sort of escape from the trap that it has set for itself.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that the deep **crisis** in which the New South Wales building industry finds itself seems certain to worsen because of the recent Budget cutbacks in Government spending.

* Such a Budget would be appropriate to an economy where private sector spending is about to go into an inflationary spiral or where the economy must be brought to a full stop to avert a balance of payments **crisis**.

* This nation is facing a national **crisis**.

* That **crisis**, beyond doubt and despite what honourable members opposite say, is in the conservation of water.

* The economic **crisis** is now to hit the student campus and the casualties will be from the lower income families.

* If the Commonwealth was properly concerned about economic barriers to higher education, the plight of many students and families and the **crisis** in universities finance, it would do precisely the opposite - it would subsidise universities that kept fees down.

* The Middle East has never posed a mere regional threat; the implication always has been of a world **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* I rise because of my great concern at the shameful attitude of the Government in the present **crisis** facing nursing homes in Australia.

* A major **crisis** confronts patients, staff and the management of these homes.

* Unless this is done, there will be a **crisis** of proportions that could not really be imagined and the hardship that will follow from it will be extreme indeed.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* What we get is an exercise in the politics of confrontation, an almost lunatic determination to build the Newport power station at all costs, to the extent that the issue has become the focus of **crisis** in Victoria.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land- Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Australian manufacturing industry is in acute financial **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The Commission considers that the Australian Government should examine the possibility of prescribing export abattoirs affected by the **crisis** in the beef industry as qualifying for assistance under the SANMA scheme.

* We have a criss-cross - I was about to say a **crisis** - of wheat trade outside the Board and outside the Government.

* It reads: 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the recent International Energy Agency report which confirms authoritative predictions of a world liquid fuel **crisis** at about the year 1985.

* Those of us who have occupied that position know that the House often tumbles quickly into a state of **crisis**.

* Although the Standing Orders are written in ex- quisitely fine language, sometimes the nuances of tern are difficult to understand in a time of **crisis**.

* Senator J.  McClelland, confirmed the unemployment **crisis** by firmly predicting that 400 000 Australians would be out of work in the new year.

* At the root of the economic **crisis** is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector.

* It is quite clear that the energy price **crisis** has re-opened a series of previously unquestioned assumptions about the most efficient forms of transport to undertake different transport tasks.

* At a time when it is critical to have effective transport systems, each of the major systems, it might be argued, faces some sort of **crisis**.

* There is no doubt that the rail industry in this country, taken as a whole, is in a state of very serious **crisis**.

* This **crisis** cannot be separated from the more general economic **crisis** which we, as a nation, face.

* The railways are part of what might be described as a more general public sector **crisis**.

* After the 1978 international monetary **crisis**, world finance problems and instability gave rise to a major explosion in international shipping rates.

* The extent of the **crisis** that faces their industry is reflected in their willingness to take direct action, as will be seen by the trucks parked at the front of Parliament House.

* I emphasise that point because it is being recognised increasingly that the contraction of rail systems over extremely long periods- the contraction has accelerated in recent years- in terms of the mounting energy **crisis** whereby the shift will be more and more from the use of liquid fuels to the use of coal, will increasingly become critical in the future.

* Excessive union wage demands have caused Australia's unemployment and inflation **crisis**.

* Will he release any vacant dwellings leased by his Department in Sydney's western suburbs for urgently needed **crisis** accommodation for the civilian population.

* They indicate a complete social **crisis** in the countryside.

* Business has been falling off in recent years no doubt largely due to high charges and the fact that a severe rural **crisis** has curtailed spending in all fields.

* Second, there is the continuing currency **crisis**.

* We all hope that the current meeting in Rome of the Group of Ten will see a clear advance towards a satisfactory outcome of the present **crisis**.

* The people of Australia sense that they are living in the shadows of a world economic **crisis** of proportions not faced since the depression years of the 1930s.

* The actions of the Senate had caused a constitutional **crisis** and one man made a decision to dismiss the duly elected Government.

* I again repeat that the Opposition believes that the Government has at last realised that there is a rural **crisis** in certain sections of primary industry.

* It has waited until a **crisis** has occurred and until large numbers of primary producers were either bankrupt or on the verge of bankruptcy or until they found themselves in an intolerable debt position from which it was impossible to recover.

* The Government should put forward policies immediately and not wait until a major **crisis** develops.

* Will the Prime Minister consider making a statement explaining the attitude of the Government in matters relating to the international monetary **crisis**?

* Are there any examples in the world scene of a currency **crisis** that has been affected by unwise remarks by political figures?

* the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system and 
Ministry what is happening, because it is quite obvious from the way in which they talk that they do not know - and they certainly do not know in relation to this **crisis** that is before us today.

* What has been done to meet the **crisis** of literacy by pointing out that in some comparable countries such as New Zealand or the United Kingdom things are even worse.

* Today I have merely attempted to bring the current **crisis** concerning literacy to the attention of the House.

* In the latter part of last year we had an energy **crisis** due to circumstances beyond the control of anyone within Australia.

* However, as a result, Australia has been in a more favourable position than most comparable nations during this **crisis**.

* He also said he feared the party was becoming identified with those who thought subsidies to inefficient farmers were a solution to the rural **crisis**.

* Australia can avoid the energy and oil **crisis** affecting the United States with long term planning now .

* The result was that the Liberal Party had a **crisis** of confidence within its own ranks and nearly brought its own Prime Minister down on a no confidence motion in this House.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability,.

* The simple truth is that we face a plethora of crises instead of one readily identifiable **crisis**, such as the World Wars or the depression, that faced past Labor governments.

* So far as the economic **crisis** is concerned, he has been telling the nation that we are about to climb out of the trough.

* Is it proud of the inflation, the high unemployment and the economic **crisis** that exists in this country?

* There have been 4 great errors of policy which have led directly and inevitably to the unemployment **crisis**.

* Australia's inflationary difficulties are rapidly reaching **crisis** pro portions.

* the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of the constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian parliamentary system and 
I now refer to the second part of the amendment to the effect that the Governor-General's Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the constitutional **crisis**.

* Either those on the other side believe that there was no constitutional **crisis**; either they believe that the GovernorGeneral at any time can willy-nilly dismiss the government of the day- a government properly elected, properly in office, never having acted illegally- or they must concede that there was a constitutional **crisis** that had to be resolved by the Governor-General.

* If they believe- from the words of my friends in the National Country Party, or whatever that party calls itself this week- that there was a constitutional **crisis**, it seems to me that they ought to set about doing something to correct that situation.

* If honourable members opposite are sincere about ensuring that **crisis** does not arise again, will they agree to support a proposition that there be a joint sitting of the Houses prior to an election.

* If we have to face some kind of **crisis** then what sort Qf reserves do we have?

* We came to office after 23 years in a time of international economic **crisis**; after 18 months our term was cut short.

* Of course this was a recognition of the **crisis** which exists in the countryside at the present time, lt was an acknowledgment of the difficulties which are being experienced internally.

* In view of the fact that it is a component of rural industry and that the **crisis** in the countryside has now spread to the cities, we should place it on record in this debate that the Australian agricultural machinery industry faces the retrenchment of 14,000 men this year as a result not only of imports but of the continuing rural **crisis**.

* Yet if the present **crisis** is allowed to continue it could mean the complete extinction of the Australian controlled agricultural machinery industry.

* I say that with due weight and seriousness, because the components of the industry have said that they are feeling the Weight of the **crisis** in the countryside and they are feeling the weight of interests that would be quite happy to take them over Australia exports nearly $8m worth of agricultural machinery.

* Today its turnover is down by half and its work force is rationed as far as employment is concerned because of the situation and the **crisis** which exists in the countryside.

* The challenge to end the **crisis** in the countryside is clear and urgent, as my colleague the honourable member for Dawson has pointed out, not only in the interests of the countryside itself but in the interests of city workers and city industries such as we are talking about at the present time.

* As I pointed out, the rural **crisis** is hitting not only the farmers but country businessmen and employees.

* So I submit that this is not just a rural **crisis**.

* It is a national **crisis**.

* Is it suggesting that this will meet the **crisis** in the agricultural machinery industry and the nation?

* In the article by Peter Samuel in the Sydney 'Bulletin' which touched off the **crisis** in the Government, and which was held by Peter Samuel to have been inspired by the former Minister for Defence, now the Minister for Education and Science  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  it was said that Cabinet was indifferent to the fate of the Army in Vietnam.

* But by intervening on the broad mainland of Asia and not merely on the peninsula where there could be an end to the military line, by violating the simple principle of not interfering with a government that was in existence and viable - imagine the British in the days of the Raj overthrowing any maharaja who was a loyal ally - and by doing that with Diem, the United States helped to create the **crisis** for which they have paid a very high price in blood in their efforts to solve.

* Until the 'oil **crisis**' of 1973-74 it was widely assumed that growing world demand could and would be satisfied from established sources of supply without major upheavals.

* A number of countries have, under the impact of the oil **crisis**, adopted objectives of energy 'self-reliance', 'energy independence', or 'greater self-sufficiency' in energy.

* Today has been a day of **crisis** for the Government.

* Really it is to be described as an international exchange **crisis**.

* With the current dollar-yen currency **crisis**, if the Budget had not contained the provision for a 36c deficiency payment scheme which has brought stability into the industry, I believe there would be absolute chaos and panic in the wool industry in Australia at the present moment.

* Also a retraining scheme for young people displaced in the rural **crisis** will be introduced this session.

* We should consider seriously those people displaced by the rural **crisis** who are too old to be retrained.

* The 'West Australian' of 18th February, under the heading 'Worse Jobs **Crisis** Seen In Building', stated: 
I address a question to the Treasurer which is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Sydney.

* Will the Government ensure that in the present world financial **crisis** Australia follows the strengthening British pound' and that it does not follow deflationary currencies?

* This is an election vear and, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, the **crisis** in our cities and the future role of the ^Federal Government in relation to that **crisis** are major issues.

* Any developed nation which has 93,000 applicants for Housing Commission or public housing is facing  a  **crisis**.

* -Let me put the point that this power would be exercised only in a **crisis** situation, which the honourable gentleman has himself admitted could arise.

* Arising out of the November **crisis** and the sacking of the Whitlam Government, has the parliamentary system failed?

* -I present the interim report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on its inquiry into the Lebanon **crisis**.

* In view of the fact that the only hope of implementing a price-wage freeze is by gaining the co-operation of the trade unions, and because of the fact that  Mr Hawke,  whatever his political colour or motives were, was at that time trying to mediate in the crippling Victorian petrol **crisis**, can the Prime Minister tell me in all seriousness why he chose yesterday to make his attacks and how those attacks will help to bring about closer relations between the Government and the trade union movement?

* Australia could well be heading for a **crisis** if we do not take significant steps to expand our construction force.

* The reference to sub-committee B was to investigate the domestic **crisis** in Lebanon and its significance to the Middle East situation.

* Because of the hostilities existing at the time in Lebanon the Committee gave priority to investigating humanitarian aspects of the Lebanon **crisis**, and a report was presented to Parliament on 2 December 1976.

* I wish to acknowledge your telegram of 19 August 1974 concerning the current fuel **crisis**.

* The failure of the Government to provide effective remedies to overcome the private sector investment **crisis**.

* -There is no doubt that the export cattle industry in northern Australia is facing a financial **crisis**.

* So while Government supporters may use whatever methods or tactics are available to them in this debate to endeavour to drive a wedge between the parents of children who attend government and non-government schools in Australia, the fact remains that no-one on the Government side who has spoken in this debate has denied that there is a **crisis** in education, that these inequalities do exist.

* I simply ask the Government: Must our resource situation reach **crisis** point before we learn the lesson that natural resources require national management if we are to achieve maximum national benefit?

* The inadequacies of the recent measures announced by the Government to solve the housing **crisis**.

* Another aspect that I might mention is the report's comments on **crisis** management, another area with a major Federal-State component.

* The report's comments on **crisis** management are consistent with and in effect endorse the contingency planning arrangements and other proposals that are being or have been developed in association between the relevant Commonwealth, State and Northern Territory authorities.

* That was the last time that the Government initiated such a debate despite the fact that its supporters who have poultry farmers in their electorates know full well the **crisis** being engendered in that industry.

* After that Bill this **crisis** developed in the wheat industry.

* The only way that we could debate wheat quotas and the **crisis** in the industry was by taking the opportunity afforded by Grievance Day.

* lt is significant that we have had no debate this year on the wheat industry **crisis** itself.

* He made very clear what he thought of the Minister for Primary Industry and the Government with respect to the **crisis** in the wheat industry.

* Almost every day we read in the newspapers of the **crisis** and the unrest in the wool industry.

* Both the Parliament and the Australian primary producers have been treated with the utmost contempt by the Australian Government, because despite the growing financial **crisis** in the primary industries the Government refuses to exercise even the slightest semblance of leadership.

* They could be the means of sustaining these towns while rural industries are recovering from the recent **crisis**.

* The inability to provide housing for those who need it most threatens to reach **crisis** proportion.

* The Opposition believes that unemployment and the **crisis** situation in the home building industry will be worse by Christmas and that it will deteriorate even further in the New Year, especially in the Australian Capital Territory where conditions are worse than anywhere else in the country and where this inept Government has absolute and total totalitarian style powers.

* People in these industries are now finding themselves in a very serious **crisis**.

* But the real **crisis** in land is in Sydney.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* The oil search effort in Australia, in the middle of a world energy **crisis**, is being cut to ribbons by the blundering attitudes of the Minister and the Prime Minister.

* Has there been an upward revaluation of the Australian dollar since the current international currency **crisis** began?

* This proposal strikes at the very basis of private capital formation in Australia at a time of an investment **crisis**.

* In the same Press handout he blames the oil **crisis** and the increase in oil prices for that potential shortage.

* With aircrew insecurity, a record unemployment level among aircrew and an international monetary **crisis** taking place, it will be a national disgrace to allow such major expenditure to continue.

* If the Minister for Minerals and Energy had allowed the proposition concerning the refining of Mereenie crude gas at Alice Springs to go ahead the present **crisis** would not have arisen because that refinery would have been in operation now and could have produced all the fuel for power generation, motor spirit, aviation gas and liquid petroleum gas required by the Alice Springs and Tennant Creek area.

* When did the Leyland Company inform his predecessor of its approaching financial **crisis**.

* The reconstruction of the damaged countries has ended and we are again in a classic period of economic **crisis**.

* During the Suez **crisis** in 1956 the United Nations emergency forces were used in the Middle East when both Soviet and United States interests coincided.

* One issue which posed a sudden serious threat to global security, the Cuba **crisis**, was settled by a direct contact between Washington and Moscow.

* The beef industry is suffering its worst liquidity **crisis** of this century.

* It said that the unrelated problems which emerged from this collapse could be summed up as a continuing build-up in cattle numbers, depressed producer income, liquidity **crisis**, and reduced credit availability.

* The Government does not seem to realise that there is a **crisis** in the industry.

* The Opposition only regrets that the Government knows so little about the problems that are seriously besetting this industry that it provides such minimal help at a time of **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* If this is the condition of the Australian steel industry then we face a national **crisis**.

* Business in Australia is now in a desperate situation as a result of taxation and wage costs and the cash **crisis**.

* There is a major cash **crisis**.

* In the face of this **crisis** the Budget had a major task to revive business confidence, increase investment, production and job opportunities.

* There is less flexibility this year than there was last year because the **crisis** is worse, but we do not accept that the cumulative impact of past policies has so reduced flexibility as to prevent a major change of direction from commencing now.

* We would suspend for the period of the present **crisis** the present system in which company tax is paid on a quarterly basis.

* Those honourable members who listened to the electronic media last weekend must have been utterly bored with the hysteria of the Leader of the Opposition in saying that there was a major political **crisis**, that the Prime Minister's integrity was under challenge, that the Prime Minister had been misleading the Parliament, that this week he was going to bring down the Prime Minister and that the Government was at risk.

* So desperate for power is the Opposition that it is prepared to plunge Australia into a constitutional **crisis** of frightening proportions.

* Events like this in Western Australia have a tendency to escalate unemployment because, apart from adding to a **crisis** of confidence, it seems to effect some building and manufacturing in other areas.

* There are three major primary industries in which we see circumstances of **crisis**.

* First of all he knifed his leader in the back, then he thrust himself into the leadership of the Liberal Party and then he went out to the country and said: 'The problems of 1973 and 1974 were not problems related to a world international economic **crisis**'- as the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  on the front bench knows.

* He went on: 'They were not part of the problems of world economic **crisis** during 1973 and 1974, but they were problems peculiar to Australia, of short run economic management.'

* I hope that the concern which the honourable member has expressed with respect to their income from vegetable growing might extend to their overall economic circumstances, for many growers in that area are subjected to an extraordinary drop in income to far below average weekly earnings, simply because of the **crisis** in the dairy industry.

* A **crisis** in energy in Australia is fast approaching.

* One hundred years ago nobody could have foreseen the pattern of environmental **crisis** which was to develop in our society as we became industrialised.

* In Australia today we see the manifestation of that **crisis** in many areas.

* Australia, with its vast resources of energy components such as coal or uranium, is in a much better situation to face a projected energy **crisis** than most other Western nations.

* While I was in the United States  President  Carter made his statement on the energy **crisis**.

* With the current **crisis** in the rural areas of the electorate of Franklin these charges will merely exacerbate the situation.

* There was a **crisis** in India with the famine at Bihar.

* But, in the current **crisis**, first of all the Government fooled about with a few thousand dollars.

* The urgency of the developing world energy **crisis** surely dictates that the time for our governments to take action is now.

* A **crisis** exists in education, and that **crisis** can best be solved with money.

* He has never in any way in this House entered into debates on the wool **crisis**, a subject which of course concerns his electorate.

* This is the dominant reason given by the Leader of the Opposition for inducing the present **crisis** atmosphere.

* As the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said the other day, the real **crisis** in this country at the moment is the threat to democratic order.

* That is the real **crisis** so long as the bloodyminded Opposition in its conservative guise says no to everything, forcing a situation whereby it takes 1 8 months for some measures to get to this stage of a joint sitting.

* If not, was he refering to the report prepared on the unemployment **crisis** in Launceston.

* It is paradoxical that we are presently debating this legislation when the meat industry is undergoing its greatest **crisis** since the depression.

* The total collapse of the beef industry would pose a grave economic **crisis** not only for the rural sector of the national economy but also for the total national economy.

* In one question, I was asked, 'Arising out of the November **crisis** and the sacking of the Whitlam Government, has the Parliamentary system failed, if so, what alternatives are available?'

* I said capitalism in the western world was in a **crisis** situation.

* that there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the south west land division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Such a Budget would be appropriate to an economy where private sector spending is about to go into an inflationary spiral or where the economy must be brought to a full stop to avert a balance of payments **crisis**.

* I am not suggesting for a moment that we should turn our backs on the **crisis** in the rural industry but at the same time I am not suggesting that the Government is without blame for the present **crisis** in that industry.

* On Monday he created the usual Australian Labor Party aura of havoc or **crisis** in respect of something which is totally unprovable to be either havoc or **crisis** and said that we should be doing the absolute opposite and encouraging people to produce more.

* I think it reasonable to suppose that most Australians look for national government leadership in the energy **crisis**, both present and prospective.

* This **crisis** is so deep-rooted in its nature and far-reaching in its effects that some direct government interest in the industry is legitimate.

* But more to the point, the so-called **crisis** that we face today has been brought about because of the constant deceit, because of the running away from reality, because of those who sit opposite who will not face the fact that there are persons, if not one very important person, party principal to the negotiations.

* Honourable members opposite talk about a constitutional **crisis** provided for by the Senate.

* They know that it is a fraud and that it is akin to the actions they have been taking throughout their period in government and more particularly, that it is along the lines of the loans affair and loans **crisis** with which we are faced today.

* The overall credit situation is worse now than it has been at any time since the **crisis** began.

* This is creating just as much a **crisis** as any other single factor, because people who normally would have been able to obtain overdraft accommodation for their operations are now being told: 'No more; we are sorry'.

* It should be noted that during the currency **crisis** last year, which resulted in a major realignment of currency values, there was minimal disturbance within Australia.

* Had this sort of **crisis** happened in the Australian economy 15 or 20 years ago the* impact on Australia would have been very much greater.

* That would mean a **crisis** which is exactly what the Government wants because the Prime Minister thrives on this sort of **crisis** situation.

* I will return to that matter in more detail, but remaining on the general level that statement, combined with the continued refusal of this Government to revitalise the economy through the public sector, its continued determination to clamp down on any movement aimed at improving life styles in this country, its insistence that the workers and wage earners of Australia must pay the cost of our economic **crisis**, the sheer pall over any growth, the sheer lack of any excitement or any feeling of national pride or development generated by this Speech, indicate a general feeling of inertia and boredom in our society.

* All of them face a **crisis**.

* While the New South Wales Minister for Health is con.idering improving this tiny contribution, the **crisis** continues.

* If the Commonwealth acted properly and rightly and took these steps it would remove the **crisis** and save the bush nurse.

* So I appeal to the Minister and the Government in the name of common sense and humanity Vo end the **crisis** facing the bush nursing centres at this time.

* When  Mr Jackson  looked at manufacturing industry and saw the **crisis** that occurred in it, he did not single out wages as being the basis of the whole **crisis**.

* I am asked whether there is a cash **crisis**.

* That should prevent any cash **crisis** for the Corporation occurring in the short term.

* In his amendment the honourable member for Scullin went on to say that:  ... the speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system .

* That extract exposes the hypocrisy of his Government and its Ministers because since coming to office it has pursued a policy of confrontation and **crisis** in an attempt to conceal its own incompetence.

* If we are going to overcome this fuel **crisis** in the long term, there must be cooperation.

* Even at this point of time the fuel **crisis** is putting some of the motorcars, which we thought would never be superseded, off the road.

* The Bill comes before us after 7 months of the worst **crisis** the wool industry has experienced in more than a generation.

* I want to make our commitment clear before dealing with the legislation that the Government has brought down, in contrast, 4 months after the Opposition acted,  7  months after the **crisis** began and 21 years after taking office.

* But I also make it plain to wool growers and to the nation that this legislation, this Government answer to the wool **crisis**, is not what the industry asked for; it is not what the growers have demanded; it is not what the Opposition is firmly pledged to do.

* One only has to reflect on the recent **crisis** in Iran, which is the No.

* 2 OPEC producer, or imagine a **crisis** in some other key country in the region to come to grips with just how serious the consequences could be.

* There is today a world fuel and energy **crisis**, lt is a **crisis** of hydrocarbons; it is a **crisis** of fossil fuel.

* There are no fewer than 
One clear consequence of the energy **crisis** has been the growing trend of the now enormously affluent Middle East oil exporting countries to seek comprehensive, long-term, government to government arrangements on agricultural development, foodstuffs, capital equipment and technology.

* During the great constitutional **crisis** in October and November 1975, a **crisis** - 
I have seen the reports and on a visit to Papua New Guinea I saw the farms to which the honourable senator has referred.

* I think all of us have to look at this process in terms of the energy **crisis** and also in terms of getting rid of pollution.

* It seems to me, with the fuel **crisis** exacerbating, that this form of waste digestion providing methane gas could be a goer much sooner than most people think.

* It is not just Labor voters who are affected by this **crisis**; it is not just Labor families that are affected by this **crisis**; everyone is affected.

* When the **crisis** in Korea arose in the early 1950s and both sides of this House supported the involvement of Australian forces in conjunction with United Nations forces in Korea, there was a great number of trained servicemen available in Australia who could be sent to Korea.

* We in Australia, as in many other countries of the Western world, appear to be suffering some **crisis** of confidencenot only in our governments but also in ourselves as individuals.

* Why is there a **crisis** of confidence in government- not the Government, but the institution of government itself?

* People living with the threat of increasingly serious floods realise that there is a very serious drainage **crisis** to be dealt with.

* That mission arrived in Sydney to study investments in the middle of the Minsec **crisis**.

* In many cases it comes at a time of emotional **crisis** and adds further to the burden of those who have lost a loved one.

* There are people in our society for whom life must seem a never ending struggle from **crisis** point to **crisis** point and from problem to problem.

* I know that he deserves most of the blame for bringing the mining industry in Australia to its present state of confusion, **crisis** and uncertainty, but the Minister is a member of a government which has approved, even praised, all that he has done.

* By bringing confusion and **crisis** to the mining industry the Government can more easily gain control of those industries.

* The people of Australia must be reminded or, even more drastically, jolted out of their apathy in relation to the energy **crisis**.

* There is a belief abroad that those people who talk about an Australian energy **crisis** are eco-nuts pushing some hobby horse; that they are people who were frightened by a motor car at birth or who have some masochistic desire to ride bicycles around the countryside in the rain.

* Australia is facing a **crisis**, not because we are poor in resources but because our 'mix' of different resources does not match our 'mix' of projected demand, both as to the type of energy resources required and to the geographic location of the available resources within this country.

* We now have industry views on what should be done to alleviate the position and to alleviate the disastrous **crisis** which is now confronting this industry.

* Companies should be allowed to defer the payment of tax and revert to the original basis of taxation while this particular **crisis** is upon them.

* But in this industry which is undergoing a particular **crisis** liquidity is vital and anything that the Government can do to increase that liquidity to alleviate the problems of the beef industry will certainly be well received by the industry.

* The arbitration system grew out of the **crisis** of the 1890s.

* We have a **crisis** of depression in the rural half of the nation.

* We have a **crisis** in education.

* We have a **crisis** in the quality of life.

* They do not regard the **crisis** in the countryside or the matters to which I have referred in the nation as a whole as matters of laughter and amusement.

* I think those who want to make union bashing more selective ought at least to give some credit to the fact that in this country at this time of economic **crisis** trade unions have adopted a far more responsible approach as a result of the exhortations of this Government than has been evident at any time I can remember since the war.

* We have seen at last a recognition that the credit squeeze must be taken off to relieve the liquidity **crisis** that was facing banks and industry.

* The world energy **crisis** has meant that adjustment must be made to other sources of energy in the wake of dwindling world supplies of petroleum.

* Nuclear energy is the only viable alternative most countries have available to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the oil **crisis**.

* Though there is no evidence of it from his statement, the Prime Minister should have known that the previous Government had taken action through the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Foreign Affairs to develop a resources diplomacy for Australia, particularly in view of the rapid consumption of the world's resources and the real prospect of an energy **crisis**.

* I must say that as far as Canberra employees of the Public Service are concerned I have no doubt that the basic qualities I outlined are being stretched to the limit by the rash of legislation brought about by the Labor Government and also by the ready willingness of senior Ministers of the Labor Government ruthlessly to attempt to shift the blame for a **crisis** - a **crisis** either for the Government or for the Minister - on to members of the Public Service.

* He is obviously trying to convey the impression that there is a great **crisis** in the building industry.

* They say that unless we show some versatility and get more money into the industry there can be a **crisis**.

* Even last night, I understand, because of the support given and because of the money being spent the Leader of the Opposition was on the telephone to a senior executive from News Limited giving that gentleman a personal account of his talks with the Governor-General on the constitutional **crisis**.

* Apparently it was an early casualty of the international oil **crisis**, because it never even got mobile.

* If the energy **crisis** is to develop the way that many people believe it is likely to develop through into the 1980s, then certainly we will need national energy policies, which we do not have at the moment, we will need a national energy plan and I believe we will need a national transport plan.

* There is no single, magical solution to the **crisis**; the simple way does not exist.

* The Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory has said many times that the Government is giving the beef industry earnest consideration and that it realises the **crisis** in which the industry is.

* For over 20 years we have lived with the **crisis** and the human catastrophe of Vietnam.

* One would have expected it to have tried to reduce the industrial strife that is a major factor in the shortages **crisis**.

* And because it has done the opposite, the people of Australia are experiencing a **crisis** of shortages - a **crisis** which will take on a new meaning as Christmas demand mounts.

* This is a major factor in the shortages **crisis**.

* This home, which is known throughout Victoria for the magnificent services it provides to the aged and the infirm in the area, is suffering an economic **crisis**, as are other homes under the categories I mentioned previously.

* Clearly, the effects of rapid inflation, rapid increases in wages, decreases in profit margins and the oil **crisis** have meant that industry has had to become more efficient.

* Our society cannot afford to have at least three-quarters of a million people not producing and face a fiscal **crisis**.

* This Government is confronted with just such a **crisis**.

* Should there be for some reason or other an unusual withdrawal rather than a reinvestment of dividends - about half of them are reinvested; it is a very high proportion - should there be a reduction of capital inflow because of the economic conditions in some other country that are not the same as they are here; and should there be a capital withdrawal, Australia would face a **crisis** greater and more serious than any **crisis** it has faced in its history.

* It is my purpose to address myself to the **crisis** in the rural industries generally and in the wool industry in particular.

* The **crisis** has been obvious for years.

* Look ing back we all know about the international monetary **crisis** which erupted soon after last year's Budget was brought down.

* That **crisis** had rapid and drastic effects on our trading partners, with severe economic consequences.

* Why has the financial **crisis** of the States and local government authorities been so neglected and almost totally ignored?

* So, with the dual trends of higher production costs and shrinking export markets, the industry now is facing continuing social **crisis**.

* It is because of this social **crisis** that the Opposition seeks to amend the legislation to help maintain the real incomes of growers and to secure adjustment within the industry that may allow it better to tailor its production to available markets.

* The industry is facing a critical export **crisis**.

* The approach of the Government in not accepting the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission, in not putting forward a positive plan for a rationalisation of the industry, has left growers in a subsistence situation in which they face a continuing social **crisis**.

* The British conglomerate also suffered from the liquidity **crisis** and had to realise on its properties around the world.

* I ask the Minister for the Media: Has his attention been drawn to reports that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is engaged in distortion and manipulation of news during the present political **crisis**?

* The **crisis** in Australian education - though the expression **crisis** is not used by the Interim Committee - is perhaps summed up in a few words of the Interim Committee's report in paragraph 5:1 on page 48 of Schools in Australia, where it points out that in too many schools the level of resources employed:  is below that required to implement modern educational methods, and to prepare all children, irrespective of their rate and style of learning, for full participation in a complex society.

* I believe that we now face a **crisis** in primary industry.

* This, as I say, is a **crisis**.

* The Treasurer, by ignoring inflation in his attempt to tackle unemployment, actually is building a worse unemployment **crisis** in 1976.

* The Treasurer said that deficit budgeting financed by money creation would end only when unemployment eases, but we have the **crisis** of greater unemployment facing us in 1976.

* The world has an energy **crisis**.

* Indeed as the Treasurer has said, as it has been said widely in Europe in recent months, anything that had been agreed - supposing that there had been the will to agree - before the oil **crisis** of OctoberNovember last year would have had to be scrapped.

* Surely to goodness this is the surest way to drive the nation down the road to a real economic **crisis**.

* In his second reading speech on the measure now before us the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  said: 
There is a continuing **crisis** in the rural sector.

* There is a continuing **crisis** in the countryside; it is not improving at all.

* There is a real **crisis** of survival for many people, not only on farms but also in businesses and decentralised industries and among employees themselves.

* If Australia has an education **crisis** I believe that it is a **crisis** created by prosperity and not by migrants.

* The sooner this Parliament says as a parliament that there is no simple remedy, that there is a deep and profound economic **crisis** right throughout the Western world which is affecting Australia, and that when it occurred the Whitlam Government was in office and its great tragedy and its great mistake was that it did not perceive either the nature or the dimension of what was occurring in Western society and continued to try to implement its program unconscious of the fact or unable to comprehend that the great boom in Western industrialised society was over the better it will be.

* The sooner honourable members on both sides of the chamber abandon the approach of saying that a Labor government did something in 1972 so it is all right for a government to do the same in 1978 the better it will be because there is a deep, significant economic **crisis** in Australia here and now, and we are not alone in that respect, and the first thing we have to say to ourselves is that there are no simple answers.

* -Ten days ago, 1 1 November, was the third anniversary of what we would all agree was the most traumatic and divisive constitutional **crisis** in this nation's history.

* Of the three major protagonists in that **crisis**, one has fled into a comfortable exile in the English home counties, a most appropriate resting place for one of his social pretensions; the second has retired from politics to a great Australian institution, a most appropriate home for an Australian of his intellect and breadth of vision; the third, the one most responsible for the perversion of our parliamentary customs and traditions, remains as Prime Minister, a continuing symbol of the bitterness and division unleashed by the events of November 1975.

* In 1973, for example, at the time of the international oil **crisis**, the Conference added a surcharge to all imports to Australia, claiming that this was due to the uncertainty of oil supplies.

* We are in a **crisis** situation.

* We are in a **crisis** situation.

* In my opinion it is daylight robbery for the Commonwealth to do this to the Wheat Board - an independent body which is struggling to rescue the wheat industry from its present **crisis**.

* This is a serious belief, because it is quite obvious that Australia's mineral exports are of vital importance to its future, particularly with respect to the rural **crisis**, in view of this, I must ask, request or challenge - whatever one likes to call it - the Queensland Minister for Mines,  Mr Camm,  to prove his belief that there is a Communist plot in Australia to smash the export coal industry by raising the price of coal so much that it would be lucrative for overseas Communist countries to supply coal to Japan.

* International authorities associated with the Japanese economy state categorically that the slowing down in Japan's imports of coal and iron ore is a direct result of the steel recession which is now being accelerated by the international monetary **crisis** in which Japan and the United States of America are the key combatants.

* Japanese authorities indicate that as a result of the cancelled or deferred options, cancelled contracts or other agreements, imports of iron ore and coal could be reduced by as much as 25 per cent if the international monetary **crisis** is not satisfactorily solved.

* But what is the **crisis** that faces Australia?

* I want to deal with one **crisis** that I believe is now evident.

* The current **crisis** in Australia is however much more severe than the Government or the Treasurer admits.

* It is a **crisis** evidenced by the highest prolonged inflation in Australia's history and by the highest unemployment since the great depression of the 1930s.

* It is a **crisis** which eats away at the security of every Australian, at our confidence and at our way of life.

* The speech of the Leader of the Opposition held out the sort of hopes that people in Australia have in terms of the decisions that ought to be taken by government that might avoid this **crisis**.

* The Government has allowed rural Australia to drift for year after year until now a **crisis** with frightening ramifications has emerged.

* We have a **crisis** in wool, a **crisis** in wheat, a **crisis** in dairying and, of course, a **crisis** in drought.

* Our export apple and pear industry is verging on **crisis**.

* We have a **crisis** in the meat industry with regard to meat workers and meat inspectors which must be faced.

* My investigations have shown that the **crisis** that already exists in this industry could worsen.

* On Monday morning there were reports in the Press of another **crisis**.

* Will it sit back and take it as it has done every other year when there has been a **crisis** in rural industry?

* We are all aware that there is a **crisis** in the wool industry.

* For 3 years prior to the present **crisis** facing the wheat industry the rumblings were present.

* But the Government waited until the **crisis** occurred.

* Australian manufacturing industry is in acute financial **crisis**.

* In part manufacturing's problems are manifestations of the world economic **crisis** in which all countries including Australia are enmeshed.

* That malaise has sharpened the impact on industry of the current economic **crisis**.

* Less than a week ago in this House the present Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  took the view that there is really no economic **crisis**.

* Is it not true that Australia has been insulated more than any other economy from the effects of the world energy **crisis**?

* How then can overseas conditions have influenced our domestic **crisis**?

* Recently in the  Australian Financial Review  the Prime Minister was described as a person who receives his kicks from crises and moves from one **crisis** to another.

* At the moment we have a **crisis** which is being magnified deliberately by the Government.

* What we can see, in any case, is that neocapitalism, with its pretensions to have found the answer to Marx, was the expression of a temporary situation, borne along not by its own dynamic but by the upwards wave of the economic cycle; but the vision of a society dedicated to welfare, not to power and profit- the only vision that makes sense in today 's circumstances- still eludes us, and will do so until another **crisis**, even more crippling than the **crisis** that is brewing today, brings home to the whole world the perils it faces.

* Should be persist time and again in this Parliament whenever he is on his feet in saying that there is a **crisis** in this industry or in that industry - he mentioned the word '**crisis**' 7 times tonight - or that there is a down turn, the survival of the countryside is not possible or that the battle of the countryside is lost, he will instil- 
So we come back to the old question: For 23 years there was a Liberal-Country Party Government which did not give one cent to the States for their public transport systems.

* Apparently that created no **crisis**.

* In the  2h  years we have been in office we have made money available to the States in the sums I have just mentioned and apparently that creates a **crisis**.

* Is the home building industry in a **crisis** situation.

* That distortion allowed the Senate to vote to defer Supply- a vote which could not have been passed if the late  Senator Milliner  had been replaced by a Labor Party senator- and to bring on the instability and **crisis** in November and December 1975.

* Harold Jago, has appealed to the Commonwealth for urgent financial assistance to help overcome this **crisis** in our hospitals?

* Will the right honourable gentleman give an undertaking to this House, preferably before the election, that urgent consideration will be given to the provision of special financial assistance to New South Wales to help overcome this **crisis**?

* The deteriorating **crisis** in the beef industry and the failure of the Government to take adequate measures to alleviate its effect.

* The suggestion made by the honourable member for Darling that the Parliament should give greater consideration to members of electorates concerned in times of **crisis** should be taken a great deal further.

* This is important to the people and at times of **crisis** the member has a responsibility to be in his electorate and the Parliament and the Government should make available such facilities as are necessary to a member in such circumstances.

* As I said this morning, the employment and unemployment situation has reached a **crisis** in Australia.

* More money will have to be put into job creation programs as quickly as possible if we are to avoid the sort of social **crisis** that is now upon us.

* I note his recent statements in the first speeches he has ever made on urban affairs that it is wildly inaccurate to speak of a **crisis** in our cities and that people have been carried away by labels such as urban affairs' and 'the challenge of the cities'.

* Does this mean that the right honourable gentleman and his Government reject the views of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Royal Australian Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, which have formed a national alliance and in a manifesto a month ago declared that the very real problems of unplanned urban growth are now approaching a **crisis** situation in many areas and are in large part caused by the failure to develop national and State policies to co-ordinate this growth?

* The  Chairman  of the Victorian Hospitals Association,  Mr Ron  Shepherd, is reported in the Age' as saying that Victorian hospitals are in their worst financial **crisis** in history.

* Another grave **crisis** is due when these figures are released.

* House, is that the then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations,  Mr Street,  in making a statement to the House in September of last year, for the first time gave the people of Australia some idea of the **crisis** of unemployment with which we were living and some idea of the great difficulties of unemployment with which we were going to be confronted in the next five to 10 years.

* The Speech was depressing and, stripped of its euphemistic grandness and its attempts to describe grandly the most unimaginative legislative and administrative program, it means the perpetration of an economic **crisis** and the Government's determination that wage and salary earners- millions of Australians- will pay the price of recovery, if the economy is to recover in the foreseeable future from the deep trough in which this Government has put it.

* The Gill figures reveal the situation only with regard to males but in the past few weeks a project conducted by four Melbourne students under the control of a professional social worker entitled 'A Study of Homeless Women in Melbourne' has unveiled a **crisis** in Melbourne that the nature of the homeless women problem generally has hidden from society.

* The Salvation Army points out that young people are forced to these places because of an unemployment **crisis**.

* What the Government inherited in many areas was a series of patch-up jobs caused by he need to act either in a **crisis** situation or as a result of other pressures.

* We do not dispute the wisdom of this, because the conditions were at a **crisis** point.

* The honourable member for Reid talked about the **crisis** at Harrisburg in the United States.

* The **crisis** at Harrisburg was of concern not only to the residents of the area around the power station but also to the whole nuclear industry throughout the world.

* But it does appear that on this occasion we are getting very close to what may be properly regarded as a **crisis** situation.

* We are at a **crisis** stage in democracy in Australia because of the out of balance situation that has developed between the House of Representatives and the Senate.

* There was a sense of **crisis**, a sense of drama.

* Perhaps this land has been used for some form of rural production, but with rural industry facing **crisis** after **crisis**, the Government ought to consider giving a larger grant to the States to enable them to purchase this land for forestry purposes.

* This has been described as a **crisis** and one tends to think of a **crisis** as drawing to a point and then having something happen but this should more properly be described as a plateau.

* When talking about recurrent grants the honourable member pointed out that a number of nongovernment schools are facing a real **crisis** at this time.

* Althouth I would agree that nongovernment schools are facing some **crisis** in relation to finance, I stress that it is my experience in my own electorate that the parish schools and the regional colleges I have visited are delighted that at this time they are receiving much more in the recurrent expenditure area than they have ever received before.

* He is making a great deal more sense on the housing issue because he is treating it as  a  **crisis** - with every justification.

* He asked could I please raise this matter because the legal profession in Victoria, like the profession elsewhere, has said that a **crisis** situation now exists in Victoria.

* This is creating a **crisis**.

* This is what the Government has to consider because today the people of this country had expectations that the Government in its third Budget would have learnt from the mistakes of its last 2 Budgets and would have had the courage to take real decisions which are so necessary if this nation is to get out of the current **crisis** of the highest inflation in Australia's history and the highest rate of unemployment since the Depression.

* This is a **crisis** which is eating away at the confidence and the security of every citizen of Australia 
This **crisis**, this chaos, this law of the jungle, this exploitation of the many by the few can and must be solved by planning.

* Perhaps the greatest problem facing the nation today is the rising cost squeeze, not only upon the rural industries - it has reached **crisis** proportions there, we know - but upon practically all of our export earning industries as well.

* In addition to these projects, the Rape **Crisis** Centre (Surry Hills), the Pregnancy Help Centre (Strathfield) and the Central Coast Women's Health Services Co-ordinator (Gosford) also receive financial assistance under the Community Health Program, but the latter projects are not classified as women's health centres.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* We have come to grips with the **crisis** in some of our rural industries, particularly in the case of wool.

* If we do not put man in control of his technology we will continue to stagger from one **crisis** to the next.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* There is a general lack of awareness that a **crisis** exists in this field, but the **crisis** will continue to exist so long as governments determinedly and successfully close their eyes to the ever widening gap between the deaf and society generally.

* Nothing could be more reckless or inappropriate at this time of delicate economic recovery than to precipitate a political **crisis**.

* The present **crisis** has been brought about by a blind lack of reason, a headlong rush in pursuit of power, the singleminded abandonment of principle by one man in too great a hurry to grasp a destiny which many would agree does not belong to him.

* In South Australia there is a **crisis** of confidence reflected in a **crisis** in business confidence, in consumer confidence and in the confidence of the electors themselves.

* When this Government came to office it was faced with a situation of **crisis** proportions in Australian schools.

* If we have to rely in the future on excessive loan raisings to meet the interest and amortisation of these debts, the burden of debt servicing in later years will lead to a **crisis** situation.

* I suggest that the Department is extremely slow in its reactions and far too slow in areas of **crisis**.

* What problems have brought about the current **crisis**?

* Let there be no mistake - it is a **crisis**.

* Even at present there is an oil **crisis**.

* If it is necessary - and in a grave **crisis** it could be - we will give serious thought to using that liquid petroleum gas in Australia.

* But I repeat that only in a grave **crisis** would we take that action.

* But, in a grave **crisis**, we would need to give consideration to using those exports ourselves.

* The Government intends to import doctors into Australia from America to overcome the **crisis** in the medical field.

* Australia has to get teachers from somewhere because of the **crisis** in education.

* These chiefly operate in times of constitutional **crisis**.

* The **crisis** in the Australian Opera, to which the Government has grudgingly responded, is only one reflection of the difficulties faced by the performing arts in Australia.

* The Government is silent about the future of the film industry, just as it is silent about the **crisis** in the performing arts.

* The Labor Party is aware that this **crisis**, this chaos, this law of the jungle, this exploitation of the many by the few can and must be solved by planning.

* We are in the throes of an energy **crisis**.

* What a great blow that was at a time when we were facing an energy **crisis**.

* The linking of the railway line to the Eyre Peninsula will assist that area, which at the present time is going through a **crisis** because of the wheat position.

* This is a gamble indeed, for if such sales are not up to expectations, within five or six years Australia may face a double **crisis**- an energy shortage for transport and a severe balance of payments problem.

* Whenever another Government inspired **crisis** looms the blame is placed on demands for wage increases, the high wages now being paid and/or industrial unrest.

* I refer to a Press statement of 5 September, which reads: 'Beef **crisis** is a social and economic **crisis**', says Ian Sinclair.

* In times of **crisis** we have been dependable.

* -Australia faces a Budget deficit this year which threatens to bring on a renewed economic **crisis** and which is a further reflection of this Government's monopoly of disaster and deceit.

* On 19 
On 31st December, a little over 4 months ago, the **crisis** as the Minister termed it, with respect to this company, was fully acknowledged by the Government of Victoria and the Commonwealth to the degree that this **crisis** was said to be so urgent that this money was made available to the Victorian Government by the Commonwealth Government.

* Is the Prime Minister concerned with the **crisis** facing hospitals?

* Will he take steps to remove or relieve this **crisis** 
The Department of the Treasury has estimated that the current amount of tax avoidance amongst this group totals almost $3,000m a year.

* This has contributed to the increasing balance of payments difficulties and the **crisis** that has arisen with regard to the deficit in the balance of the current account.

* That is the **crisis** that this Government has to face.

* The tragedy is that a decade has gone since the awareness of the developing **crisis** in urban affairs and its preparedness to confront it.

* He said: 
Thirdly, it is an acknowledged fact that Australia- has not suffered a fraction from the energy **crisis** which has so beset all other countries in Europe and Japan.

* In this statement I have set out the dimensions of this Government's massive economic failure- a failure of domestic economic management which has led directly and inevitably to the tragedy of Australia's economic **crisis** today and in the coming months.

* The Opposition takes no pleasure in setting out the detail of today's **crisis** or in warning that worse is yet to come.

* What we condemn with the strongest force and emphasis is that this nation has been so needlessly, so negligently and so deliberately plunged into economic **crisis** by the combination of incompetence and blind adherence to a worn out philosophy of socialism.

* This 
Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* The way in which they reacted in this **crisis** deserves the highest commendation.

* But certainly some governments must accept responsibility for the housing **crisis** that exists in Australia today.

* I compliment the Minister on his swift action and the way that the Cabinet has assisted him and the Treasury in making money available, because I believe that in Australia today there could be no greater **crisis** than the **crisis** of providing people with proper homes and accommodation.

* Then he berated us for having a policy to deal with the current economic **crisis**.

* It is time that the Government had a policy to deal with the country's economic **crisis**.

* -My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who would be aware of the current political **crisis** in Iran.

* Can the Minister tell the House of the grave ramifications of this **crisis** for the Western world?

* After all, developing countries in the world have never faced a greater **crisis** than they are facing at present, not merely because of the energy **crisis**, not merely because of oil prices, not merely because of oil inflated prices, but also because of the difficulties that many countries have with nitrogenous fertilisers.

* The fundamental moral, political and strategic confusion of that action was to rebound into our own society, particularly in the problems of this country and the constitutional **crisis** of1 975.

* Forward selling is not, in my view, the cause of the economic **crisis** among woolgrowers, nor is it the reason for the low level of prices.

* Merely to lay the blame for the **crisis** on the level of wool prices is not logical, and clearly the adverse season has been a major cause in the reduction in prices.

* It contained an urgent request for representatives from the Griffith Co-operative Cannery to interview the Minister to determine what financial assistance the Commonwealth Government is now prepared to offer the Griffith Co-operative Cannery following the recent second refusal by the New South Wales State Government to assist in the present **crisis**.

* We hope that the sentence of death that he has passed will be commuted by the Federal Government in this instance because here again is another example of where the rural **crisis** has been deepened by Government action or inaction.

* Any attempt to fill this office with a person who would be, by virtue of background, constrained not to act in a constitutional **crisis** would be to place this nation in a dangerous situation.

* Whatever the reason, Whitlam retreated to the Lodge for many weeks and his Government was left without strong leadership, in a rudderless condition, shining from **crisis** to **crisis**, being discredited each day.

* When we consider that the economic **crisis** in the rural community extends over the 6 States of the Commonwealth and that this money must be divided among a number of people in those States, it is a long way from being sufficient.

* If there is some substance to the arguments which the Press has brought forward and which have produced a situation of **crisis**, as there is today within the Labor Party and the Government as a result of the Government trying to conceal or hide the facts from the Australian people, this Government and individuals in it are deserving of whatever criticism they get from the Press.

* They obtained Executive Council approval to go overseas and raise $2,000m on the assumption that the money was to be used for temporary purposes, that it was to be used to enable Australia to meet its balance of payments commitments, that it was to be used in respect of the energy **crisis** in our country and that it was to be used in regard to unemployment But today we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Minerals and Energy that this money is to be used for long term investment in the electrification of railways, in port facilities, in the development of gas, in the development of coal and in the development of the hydrogenation of coal.

* He says there is a **crisis** in housing.

* His idea of a **crisis** in housing is based on the fact that there are about  93,000  applicants for homes from housing commissions.

* This is not a housing **crisis** at all.

* The energy **crisis** and shortage throughout the world does not come home fully to the people of Australia at any time.

* We have not yet realised the severe implications of the **crisis** which faces Europe, North America and other areas.

* Because we are so fortunate with huge reserves of coal and other fuels, and now of course with uranium, it does not mean that we can turn our backs on the energy **crisis** throughout the world.

* This legislation was brought about principally in an era when even those two countries did not really realise fully the significance of the shortage of oil and the impending **crisis**.

* It deals with the beef **crisis**.

* This is a constitutional **crisis** of the highest order.

* Having done that we look to the future because coal today, as never before, is the key industry in the world energy **crisis**.

* It is true that there are odd families in financial **crisis** - largely families that have been left in this **crisis** because of the failure of Commonwealth Governments in the past to cope with this **crisis**.

* Where are the government policies to introduce properly paid job creation schemes, to raise unemployment benefit levels above the austere poverty line, to index pensions and benefits quarterly, to expand significantly labor research and planning so as to help avert the growing **crisis** of unemployment?

* As helpful as lectures may be- honourable members have been receiving several lectures during adjournment debates- to uninitiated economists, they do not assist this House to come to grips with the basic issues that face Western nations during a current world wide economic **crisis**.

* The reality is that it has now been shown that we are facing a **crisis** throughout the whole of the Western world.

* This excludes the rest of the world, which can be classified, as the Government would see it, as ossifying under tyrannical socialist rule or as part of the Third World, which the Government tends to expect to be in a situation of perpetual **crisis** anyway.

* The causes of the **crisis** go much deeper than rhetoric about free trade and free competition might suggest.

* I believe it can be argued that we in the West faced a **crisis** of overproduction, followed by a long period of booming investment in which it seemed that there was only one way to go- to grow bigger and better, to form larger and larger combines and to transcend any boundary, whether it be local, State, national or international, in search of larger and larger markets and, more importantly, larger and larger profits.

* The oil **crisis** of 1973 followed the recognition by the Middle Eastern powers that they could not go on subsidising a Western and Japanese economic miracle forever, given the fact that for many of these countries oil was their only major asset and bargaining tool.

* So we have the exploitation, particularly at the moment, of Australian energy resources as if there were no energy **crisis** in the whole damn world.

* Those benefits are designed to get people out of a **crisis** in a few weeks, whereas increasingly the average length of time that people are unemployed is between six and eight months.

* Why is there a **crisis** in land prices?

* That **crisis** varies from city to city and from State to State but the price of land is at **crisis** level in Sydney.

* Because of the **crisis** in the cities the Cities Commission is to have a role which embraces a solution to that **crisis**, that is, through the new regional areas in the country and in the cities.

* The **crisis** point has not been reached in Melbourne although speculation is beginning to run riot.

* 1 ) When did the Leyland Company inform him of its approaching employment **crisis**.

* The longer the **crisis** drags on, the more repetition we will inevitably have.

* When we say that the country is bordering on the brink of a political and economic **crisis**, people having heard that so often will tend to brush it aside, discount it, and say: 'Well, that is merely a cliche.'

* Certainly to speak today of the country being on the brink of a political and economic **crisis** is self-evidently true.

* It was not so difficult to accomplish them in Australia until that time, but in 1973 this country and the rest of the world had experienced the external effects of the oil **crisis**.

* I ask this House to bear in mind the response of Australia to the oil **crisis** of 1973-74, and what would be a Labor government's response to a similar **crisis** of 1978 and 1979-80.

* If we go back to 1973-74, we now know that there were three countries which responded to that **crisis** in a very careful and very gauged manner.

* I merely say that in response to any **crisis**, whether it be the oil **crisis** of the 1973 period or the one which is presently upon the Western world, honourable members should ask themselves whether Australia is going to go for the short term solution or the long term solution.

* We are concerned about ensuring that when members of the Opposition face inwards they fire the correct bullets with respect to an appropriate rate of taxation, show appropriate concern as to the main aggregates in the economy and, above all, do not repeat during the oil **crisis** of 1979 the kind of infamy that they repeated during the oil **crisis** of 1973.

* It was stated that it was to protect Australia against an energy **crisis** a year after that **crisis** had broken, a **crisis** which because of our own supplies as a result of our earlier policies had hardly touched Australia.

* When did it- dishonestly, if honourable members likepretend that there was no such thing as an oil **crisis**?

* It was the Labor Government which, by burying its head in the sand in 1973, 1974 and 1975 and pretending that there was no oil **crisis**, pretending that there never would be an oil **crisis** and pretending that it would get away with cheating on the companies looking for oil, with the result that oil exploration stopped in this nation- through a combination of those factors- caused the severe trauma which all of a sudden was involved in Australia catching up with the real world situation.

* The importance of the creation of the Ministry for Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 which were associated with the world energy **crisis**.

* Indeed, it could have been a **crisis** for Western Australia where the previous State Liberal governments, with the agreement of the Federal Liberal governments, had 'abandoned the policy of using local resources in the manufacture of power, with the introduction of oil fired burners.

* It is pleasing to see that the Western Australian State Government has been able to avert any **crisis** which could have arisen from that situation.

* Since the beginning of the **crisis** in March this year, the Australian Government has made repeated efforts to try to influence the leaders of Pakistan and India in the direction of reaching a political settlement and to reduce tension.

* The Government has throughout the **crisis** been paying attention to the need to ensure the safety of Australian citizens in India and Pakistan.

* The first crack appeared with Britain's devaluation in 1967, which in itself makes a mockery of suggestions that there was a 10 year **crisis**.

* In fact, the Victorian Government is still fostering closer settlement for dairying at this time of **crisis** for this industry.

* Our rate of inflation would have been doubled by the energy **crisis**.

* energy **crisis** that is building up.

* Had we not escaped the full impact of the energy **crisis** we would be way out in front.

* The causes of the economic **crisis** can be quite simply identified.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that major sectors of primary industry are now experiencing the worst financial **crisis** since the great depression 40 years ago and that even more serious problems will be experienced in the immediate future as conditions worsen and unemployment grows in country areas?

* Of all the Ministers in the Government, it is the Minister for Primary Industry most of all who should be in Australia in the immediate future because of the rural **crisis** and in view of his ministerial responsibilities.

* Is this not an act of stupidity as well as a blatant contempt of the rural **crisis**?

* -Is the Minister for Labor and Immigration aware of a special **crisis** among woodchip loggers and bushmen in Tasmania in that many loggers with costly trucks and equipment worth from $50,000 to $150,000 have become unemployed because the 3 woodchip companies in Tasmania have had their exports to Japan drastically reduced by the Japanese paper companies?

* Will the Minister treat this **crisis** as urgent and make one of his key employment officers available at a log haulers association meeting at Launceston next Sunday?

* Because this woodchip **crisis** is unique to Tasmania can he make special arrangements to help these out of work hauliers to stay solvent?

* There is a world energy **crisis** and there is, in various countries, varying degrees of **crisis** in terms of crude oil availability.

* -I support the matter of public importance raised by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  that the Government has failed to respond to the rural **crisis**.

* Of course, the Opposition is talking not just about the **crisis** amongst primary producers but about the **crisis** in the whole of the rural community.

* Let us not cloud the issues of the current **crisis**.

* There is no constitutional **crisis**.

* If anything, it is a political **crisis**.

* Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into **crisis** after **crisis**, embarrassment piled upon embarrassment week after week?

* Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week's **crisis**, next week's blunder?

* Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which have lurched into **crisis** after **crisis**, embarrassment piled on embarrassment, week after week?

* Will you accept another three years of waiting  for next week's **crisis**, next week's blunder?

* Before we get to the aspect of the amendment dealing with the constitutional **crisis**, I think it is important to mention that the Australian Parliament has an important place in the world of defence and foreign affairs.

* -The policy actions of the Whitlam Government have led to an investment **crisis** in the Australian economy.

* This investment **crisis** is serious.

* The Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of capital expenditure in 
For well over a year evidence of the investment **crisis** has been building up.

* The time allowed for this debate does not permit a detailed analysis of the reasons for the present investment **crisis**.

* We talk about an energy **crisis**.

* Might I also point out that we are facing a food **crisis** which in importance is as vital as the energy **crisis** not only to Australia but to the world.

* What we members on this side of the House query is whether rural subsidies should be built perpetually into the financial structure of this country, enduring long after the **crisis** adduced by Country Party Ministers for Primary Industry as grounds for their introduction.

* But the one **crisis** that cannot be risked is a **crisis** of confidence in the United Nations itself.

* Are we prepared to maintain at the head of our affairs a coalition of factions which has lurched into **crisis** after **crisis**, embarrassment piled on embarrassment week after week?'

* The former Leader of the Opposition also said: 'Can we accept another 3 years of waiting for next week's **crisis**, next week's blunder?'

* South Australia is suffering a **crisis** of confidence and as a result is losing prospects for 55,000 jobs.

* However, its smallness and the smallness of the sum it intends to spend are no measure of the importance of this Department because it has the role of trying to draw attention to the greatest **crisis** facing modern man.

* This **crisis** involves the effects of the technology of Western industrialised society upon society.

* Indeed, when we look at the greatest problem that confronts us- the energy **crisis**- I do not think there is any reliable evidence to indicate that the solutions that are being suggested for the problem of the energy **crisis** will not produce worse problems than those the solutions seek to overcome.

* As a nation obtaining more sophisticated defence equipment, we have to ask ourselves whether our local manufacturing industries are geared, equipped and able to participate in the continuing manufacture of some of the components involved and, more importantly, whether they are able and have the resources to keep that equipment functional and in service in a **crisis**.

* I support the estimates for the Department of Minerals and Energy, The Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor),  who is at the table, has repeatedly drawn the attention of the nation to the world energy **crisis** or, rather, the **crisis** in hydrocarbons.

* In dealing with the real energy **crisis**, I point out that less concern would have been shown in the **crisis** in America were it not informed opinion that there will be, indeed, within a time of interest to most of us, difficulties in keeping up with the expanding need for energy if we are at the same time to eliminate the pollution caused by venting the products of burning fossil fuels into the atmosphere.

* While one could not disagree with the honourable member for Scullin in wishing to make more pure or less impure the waters of the Yarra or any other local stream, one cannot really regard that as an urban **crisis**, although I do not think the honourable member claimed it to be that.

* Nor can one regard as an urban **crisis** the proliferation of motor traffic at certain hours of the day on certain major highways, because in those terms we can develop any inconvenience of living into a **crisis**.

* The term 'urban **crisis**' is much over used and misused at these times.

* What is the Australian Government doing to solve the **crisis** in Korea?

* It has been estimated that there will have to be an outlay of $5,900m over a 5-year period to avert a real **crisis** in the national roads system.

* I hope the 
On the eve of the State election in Western Australia the members of that organisation invited all the representatives of the political parties to be present on the platform to deliver to a very substantial gathering of women from rural areas the policies of their parties and what they proposed to do in respect of the rural **crisis**.

* During the course of these discussions the present Premier of Western Australia, the then Leader of the Opposition, was asked what he was prepared to do about the rural **crisis**.

* At what stage does the **crisis** of conscience come for them?

* But then the **crisis** comes.

* The **crisis** in building and construction caused by the Government's economic policies.

* The honourable member for Oxley claimed that the real **crisis** in our hospitals is in the field of maintenance costs.

* Throughout this **crisis** of surplus cattle, the Government has persisted with a negative program of giving preference to frozen semen without attempting to send any more than 400 of our more productive dairy animals to India, which in no way has matched the effort of our small Agency.

* As a brief preamble I point out that although 2 questions concerning the beef industry were asked yesterday of the Minister for Northern Development, I regard the **crisis** in the industry today to be of such a magnitude that I would expect the Minister and his colleagues to have made important decisions within the last 24 hours.

* The **crisis** was over before this Commission could have brought its attention to bear on the issue.

* Probably my first memory of a political **crisis** occurring was in 1939, when the then AttorneyGeneral in the Lyons Government, R. G. Menzies, resigned from Cabinet because he claimed that the Government had not honoured its election promise to bring in a national superannuation scheme.

* It is quite clear that the nature of the Australian work force altered in a **crisis** way during the past 3 years.

* The germ of the answers to those questions can be found in the **crisis** that developed in the Australian work force during the past 3 years.

* Let me look at what that **crisis** situation is that developed in the nature of the Australian work force.

* A state of **crisis** exists in the drought areas of Queensland.

* The Premier of New South Wales, after saying that there were no real problems and that no-one had been refused, now says: 'We are in a considerable difficulty because of the **crisis** in the countryside.

* It  is a **crisis** situation.

* The Joint Statement issued by the Australian Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  and the US Secretary of Defence  (Mr Schlesinger)  on 10 January 1974 stated 'The Ministers recalled the provisions of Article III of the ANZUS Treaty and confirmed the importance to both Governments of urgent consultations in case of a developing international **crisis**'.

* Mr Barnard  released on the same date a statement which included the following: 
Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* How on earth, in the present economic climate, can a government persist with this attitude when it penalises any creation of funds to ride through a liquidity **crisis**, to insure against a credit squeeze, to provide for expansion and to provide for plant and equipment replacement at a time when rapidly escalating costs make replacement all the more difficult just cannot be comprehended.

* My colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  cannot, even in an emergency situation, dial the phone numbers of members of the National Labour Consultative Council in order to arrange an urgent meeting on this **crisis** facing telecommunications in this country.

* Let me give the House an illustration from the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide of the way in which the Opposition, even tonight, is failing to face the real issues in this situation of **crisis** facing telecommunications in Australia.

* Clearly, Telecom's total acceptance of Commissioner Clarkson 's proposal, which was supported by the Government after discussion with Telecom, indicates its preparedness to have the **crisis** in telecommunications in Australia resolved promptly and properly.

* One of the points with which I would like to deal is the proposition that somehow we are in a state of **crisis** as far as health costs are concerned.

* People tend to respond to what they perceive as crises by jumping up and down and doing things, being seen to be doing things because there is a **crisis**.

* Health costs are not in a state of **crisis**, I emphasise again, in the medical sense of the word.

* The Government is reacting as if we are in a state of extreme **crisis**.

* It is part of a global debate which is taking place against the background of an impending world energy **crisis** of unprecedented and potentially disastrous dimensions.

* It is not a **crisis** which lies in some indefinite future.

* While Australia has been relatively insulated from the effects of the oil **crisis** thus far, we must not formulate policies which ignore the world energy problem and the difficulties which face energy deficient countries, many of which are major trading partners of ours.

* It intends to try to stop this **crisis** deepening.

* Of course, we all know the Government's form: It will not want to come back within cooee of New Years Day, so if we get up and do not return in 1970 we will not take action until a number of months have passed, and in every week that passes there will be more bankruptcies and in every month that passes there will be a deepening of the **crisis**.

* With regard to apprenticeships, the most recent figures available indicate that in New South Wales alone- I accept that the extent of the **crisis** in this industry varies from State to State with New South Wales being accepted by all, including the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman),  as the worst affected- over 1650 apprentices from this industry are now on the dole.

* The doctrinaire policies espoused by the  Deputy  Prime Minister are causing calamity and **crisis** that can only increase and which are already reaching proportions which will cause very great suffering among the Australian people.

* As a result, the Government has lost forever large numbers of valuable officers and has created a **crisis** of confidence which will not be overcome until it is thrown out of office.

* The present muddle-headed policy of the Government is heading us towards inevitable economic **crisis**.

* So too in our defence and foreign affairs, this Government, to use the words of the present Prime Minister, lurches from **crisis** to **crisis**.

* At best, the Government has tried- after the event, after each **crisis**- to guarantee the security of depositors.

* The Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  had the consent of the House to incorporate in  Hansard  a statement he made after the last **crisis** involving a permanent building society in Queensland.

* During the last two years the housing finance industry has gone from **crisis** to **crisis** as a direct result of this Government's policies.

* The **crisis** has been particularly pronounced in Queensland.

* The **crisis** was begun by the inept launching of the Australian savings bonds at the beginning of last year.

* The problems resulting from the 1976 **crisis** have continued.

* This is a hasty response to a **crisis**.

* At present they do it only whenever a **crisis** occurs.

* Another cause for deep concern is the Queensland Government's recent allocation to itself of extraordinarily sweeping arbitrary powers to cope with the current **crisis**.

* But the problem is that this decision was hasty and forced on the Bjelke-Petersen Government by the **crisis**.

* Because of this Government's doctrinaire attitudes the building societies lurch from **crisis** to **crisis**.

* As each **crisis** occurs, general public confidence is further undermined.

* What happened during the recent **crisis** in Iran?

* Even at the time of that enormous **crisis**, the people of Switzerland agreed by a narrow majority of 40,000 votes in a referendum to continue with a nuclear power program.

* Current difficulties have been aggravated by the world monetary **crisis** and the 10 per cent surcharge which has been imposed by the United States of America on our wool exports on top of the existing 25c a lb import duty.

* I do not exempt completely the primary producers from the present **crisis**.

* I remember not so very long ago hearing in this House the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  make comments about  Sir Robert  Menzies, who was the Prime Minister of that day, in regard to what the present Prime Minister called  Sir Robert's  intrusion into the Suez **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* This Labor Government is being condemned yet again by the Premier of South Australia for its lack of policies and its inability to deal with the economic **crisis** that faces this country.

* But the **crisis** in the inability to speak the language is in education.

* In 1976 and most of 1977 1 suppose one could say that things went along without **crisis** in spite of the influx of children from South America.

* The air forces of Australia and of some of our other allies have been prevented from going into that war torn area to bring out the people who are the innocent victims of the **crisis**.

* There will be some sort of **crisis** which will have to be faced up to by the Treasurer.

* Many of us on this side of the House who have spent a lifetime in sheep raising areas have in the last few years made every attempt to serve warning on this nation that the crippling conspiracy of drought and poor market conditions would bring Australians giant industry to a **crisis** point.

* When the Arbitration Commission granted full indexation for the September quarter the Government responded by vilifying the Commission and blaming it for our economic **crisis**.

* Obviously there are several alternatives but, to my mind, it demonstrates that after long and critical examination of the increased capital intensive nature of primary industry the Government is moving with certainty towards the provision of a facility which will help all primary producers to meet the servicing of their debts, which regrettably are eroding their profitability and are essentially one of the causes of the past **crisis** in the rural industries.

* We all like to see home-grown and locally manufactured products promoted, but when there is a **crisis**, as there is at the moment, we should be doing all we can to import building materials to help the home builder.

* In the event of a **crisis**, and the countries of this area were either hostile or neutral, we could never get these aircraft back to Australia to carry put their basic function, the defence of the Australian continent.

* In the event of a **crisis**, on the basis of the previous Government's attitude towards defence, we would not at any stage have been capable of undertaking and honouring our commitment.

* It is conceivable if the present **crisis** continues much longer that, as my friend the Minister for Administrative Services  (Mr Daly)  has pointed out, we may provide members of Parliament with an airline ticket to Canberra but not be able to provide them one to leave Canberra until the Appropriation Bills are passed.

* The new impost on fuel, as he just said, will be a lax on the development of the nation, lt will certainly be a hurtful tax in relation to a countryside in **crisis**.

* He said that the price rise would bring about a **crisis** in the industry in a couple of years.

* Next to unemployment, the provision of shelter is the most serious **crisis** in our community today.

* First, let us look at the **crisis** resulting from the shortage of emergency accommodation.

* But when one looks at the **crisis** and the problems, most of which are policy problems, in Australia one sees that the place for the Minister for Primary Industry at the present time is in Australia.

* Minister should have graciously informed the Director-General of FAO that he was unavailable because of the **crisis** in the Australian rural industries.

* We can only say that never before has it faced such a **crisis** and never before has Australian primary industry faced a greater **crisis**, and that includes the depression, because then at least we knew that it was an economic depression and that the dark cloud had a silver lining.

* -The Australian beef export industry is facing possibly its biggest **crisis** period in its history.

* The complete failure of the Federal Government either to understand or to act on the Australian beef **crisis** is damaging the economy of this nation.

* We on this side of the House have been urging in this Parliament for action, not talk, from the Government on the beef **crisis**.

* At the beginning of his speech the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  observed that the international monetary **crisis** last year led to capital expenditure cutbacks in the mining and other industries.

* The fundamental reality is not that we are helping them but that we are helping ourselves to avert a tragic **crisis**, a **crisis** which would flow across national boundaries and affect the whole world.

* That is a minor point really - although I know it is important if we have not got enough school rooms or teachers - compared with a far more serious **crisis** facing the whole community.

* I refer to a **crisis** in education itself.

* Senator Wriedt  assured the Food Conference that Australia would play its part in meeting the food **crisis**.

* The lack of opportunity to discuss the great **crisis** confronting the people of Bangladesh indicates the low priority of foreign aid.

* During this **crisis** I repeatedly stated that India and the United Nations urgently needed cash, not goods, to provide immediate relief for the refugees.

* But if members of the Opposition genuinely believe that a **crisis** exists, let them stop the nonsense and get down to supporting the solution.

* Nearly 7 per cent had been dismissed, while the rest had resigned for reasons such as ill health, moving to another locality or family **crisis**.

* No doubt, as  Mr Brewer  points out, generally speaking persons possessing job skills are untouched by the current unemployment **crisis**.

* They are in great demand as mercenaries, as people who can be depended upon in times of **crisis**.

* The Sydney Press last night dealt with the great **crisis** in the adequacy of hospital provisions in New South Wales and, of course, there are similar problems around Australia.

* I could continue this great list of examples simply to demonstrate my assertion that the Government is abdicating in the face of a very great **crisis**.

* It is no good waiting until the **crisis** comes.

* As the Deputy Prime Minister said, we are facing a **crisis** with butter and yet this nation is continuing to increase its butter production.

* We have heard from the member who represents the fruit growing districts of South Australia, in regard to the **crisis** say: 
The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  has made it quite clear that the Minister has a responsibility to spell out what the Government's policy is in these cases.

* It is not enough to throw this scheme down as the only thing that we have before us as a solution to the **crisis** and to say: That is it.

* This would achieve nothing more than a postponement of the present **crisis** for a few years after which the problems would return with greater intensity.

* Impassable roads are no answer to a **crisis** or an emergency when they are the only roads in existence.

* But I tell the House this: I sought during the **crisis** to get a man into Darwin.

* Apart from the increase in the cost of goods imported from Japan, America and western Europe, Australia was reasonably insulated from the oil **crisis**.

* The Industries Assistance Commission report on crude oil pricing stated: 
It would appear that Australia could face its energy **crisis** in the next decade rather than in this one unless appropriate action is taken to prepare for likely massive increases in oil costs.

* lt seems to be one of the tragedies of civilisation that it does not recognise a problem until it becomes a **crisis**.

* When one tries to solve problems in an atmosphere of **crisis**, one does not always arrive at the most rational solution.

* This national Government is faced with a world energy **crisis**.

* I would like to make the humble observation that whilst 1 agree that there is a world energy **crisis**, if one takes the time to analyse the situation in the United States one finds that a high proportion of oil, gas uranium and fossil fuel is owned and controlled by multi-national corporations.

* Its failure to do so has put the United States in a position where today its natural gas and particularly its crude oil reserves have reached **crisis** proportions.

* I conclude on this point: When the people of Australia realise just how important it is for a nation to control its resources, whether they be oil, gas, uranium or fossil fuel, in the national interest and in terms of the world energy **crisis**, the Government must be in the position to act in the national interest and, more importantly, in the international interest.

* This is a **crisis** of human factors, as the Minister rightly reminds us, but Australian assistance in the previous **crisis** in Pakistan - the **crisis** which was caused by the tidal wave disaster - was tardy and ungenerous.

* If we tend to flinch from giving aid in this **crisis** because we think it may be a continuing development - if there is a continuing situation in East Pakistan that will produce more refugees - still we have to look back with disappointment at the Australian reaction to the disaster which was not man made and which was not continuing in East Pakistan.

* No doubt it was a factor in producing the immense vote for Mujibur Rahman and finally producing the **crisis** between East and West Pakistan which lies at the root of the present situation.

* If one is giving very small medical aid, then a very small medical team can see that this gets into a situation of **crisis** among the refugees.

* There is no doubt that if a hospital ship had moved into Calcutta it would have added to the facilities to treat wounded people, sick people and people who are suffering as a consequence of their displacement in the political **crisis** that developed in East Pakistan.

* Never before has an Australian government lurched from selfmade **crisis** to self-made **crisis**.

* I hope there will be less of the kind of talk we have heard tonight, because if anything helps to precipitate a rush on or a **crisis** about a currency it is people beginning to talk about whether it may go up or it may go down.

* We believe that these measures are especially inappropriate at this stage of the international monetary **crisis**.

* The main topic I want to discuss tonight is the wool industry because if ever there has been a national **crisis** it certainly has been in wool.

* For the same reason I believe it is quite spurious to ascribe the present situation to the international monetary **crisis**, although this could become a factor in the near future.

* They are in a severe financial **crisis**, loaded with debts, unable to sell most of their crops and facing a return to the factory floorsthat is, if they could get their jobs back, which is very doubtful.

* He needs special help in language study, especially when it reaches into **crisis** areas such as industrial safety.

* In the limited period remaining to me I should like to refer to a matter that should be of great concern to this nation, particularly in view of the oil energy **crisis** which commenced last November.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with the view to substituting the following words: 'this House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic **crisis**, in that: 
I want to relate those events- other than international influences- which have contributed to these circumstances because I believe it is reasonable for us to accept in Australia that we should show how the actions of the Government have contributed to the economic situation and the **crisis** which we face today.

* There is a program that must be faced by a serious government if it is to deal with the economic **crisis** and that is the international program that has been recommended by the  Chairman  of the Union Bank of Switzerland.

* The easy way out is to blame the Government for the **crisis**, but the blame lies well beyond that.

* The present **crisis** is entirely in the field of monetary management and that is where the prime responsibility rests for both the world depression of 1 930 and that of 1 974.

* Everyone knows, with the exception of the leaders of the Government, that the economy is in **crisis**.

* So there we have it- an economy in **crisis**, a **crisis** of this Government's making.

* With reference to the interim report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on its inquiry into the Lebanon **Crisis**, and the quoted figure of 1835 
-From the tone of the question of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition I take it that he is not in favour of the Government's proposition that we are putting to the States for them to bring forward proposals whereby the Commonwealth might assist in underwriting loan moneys for the development of further electric power generation based on coal.

* I cannot think of any greater national project that would be of more benefit during this energy **crisis** period than the development of electricity, both as an alternative to oil power and also to give greater opportunity to Austraiian industry to capitalise on this cheaper form of energy.

* On any analysis the Australian economy is in a state of **crisis**.

* The Government has sought princi- pallybycircumventingtheParliamenttogloss over what can only be described as the worst economic **crisis** in this country since the Second World War.

* In his opening remarks the Leader of the Opposition has accused the  President  of the United States of America of precipitating a great international currency **crisis**.

* However, seeking always to gratify those elements within the Australian Labor Party which are notorious for their anti-Americanism, which are known to the Australian people as the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, he is ready to brand the  President  as a sinister influence engaged by inference in some monstrous capitalistic plot to create a great international currency **crisis**'.

* Having been warned of an impending **crisis** and what should be done the Government waited months before doing anything.

* I am not suggesting this as a permanent feature of policy but we are in a **crisis** situation and unusual and imaginative policies are required to deal with it.

* The Governor-General's prerogative powers, powers which are essential to the preservation of Australian democracy, are the safety valve that ensures that in times of **crisis** it is the people exercising the ultimate right in democracy who have a say in determining the future of their government.

* Unfortunately the world is moving more and more into a **crisis** of violence and so this mutual protection should be one of the great values of our society.

* If they are not removed from this area then the huge percentage who kill, although not with the same degree of criminality, will grow and our country will move more and more into this **crisis** of violence which is spreading today throughout the world.

* He says: 'The international monetary **crisis** jolted world confidence severely.

* And he says finally: - 
Has the attention of the Minister for Minerals and Energy been drawn to a statement by the Western Australian Government that Perth could face a **crisis** with its natural gas supplies by 1980?

* It fixed a price at that time because of the shock of the oil **crisis**.

* Again  1  know that I might be in difficulty if I refer to the **crisis** in the wool industry, but members of the Country Party cla m to represent those engaged in the wool  industry.

* Mr Frank McGuren, because it was through his constant advocacy, persistence, constant representations, speeches in this place and uflagging zeal in talking about these matters, that the Government finally in a time of **crisis** was compelled to take action.

* Under the Portuguese, the Church constituted a kind of buffer between the colonial administration and the ordinary people, to whom it offered some sanctuary in times of **crisis**.

* The canned fruit industry faced a nation-wide **crisis**,  Mr Grassby,  Labor New South Wales said yesterday.

* I refer to the matter of energy and what is known as the energy **crisis** in the world today.

* This is what the Government had to say in Her Majesty's Speech: 
The importance of the creation of a new Ministry of Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 associated with the developing world energy **crisis**.

* Although Australia is in a more fortunate position than most comparable nations in this **crisis**, my Government will not be complacent in planning for the future energy needs of the Australian nation, lt stands ready to join with other nations in search of solutions.

* On the one hand one talks about a world energy **crisis** and the value to Australia of oil exploration, but there is no exploration of any significance in this country.

* The energy policies on which all countries are working- Australia's energy policy was enunciated on 27 June this year- were brought to a head by the price increases of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the **crisis** in Iran at the beginning of this year.

* More purchasing power and massive tax remissions for the privileged minority are not the antidote for the chronic sociological ailment which is our nation-wide housing **crisis**.

* But while we have a **crisis** in housing it would be financially irresponsible to use a large part of the funds available for housing on a scheme such as this.

* I express the gravest concern that a client of the Soviet Union engaged in military aggression, precipitated this **crisis**.

* ~ The present Labor Government assumed office at a time when a **crisis** existed in the housing field.

* Under the previous Government a housing **crisis** had developed to the stage where in all States there existed long lists of outstanding applications for homes for purchase or rental from State housing commissions.

* In New South Wales it has been reported that the inability of the State Housing Commission to compete with private developers for housing blocks has led to a **crisis** point situation developing.

* But what the Minister failed to state was that a record number of our primary industries are facing an economic **crisis**.

* One of the most outstanding of these must surely be the **crisis** in local governments.

* It has created a **crisis** of confidence in which long-term investment- especially risk investment- is no longer prudent or warranted.

* For well over 18 months evidence of the investment **crisis** has been building up.

* Evidence of the investment slump has at the same time been consistently ignored by the Government as in fact it is ignoring that **crisis** at present.

* We have not yet had any indication of what the future holds in regard to the present monetary **crisis**.

* The Government's attitude in completely ignoring this area in the Budget is similar to the contempt shown to the education **crisis** which exists in Australia and which has brought condemnation from private and government school bodies.

* With the increased overseas control of our finance, no wonder our Government has not been able to predict how a world monetary **crisis** will affect us.

* When debate on foreign investment first began the world had not been confronted with an energy **crisis**.

* Added employment of Australian citizens, particularly during the present unemployment **crisis**, the royalties and taxes extracted, together with the foreign exchange generated by exports, are all benefits to Australia and far exceed the profits enjoyed by foreign investors, no matter what is the amount of their equity.

* This Prime Minister persists with a deliberate campaign to blame overseas influences for the present economic **crisis**.

* We shall provide encouragement because, unlike this present administration, we believe that small businesses in Australia require incentive and encouragement, particularly in the present economic **crisis**.

* Why is it necessary to have a **crisis** in New South Wales?

* First of all, this Government has to meet the **crisis** in the private home building sector of the community.

* I turn finally to what has been called the existential **crisis** in which the Aboriginal people find themselves and which is related to material things.

* These things can contribute very little to the solution of what has been identified as the existential **crisis**.

* In the absence of this, in this existential **crisis** in which the Aboriginal person in Australia lives, there is a lot of concern today about the Aboriginal people turning to violence, as though that is a terrible thing.

* I believe that the banking structure with all its instrumentalities and departments - the Commonwealth Development Bank established in I960, the Term Loan Fund established in 1962, the Farm Development Loan Fund established in 1966, and the private trading banking system with its overdraft system of lending - does not really provide the rural industries with the machinery necessary to recover from the **crisis** that faces them at the present time.

* Well, admittedly, since 1967, the Commonwealth has been giving some direct help towards meeting the teacher **crisis**.

* They and their successors for years to come will pay the enormous penalty - and so will the nation incidently - for the blank refusal by a succession of Liberal Party-Country Party federal governments to see the obviously approaching **crisis** years before it came.

* The housing and economic situation in Australia has reached a **crisis**.

* The first point made by the Council is that there would be no beef **crisis** if market access was not restricted.

* As the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council said, there would be no beef **crisis** if present prices to producers were associated with 1973 cost levels.

* Others are: 'Credibility is the PM's- latest **crisis**', PM climbs to fame - and Blame', 'Liberal MPs call for Meeting'.

* A publicly owned Australian organisation is thus giving work to an overseas yard while our own shipyards are facing a **crisis** through lack of orders.

* For the first time negotiations have been taking place with the States over the best way to solve the urban housing **crisis** in Australia.

* I remember when the previous Government was faced with a **crisis** in, I think, 1970 that involved the exchange rate.

* We have now reached a situation where, like it or not, Australia cannot get away from the various world influences in the energy **crisis**.

* In fact, that **crisis** has taken on deep implications for Australians and particularly for Australian motorists.

* No doubt a tremendous **crisis** exists generally in the administration of the Australian economy.

* It is a **crisis** which is seen not just in the measure of industrial unrest which at the moment is being completely ignored by members of this Government, nor is it just in the degree to which inflation is eroding the earnings of the average citizen - 
-It has a great deal to do with the Bill.

* At this moment a great **crisis** is affecting the State governments which, in this Parliament, are represented in the Australian Senate.

* What utter nonsense it is to hear the honourable member for Canberra and Minister for Manufacturing Industry comment on the Statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  that the real **crisis** is the threat to democratic order.

* All we have to do today is look at the **crisis** the Government has created.

* In no way has this Government tried to intervene in order to control the oil **crisis** that threatens this nation.

* 1 ) When did the Leyland Company inform his predecessor of its approaching financial **crisis**.

* I believe there is a great risk in Australians accepting high levels of unemployment and inflation and the economic **crisis**.

* I want to examine the reasons for unemployment One reason is the economic **crisis**, the credit squeeze.

* No emergency relief is offered in the compounding housing **crisis** which exists in Western Australia.

* There is a housing **crisis** and this Government should institute a national inquiry into housing needs and associated matters.

* Overall, in any section of the community in Western Australia, there is a housing **crisis**.

* Why perpetuate the **crisis** of the present in the future?

* There should be a conference and a debate in this House on the possible **crisis** looming in the coal industry and also in the steel industry.

* In any event, the Government seems' cavalierly unmoved by this phenomenally high rate of attrition at a time of developing **crisis** in Australia's nursing services.

* If the appeal is ignored not only will the nursing profession experience a rapid movement into **crisis** but so, too, will our public hospital system, currently serving the nation.

* In addition to that, at the National Conference of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations yesterday Professor Bill Ford said that the real **crisis** of technological change will hit Australia in 1 980-8 1 .

* The real **crisis** of technological change will certainly hit us in 1980-81.

* Having listened to the rhetoric from certain Opposition spokesmen since 24 May it appears that they do not understand the great difficulties now facing the world because of the current energy **crisis**.

* I believe that the legislation introduced by the Minister for National Development  (Mr Newman)  and the way he has approached the problems of the energy **crisis** of 1979, on behalf of the Government team under the leadership of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  is what is needed now.

* We have faced the difficult situation presented by the energy **crisis** by looking at the amount of oil that we are currently producing.

* It has failed to take into consideration that the energy **crisis** is one of the greatest problems that the world faces at present.

* Despite the unquestionable evidence of the growing financial **crisis** in the rural sector which has been available to the Government for at least the last 3 years, the Government has exhibited an incredible display of apathy and confusion with respect to this national problem.

* Despite the gravity of impending bankruptcy of major sections of rural Australia, the cold fact apparently is that the Liberal-Country Party Government just does not have comprehensive policies or immediate plans to combat this **crisis**.

* In the eyes of the Government apparently such matters as law and order as affected by student demonstrations, and the perennial Communist bogey, are far more important to the nation than the critical economic **crisis** that is threatening the economic livelihood of rural areas throughout Australia.

* Make no mistake about it, the responsible party in this **crisis**, as in so many crises that have existed in the past during the reign of various Liberal Party-Country Party governments, is very clearly this Government itself.

* The quality of life or the standard of living which is the right of every Australian to enjoy is today grossly inadequate, ft will continue to be so while this decaying, crumbling Government continues to falter from one **crisis** to the next, with each one more calamitous than that which preceded it.

* One such policy promise was that the Government would accept some responsibility for this **crisis** in pre-school education.

* Honourable members will remember my saying in December of last year that if the economic downturn- the cyclical downturn- in Western economies, which was then being confidently predicted by all of the economic experts around the world, in fact eventuated and if the energy **crisis** remained unresolved there was no way that the ripples of inflation and unemployment which would follow in the wake of these events in the Western economies would not lap our shores as well.

* As I said at Question Time today, in South Australia there is a **crisis** of confidence in the economy.

* The present rural **crisis** not only concerns the man on the land but has widespread sociological, community and centralisation problems.

* The **crisis** seriously impairs development and also consolidation of rural districts throughout Australia.

* As we consider the estimates of the Department of Primary Industry tonight and review the estimated expenditure of $70m we must pose the query as to how the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  can accept the present **crisis** in the countryside.

* It might be said that he does not accept it all, that he is fighting manfully to end the **crisis**, to restore confidence and prevent the flight from the farms.

* Yet it is the policies that have been his direct responsibility on behalf of the Government that have led to the present **crisis** in half the nation.

* The Government's decisions on wheat have contributed to the **crisis** in the countryside in a major way.

* So the **crisis** in the countryside has been contributed to by the Government's decision on wheat.

* The Government has power in its hands to begin to end the **crisis** in the countryside by taking in and paying for all wheat produced last season and this season within its own national ration.

* Australia is in an economic **crisis**.

* Mr Hawke  said: 
When we look at the inconsistency of the Government's policies, we see that Australia is in an economic **crisis**.

* I refer in particular to the employment situation in my electorate where industries such as steel fabrication works are in a serious situation due to the scaling down or, in fact, the stopping of development projects caused by the international economic situation, the effects of this Commonwealth Government's previous budgets and the failure of the Commonwealth to recognise the impending consequences of the situation and to take action on a national scale to rectify the **crisis** that it had .itself assisted to create.

* It is incredible that after 23 years of Federal Liberal administration a national employment and financial **crisis** has been created.

* The building industry is in a **crisis**.

* He chided my colleague, the honourable member for Farrer  (Mr Fairbairn),  for not mentioning the energy **crisis**.

* If the Government continues on its present course, its dealing on behalf of Australia, with the energy **crisis** and the resources we have will not be in Australia's interest or in the interests of anybody else.

* He had reached alert wariness, watchful fear, and, in **crisis**, courage in face of danger.

* We had reached **crisis** point way back in 1966, and he was going to cure all the ills of the Government and everybody else, according to what appears under the heading.

* The basic reason for the continuing unemployment problem largely revolves around the **crisis** for young women as many more married women and senior women are now making it more difficult for young women to get jobs.

* I think it is important that we bear that m mind because the Opposition is trying to lead us to believe that there is a continuing **crisis** in this industry.

* I think it is irresponsible for the Opposition to try to suggest in the Parliament that there is a **crisis** in the industry.

* I can go back even to December 1973, when a lot of people who should have known better went on record criticising me for saying then that 1974 would be a year of rising unemployment, that it had to happen because of the energy **crisis** in the Western economies and because of the downturn in economic activities in the countries that are our chief trading partners.

* Britain is in **crisis**.

* Is the impact of the present world currency **crisis** operating most severely in this Group, which must be responsible for an ultimate solution which will in turn, affect our economy?

* From a study of the financial situation of local governments it is quite easy to see why a **crisis** is developing.

* In fact, the Opposition is very much in favour of the objective of the legislation, which is to help overcome the **crisis** that is developing in the financing of local government authorities.

* The two honourable members from the Opposition side who have spoken suggested that the answers are simple and that it is easy to overcome the unemployment **crisis**.

* The Minister has mentioned a number of anomalies that occur when employers who appear to be genuine people are saying that there is no unemployment **crisis** and they cannot get people to fill jobs.

* -The Opposition brings this matter of public importance before the House today because it is gravely concerned at the current and growing unemployment **crisis** in this country.

* It is also concerned at the Government's perfunctory response to that **crisis**.

* The extent of the problem is something which is fairly common knowledge to members of this Parliament, but may I just quickly reiterate the developing **crisis** which confronts us now.

* All of that adds up to a **crisis** picture.

* The Government's response to that **crisis** has been minimal, to say the least.

* It will not have the effect of doing anything about the present **crisis**.

* He said: 
All that the Government has done in response to the **crisis** can be described as perfunctory.

* Building societies have suffered a liquidity **crisis** through declining investment confidence.

* The Master Builders Association of New South Wales is among the bodies that are seriously concerned about the current **crisis**.

* They of course are professionally involved with the early pipeline activity and their inactivity spells **crisis** for many other professional and trade groups.

* So the **crisis** goes on.

* One effect of the continuing clash between the Houses of Parliament could have been that Parliament would not have had funds with which to operate during a period of national **crisis**.

* Perhaps someone should tell the Minister that there is a **crisis** in our apprenticeship system.

* Public discussion on unemployment has frequently degenerated into harangues of so-called bludgers, in place of rational consideration of the causes, nature and effect of the employment **crisis**.

* Thus, the powerless victims of the **crisis** have somehow come to stand accused of having created their own unemployment- a twist of logic which represents a classic example of blaming the victim.

* When employers, employees and responsible Australians in all walks of life are crying out for a balanced and reasonable approach to the solution of industrial unrest and for ending the inflationary situation that is causing its manifestation, this Government deliberately sets out to create an industrial **crisis** knowing full well that whatever its political advantage, the disadvantage to our country will be devastating.

* At the next opportunity it was to criticise the United States' handling of the Middle East **crisis**.

* The low profile strategy was somewhat distorted by the presence in Apia harbour oi HMAS 'Vampire' and the Fiji Prime Minister, Ratu  Sir Kamisese  Mara, manoeuvred an internal dispute over Fiji unionism into a regional **crisis** involving Australian trade union interference in Fiji affairs.

* The people of La Trobe have realised that Australia faced a **crisis** - a threat to the quality of life that should be due to all Australians and would be restored only when more emphasis was given to community programs in schooling, housing and employment.

* The speech of the Governor-General captures the seriousness of the **crisis** and meets it head on with a 3-year program designed to achieve basic changes in the administration and structure of Australian society.

* 1 wish to comment on the underlying theme of that speech for in the common denominator of the several parts of the pro gram lies the response and understanding of the **crisis** in the quality of life.

* The establishment of the Corporation comes at a time when the apple and pear industry is in **crisis** - as if it has not been in **crisis** for many years.

* He did not devote any part of his speech to the call made by the Foreign Minister of Indonesia,  Mr Malik,  for an international conference - a conference which will deal not only with Vietnam but the **crisis** which has developed in Cambodia as well, a **crisis** which has extended this conflict to the whole of Indo China.

* lt is easy to identify the villain of the piece in the prevailing rural **crisis** - namely, inflation.

* What then is to be done now in the **crisis** affecting the whole of the rural economy?

* At the same time as we look at the proposal put by the honourable member for McMillan, let us look at the so-called fuel **crisis**.

* The Minister loves to talk about this fuel **crisis**, but if there is one it is a political **crisis** which has been caused by the Minister himself.

* These growers feel that if the tax remains it will probably be increased in future budgets, and this could eventually lead to a serious **crisis** for both growers and wineries.

* After an unprecedented world economic **crisis** in 1974 and continuing into 1975- something which happened not only in Australia but also in every comparable country- we had a slow but sure return to economic health taking place about IS months ago.

* Then this country was plunged by the Liberal and National Country Parties into a political **crisis**.

* In using the comparative figures related to the December quarter of 1975, these Fraser Government leaders are seeking to persuade us to forget that they are making comparisons with an economic quarter in which thenown abominable actions created a political and economic **crisis**.

* We need to face the facts that the slow but steady recovery from the world economic **crisis**, which was under way when the Liberal and National Country Parties usurped power, was halted by consecutive policies.

* In Victoria the **crisis** facing the residential sector is a little better.

* We know too that much has been done to meet this **crisis**.

* The enormousness of this **crisis** has to be seen to be believed.

* The traditional signs of economic **crisis** in the rural sector are with us: The destruction of livestock, some form of Government help to impoverished small farmers, and severe unemployment in country towns.

* There is no **crisis** in solid fuels, in energy driving fuels; the shortage exists in liquid fuels.

* I believe that at present the Australian people understand the very deep **crisis** into which this country has been plunged.

* When the Second World War commenced, America was about nineteenth on the list of countries in armed strength, and managed from this base to get through a very great **crisis** which it otherwise might not have overcome.

* From time to time, generally in these periods of **crisis** when the employees are worried about the future, I visit the Government Aircraft Factories and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation.

* On the other hand, the Government is revealed as lurching from **crisis** to **crisis**, adopting an  ad hoc  approach and not following any practical guidelines.

* The **crisis** is here and now, and the establishment of yet another committee will not solve it.

* The world-wide recession sparked off by the oil **crisis** of 1973 produced higher unemployment in almost all the OECD countries, including Australia.

* Beyond the immediate **crisis**, though part of its solution, there must be a continuing long term job creation program.

* Another matter that the honourable member for Farrer evidently forgot is that today there is a world energy **crisis**.

* The future of the world - there is a world hydro-carbons **crisis** - will be determined by the possession of coal reserves.

* In conclusion I point out that we do have an energy **crisis**.

* We do have a Government which, fortunately, is planning, and has planned, for that **crisis**.

* At a time of a world energy **crisis**, we see only pitiful mismanagement, incompetence and lack of foresight by the Minister for Minerals and Energy.

* This year 90 wells will be drilled, at a time of a world oil **crisis** and declining Australian reserves.

* Another matter I would like to draw to the Government's attention is that it had a former Minister for External Affairs, now the Governor-General, who in the Bihar famine **crisis** - this is very little realised in Australia - sent $35m in aid to India.

* The wonders of the $1.5m for the present **crisis** rather pale into insignificance when compared to the action that  Sir Paul  Hasluck took when he was Minister for External Affairs.

* I merely point out that is is an instance of the importance of land in their thinking and' that each **crisis** we have run into has at base a **crisis** built upon the fact that they regard land as vitally important.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Indeed, I would go so far as to say that had the suggestion of the Minister for Immigration been adhered to before the strike reached the **crisis** stage that dispute may never in fact have occurred at all.

* My point is that the colleges of advanced education are going through a **crisis** and it is up to the Government to recognise this situation and provide the necessary action.

* The report said that equipment is needed in every one of the Institute's tertiary departments: It went on to say: 
Most people have welcomed initiatives by producer organisations and by the Commonwealth and State governments to improve the situation in the beef industry, an industry that has been in a **crisis** situation for some 2 years.

* This **crisis** has had the effect of making all sections of the meat industry look more realistically at its situation.

* Where we have people supporting industries that have helped save this country from what might well have been a great financial **crisis**, with drought and troubles in the wool and other industries and where we have them going to remote and isolated settlements scattered right across this nation, despite what might be provided by the companies concerned, governments - particularly the Federal Government - must earmark special funds to assist.

* So I have asked that this **crisis** be discussed at Cabinet level.

* I hope that in the days ahead of this **crisis** the Government will stress this point in those councils.

* As he said, it is preliminary and really not much has happened in the last few days other than that, the situation has not accelerated further into a **crisis**.

* These expenditures serve to soften the blow that capitalism- particularly capitalism in **crisis**- exerts on the people.

* The present Government relies on this percentage of self sufficiency, which has resulted from incentives and concessions given by the former Government over 23 years of office and which has enabled the Australian community to be in the happy position that it is in today in the face of the world energy **crisis**.

* It is a background of an undoubted world energy **crisis**.

* The world energy **crisis**, into which the Arab oil producing nations have plunged the world, will surely reach Australia's shores.

* Compare what is needed with the last Lynch Budget forecast of 2 per cent real growth for 1977-78, and with the later and rather optimistic OECD forecast for calendar year 1978 of  VA  per cent, and one can better understand the magnitude of the unemployment **crisis** confronting this Government.

* What is the response of the Prime Minister to this **crisis**?

* We face a **crisis** situation within 10 years so far as liquid fuel supply is concerned, yet the Government offers only a tentative and partial energy conservation program.

* Never has the Australian apple and pear industry faced a **crisis** such as the one it is now going through.

* If we had established our own overseas shipping line at that time we could now have 15 to 20 of our own modern ships on the overseas trade runs and our industries would not bc facing the **crisis** that confronts them today because of high freight rates.

* If it has not this is a disgrace to Tasmania because the **crisis** caused by the increased freight rates charged by the ANL is affecting the whole of the Tasmanian economy.

* We all know that the Australian beef industry has been in a financial **crisis** situation since 1974.

* The **crisis** of liquidity had its origins in the 1973 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries oU **crisis**; one consequence being the sudden and complete closure of the Japanese market to Australian export beef.

* I make the point that it is indeed unfortunate that in the ensuing four years research into beef marketing has centred on the quantification and dimensions of the cattle industry **crisis** rather than on providing a direction out of the **crisis**, both at the economic level and the political level, to ensure an improvement in the marketing structure of the Australian beef industry.

* In the circumstances therefore I again plead -  (Quorum formed)  Once again I make a plea to the Opposition that it draw back from the brink of economic **crisis** to which it is pushing this country.

* The symptoms include: sluggish economic growth verging on recession; stubbornly high rates of inflation; high and intractable unemployment; recurring disruptions in the monetary system; the emergence of a real energy **crisis**; rapidly escalating Third World debt; widespread poverty and malnutrition.

* The effect of all that is simply to heighten the **crisis** in the world community.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* My solution goes to the reality and truth of what we are doing, basically the problem is that we are facing a **crisis**.

* He then said that in his view a temporary purpose was to avert the **crisis** and the disaster that the Labor Attorney-General of the day thought on indications at that time would have arrived by 
The major short term causes of the State's unemployment **crisis** are well recognised and can be counted on the fingers of one hand.

* But now they are approaching a **crisis** position and they are very much dependent on their Tasmanian representatives.

* Whilst this Liberal-Country PartyDemocratic Labor Party coalition is going from one **crisis** to another, whilst we move from one seemingly inevitable ad hoc decision to another, the people of Australia are suffering.

* He said that the energy **crisis** was the greatest **crisis** in the history of the United States, short of the **crisis** of war.

* He said that the United States had been hurt by the **crisis** and that Japan was in even worse straits.

* What steps would you take to alleviate the present **crisis** in the beef industry?

* It is ironic that restraints on this particular activity, so important now in this particular **crisis**, have the complete consensus of the Opposition.

* Therefore, in the number of dwellings getting under way, we still see a long-term problem and **crisis** in the housing sector.

* People interested in this area will be able to examine the report and I hope criticise the Government generally for not having taken action to overcome the **crisis** in housing.

* It would take a man of extraordinary administrative incompetence to achieve a situation where there is a sharp reduction in oil exploration at a time of world oil **crisis** and when Australia's proven reserves have only a few years to run.

* Yesterday the Federal Council of the Liberal Party met to decide what that Parry's policy should be towards what Liberals call the **crisis** in CommonwealthState financial relations.

* It is significant that these relations reached **crisis**' proportions at a time when the coalition parties had a monopoly of every government, Stale and Federal, in this country, a monopoly broken only last Saturday week.

* In 1965 a **crisis** had arisen because of mechanisation in the industry.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* This **crisis** maintenance policy implementation has now reached the stage where essential equipment is becoming increasingly non-operational and to rectify this position in the short term, additional funds of $100,000 are considered to be absolutely essential.

* In the current unemployment **crisis** Western Australia is suffering more and is being assisted by the Commonwealth Government less than is any other State.

* There the Government determined that it would give a certain amount of money to endeavour to meet the world food **crisis**, not on the basis of guide lines laid down in this Parliament or at the Conference itself, but simply because Canada had decided to give in excess of $30m.

* Yet at the height of this **crisis** we heard the great spokesman for the rural wing or rump, as it is sometimes called, of the Labor Party preparing to scuttle the ship.

* The greatest danger at the present time is that because of the growing economic **crisis** in major sectors of primary industry, to quote the words of the matter raised for discussion in this debute, hasty, ill-considered policies will be proposed designed merely to take the heat off temporarily rather than to attack the real cause of the situation.

* We must look at what would occur if there was a **crisis** and a sudden demand for the repatriation of profits which have been capitalised in this country by being allowed to remain here or, alternatively, the repatriation of capital which had previously been borrowed from overseas and sent to this country, lt could be any type of **crisis** - a political **crisis** or a severe **crisis** in Papua and New Guinea.

* The difference could be accounted for to some extent by the different closing dates of the books of the various companies; but there is no doubt that if a **crisis** did occur and the Government, irrespective of its political colour, had to make a sudden decision as to how to overcome the **crisis**, there could not be a ready assessment of the extent and potential in the repatriation of overseas capital and profits.

* Otherwise, in the event of a **crisis** we could be placed in a very difficult position.

* Instead, I believe that this House should be debating a motion seeking to congratulate the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  for his action to expose the policies of this Government not only prior to the November 1976 devaluation but also in respect of the present **crisis**.

* The **crisis** was in relation to the capital account and not the balance of trade where there was a surplus of over $ 1 ,000m.

* To make the position worse, currently the world is undergoing a monetary **crisis** in which the world's major banker - the United States - is, according to orthodox capitalist canons, verging on insolvency.

* How many women's refuge and **crisis** centres are in existence in each State and Territory.

* I refer to what is commonly called the rural **crisis** and also the urban **crisis**.

* During the last few years we have witnessed the oil **crisis**, unprecedented exchange rate fluctuations and world stagflation.

* Milton Ferris in his article '**Crisis** and Change in America's Health system' said this: 
The honourable member for Warringah  (Mr Mackellar)  has revealed a tendency that is all too apparent in the policies of the Government when faced with a national **crisis** and a national problem.

* The situation is one of **crisis** and the position is worse this year than it was last year, with the lack of adequately trained teachers and the increasing use of stopgap teachers.

* The real issue facing the world today is the energy **crisis** and this is what the world should be tackling so that collectively we can overcome this **crisis** other than by the use of atomic energy which will pollute this world for the next 250,000 years.

* Under the normal sittings that were planned for the House the Bill would not have been dealt with until the week commencing 19 November, but because of the stupidity over the constitutional **crisis** the matters set down for later in the parliamentary session have had to be brought forward.

* The amendment states: this House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic **crisis**, in that: 
-That has nothing to do with it.

* The fact is that in this world when we have a food **crisis** or a **crisis** concerning the sources of energy, it is not hard to imagine a situation in which the threats that we may suffer from could be much greater than they have ever been before.

* There was a **crisis** climate created in this Parliament.

* The then Opposition created a **crisis** climate by rejecting our Budget in 1974.

* The Prime Minister should be getting the Russians and the Americans together to work out how they can get their ships through without this **crisis** complex developing.

* The report underlines the fundamental contradiction which is built into the nation's transport program when it refers to the near certainty of Australia's reversal to overwhelming dependency on imported oil in the 1 980s at a time of a mounting world wide petroleum **crisis**.

* The report states: 
Of course, while the energy **crisis** makes the need for a fresh approach to land based transport in Australia compelling, especially with respect to Australian cities, there are other factors involved as well.

* and John McDermott, M.D., in an article entitled Abortions and Acute Identity **Crisis** in Nurses' wrote: 
The article goes on to comment that the symptoms were due to an acute identity **crisis** regarding their nursing roles caused by their abortion activities.

* Perhaps if there had been proper representation at that critical time we might have been able to have avoided the development of the Cambodian **crisis**.

* There is obviously a very great need for increased teacher college accommodation in Victoria, because that State is passing through its worst **crisis** in relation to the provision of teaching staff.

* There was in the Melbourne 'Age' on 21st May a report from the Victorian Teachers Union which showed just how severe this **crisis** would become by the 1970s.

* I saw an article the other day which said that India would probably have to absorb something like 80 per cent of its foreign exchange to buy the energy that she requires in the present oil **crisis**.

* Regrettably in times of economic **crisis** there has been a tendency for socialist governments to allow their idealogical commitments to inhibit rational and objective analysis of changing circumstances.

* The solution to our **crisis** must lie in the Government instituting policies which encourage increased production while applying selective controls to dampen down excess demand.

* I suggest that if the Constitution had been drawn up about 12 or 15 years later than it was the situation we have at the moment would not have occurred, because about 1910 or 1911 after a constitutional **crisis** in the United Kingdom the House of Lords had the power to refuse money taken away from it- or it agreed by virtue of the circumstances that it could not refuse money to the Parliament.

* If this should happen in this Parliament we will be faced with a very serious constitutional **crisis**.

* Since 1976 the extent and duration of unemployment have reached **crisis** levels, yet this Government continues to persecute the unemployed through restrictive work tests and a subsistence level unemployment benefit.

* Let us take a look - a hard-headed look - at those policies and disregard temporarily the stupid, doctrinaire Connor approach which long-term threatens our self sufficiency in oil which has enabled us to ride out the prevalent world **crisis** in oil supplies better than most countries in the world.

* But we ako got, firstly, access through Esso to technological ability and know-how that was and still is, available to Australia on a limited scale only; secondly, risk capital of $309m from Esso and $189m from the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd without a dollar of taxpayers' money imperilled, and, thirdly, above all we got the Bass Strait oil and gas fields, a cheap source of supply of crude oil, and the knowledge that on known Australian reserves our supplies are assured until at least the early 1980s, and a position of being one of the few countries in the world unaffected by the recent oil **crisis**.

* Would any Australian object to a service charge of S20m a year in return for what we got - the savings we made in overseas payments, and the freedom from the recent oil **crisis**?

* The States have joined with the Commonwealth in accepting responsibility for providing financial relief to help farmers weather this **crisis** or facilitate their exit from dairying where this seems to be the more prudent course.

* The current **crisis** in the dairy industry is yet another manifestation of the effect of sinusoidal fluctuations in the world supply and price of manufactured milk products.

* This is the sort of nonsense that he tried to put over to the farmers in Launceston last week, in the State most affected by this dairying **crisis**.

* The old Country Party shibboleth has manifested itself- again-encourage production, ignore world trends, wait until a **crisis** is around one's ears and then vacillate, call for a second, superflous IAC report on the industry, which the Minister has just done, and waffle at farmer meetings month in and month out while thousands of families go destitute across the nation.

* He says: "The international monetary **crisis** jolted world confidence severely.

* But it will not be enough to find our way out of the recent monetary **crisis**.

* We have said that we needed first to deal with the current **crisis** and only then should we consider the question of possible reform.

* Noone in this Parliament, no-one in Australia and certainly no wheat grower will be satisfied with the attempt of the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  to downgrade the importance of the present **crisis** in the Australian-Chinese wheat trade and, generally, in trade relations between Australia and China.

* Usually the honourable member opposite talks in **crisis** terms.

* I do not think anybody in Canberra would talk much about a transport **crisis**, even if they are prepared to do so in Sydney, Melbourne or New York.

* It is one thing to identify a problem; it is another thing to turn it into a **crisis** verbally; it is another thing to get a balance; and it is a further thing to solve the problem.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* It is yet another aspect of the national credibility **crisis**.

* As our economic **crisis** and our national **crisis** deepens there will be more attacks on living standards, more unemployment, more pressure on the wages of ordinary breadwinners and families.

* It would be foolish to say that Australia has nothing to fear from the energy **crisis**.

* The international **crisis** has passed.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Has he yet considered the request of the State Premiers for a special Premiers Conference to discuss the depressed condition of the Australian economy and in particular the problems of unemployment, the rural **crisis** and the cost-price inflation?

* Sydney, above any other city in the whole of Australia, has a land **crisis**.

* It would not be in the best interests of Sydney because, as this Government knows, Sydney is facing a dire **crisis**.

* After all, developing countries in the world have never faced' a greater **crisis** than they are facing at present, not merely because of the energy **crisis**, not merely because of oil prices, not merely because of oil inflated prices, but also because of the difficulties that many countries have with nitrogenous fertilisers.

* I would have thought that, taking the example of the energy **crisis** that I mentioned, we would have to look again at the nations at whom we are directing our aid, some of whom within the whole context of developing countries will benefit to some extent by the energy **crisis**.

* While it is true that the net flow of financial resources, to developing countries from the donor countries has increased greatly in size - it amounted to 1971 to $US18,000m - the impact of this expenditure has been undermined to a significant degree by such factors as the world inflationary movement, the energy **crisis**, the international monetary **crisis** and by burgeoning population growth in the developing countries themselves.

* Australia's comparatively high rate of inflation, the decline in world commodity prices and the effects of the world oil **crisis** will clearly exacerbate the developing negative balance of trade.

* present **crisis** situation.

* It is this deliberate government action that has created the **crisis** with aged persons homes and nursing homes.

* There has been a belated recognition on the part of the Government, after the honeymoon period of the first 12 months was over, that it was impossible to achieve its aim of a Government takeover in these areas; and I hope there will be a recognition that the Government's pacesetter policies in wage and salary adjustments have created or helped to create this **crisis** in building costs and the salaries of those employed in these places.

* It is of no use for Government members to talk about the double dissolution retarding the generosity of the Government, because the double dissolution forced it into taking some action to give up, at least for the time being, this ideological approach which was causing this **crisis** in the field of aged persons homes and nursing homes.

* One only has to read the newspaper comments on the **crisis** which is facing aged persons housing and nursing home organisations to realise that.

* I was disappointed that the report dismissed without any real analysis the proposition that a bounty be paid on a limited tonnage per farm and that it ignored the **crisis** now existing for aerial agriculture.

* He is saying: We've just solved the oil **crisis**!

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* There is a world hydrocarbons **crisis**.

* A point is quickly being reached - it is in fact being intensified by the present **crisis** precipitated in the Arab countries in respect of pricing - when it will be as economical to extract oil, petroleum and other derivatives from suitable coal types as to produce them from the ground by drilling.

* Will the Government react to this **crisis** situation in any positive manner or will it continue its policy of abandonment of this key industry which has already reached a peak of unemployment?

* It is perfectly true that the principal reason for the **crisis** in the beef industry today is the collapse of the world price of beef.

* Firstly, let us make it very clear indeed that the principal **crisis** is due to the collapse of the overseas markets.

* We have to measure the Bill's provisions against some of the aspects of the present **crisis** position.

* Looking at the quantitative aspects, we have to remind ourselves that there is a very observable **crisis** - the shortage of teachers of all kinds in both State and nonState schools.

* He would not know what the words 'fiscal' and 'responsible ' mean but he probably would know what '**crisis**' means because he belongs to the group of people who brought this country into a great **crisis** in the three years that people regret so much throughout our community.

* The honourable member for Gellibrand said: 
The speech of the Governor-General captures the seriousness of the **crisis** - a threat to the quality of life that should be due to all Australians - and meets it head on with a 3-year program designed to achieve basic changes in the administration and structure of Australian society.

* Surely they were not unconscious of the fact that they were creating a very serious **crisis** in the housing industry, when in a 2-year period they allowed the money flowing from banks, building societiesand insurance companies to increase by 300 per cent without a comparable increase in the supply of materials or the size of the work force.

* Today Australia is facing an economic **crisis** of a kind which threatens to undermine our whole society.

* In fact, I believe this Budget will only worsen the **crisis** which is gripping this nation.

* I rise tonight to make a plea to the Government that it make available to the States emergency grants so that they can effectively deal wilh the **crisis** that is affecting hospitals.

* All 1 want to do is to make an urgent plea that the Commonwealth accept responsibility for this situation and recognise that the **crisis** can be removed or relieved only by its intervention.

* It will deteriorate even further unless aid is given by the Commonwealth Government, lt is clear that the State of Victoria is not in a position to meet this **crisis**.

* The voluntary agencies, already in a state of **crisis**, will have to find money and food vouchers.

* Families at risk in this country need economic and social justice to prevent **crisis** situations which so often occur unnecessarily.

* We could not produce sufficient ammunition to respond quickly to any sort of **crisis**.

* All of us in this Parliament who owe allegiance to Australia's flag and a duty to its people have a basic obligation to rectify this situation before we have a serious **crisis**.

* He would know that we may face a **crisis** within the next eight to 10 years, or even sooner, and that we must be prepared for it.

* What is his attitude to the statements from medical research organisations that medical research is facing a **crisis** because of insufficient funds.

* That in view of the **crisis** envisaged in the supply of trained dentists to provide a denial service to the Australian community the Commonwealth Government should, through the Australian Universities Coinmission, give high priority to forward planning for dental education.

* The Government, on coming to office, said that it would change quarterly tax collection of company tax and would suspend it for the period of the present **crisis**.

* The Government is guilty of gross neglect not only of the wheat growers of Australia but of the taxpayers also for not informing us 5 years ago of this serious **crisis** towards which the wheat industry was heading.

* The **crisis** in Australian politics today is one of credibility.

* In this Parliament we have seen evidence of that **crisis** of credibility in what the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Government offer.

* The shortage of nursing staff in public hospitals has reached **crisis** point.

* There is a great **crisis** in staffing in public hospitals throughout Australia.

* The situation has been pointed up by a meeting some weeks ago called by the Royal Australian Nursing Federation at which the following resolution was passed: 
There exists in these areas an economic and social **crisis** of considerable magnitude.

* This **crisis** has gone beyond the point where it can be classified as an industrial problem.

* The **crisis** cannot be seen simply in economic terms.

* In view of the economic **crisis** in Australia- mounting unemployment and price rises, with worse in sight- and his admitted lack of expertise in economic matters, and as the Prime Minister has often prided himself on being a good Australian, will he now serve the best interests of the country by stepping down as Prime Minister to make way for the  Deputy  Prime Minister,  Dr J.  F. Cairns, the only Labor Minister who takes a close and consistent interest in the critical economic areas of government responsibility?

* one which is similar to the Cuban missile **crisis** of 1962 .

* It is of no particular strategic concern to Australia but it is as serious as the 1962 Cuban missile **crisis**.

* One is a humanitarian issue concerning the amounts we give to international disaster assistance, and I should like to inject some new thoughts concerning the **crisis** in Timor.

* I refer to the last page of the Governor-General 's Speech where he said: 
Essentially, what has been created is a phony **crisis**.

* Except in terms of the internal affairs of the Liberal Party, there is no CommonwealthState **crisis**.

* There is a **crisis** in school finance; there is a **crisis** in hospitals finance; there is a **crisis** in city finance.

* If there is one thing which the present economic **crisis** which the Western world is suffering should teach us it is that we have to improve the productivity to bring about an improvement in our standard of living.

* The purpose of the borrowings, as set out in the explanatory memoranda for the Executive Council, was to meet the needs of the Australian Government for 'substantial sums of non-equity capital from abroad for temporary purposes, amongst other things to deal with exigencies arising out of the current world situation and the international energy **crisis**, to strengthen Australia's external financial position, to provide immediate protection for Australia's supplies of minerals and energy and to deal with current and immediately foreseeable unemployment in Australia'.

* The world energy **crisis** had shown no signs of easing.

* The wheat industry reached a point of **crisis** a little more than 2 years ago when supplies were far in excess of market requirements and storage capacity.

* At a time when the world faces another Middle East **crisis**, when supplies of export oil to many countries are in jeopardy, when many countries, some of them close neighbours, are now faced with not only trying to find alternative supplies of oil and associated products but also having to pay enormous prices when they happen to find a market in which they can buy, the importance of selfsufficiency is emphasised once again.

* What impeccable timing the Opposition has, coming into this chamber at a time when the world faces an oil **crisis** to complain about oil prices for short term political effect.

* Would honourable members opposite just surrender to that at a time when, as I said, we are facing a Middle East **crisis**.

* In a time of critical **crisis**, a suggestion that we would renege on our pricing situation - 
At the root of the economic **crisis** is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector.

* Measures to deal with this **crisis** will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible.

* The point at issue as raised by the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  is whether action should be taken to help meet the growing economic **crisis** in the countryside.

* He addressed a meeting of nearly 2,000 people, which was sponsored by sixty local government and other bodies to discuss the very **crisis** that he now denies should be a cause of concern to this Parliament.

* I recognise that the Minister has his warm supporters, but despite them the rank and file of the people of Jerilderie would have preferred a visit from the other historic character who rode into the town some years before and who at a time of **crisis** did something positive by burning up all the mortgages he found in the Bank.

* The  President  of a Riverina graziers organisation, who is hardly a roaring radical but is a gentleman of great substance and standing whom I respect, told the meeting that the **crisis** in the countryside was an immediate problem for the Government.

* The  President  of the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association of New South Wales put his finger on wool as one of the keys to the rural **crisis**.

* Let us look at this business of whether there is validity in our submission today, which was put so well by the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  that there is a **crisis** in the countryside.

* The Minister for Primary Industry went to one of those meetings, I might add, and probably had something to say about the **crisis** in addition to what he said today.

* The burden of their message was that they were in trouble; that there was a **crisis** and that it had to be tackled by the Government.

* Of the **crisis** in rural industry about which we are talking there was not a hint in the Governor-General's Speech.

* The Government says there is no **crisis** anywhere.

* Is there a denial today by the Minister that in fact there is a **crisis**?

* Despite all the activity by the Government in the past 20 years, we face this **crisis** now.

* Let me just cite one town as an example of the situation and of this **crisis** which is real and cannot be denied.

* I refer to a town in which every business house and the co-operative gathered together and announced in the local Press that all credit had finished, that it had ended, that it had to be cash or nothing because of the **crisis** confronting primary industry.

* They demand action because there is a **crisis** in primary industry.

* Revolution in an advanced capitalist country can become a possibility only if there is a serious economic **crisis**.

* This Government must shortly become aware that there is a **crisis** developing in large sections of our rural community.

* Panic repetition of such measures in the interim can lead to a **crisis** when they all take effect.

* The importance of the creation of a new Ministry of Minerals and Energy has been confirmed by the events of 1973 associated with the developing world energy **crisis**.

* Although Australia is in a more fortunate position than most comparable nations in this **crisis**, my Government will not be complacent in planning for the future energy needs of the Australian nation.

* On 1 April this year I made a statement to the Parliament pointing out the Government's sympathetic attitude to the victims of the present **crisis**, particularly those with relatives in Australia, and outlining special arrangements which were being put in train to assist them.

* Firstly, during the **crisis** in Lebanon, we maintained a presence in Beirut sometimes under conditions of quite extreme danger.

* I concluded my reply by saying: 
We have a **crisis**, an energy **crisis**.

* The **crisis** is with us now.

* It may not be obvious because we do not have at this moment blackouts and petrol rationing, but the **crisis** is very real.

* This Government, in its Budget, has taken this energy **crisis** into consideration.

* In the short term of energy requirements- here we are talking of the next 12 years or so to 1990- we have our **crisis**.

* This Government is moving in appreciation of this **crisis** which shows up in Australia as a liquid fuel **crisis**.

* The further approach to alleviate the liquid fuel **crisis** is of course exploration.

* There are also 60 off-shore and 70 on-shore exploration permits, due to this Government's appreciation of our **crisis**.

* Let me just quickly run through some of the other aspects of the energy **crisis**, areas which will require government initiatives and action.

* At this stage we should pay tribute to the Victorian Government and the Premier,  Mr Hamer,  who, in appreciation of the energy **crisis**, has personally arranged vast experimental work in conjunction with overseas experts to convert Victoria's huge brown coal reserves to liquid fuels in order to tide us over this **crisis**.

* On the other hand, Premier Wran of New South Wales has no appreciation of the **crisis**.

* In conclusion I remind honourable members that we have an energy **crisis** now.

* This Government has appreciated the **crisis** and in the Budget has moved to overcome it.

* This development has already proceeded apace and the whole complex of pumping schemes that has come into being in recent years has proved invaluable in preventing drought losses and also has put huge areas in a better position to brave the current rural **crisis**.

* There has been a significant increase in the salaries of university lecturers and professors, and I am not criticising this, but when we talk about difficulties in education, problems in education and the **crisis** in education, it is interesting to note that in 1952 the salary of a subject master in the New South Wales Department of Education was approximately equal to that of a university lecturer whereas in 1970 the salary of the subject master is approximately only two-thirds of that of a university lecturer.

* -Let me put into perspective the **crisis** that is facing the mineral and energy industries of Australia today.

* Energy policy has been falsely predicated on unlimited availability and profligate use, bringing Australia face to face with a serious energy **crisis** in the early 1980s.

* This kind of tax on consuming nations is the very antithesis of the developing international economic relations since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries **crisis** of October 1973. International relationships today are being built on a policy of interdependence between consuming and producing nations, not on a policy of confrontation or on a policy of resources blackmail.

* With this kind of approach, with a true appreciation of the energy **crisis** which will face Australia in the 1980s - 
Primary industries have suffered from years of drought which still gives rise in some parts of Australia to a major problem in regard to the re-establishment of primary producers.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr McEwen)  and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony),  along with Government members, have been giving this important problem considerable attention with wool industry leaders, and every effort is being made to solve the **crisis** which has arisen in the wool industry.

* Our aim is to inject into the Parliament through this committee a greater understanding of the **crisis** of unemployment.

* The report of the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty showed that the majority of these unemployed people had little or no buffer against any potential financial **crisis**.

* This is not the only country facing this **crisis** but it seems to be the only one intent on doing nothing about it.

* The Government waited until there was a **crisis** in the wheat industry and then it acted to bring in a quota system.

* After listening to the  Deputy  Prime Minister one would think that there is no such thing as a rural **crisis** in Australia.

* Yet every speech that has been made by members of the Country Party in recent months has been based on calamity howling about the rural **crisis**.

* Now we hear from the Leader of the Country Party that there is no rural **crisis**.

* But the Country Party says that there is no rural **crisis** in Australia.

* Of course there is a rur.il **crisis**, and every member of this Parliament knows that there are very serious problems in the wool growing areas of Australia.

* Never has this nation been worse off in terms of a rural **crisis**, especially in the wool industry - our greatest industry - since the depression of 1929-30 and yet positive action still has not been taken in the field of marketing.

* For that reason, I wholeheartedly support the motion moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  condemning this Government for its failure in economic policies 
The belief that the world food **crisis** is not a temporary aberration but a persistent and worsening problem which already has overtones of disaster must focus attention on the little time we have in which to work out a solution.

* Australia must take a more responsible position in encouraging its producers to play their part in this world **crisis**.

* The Australian Government has a responsibility to ensure that the primary industry sector of our economy does have the necessary incentive and the necessary willingness to expand production so that we can offer to play our part in this **crisis**.

* The effect of that on the production of Australian grains and protein is enormous but when we talk about the billions of dollars needed to boost agricultural production in other countries an Australian contribution of $56m in this significant **crisis** is chicken feed.

* I call on and urge the Government to look responsibly at this problem so that Australia cannot only be seen to be but also will be playing a positive part in the solution of the world 's food **crisis**.

* This latter **crisis** was brought on by a falling off in the demand for steel and by a slight falling off in New South Wales and 
Industry has had incredible trouble because of its attempts to obtain cheap movement of bulk tonnages like coal and iron ore.

* I believe that this is a temporary **crisis**.

* It is a good thing that we have this **crisis** now, because something must result from it.

* This **crisis** has been brought on by industrial trouble and a recession in the steel industry.

* The country possesses important domestic resources in coal, petrol, gas and uranium which will probably protect it over a long period from the direct repercussions of the world energy **crisis**.

* I know that this Minister deserves most of the blame for bringing the mining industry in Australia to its present state of confusion and **crisis**.

* By bringing confusion and **crisis** to the mining industry the Government can more easily gain control of these industries.

* The most disturbing aspect of Australian oil production is that we can now say with certainty that in 5 years time Australia will face its own oil **crisis**, and honourable members know what that means.

* RESEARCH **CRISIS** 
A moment ago I reflected in passing on the paper prepared by Professor Richard Blandy.

* There would then be an education **crisis** of truly classic proportions.

* The Government's perfunctory response to the unemployment **crisis**.

* The simplistic view that increasing exports is the answer is also wrong, because it has been the very success of Japan's export effort, its enormous positive trade balance in relation to most of its trading partners, which has resulted in most economic pundits now putting the blame on Japan as one of the causes of the present world economic **crisis**.

* Much has been mentioned recently in the Press and in other places about the **crisis** faced by capitalism, which is the system which operates in the Western democracies, and about a need for change.

* For instance, I believe that, with the continuing energy **crisis** in the world, there will be a need to use resources to develop such things as solar energy.

* The monetary **crisis** preceded the oil **crisis** and to some extent was perhaps responsible for it.

* Liberal Parties in providing **crisis** accommodation was one of the major issues in the State election to be held on 7 October.

* Of all people on the Government side of the chamber who should not be saying anything at the present time about creating uncertainty in rural industry it is the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  because he more than anybody else has caused the rural **crisis** because of the statements which he has made.

* He dismissed the whole rural **crisis** in 10 words.

* The Treasury recommended that the new estimate not be published until the economic difficulties caused by the constitutional **crisis** of that month and the **crisis** itself were resolved.

* And for the first time since the oil **crisis** of October 1973, Australia's economic problems and their solution depend more on what happens here than on what happens overseas, among our great trading partners.

* I believe that in the years ahead it will become a reality because of the world energy **crisis**, because of the rising costs of Middle Eastern oil on the world market and because of the fears of people as to the use of uranium.

* Paragraph (b) reads: the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system.

* Surely, if nearly 50 per cent of the people in a democratic country are not only hopeful but also adamant that another constitutional **crisis** will not occur, then it is reasonable that a government should acknowledge and dispel such fears.

* Let me restate to the House paragraphs (b) and (c) of the amendment: 
the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system; and 
At the present time the dairy industry in Australia is suffering from probably the greatest **crisis** in its history.

* Thus preventive and long term chronic care services are submerged to acute and **crisis** care.

* For instance, only the Commonwealth has available the sort of financial resources to avert the gathering **crisis** in Australia's public hospital services.

* On top of this there was a worsening problem in the Western democracies with regard to the liquidity of the oil **crisis**.

* In the debate on this subject last October the Government reviewed the action which had been taken to that date in regard to the serious **crisis** in the beef industry.

* That Committee established close liaison with the cattle industry as soon as the **crisis** started.

* I repeat that 80 per cent of world imports of beef are accounted for by these 2 markets in which Australia has already established a very firm base and in which the present **crisis** is politically motivated in order to protect the interests of the domestic meat producers.

* But these are **crisis** times which require more than just those schemes which I have outlined.

* It was designed for the preenergy **crisis**.

* We are now in the depths of a postenergy **crisis** and a world depression in shipbuilding.

* During the post-energy **crisis** Japan devalued heavily.

* The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission usually is painted as the villain in our present cost-push inflationary **crisis**, and certainly last year's 6 per cent national wage rise was remarkably ill-judged.

* What can we do to control the alarming rise in the wages drift which, on top of the 6 per cent national wage rise, has caused our present inflationary **crisis**?

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population -explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The Government allowed this industry to get into a state of absolute **crisis** before it was prepared to introduce such a scheme.

* If we had our own overseas shipping line we would not have had the **crisis** we have today with our fruit exports.

* There we find that at this late stage, when things had reached a state of **crisis**, the Liberal Party in Western Australia - at least the Young Liberal Party as can be seen from that article - has seen the need to look for a policy, to begin developing a policy.

* I think here we see cause to condemn the Liberal Party and to condemn this Government, because the Party has admitted tacitly that it has failed to produce a policy and that it had not grasped the position until the position had reached **crisis** point.

* I should like to take down into my electorate members of my Party so that they can see the conditions that exist, the conditions that have caused members of the Liberal Party to realise that there is a **crisis** in the country.

* These have reached such a pitch of urgency and such a state of **crisis** that universities will be lacking in essential maintenance.

* Surprisingly there is not as much financial wealth as was predicted four or five years ago when the oil **crisis** arose late in 1973 as a result of the quadrupling of crude oil prices.

* We saw as a result of the oil **crisis** in late 1 973 just what disruption such price increases as occurred then and subsequently and the rapidity of such increases can be caused to the economies of major Western countries.

* In many respects the Western world countries almost without exception are living through a period of considerable financial and economic difficulty with lower than optimum growth rates, higher than normal long term unemployment and the like and I think that much of that difficulty can be slated home to the dramatic effects on them of the Middle East oil **crisis** of 1973 and subsequently.

* This **crisis** is the most likely catalyst for a world war facing world humanity in our time, and it needs more than some cursory and casual consideration of the aid factor.

* I know that paragraph (b) of the amendment does refer to the constitutional **crisis**, but I suggest to the honourable member for Melbourne that he is covering and canvassing what happened in the debate which took place in this chamber today.

* The situation is that so long as you do not refer to the debate this morning you can refer to the subject of the constitutional **crisis**.

* In the few moments I have, I want to deal with the so-called energy **crisis** and the safeguards proposals, and I want to say a few words about Australian Labor Party policy.

* Let me quickly look at the question of the energy **crisis**.

* Now that is not true because the so-called 'energy **crisis**' is due to a potential shortage of liquid propellant fuel for transport services.

* In the long term we must eliminate the **crisis** orientation associated with our undue emphasis upon the annual Budget.

* The attitude of the Government to the accommodation and care for the aged in aged persons homes and nursing homes, which is creating a **crisis** situation.

* The basis of the legislation is to be found in the report on the current rural **crisis** commissioned by the Government.

* Yet the Government can find only $100m in 4 years to deal with the **crisis** in half the nation.

* Australia today faces its most serious postwar economic **crisis**.

* In spite of the accelerating economic **crisis** the Government is apparently prepared to proceed with its existing economic strategy- a strategy which has been shown beyond doubt to be misguided, ineffectual and dangerously inappropriate.

* In short, there is a **crisis** in Australia in capital mobilisation.

* What did the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  do in this last unemployment **crisis**?

* We accept that there is a potential **crisis** and that a lot of damage could be caused to pearl beds and marine life if action were not taken now.

* One is the overt pressure and power being exercised by multi-national corporations on national governments or sovereign States, and the second is the world energy **crisis**.

* Australian and world demand, current and projected, clearly indicates ominous signs of a world fuel **crisis**.

* I put it quite seriously to this House that the world wide fuel and energy **crisis**, the role which has been played by those countries which control these vast non-renewable resources, the role being played by the multi-national corporations and the effects which they have on national governments in Western Europe, Japan and the United States, are crucial to world stability and peace.

* He was the only sentry at the gate who was talking about the energy **crisis** that could face the world and this nation.

* Has the Minister for Primary Industry kept abreast of the numerous propositions put forward by a number of producer organisations seeking aid for the beef industry in its economic **crisis**?

* But just at this time of **crisis** the wheat industry has been able to produce men of great substance to give this sort of leadership.

* I sometimes feel very sad that the wool industry is not as united as the wheat industry in the moments of **crisis** that it is going through at the moment.

* Following the negotiation of the stabilisation scheme it became perfectly obvious thai we were heading for a major **crisis** because we were producing more than wc could dispose of and putting an abnormal strain on our storage facilities.

* In the Opposition's view it is the refusal of the Prime Minister to face his makers that is causing the present **crisis**.

* I say that this policy is extraordinary because we all know that when the Australian Labor Party took over in December 1972 it was faced with a **crisis** exchange rate position.

* The ball game has also been made very different because of the oil **crisis**.

* I now come to the oil **crisis** and what that has caused.

* We all know that there has never been a time when there has not been a **crisis** over political party funds.

* This **crisis** ought to be recognised for what it is and for nothing else.

* There is an old saying: The pop of the pop gun is the pop of a pop gun; it is not the **crisis** of doom.

* Perhaps I should add also that if we are to have integration, which is the essence of this legislation, between the military and the civilian arms of the Department of Defence, it is not difficult to imagine in times of defence **crisis** the difficulties that will arise in handling such a situation when no fewer than 12 committees which are to be established in accordance with the Tange report must be dealt with.

* Today we stand in the centre of a grave constitutional **crisis** that threatens to destroy the fragile fabric of the democracy that holds our nation together.

* It is a **crisis** that has been engineered by a man bent on getting power at any cost.

* It is because of the inspiration given by the Prime Minister in this present **crisis**, the man who in this Parliament stands out like a giant against the intellectual and moral pygmies who sit opposite him.

* However, in the current **crisis** its value at the most is minimal.

* But, quite apart from that, its value in the present **crisis** must be minimal because until the spiralling of prices and wages is stopped the legislation cannot hope to work effectively.

* This is a national **crisis**.

* The loan transaction was for the necessary infrastructure for the emergency development of those resources based on the energy **crisis**.

* Our offence in the eyes of certain international forces is borrowing through official Australian Government channels capital funds on the credit of Australia to cope with an energy **crisis**.

* Sixty-five billion Middle East petro-dollars, generated by the energy **crisis**, is sought to be invested yearly.

* The moneys would have been drawn down as the respective parts of the energy **crisis** program were implemented on a 'crash ' and in some cases, ' turn-key ' operation.

* The previous Government's poor performance in the housing field had resulted in a national **crisis** developing in that area.

* The plain fact is that the Government has done nearly everything that needed to be done to reverse the following policies that created the economic **crisis** of 1974-75 .

* Nobody can seriously argue that the investment **crisis** is going to be turned back by any marginal downward adjustment of company taxation.

* The Labor Government has put us in a situation today where Australia faces, in the words of the Housing Industry Association, a **crisis** in housing not paralleled since the immediate post-war period.

* Government spending and wage demands have so exceeded increases in profits and prices that for 2 years we have had the signs of the investment **crisis** which is now well and truly upon us.

* Now that means, of course, and I think that this is a fair thing to say, that an economic **crisis** of the kind that we are contemplating is a moral **crisis** for the citizen.

* Through the actions of this Leader of the Opposition, this nation has been plunged into an unprecedented constitutional **crisis**.

* Yet through all the months during which he was working himself up to take the plunge, through all the weeks of the **crisis** he has created, he has never before taken the course which would bring on a debate of no confidence in or censure of the Government or on any Minister- on this issue, on the Budget itself or on any of the pseudo-issues which were to be used to justify the extraordinary conduct of the Opposition and the unconstitutional conduct of the Senate.

* The only honourable, the only sensible way for the **crisis** to be brought to an end is for the Senate today to pass the Appropriation Bills.

* The Leader of the Opposition only a fortnight ago said: 
Apart from the obvious point that the US is hardly likely to accept  a situation  in which Australia could snatch its finger from the nuclear trigger in a time of **crisis**, there are severe practical problems in exercising control.

* The time for decision making in a **crisis** situation is likely to be so small that the Australian Prime Minister could not be contacted in time to say 'yes' or 'no'.

* That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition making  ; n  immediate statement on the serious consequences of public conflicts and contradictions between Ministers, and between Ministers and the Prime Minister, over  the  economic **crisis** emphasised by replies to questions yesterday and today, wherein was seen: 
The lack of agreement between Ministers is both obvious and astounding.

* It is totally impossible for any person in the community, no matter whether he is an ordinary citizen, a commentator, a member of this Parliament, a member of the Government or a member of the Government parties, to go to any document or any group of documents and say: 'This document or this group of documents represents an analysis by the Government of the present economic **crisis** and the policy proposals which the Government will put into operation in order to cure the ills which we are now living through*.

* Can anyone in this Parliament think of a more fundamental economic decision than the one which concerned the recent ' currency **crisis** around the world, a decision taken by  Mr Whitlam  acting with some marginal concept of an economic czar.

* 2 coal mines on the south coast of New South Wales is an ominous warning of a large scale and rapidly developing **crisis** in the Australian coal industry.

* The present **crisis** has been precipitated by the loss of Italian markets by the Clutha mines to the Goonyella open cut mine in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, which is owned by the Utah Development Company.

* Has this Government any answer to the **crisis** confronting the coal industry?

* Given the massive impact of the energy **crisis** on virtually every developing Asian nation, with the exception of OPEC member nations, and the increasing incidence of social and economic instability created by war and famine, the current level of Australia's multi-lateral aid must still be deemed to be very much inadequate against the whole context of need in the countries concerned.

* He is the Minister who has betrayed the Australian working man by presiding over the worst unemployment **crisis** since the Great Depression, the Minister whose policies and those of his colleagues have directly led to in excess of 300 000 people unemployed in Australia at this time.

* Headed **Crisis** at the Chemist's' it reads as follows: 
Britain is heading for a **crisis** over her chemists' shops.

* I think that it was inevitable and that there was really no alternative for a responsible government, given the world energy **crisis** and our oil **crisis**.

* It is interesting that Brazil, which has a very serious energy **crisis**, has started adding ethanol, which is produced from sugar cane, to its petrol and is now approaching an addition rate of 20 per cent of ethanol to its petrol.

* I would like to draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that there has been considerable cooperation in the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs notwithstanding the present **crisis** that was referred to by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Les Johnson).

* In fact, he is facing, as is his party, an identity **crisis**.

* It is suffering from a serious identity **crisis** and the Leader of the Opposition is totally incapable of handling the situation.

* I notice, towards the end of the table, a break from 1954 to 1971 without any **crisis** in this regard.

* The occasion in 1971 was a very serious **crisis**.

* On the 2nd of this month the 'Age' reported: 'Hospital **Crisis**; Patients Sent Away.'

* But the Minister says it is not a **criSiS**, that things are all hunky-dory.

* I am concerned particularly with the **crisis** in roads.

* Frankly, I am going to adopt a parish pump attitude on this issue of the road **crisis** in the Blacktown municipality.

* Anybody who goes into the area will appreciate that this has reached **crisis** point.

* The reason is that the developers have moved in - including the Housing Commission of 
I emphasise for the benefit of the Minister for Urban and Regional Development the seriousness of what I can only call the **crisis** in roads that exists in that area.

* It is the major - issue - the major **crisis** - at the moment.

* - Mr Speaker, since this Parliament reassembled, debate and counter debate have taken place with regard to the **crisis** facing primary industry in this country.

* Indeed, discussion of the **crisis** was promoted by the Opposition as a mater of public importance.

* These figures highlight in the most dramatic way the startling **crisis** that has developed in this industry.

* Estimated Australian and world demands currently, and projected demands, show that there are ominous signs already of a world fuel **crisis**.

* As their economy recovers the Americans have woken up to find themselves rushing headlong into an energy **crisis** which a few years ago would have been unthinkable.

* In effect, the United States faces a **crisis**.

* Japan, for energy purposes, is the third major world power in the utilisation of nuclear energy, and, unlike this Government, is fully conscious of the pending world fuel **crisis** and is rapidly stockpiling its imports.

* the urgency of the developing world energy **crisis** surely dictates that the time for our Government to take action is now.

* Firstly, positive legislation is needed to ensure maximum Australian equity, participation and control of these national assets; secondly, we must tap the vast reservoir of the Australian capital market; and, thirdly - I no longer request this but demand it on behalf of the people who have any concern for the assets of this country and our national heritage - we must set up immediately a national inquiry to establish concrete policies and guidelines which will co-ordinate, identify, and quantify, and plan the most economic and efficient use of these vast resources of fuel and energy, based not on this Government's ad hoc, puerile decisions which are reached on a **crisis** to **crisis** basis, but on what this nation's supply and demand requirements will be not only in the next decade, but also - this is equally important - for the next half century.

* I claim to have been misrepresented in an article in the  National Times  of 19-24 September entitled: 'Bush **Crisis**: What's Being Done for Farmers'.

* My attention has been drawn to part of a paragraph which states: 
The Westminster system is a **crisis** system.

* Every time the bells ring in this House there is a **crisis** for the Government.

* I repeat that we will not divide, to save time and to allow colleagues in the Country Party and in my Party to discredit further this contemptible attempt by the Government to divert debate from a national issue - a big political **crisis**.

* The Prime Minister seems to have swallowed hook, line and sinker the Minister's oft repeated statement about the impending energy **crisis**.

* What has happened in the United States when faced with a world energy **crisis** particularly in petroleum and natural gas, and when that country may be forced to convert to coal is that many if its mines have run down.

* Where I part with the honourable member for Farrer is that there is beyond any question a world energy **crisis**.

* The Government was dressing up the figure because it knew that there would be a great **crisis** in interest rates.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* The present **crisis** in the industry requires a comprehensive approach which involves both immediate and longer term measures.

* This scheme should materially assist hard-hit wool growers to survive the immediate **crisis**.

* This scheme is one of a series of measures designed to help meet a **crisis** situation in the rural industries, and particularly the sheep and sheep-wheat industries.

* The failure of the Government to adequately respond to the rural **crisis**.

* It may be that the 1970s will be the decade in which we see people around the world deciding to go back to rail, not only because of the efficiency it can provide in shifting freight and passengers but also because of the energy **crisis**.

* I would think that the proposed new sections, particularly proposed new section 31, were introduced into the Bill because of a lack of understanding - an admission by the Government of its lack of understanding - of what the present economic **crisis** is all about.

* It is in times of a rural **crisis** that all sorts of people will raise their ugly heads.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The dispute simply brought to a head a situation which had already reached **crisis** state.

* New South Wales is a **crisis** State, under a Premier who is now busily engaged in trying to divert attention from the consequences of determined and deliberate policy decisions which have brought about this **crisis** and which have created a situation in which a $lm a day dispute by employees of the Government can so seriously damage a region and so seriously damage the economy of the area.

* The interesting thing is that  Mr Wran  - 
At the root of the economic **crisis** is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector.

* Measures to deal with this **crisis** will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible.

* Alongside its assistance to manufacturing and other industries, the Government has taken action to assist the rural community to overcome its present **crisis**.

* At the same time as the Department acknowledges the problem of inflation in its own administration, it refuses to acknowledge the **crisis** facing the prescription drug industry.

* Are you prepared to maintain at the head of your affairs a coalition which has lurched into **crisis** after **crisis**, embarrassment piled on embarrassment week after week?

* Will you accept another 3 years of waiting for next week's **crisis**, next week's blunder?

* These fully owned Australian businesses each employing fewer than 100 employees are facing their worst **crisis** in Australian history.

* It has argued that the world oil **crisis** has forced up Australian domestic costs, but Australia is virtually isolated from international oil price increases and the price of domestic crude oil is fixed.

* The Minister said that the scheme was in the context of the Government's assessment of the rural **crisis** and the rural reconstruction scheme.

* The rural **crisis** is an incredible example of Government mismanagement at a time when there is a boom in Asian countries for primary products.

* It has been suggested that it will be an effective means of assisting in the present rural **crisis**.

* The great question mark lying against this scheme and the Government's attitude generally to the rural **crisis** is: Where is it envisaged that this retraining scheme will take place?

* This debate manufactures a **crisis** where none exists.

* If his Government had done that, we would not now be facing the worst economic **crisis** this country has seen since the Depression.

* It is this economic **crisis** which has caused the problems for young people in the cities.

* It is this economic **crisis** which has provided the high inflation rates, the structural land problems and so on about which the honourable gentleman was talking.

* Money, money, money, money; that is all one hears when the hospital **crisis** in Australia is discussed.

* I am not suggesting that there is no **crisis**.

* Of course there is a **crisis**.

* It is not that doctors are extravagant or that hospitals are inefficient; the **crisis** has come about because patients or potential patients, such as other honourable members and I. are demanding increased standards of medical care, particularly in the public hospital sector.

* Briefly, I suggest that this **crisis** could be minimised if the Government recognised that the present financial arrangements are extremely wasteful.

* The Mathews Committee recommendations resulted from the Committee's perception that inflation was causing a **crisis** in the business sector.

* This, of course, is a **crisis** of great magnitude.

* She pinpointed the **crisis** as being mainly in Sydney, Wollongong, Canberra and Newcastle and, to some extent, in other capital cities as well.

* It has deliberately imposed staff ceilings, with the result that today fewer people are employed in the Commonwealth Employment Service, particularly in New South Wales, than when the **crisis** began.

* The plight of the sick aged in our community is of **crisis** dimensions.

* It is established that it is Government policy to encourage and support voluntary agencies in the field of aged care, and it can be reasonably anticipated that this new **crisis** in rising costs will receive realistic Government attention.

* Governments expect to meet **crisis** situations from time to time.

* An immediate $5ra may well match this Australia-wide **crisis**, and such a grant would win wide public support.

* ALP rebuff to Whitlam in the fines **crisis**.

* Apart from the domestic shocks from wage cost inflation and severe industrial unrest, we have also witnessed external shocks to the system from the international monetary **crisis** and the slowdown in the Japanese economy, which affected the expansion plans of our mineral industries.

* I ask the Minister whether he will invite a representative from that un on to attend any further conferences on this **crisis**.

* As capitalism approaches its bicentennial, it is beset by **crisis**.

* In January seven Nobel prize winners, including Economists Gunnar Myrdal and Kenneth J. Arrow, signed a declaration condemning Western capitalism for bringing on a **crisis** by producing 'primarily for corporate profit. '

* The system we live under is in **crisis**, as has been pointed out by our Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  who is visiting overseas.

* Beef **crisis** is a social and economic **crisis**', says Ian Sinclair.

* What we are facing now is a massive social **crisis** in some sections of the beef industry.

* At a time when all nations are facing the impact of the energy **crisis** the Minister tries to retard the development of industry instead of trying to redouble it.

* The root causes were the despair and **crisis** in values aroused in youth by the injustices which they saw in the established order.

* The distinctive features of the patterns of unrest could be characterised as, firstly, the influence of communications media in creating a generation consciousness; secondly, a **crisis** of legitimacy and a breakdown in the authority of any institution with which the youth generation disagreed; and thirdly, racial injustices and poverty.

* They cannot be divorced from the general strategic and political environment and, to the extent that that environment deteriorates, their credibility as instruments of **crisis** management is diminished.

* I refer to that document to establish that the Government's early recognition of the present **crisis** was firmly based on a long-standing anaylSls of the strategic situation.

* In responding to this unfolding **crisis**, the Government quickly and accurately assessed the course the **crisis** was likely to follow.

* It is to the latter 's credit that in the current phase of the **crisis** it has so far shown such restraint.

* We are under no illusions that we can play the pivotal role in resolving this **crisis**.

* I do not intend wasting much time on the Opposition's performance during this **crisis**.

* Emotional charges or Cold War mentality do no good in the face of a serious regional **crisis**.

* The cessation of oil exports from Iran, previously the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, has brought into focus again- as if the 1973 oil **crisis** was not sufficientthe world's heavy dependence on imported oil, most of which originates from the Middle East region.

* Representative institutions throughout the world are undergoing a **crisis** of confidence.

* I do not believe that there is a member of this Parliament who would suggest that the world is not facing an energy **crisis**.

* Is the Opposition really suggesting that we can sufficiently retreat to a less energy reliant state of existence in the time available before the energy **crisis** becomes crucial?

* That is a fairly emotional example but surely that is what a real energy **crisis** is about.

* It is not a **crisis** when it starts to affect the money in people's pockets.

* It is a **crisis** when it starts to affect people 's lives.

* The Government recognises that the present **crisis** in the wool industry calls for a number of measures which in aggregate represent a concerted approach to the urgent problems affecting woolgrowers.

* I cannot see any reason why we should not be asking for the same thing if our electorates are facing the same **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* They think that the areas of **crisis** are the cities.

* The situation of an unemployed man with a wife and 2 or 3 dependent children is in fact much more serious than the situation of many of these other people in that, with a meagre income and often with the sort of economic background related to work of so many of the people who find themselves unemployed, unemployment represents a monumental **crisis** because not only will he get a lesser return in benefits but also he will be involved in additional costs which the others would not have.

* A migrant who has a pension right after having been here for 10 years and who draws on the pension for 5 years and then goes home for sound family reasons - perhaps there is some **crisis** back home and he has to go and see his close relations, which could happen with the southern Europeans in particular - will lose his pension unless some arrangement is negotiated.

* We have just heard the Minister for Social Security confusing himself and finally sitting down after 10 minutes of lengthy verbiage, having ignored the headlines that appeared this morning in the 'Age' newspaper - 'Inflation near **crisis**: experts'.

* An article by Tony Thomas stated: 
Australia's inflationary pressure is building up to **crisis** proportions.

* Unless there is a reappraisal of the situation we will come to a stage of a very great **crisis**, % complete disintegration of local government works that will mean that finally the Com.monwealth will be forced in a period of chaos to enter the field.

* Unless some large scale developmental works are implemented in this country within the months to come the employment **crisis** which has built up month by month will become permanent and it will not be able to be corrected.

* Until this type of proposal is implemented the problems of local governments, particularly the increasing financial **crisis**, will continue.

* The Rome conference will be held in an atmosphere of **crisis**.

* The impending food **crisis** has renewed the call to establish an international stock of basic foodstuffs, principally cereals, to cover seasonal fluctuations in world production.

* It will be the Western countries, the free enterprise countries, the so-called capitalist countries, that will be called upon to provide the exportable surplus food in this time of **crisis**, indeed in the immediate future.

* They include: The 'Energy **Crisis**'; The Problem of Liquid Fuels- Exploration, Windfall Gains, Fuel Substitution, Conservation; A Natural Gas Policy For Australia- Demand and Supply, Gas Pricing, End Use Allocation of Gas; The Contribution of Coal- Reserves, Coal Uses; and The Australian Mineral Industry.

* We came in when the universities were in a state of **crisis**, when we had the findings of the Murray Commission, and we have come in at election times with Commonwealth scholarships, with science grants, with grants for school libraries and so on.

* The **crisis** in education would be precisely what the honourable member for Denison  (Dr Solomon)  said.

* In denying the existence of a **crisis** he said how very difficult it is to get adequate university staff.

* The **crisis** in educataion is, of course, the inability of institutions to adjust very quickly to a complete change in the values in the Australian community.

* Obviously we have as a consequence a **crisis** in trying to adjust our universities, colleges of advanced education, and technical schools to the new demand.

* The **crisis** of adjustment is not only in new buildings and in new student places; it is, of course, in the effort to attract staff.

* As the honourable member for Denison said in denying that there is a **crisis**, it is extremely difficult for universities and colleges of advanced education to get staff.

* -In the course of this Committee debate thus far, the very serious and important points made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  about the extent of the **crisis** that exists in Australian society in terms of the unemployment level and the failure of this Government to meet this problem have gone unanswered.

* Whenever honourable gentlemen opposite talk about the **crisis** in the economic system all the burden, responsibility and blame is always put on the lower 50 per cent of the community.

* This system is in a considerable state of **crisis**.

* In view of the many indicators of storms ahead for the Australian economy, such as the United Kingdom's entry into the European Common Market, the wool industry **crisis**, both rural and general unemployment in the basic industries, the currency **crisis** and obvious speculation about a possible appreciation of Australian currency as indicated by the dramatic increase in Australia's overseas reserves, which now stand at over $2,600m- 
I wish to take up a number of items of the Budget under the appropriations for the Department of National Development and the Department of Trade and Resources and to allude to several items under the appropriations for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development because they are relevant to the first items.

* In the earlier debate on the Budget I talked about the energy **crisis** we have now.

* It is a world **crisis**.

* In the short term we in Australia will have a liquid fuel **crisis**.

* 1) 1978-79 which show that this Government has appreciated the energy **crisis** and is doing something about it.

* I come now to the most vital aspect of the energy **crisis**- capital.

* Those capabilities that are required to provide a military response to the lesser contingencies which could arise with little or no warning; those high performance capabilities relating to a general strategic requirement as dictated by the characteristics of the environment rather than by specific contingencies and required to provide deterrence against the use of military pressures or military means by a potential enemy to achieve its objectives and which could not be acquired within the period of warning likely to be available before a major threat to Australia could develop; and a representative selection of second tier or substitute capabilities- moderate cost, moderate performance, short lead time systems, that could be acquired in relatively large numbers during a period of developing threat- to enable the development of operating techniques, procedures and doctrines in a short period of **crisis**.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Nevertheless, the provision of this money is not in itself sufficient because there seems to be plenty of evidence to clearly indicate that despite the fact that this money will be made available and the States will make good use of it, there is still a **crisis** in education.

* Although this Bill will help in some way, the **crisis** is getting worse.

* What should be done now to combat the **crisis** caused by teachers leaving the profession?

* In this case we applaud this Bill, but the **crisis** is still there.

* Without directly talking about State aid, problems nevertheless exist in nongovernment schools; in fact, there is a **crisis** there also.

* A **crisis** is being developed.

* A potential **crisis** is facing this country for the near future unless we find more reserves.

* Has the Minister for Transport seen claims by some State Transport Ministers that the **crisis** in State public transport systems is the fault of the Australian Government?

* At the moment we have a **crisis** over Supply that should legitimately be granted.

* Other countries, such as Japan, in the face of a world energy **crisis** are closing down their refineries and smelters at a very great rate.

* Surely when one hears the sorts of questions asked here, particularly by the group which is not represented in the chamber at the moment, the National Country Party, about what it calls the beef **crisis**, we perhaps should adopt new and novel methods.

* What the Opposition is saying m the amendment has already been proved in the past 12 months, namely, that inflation has not been controlled, that unemployment has soared and that there is a **crisis** of confidence.

* In the national wage case, the Full Bench of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission clearly said that private employers had submitted to the commission that there is a **crisis** in confidence.

* There has been rural **crisis**.

* Mr Deputy Speaker,  you of all people, would know that the **crisis** has deepened and worsened.

* There is a **crisis** in the rural community at present which could lead to the annihilation of the Government in rural electorates.

* The principal and the quite unforgivable weakness of his argument was his complete failure to mention the fundamental reality of our time, that is, that the competitive market economic system which operates in most countries and governs their international trade is in a state of world-wide **crisis**.

* It is clear that we are caught up in an international **crisis** that creates enormous difficulties for the government of the day.

* We had the difficult problem last year of the tremendous boom in international prices; we had the difficult **crisis** of disruption of the international monetary system, which began in the early 1 970s and 1971 and has become worse since.

* The system of allocation of Australian crude was devised when there was no energy **crisis**.

* There is an energy **crisis**.

* I strongly recommend to the House that it closely examine the serious anomalies of national resource usage which has been generated in a way intended by the architects of the allocation system and more rapidly than intended to achieve the elimination of these obvious and glaring anomalies 
The inability to provide housing for those who need it most threatens to reach **crisis** proportions.

* But now, under the Johnson administration, this area really is in **crisis**.

* Sooner or later there will be an absolute oil **crisis**.

* But there may be a mini **crisis** before that time.

* The communists need a **crisis**, a **crisis** of energy in the world, and if they succeed in this campaign they will succeed in creating that **crisis**.

* It is my view that there is an even greater **crisis** in our cities than exists in the rural areas, even though their position is catastrophic.

* It does not matter if man's value system - and I even include the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who is at the table - is Communist, Fascist, Conservative, Liberal or Socialist, he faces a global **crisis** based on the fact that his population increase, his squandering of natural resources, his control of food production, his accelerated urbanisation and his release of a wide variety of toxic substances into the environment are directing him on a collision course with disaster.

* Medical research has reduced the dangers of infectious disease and this has added to the population **crisis**, but now pollution is beginning to take its toll.

* He shows that an inevitable pollution **crisis** which will cause the death of 83 per cent of the world's population will follow and that it will predominantly affect developed countries rather than developing countries.

* If all the people on earth had such an opportunity we would have had a pollution **crisis** much earlier than we have.

* Such a **crisis** would have occurred if the people of India had the same standards of living as we have.

* It gives the Government no power to deal with the real **crisis** in housing.

* It does not deal in any shape or form with the **crisis** in our cities.

* In view of the failure of the Budget to alleviate the circumstances of cattle producers and people living in these areas and the fact that the Government has not acted on 3 Industries Assistance Commission reports that have been published and which affect cattle producers, will the Minister undertake to negotiate with his colleagues responsible for the Industries Assistance Commission to have the report of the IAC on the **crisis** in the beef industry completed and published as soon as possible?

* The tragedy of the Whitlam Government is that Australia as a nation is now, as a consequence of misguided government policies and general mismanagement, confronted by crippling inflation and economic instability; a severely impaired defence capability; a **crisis** in the housing industry, excessively high levels of industrial unrest; a massive erosion in the purchasing power of fixed income earners and pensioners; uncertainty and stagnation in the mineral and oil exploration industries; the highest interest rates in the history of this country; and huge increases in personal income tax.

* Housing today is in a state of very real **crisis**.

* The Opposition has a positive response to the rapidly developing housing **crisis** but put forward as a general approach because the detailed aspects will be developed elsewhere.

* Yet his bank is more responsible than any other similar institution for the liquidity **crisis** in this country.

* Finally, this bank of which  Mr Prowse  is the Assistant General Manager, because of the severe liquidity **crisis** it found itself in and because it did not read the signs- the Commonwealth Bank and the National Bank did and they knew just what was occurring; they had the economic advisers on their staff to advise them and accordingly did not get any problems- had to go into the short term money market and borrow at rates as high as 18 per cent because its own liquidity margin had fallen below the 1 8 per cent traditional margin.

* In other words, he should ensure that he puts his own house in order, a house which has been responsible for a great deal of the liquidity **crisis** which exists in this country.

* In every State of the Commonwealth we have these problems, and of course they stem from the rural **crisis**.

* The situation is that we face this **crisis** of confidence and collateral which the Prime Minister has done very little to dissipate.

* The next thing I must say is that we are talking of a **crisis** which is worse than it has been since the depression days.

* The **crisis** had been averted; there was plain sailing ahead, the wool industry believed.

* There were many factors which contributed to the United States' balance of payments **crisis**.

* Finally, the United States has recognised that this dollar **crisis** is only the last of a series of crises which have affected ;n turn the pound sterling, the French franc, the German Deutsche mark, and now the United States dollar.

* The latest Middle East **crisis** between Israel and the Arab States has produced an even more important **crisis** between the United States and the Soviet Union, and between the United States and the Communist Government of China.

* In those big televised meetings between Nixon, Brezhnev, Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai in Moscow and Peking, the leaders of the major powers agreed to support universal principles, which would lead to a new order in the world, but when they all gathered around here at the United Nations on the East River during the latest Middle East **crisis**, they sang a different tune.

* You have to go back to all those reassuring communiques out of the Kremlin and Shanghai in order to understand what the Soviet and Chinese representatives said here at the United Nations about the Middle East **crisis**.

* Yet when the latest **crisis** developed in the Middle East, all these noble promises and intentions seem to have been forgotten.

* 1 ) his deliberate and calculated attempt to mislead this House and the Australian people as to the gravity of the oil **crisis** currently facing Australia, 
This Budget also does not take into account the world currency **crisis** brought about by the announcements by the United States Government 2 days before the Budget was introduced, which could have a dramatic effect on this country's trade and capital transactions.

* With regard to the currency **crisis** it seems to me that the Australian Government is confused as to what action it should take in regard to Australian exchange rates.

* Detailed papers are all very well, but they will not help in the present **crisis** situation.

* But the present situation, as I mentioned a moment ago, is a **crisis**.

* Whilst the Government has a responsibility to negotiate access to markets, that will not help cope with this **crisis**.

* -There is an aged care **crisis** in the community.

* Those patients are going from one financial **crisis** to another because of the Government's failure to recognise in the Budget the need to announce that nursing home benefits should be index related.

* It is not a question of their being able to provide greater facilities; the **crisis** is that they will not be able to provide the facilities that they now offer to many thousands of needy people.

* Following the financial **crisis** of that year, which precipitated the fall of the Labour Government headed by Prime Minister James Ramsay MacDonald, the King followed strict constitutional practice and sought to determine a future government for Britain.

* I believe our Governor-General could well have been praying during October and early November 1975 that the political and constitutional **crisis** which existed in this country would resolve itself at Parliament House so that he could avoid involvement in controversy, but when it did not, he was bound to act.

* One cannot blame the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  for holding out in the hope that the then Opposition senators would abandon their stand, but in retrospect even the most politically biased must admit his proposal for a half-Senate election would have simply served to prolong the national **crisis** and agony.

* there is a shortage of money because the Government has created a liquidity **crisis**- 
He went on to mention the cost of land.

* A liquidity **crisis** means a shortage of money in the economy.

* One of the major economic measure that the Leader of the Opposition states his Government would undertake is set out in these words: 
Probably at no time since 1951 or the recession of 1961 has such an economic **crisis** faced Australia.

* To handle this situation and to face the **crisis** is possibly the most discredited government of our time.

* Here we rind in the Parliament a Budget brought down at the time of greatest **crisis** in this country by a Government which is merely hanging together, with 31 changes in the Ministry, riddled with dissension and hatreds, members disappearing and hiding from each other and yet claiming to have the confidence of the Australian people.

* This **crisis** situation is a cause of deep concern and, if violence does occur, the consequences will be alarming nationally.

* They are, as I see them in broad, simple terms and not necessarily in order of importance: Firstly, a series of adverse seasons since 1964 over a wide area of Australia; secondly, marketing difficulties, especially export marketing difficulties with such products as wheat; thirdly, the low export prices on world markets for many rural products, wool in particular, compounded by Britain's likely entry to the European Economic Community; fourthly, the growing use of synthetics, or alternatives to products of rural origin; fifthly, the constantly rising cost of production; sixthly, the international currency **crisis**; and, seventhly, the whole rural economy has been geared to the era of post war prosperity.

* There is every justification for the Government to come to the industry's aid in its hour of **crisis**.

* During the wheat **crisis**, the Labor Party had several wheat policies.

* Now during the wool **crisis** it has several ill-defined policies.

* 1 rise tonight to rectify an injustice which has been perpetrated by the Government against people in the Australian countryside who have had the temerity to believe that we have a **crisis** in the rural sector and that the Parliament should know about it and perhaps apply itself to rectifying it.

* It attempted to discredit a man who had put his time and money into a protest against the present **crisis** in the countryside.

* I cannot understand how men who come in from the countryside in **crisis** can turn their backs on people of good will who are doing their best.

* Indeed over the last 10 years the trend in wool prices has been downward, and a **crisis** developed.

* It allows them to develop to **crisis** proportions and then takes some small, supposed, remedial action that barely touches the surface of the problem that confronts it.

* So despite all the talk earlier about a **crisis** we have not been given the ideal requirements; we have been given only what the Ministers think might be possible.

* ls that not a **crisis**?

* Is that not a **crisis**?

* Is that not a **crisis**?

* Is that not a **crisis** right now?

* If all these things do not mean that there is a **crisis** in education right now I do not know what they mean.

* Are they prepared to impose an additional percentage tax to overcome the so-called **crisis** in education?

* [ believe that there are individual crises but 1 do not believe that the field as a whole is in * state of **crisis**, which is a much over-used word these days.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* But today we are faced with an international **crisis** on a par with the Cuban **crisis** of 1962.

* The gravity of this **crisis** demands our attention now.

* It is necessary for me to say now, before going into detail, that the Australian Government's recent statements and actions concerning the **crisis** in Indo-China have been mere echoes of the statements made by the United States Government.

* The companies in Australia which can grow big enough at the expense of the smaller firms to specialise their production for export in tandem with the same big companies operating in other countries in our regional production Une are, in a way, responsible for our present economic **crisis**.

* If the Government can reach a **crisis** point or a flash-point in industrial relations, our good friend the Prime Minister may have sufficient reason to call another Federal election.

* Because of the Prime Minister and because of his wanting to get some value out of a **crisis** in industrial relations, the proper aim of this Government on real industrial relations is swept under the carpet and is replaced by this confrontation.

* This Minister cannot say on one hand that we have a **crisis** because John Halfpenny made a speech at the Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress and tell us on the other hand that industrial relations have improved.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* 1 cannot agree that nursing homes in Western Australia will be facing a **crisis** early in 1974, although I freely admit that both the nursing home proprietors and my Department are continually facing very real difficulties in the administration of the nursing home benefits scheme that was designed and introduced by the previous Government.

* This is where I return to the responsibility of this country to build and maintain necessary bases if we expect - and in fact we would expect - the British and others to be with us in any time of **crisis**.

* We would indicate that it is somewhat late on the scene but acknowledge that it usually takes some form of **crisis** or some threat of long-term and continual political damage to political parties in order to have action of this nature taken.

* -Last Friday, the State Housing Ministers met with the Federal Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development,  (Mr Groom)  in Adelaide to try to overcome the serious **crisis** that has developed in the housing industry in Australia and, in particular, to discuss the seriousness of the **crisis** in the public housing sector.

* The **crisis** we face in land prices requires that all responsible political leaders try to break down barriers of distrust and work together so that young people may have an opportunity to acquire a block of land on which to construct a home.

* There are no immediate solutions to the land **crisis** in Australia.

* Is it a fact that investment spending, not consumer spending, is the major factor in the present inflationary **crisis** on the expenditure side.

* Last week he told a parliamentary group of which I was a member that there is no world energy **crisis**; that the world has extensive natural gas reserves.

* The truth of the matter is that Australian farmers are generally efficient by world standards, but they are being burdened by cost pressures which have, in many cases, brought them to **crisis** point.

* A **crisis** point has been reached in the wool industry.

* There is also an Oil Supplies Advisory Committee which was recently established to advise the Government following the disruption to supplies caused by the Iran **crisis**.

* Without, at this stage, going into the reasons why this does result directly from the land **crisis**, I would merely indicate how bad the situation is.

* If we recognise how basic the land prices **crisis** is to the problem, this question follows: Could we use these funds in some other way to solve the problem of land prices?

* ls it a fact that there is a growing **crisis** in education in South Australia, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, and that the State is unable to meet pressing demands in the areas of building, transport, teacher training, administrative costs and salaries.

* The oil **crisis** of 1973 precipitated the fundamental recognition that the world was facing an energy **crisis**.

* While Australia has been insulated from the effects of the oil **crisis** by a plentiful supply of energy resources, the dwindling supply of petroleum has meant that many countries must change over to other sources of energy.

* Nuclear energy is the only readily available alternative most countries have to meet their essential need for electrical energy in the wake of the oil **crisis**.

* Australia has an obligation to the rest of the world to provide the energy resources- the coal, gas and uranium- that will be required to overcome the energy **crisis**.

* But at the mention of the word 'beef and the **crisis** that faces such a significant part of the Australian community- both the consuming public indirectly and the producing sector very directly and all those who are dependent on it- the Prime Minister stomps out of the House in a huff.

* Yet when we have a **crisis** in one of the major Australian producing industries, which has been significantly affected not just by marketing circumstances but also by the actions of this Government, the best offer from the Government to date to the beef industry has been a $20m loan repayable at 1 1 Vi per cent through the Commonwealth Development Bank, a suggestion that I read in a newspaper yesterday that a new submission might come forward in a fortnight from the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt),  and a reference by the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory  (Dr Patterson)  who was sitting at the table this morning that the industry really only requires that its position be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission.

* Let us go through the parameters of the **crisis** and try to analyse it in a more rational way than I am afraid the emotions of those who are affected by the absence from the House of the Prime Minister and the lack of concern on the part of the Government might otherwise permit.

* The marketing **crisis** itself was amply indentified at the recent Agricultural Outlook Conference.

* The marketing **crisis** is real.

* There is not only a marketing **crisis** but also a prospective seasonal fall factor which will prejudice the ability of cattlemen to realise their stocks in a rational way.

* Last year's oil **crisis** brought this sharply home to all of us- developed and developing alike.

* We are told, and we are all aware of the fact, that there is a world energy **crisis**.

* An article in an American magazine dated 23 February 1973 states: 
I believe that the Australian people fell for the line pushed by the Liberals and the Australian media that Australia alone could have been isolated from the world economic **crisis**.

* This is pure scapegoating- a reaction to the economic **crisis** and to the social problems created and aggravated by that **crisis**.

* Refuges provide essential services for women and children in **crisis**; they are an alternative to a home situation that has become intolerable.

* The need for refuges is increasing, along with the need for rape **crisis** centres and women's health centres.

* It is history now how the oil **crisis** of that time led to an international monetary **crisis** which in its turn led to a reappraisal of the relationships between rich and poor nations, between developed and developing nations.

* What became abundantly clear in the aftermath of that oil **crisis** was that the disposition of the world's resources- its raw materials, particularly the energy resources of the world- became a matter of vital importance to world economic stability and also to sound international relations.

* Those people are helped when in a **crisis** situ ation and are not those who are sometimes termed 'professional bludgers'.

* They are people in a **crisis** situation and in dire need.

* The Smith Family organisation meets **crisis** situations.

* But virtually it leads a hand to mouth existence going from one week to the next trying to get enough money to help those people in a **crisis** situation.

* The unbridled ambition of the Leader of the Opposition, a man who has destroyed two friendsone a Prime Minister and the other a Leader of the Opposition- has pushed this country to the brink of the most serious constitutional **crisis** since Federation.

* All its policies have sapped the State of economic vigour and have destroyed the confidence of South Australia to the point where there is now a **crisis** of confidence in that State.

* I am confident that wool will ride out the present **crisis** with the assistance of this Government.

* The main  speaker,  and the main attraction for people who will be attending the Conference, will undoubtedly be  Dr Ernest  Mandel, a Belgian economist who, if he is allowed to enter Australia, will be speaking at the conference on the **crisis** of capitalist relations of production.

* A number of factors have conspired to bring about the present **crisis**.

* -As usual, of course, the Opposition has launched into a tirade of abuse of the Australian Government for its alleged inaction and has attempted to blame the Australian Government for the whole financial **crisis** in the cattle industry.

* Everybody, except apparently the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair),  knows that the economic **crisis** in the cattle industry is a worldwide problem.

* -Of course there is a **crisis** in the cattle industry.

* I am inclined to agree that we do need it because I represent an area where a **crisis** is occurring.

* The **crisis** will occur in the next 2 months when the cattle turn-off commences.

* If one really looks at what the Government's allocation of that $24m has done, it can be seen that it will mean another **crisis** for medical research in 1978, that is, if medical research survives the immediate **crisis** of the first 6 months of 1 976.

* Even if the triennium allocation is considered adequate- 'adequate' would be the strongest word one could use and then I think one would still be exaggerating- the triennium planning is theoretically continued but that may be of no value if the present **crisis**, that is the **crisis** in medical research that will be with us in the first 6 months of 1 976, is not resolved.

* That is the immediate **crisis**.

* Unless additional Budget money amounting to Sim to $1.5m is provided for this January- June 1976 period, there will be this immediate **crisis** in medical research.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* The report deals particularly with the staffing **crisis** in the Education Department's psychology and guidance branch and speech therapy branch.

* The waiting list for admission of mentally retarded patients into residential institutions in Victoria is in a state of **crisis**.

* The key, the index, to the bed shortage **crisis** is the list of mentally retarded people waiting for admission to Victoria's 9 institutions.

* The first category is: Most urgent - family in a state of **crisis**, immediate placement in an institution needed.

* The third category is: Pending^ - no immediate **crisis**, but an institutional bed will be needed eventually.

* The contemporary **crisis** in family relationships results from a large variety of factors including changes in the social philosophy which are emphasising increasingly the freedom of the individual to develop his own philosophy of life and the freedom of the individual to acquire the tools for an analysis of problems.

* The relief which has been given thus far is only temporary, and the patients and those caring for them in nursing homes are faced with the prospect of going from one **crisis**, from which there has been temporary relief, to another **crisis** as escalation occurs in wages, nurses salaries and food prices.

* The only real **crisis** threatening Australia is a **crisis** in the parliamentary system.

* We in Australia face a grave energy **crisis**.

* Yet the first item, the first Bill which the Opposition delayed in the Senate in respect to this constitutional **crisis** was a Bill the purpose of which is to provide finance for our defence expenditure.

* (Quorum formed)  As I said, the Opposition, which gives great lip service to the issue of defence, chose as the first item of legislation which it delayed in the Senate in respect of this constitutional **crisis** that we have today a Bill to provide finance for our defence expenditure.

* This Government has faced a **crisis** as to whether we would be denied Supply by a contrived Senate, by a Senate which has equal representation for every State.

* (Quorum formed)  The honourable member for Evans made the point that every 18 months we faced a **crisis**, but we have faced a **crisis** every 6 months because there have been threats from the Senate to withdraw Supply every 6 months.

* Australia will face some sort of energy **crisis**.

* The oil **crisis** of 3 years ago created such a situation in Japan that the Japanese community was faced with a position of continuing decline in its industrial development and way of life.

* It would seem that in the short term the world is indeed suffering some sort of energy **crisis**.

* If this energy **crisis** continues and at no time is regard given to it by Australia and other nations the future looks bleak.

* There have been articles such as the CIA report on Australian capacity for oil production, and the energy **crisis** and many other comments in papers and columns of recent days.

* But what I object to - I think every member of the Parliament should object to it - is that this **crisis** was known on 31 December last, 4 months ago; yet the agreement was not signed until yesterday, and the Bill was not introduced until 1 o'clock this morning.

* If the **crisis** was known in December, I would assume that the Cabinet made a decision before the money was made available.

* Surely the whole purpose of this grant of $2m a month, approximately, is not to help the farming people alone but to help all people in rural areas, cities and towns who may have been affected by the rural **crisis** because of the drop in purchasing power of farming people.

* We have 2 types of unemployment; we have metropolitan unemployment which is certainly growing much more rap idly now, but it is not of the same nature orproportion as it is in rural areas where there is large long-term hard-core unemployment brought about by the structural changes in the rural community which have been caused by the **crisis** in rural industries.

* Lastly, I believe that the international **crisis** surrounding the future supply of oil is starting to highlight Australia's energy resources.

* It was at that point of time that a **crisis** situation had developed in the affairs of the company in respect of payments to growers.

* It is nol good enough to say, as this Government says: 'Oh, it was not our fault - there were such overseas factors as the currency **crisis** and wool prices and so on'.

* It was precisely because of the currency **crisis** and wool prices that we should .

* A permanent way could have solved the Newcastle Waters **crisis**, where trucks were held for more than a month on either side of the water, unable to cross.

* For 23 years the conservative governments of this nation excluded the human and social problems that built up in the urban community and a **crisis** situation occurred in Sydney and Melbourne.

* This was referred to as **crisis** financing and was applauded by the then Opposition spokesman who today sit on the Government side.

* The Australian Government is refusing to appropriate funds for this necessary form of preservation in a time of **crisis**.

* It would be very nice to hope that we could take a vote today to facilitate that bringing together of the 2 Houses of Parliament, because what we are dealing with represents a **crisis** in the history of this country.

* One has only to search one's memory and to think of the case of the Evans Deakin company: My God, when I was first reading about the shipbuilding industry, probably 15 years ago, Evans Deakin was in a state of perennial **crisis**.

* When I first came into this Parliament in 1970, one of the first debates that I heard was on the **crisis** at Evans Deakin.

* The 2 shipbuilding yards which do particularly well, which do not complain and limp and stagger from one **crisis** to another, are BHP at Whyalla in South Australia and the State Dockyards at Newcastle in New South Wales.

* It is working better than ever before and better than it did under the former Government when the shipbuilding industry limped from one **crisis** to another.

* This is linked with the problem or the **crisis** in education throughout the country.

* But the real situation in Canberra is that there is a widely felt **crisis**.

* If we were to draw up a list of our priorities in view of the socalled danger to this country from invasion by foreign forces and bearing in mind the undoubted **crisis** in education, then if we must have a national service scheme, why not give exemption to teachers and trainee teachers?

* I finish on this note: The real **crisis** in education is that it can produce this kind of insular remark.

* Put briefly, the **crisis** facing the Government is to assure the payment of the new pay rates and improved conditions for servicemen decreed by the Kerr Committee while freeing sufficient resources for the reequipment programme it has announced over the past 2 years.

* The time at my disposal tonight will allow brief reference only to the scandalous neglect by this Government which, I believe, is the main reason for the development of the **crisis** in university facilities in Queensland.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The truth is that most of the elements of the current **crisis** were identified by the Constitution Review Committee which the Parliament established after the credit squeeze of 1956.

* Even Liberals would now have less difficulty in managing the Australian economy if they had been less sceptical of the proposals they commissioned from experts in movements of economic **crisis** and electoral despair.

* The Prime Minister's own ad hoc decisions, disregard for advice, electoral opportunism and insensitivity to the indirect effects of particular actions have now produced just that sort of economic **crisis** with which his government is so clearly ill-equipped lo cope.

* So as long as that Party, its allies and its present leadership have been in government, this nation has faced an inflationary **crisis** on an average of every 5 years.

* If there is anybody more notably lacking in compassion than this Government in moments of great **crisis** I would like to know who he is.

* I would add that the establishment of the Society of the Helping Hand has further assisted the struggle to provide shelter and **crisis** accommodation for our  displaced youths.

* In this respect I seek leave to incorporate in  Hansard  a copy of the minute paper of the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development on youth **crisis** accommodation in Brisbane.

* Re: Youth **Crisis** Accommodation- Brisbane 
Iam attaching hereto a report submitted by ARO  Mr John  Elliott on Youth **Crisis** Accommodation in Brisbane.

* YOUTH **CRISIS** ACCOMMODATION IN BRISBANE-JUNE 1978 
REPORT-BRISBANE: YOUTH **CRISIS** ACCOMMODATION 
There is no establishment in Brisbane providing specifically and solely for **crisis** accommodation (i.e.

* Primmer Lodge, a self-supporting longerterm care community for children aged 14-17, has recently received State Government funding to operate 6 short-term **crisis** accommodation beds.

* It has not yet started operating its 6 **crisis** accommodation beds, and at present has 1 1 'longer-term' (i.e.

* Not only are those residents (the majority) referred by Children's Services receiving regular payments ('MLI payments') under the existing subsidy scheme, but the Lodge received a $4,000 grant  in advance  for operating the 6 **crisis** beds.

* Such organisation shows the potential for funding once a centre is approved (for **crisis** accommodation) by the State government.

* Impressions of its operation once the **crisis** beds are operating will be most useful.

* They all have one thing in common: the opinion that the Brisbane youth **crisis** accommodation situation is far from satisfactory.

* The usual procedure followed by referring bodies looking for **crisis** accommodation is rather ad hoc, and involves one of the following alternatives: 
In the area of **crisis** accommodation, its advance payments to Primmer Lodge are a new initiative.

* The Department is aware of the need for **crisis** accommodation, as it is the first point of contact for homeless children picked up by police (often in city parks).

* In a recent study of 62 such children, 24 were placed in **crisis** accommodation of some description, 18 were placed in hostels (eg.

* DCS also has to do a lot of shopping around' to place a child in **crisis** accommodation.

* **Crisis** accommodation (for 2-7 days, say) would only fill part of the need.

* There is a tremendous demand in Brisbane for youth accommodation (both **crisis** and long-term supportive).

* The feeling was that **crisis** accommodation alone won 't serve a worthwhile purpose.

* The **crisis** facing Tasmania goes beyond defective services and uncompetitive freight rates; in the broader sense it strikes directly at the policies of decentralisation which have been vaunted by the Federal Government.

* Because of 
The most unfortunate effect of the shipping **crisis** is the loss of key industries to other States.

* This **crisis** is blotting out the work which has been done over many years by way of incentive schemes to develop industries.

* The stage has now been reached were a shipping **crisis** has developed in Tasmania.

* But it was obvious when this Parliament first met on that famous 1-day sitting that the **crisis** was growing.

* Yet the Government programme outlined by the GovernorGeneral indicated that all was well with the nation and that there was no **crisis** anywhere.

* Indeed, he attacked the very action of the Opposition in raising the question of the **crisis** at the first opportunity.

* The countryside is in **crisis**.

* If there is one thing that the speech by the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  has displayed it is his total ignorance of the real **crisis** which is facing Australia at present I go on record as saying, in response to his final comment, that if this Government in fact had the courage to face up to the serious and deteriorating position in Australia's economic circumstances I have no doubt that the Government would not only deserve but demand the commendation of Australians of all political parties.

* It is the failure of this Government to face up to the situation which we see at present in the context of higher inflation, higher unemployment and a real **crisis** in capital mobilisation that has produced the current lack of confidence throughout the Australian economy.

* There is now a very real **crisis** in capital mobilisation in Australia.

* We have not been involved with the energy **crisis** to nearly the same degree as other countries because we have been 70 per cent self-sufficient with the cheapest fuel in the world.

* It is well known that the Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said in Caucus only 2 weeks ago that every major **crisis** that the Party had confronted was caused by its Prime Minister.

* It is simply a formula for a **crisis** in the building industry and that is the situation we are facing today.

* But, gentlemen, we are on the edge of a national **crisis**.

* We have people leaving the industry daily and we have bankruptcies throughout the land because the Australian building industry today is in a greater state of **crisis** than has ever been known since the great depression.

* Interest rates are the highest we have ever known, and the Minister and his Government must realise that it was the introduction of higher interest rates that accelerated the housing **crisis** as we know it today among middle and low income earners.

* There is no denying that Australia does have a **crisis** in housing which has been equalled, if my memory serves me correctly, only by the **crisis** in the immediate postwar period.

* There was a feeling that because of the Government's actions the **crisis** would increase rather than the demand be moderated.

* Bill Crews, Director of the Wayside Chapel's **crisis** centre, has written this: 
Our **Crisis** Centre bathroom has become a first aid post for these people.

* It must mean that the wool industry has reached a **crisis** in terms of the world price of wool.

* The longer the **crisis** lasted the more the scope of the operation in Nicosia grew, and each week twice the number of applications that could be handled were received.

* The **crisis** ran longer, and so too did the plight of the Lebanese presenting themselves become more serious.

* When the **crisis** began it was those with money who left first.

* Finally, he should begin to think about how this type of regional refugee problem should be faced in the future because his ad hoc **crisis** reaction approach to this problem has resulted in disaster.

* Had that advice been taken inflation would not have taken off as it did, interest rates need not have been raised to unprecedented levels, income tax collections would not have increased by more than a third, with the prospect of income tax collections this year being double what they were 2 years ago, and the country would not have faced the wage explosion and the economic **crisis** it faces today.

* He was talking about the **crisis** in the building industry and about pumping money into State housing authorities for welfare housing.

* In the article to which I have referred and in many other places and on many other occasions the Minister has referred to the **crisis** that existed in the building industry when the Australian Labor Party took over the Government.

* I would like to make it clear that there was no **crisis** when the Government took over from us, but there is a **crisis** now.

* I believe that that is a **crisis** situation.

* The Opposition believes that the abolition of the homes savings grant further exacerbates the building **crisis**.

* There is a real **crisis** in the rental accommodation situation.

* This will further add to the **crisis** situation for young people.

* The Opposition believes that the abolition of the grant will only worsen the **crisis**.

* In the last 3 years we have had a serious economic **crisis** that has needlessly been brought upon Australia, an economic **crisis** that has harmed all Australians and the weak most of all.

* The **crisis** was principally caused by a failure on the part of the former Government to plan and to act responsibly.

* Borrowed money today is the worst form of investment for Australia because it has to be paid for in hard earned exports at a time of economic **crisis** in world trade.

* I am not a calamity howler but I say that  we  are heading for an economic **crisis**.

* How can there be any confidence in a government which tries to blame the Treasury for Australia's economic **crisis**?

* The Opposition for many months has been urging the Government to respond to the growing **crisis**.

* The Government has shown itself to have lost control and the Prime Minister has shown, by his own admission of his ignorance of the extent of the deepening economic **crisis**, his unfitness to continue as Prime Minister and for his Government to remain in office.

* Later still we had the Prime Minister come into the House and demonstrate his abysmal lack of expertise and his utter disregard for the inflationary **crisis** by bringing down still further measures which can only pour petrol on the flames of any inflation that we have already.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* I simply say that constitutionally it is not a Commonwealth responsibility and therefore the commitment both by the previous Government to provide $190m from 1973 to 1978, and by the present Government to increase that commitment by over 50 per cent to $300m for the five-year period, is a very significant indication by the Commonwealth Government and Commonwealth governments of both political colours, of the importance of ensuring that Australia has a proper urban public transport system as we move out of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century with all the problems which we know are around the corner, not the least of which is the energy **crisis**.

* Unless something is done within 10 years metropolitan Hobart will have a transport **crisis**.

* Ferry companies such as Sullivans Cove Ferry Co. Pty Ltd and Roche Bros, in conjunction with the Transport Commission which acquired in very strange circumstances ferries from several places, one or two of which were not exactly a success, provided a ferry service across the Derwent at that dme of **crisis**.

* Quite apart from the effects on Australia of a loss of export income, the **crisis** on the farms is thus bad news for the cities as well.

* The two cities with the worst **crisis**, of course, are Sydney and Melbourne.

* The honourable member for Hughes will give more details about the **crisis** situation, of housing costs in the electorate of Cook and about how this scheme is completely irrelevant to the constituents of someone like the honourable member for Cook who will be struggling to survive at the next election.

* This Government does not want to even try to control the **crisis** that is occurring.

* For thousands of people the problem has now reached **crisis** proportions.

* I want to stress over and over again that the real problem facing the single income families, earning up to  135  per cent of average weekly earnings, whether they live in Sydney or Melbourne, is that they are in a **crisis** situation when it comes to acquiring a home.

* There is no reference whatever to the dollar **crisis** which is shaking the world.

* The policy enunciated with regard to the dollar **crisis** by  President  Nixon is an economic watershed for the world and the United States has the economic muscle to decide what it wants to do.

* As for the future, we can expect an intensification of the present economic **crisis**.

* The truth is that we are facing a stark economic **crisis**.

* Is it unreasonable that the State Housing Ministers are expecting the Commonwealths coffers to be opened to help them alleviate what is now the worst housing **crisis** in Australia's history?

* I refer to the recommendations that contraceptives be supplied on the free pharmaceutical benefits list, that the advertising of contraceptives should be legal and that there should be a vigorous Government sponsored education campaign aimed at explaining the population **crisis** I would say that there is no population **crisis** in this country; quite the opposite and the means of solving it.

* On 27th December he was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' as having said: 
However, even as late as 1969,  Sir Harold  Ragett did not mention the grave energy **crisis** which the great industrialised areas of the world are facing.

* An energy **crisis** must have an effect upon Australia when its full impact is felt in Europe, the United States of America and Japan.

* If present trends continue, we could face a genuine energy **crisis**.

* I cannot cite the details of the contacts that Evans Deakin has had with the Government, but I certainly have it on the most reliable authority that contact has been made and that no effort was spared by the management to make the Government aware of the impending **crisis** that the Evans Deakin shipyard faced.

* They chose to ignore the details of the impending **crisis** that were given to them in a conversation following the speech that the  chairman  of directors made at the launching of the Esso Gippsland' in April this year.

* Now he is suggesting that although the icing sugar has got thicker it has caused a **crisis** down in the cake.

* Others say that it is not a deliberate policy; it is merely that the Government is impractical and incompetent in government giving rise to this **crisis** situation.

* So I say in summary that we have an economic **crisis** in this country and the root cause of it is the **crisis** of confidence the Government has caused.

* In the **crisis** we have the  Deputy  Prime Minister should become both Treasurer and Prime Minister in this country because, while I would seriously quarrel with his ideological purpose, there is no denying that he is more knowledgeable and attentive m economic and finance matters.

* No one can guarantee that the ILO activities in the employment promotion field will be successful but it is obvious that unless the high levels of unemployment and underemployment in many parts of the world are reduced rapidly there is a danger not simply of economic stagnation but of political and social conflict of **crisis** proportions in many countries.

* Any alleged **crisis** in health care and health costs is being caused by the cry wolf stance being taken by the Opposition.

* At a time of **crisis** what we want is a Prime Minister who is forthright and who has the loyalty of his Party to enable him to give the sort of leadership that is required.

* The Melbourne 'Age' in an editorial this week, described the inbuilt incapacity of the Labor Government to respond to the growing **crisis** facing Australia.

* Australia is facing a **crisis**.

* We see in the rural sector of the community that the meat industry is running into a **crisis**; export sales are down 50 per cent on those of last year.

* It must be embarrassing to the Minister for National Resources,  Mr Anthony,  and  Senator Webster,  that many of the States have financial commitments to solar energy which indicate a far more visionary understanding of the impending global energy **crisis** than has been displayed by the present Government.

* It will in no way cope with the current **crisis**.

* The police forces should take steps to make this a process which is systematic, intelligent and articulate and one which anticipates social problems and adapts to meet them before a **crisis** situation arises.

* While I support the Bill, I remind the Mouse that, in the light of what I have said, this Bill goes only part of the way towards solving this national problem or this national **crisis** which for too long the Government and the community at large have treated with appalling apathy and neglect.

* -Is the Minister for Health satisfied that his announcement on medical research of Tuesday evening will end the **crisis** in medical research caused by the 50 per cent Budget cut for this year?

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the  Canberra Times of  17 May 1979 entitled 'University StaffTell of Research Funds **Crisis**'.

* Nobody can pretend that we have not been through a **crisis** parallel to that in Cuba.

* It was certainly the most tense **crisis** the nation has faced since 1962.

* Tonight I want to express my own views because I have been actively involved in foreign affairs since the first Parliamentary mission to China in 1955, through the Suez **crisis**, through Aden, and through the problems we have experienced since then.

* -Australia's manufacturing industry is in a **crisis**.

* This loss of jobs in manufacturing industries is the core of Australia's worsening unemployment **crisis**.

* It is a **crisis** caused largely by investment decisions of large corporations here in Australia but especially overseas.

* It is a **crisis** that has now been used by these corporations to strengthen their international control of production, to weaken the control of organised labour and to increase the corporations' profitability on a global scale regardless of the devastating impact on the various nations and their work forces.

* The General Motors Corporation's complementation plan is an attempt to exploit the current unemployment **crisis** in this country.

* The Housing Industry Association President has warned that Australia faces a **crisis** in housing unparallelled in the post-war period.

* The Prime Minister is now desperately trying to extricate himself from the constitutional and political **crisis** he has created by attempting to appoint  Senator Gair  Ambassador to Ireland.

* Australia is facing a **crisis**.

* That **crisis** relates to domestic affairs and to foreign affairs.

* In fact, during this period of **crisis**- the world inflationary situation- we have been cushioned or should have been cushioned from the ramifications of the world trading patterns.

* There is an investment **crisis** and it is beside the point to talk of overseas causes.

* One sees that there has been some recognition of this **crisis** by the Government when one remembers its recent reversals of its policies and its newfound respect for the private sector.

* But the Government has only partially recognised this **crisis**, especially in respect of the liquidity problems to which the  Deputy  Prime Minister referred.

* This is really the **crisis** which we now have.

* It must be decided to what extent people should be supported by the community in times of stress or **crisis** and the need for continuing support for those who have some more permanent social or economic disadvantage.

* This Government has virtually underwritten the permanent building societies following the **crisis** with which they were confronted a short time ago.

* For the first time,  Mr Prime  Minister, the big three- inflation, unemployment and economic **crisis** in combinationare the scourge of this nation.

* We have an economic **crisis**.

* Indeed, the people generally lack confidence in the ability of the nation to recover from inflation, high unemployment and the economic **crisis**.

* Inflation will remain high and the economic **crisis** will continue.

* -At least he did not get the country into an economic **crisis** with unemployment and inflation as they are today.

* In our preoccupation in this country with using the antiquated political nostrums of this Government to overcome what is a world depression we neglect and forget the social and political **crisis** which the fundamental conservatism of the present Government could never properly evaluate, much less understand.

* Successive phases of the world currency **crisis** were, in 1968, the introduction of the 2-tier gold price and the 'dollar shock' of August 1971.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the report tabled in December 1976 by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence entitled 'The Lebanon **crisis**- Humanitarian aspects' in which the Committee made a number of recommendations regarding the broadcasting of inflammatory commentary by community access stations in Australia, including the need for satisfactory monitoring procedures.

* But the very fear of an economic **crisis** makes this **crisis** more likely to occur.

* Only now does the policy recognise, through the present Budget, the major **crisis** that confronts Australia in its desperately short reserves of oil.

* We need look only at Canberra itself for ample evidence that the implications of the **crisis** have as yet not been appreciated by Australians.

* There is little appreciation for the fact that in Australia the oil industry is in a **crisis** situation.

* Australians must now address themselves to this **crisis**.

* This is an inevitable consequence of the **crisis** we now face.

* A discipline imposed in the United States of America m the height of its fuel **crisis** recently to reduce the speed of automobiles on the highways effected a 20 per cent saving in the amount of fuel used.

* The reality of the **crisis** is there.

* The most developed nation in the world today, the United States of America, earlier this year as a result of a **crisis** in its energy production and supply could not prevent the deaths of many of its citizens in the coldest snap experienced in that nation in recent times.

* I refer very briefly to the rural **crisis** and say.

* They are largely responsible, together with this Government's ineptitude, for our present economic **crisis**.

* It is a world of major corporations, of multi-national corporations which are so big that they can ride through any period of depression or economic **crisis**.

* It is not elected by the people - the general public: - and it is about time this laissez-faire Government that has been sitting in power for over 20 years and which blames everybody but itself every time a **crisis** occurs, faced up to its responsibilities.

* Of course we must welcome any small recognition by the Government of the current **crisis** in the countryside.

* I was saying to the House just prior to the suspension of the sitting that most of the primary producers in the State of New South Wales, and in other States for that matter, are standing firm in the face of rising costs and in the face of the **crisis** in the countryside at the present time.

* The Rural **Crisis** Manifesto was produced by the Edenhope Agricultural Bureau.

* The Rural **Crisis** Manifesto said this: 
These are isolated instances at the present time.

* Then we have a situation of **crisis** in which the same hot money is standing by to buy up properties of family enterprises which, as has been conceded by honourable members on both sides of the House today, have the record of being the most effective and efficient in absolute terms.

* MrGRASSBY- Perhaps I should be grateful to the honourable member for Evans for that interjection, because it seems to me that the entitre **crisis** in the countryside is either being deliberately misunderstood by some city interests or perhaps is misunderstood because of ignorance of the significance of the **crisis**.

* His  last policy was taken out before the drought - before the current **crisis**.

* It seems to me that, in considering such measures as this, we have forgotten that the drought faced producers with the worst **crisis** for 100 years.

* This is the summation of what I have said tonight: That the family enterprise has been demonstrated to be both efficient and effective and is the backbone of the rural development of the nation; that the current **crisis** is a product of policies or the absence of policies; that imposts, such as estate duty, must be totally reconstructed; that this small measure should be only a prelude to this being done as a matter of urgency; and that the vote on the amendment that has been put forward should be a vote of conscience.

* Since 1973 when the oil **crisis** struck as a deadly blow the industrial heartland of Western Europe in particular, as well as that of North America, the Western world has been faced by the immediate need to seek and to find and develop alternative sources of energy.

* They are out of work because of the **crisis** in rural industry.

* I therefore move: 
My main reason for making a few remarks in this debate is to give some special emphasis to the greatly accelerated and heightened problem that has occurred due to the oil **crisis**.

* Mention has been made already of the effects that the oil **crisis** will have on the balance of payments problems of the industrialised countries.

* If the **crisis** is going to cause problems for industrialised countries, then surely the problems that it will pose for the lesser developed countries will be nothing less than devastating.

* The Shah of Iran, of course, is in an extremely fortunate position at the moment because he happens to be the head of government of a country which has done extremely well out of the current oil **crisis** and perhaps is better placed than Australia.

* But it is interesting to note that the Shah of Iran has suggested the establishment of an international fund to help to overcome the balance of payments problems which underdeveloped countries will experience as a result of the oil **crisis**.

* The situation is really one of great urgency if the underdeveloped countries are not to fall even further behind now that the oil **crisis** has come upon us.

* Throughout the last few days we have had nothing in this country but people on the other side, on public platforms and in this House, creating a situation of grave fear and grave **crisis**.

* There is no **crisis** whatsoever.

* There is no constitutional **crisis** in this country at all.

* What I am saying is that honourable members opposite have been creating fear in this community when there is no constitutional **crisis**.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister came to the Parliament this afternoon to tell the country people that they have a **crisis**.

* In these figures and in this performance lie the explanation as to why one of the richest countries in the world has bad roads, overcrowded schools, inadequate hospital buildings and 1 million poor people with half of its rural industries in **crisis**.

* I challenge the Government to table the report on the rural **crisis** which it commissioned for circulation to the States.

* Yet, the very rural **crisis** is a product of Government mismanagement.

* I think also that the Government should realise that amending legislation to gain a short term relief in our balance of payments **crisis** or for any of the other purposes which have been brought forward during the debate, such as to promote the accelerated processing, mining and export of uranium, should not take precedence over justice to our oppressed indigenous people, which is the theme which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs very rightly has stressed from the outset of his accepting the Aboriginal Affairs Ministry.

* Here in Australia- indeed, in this very city- we have a far more sensible proposition to beat the power **crisis**; a far more permanent and complete solution to our balance of payments problems; and a far better remedy for the parlous state of our motor industry in particular and, indeed, of the world's power generation **crisis**.

* If there is a power **crisis** we need to develop this alternative which is, I repeat, more promising than nuclear power because it is cleaner, cheaper and much better proved than the technology to cope with nuclear power waste disposal and security for which we are still waiting.

* The Government cannot expect that the Atomic Energy Act of a former generation- when atomic potential was seen outstandingly as a feature of the Cold War- should be equally relevant to the energy **crisis** of 1978.

* It is leading us there ever faster in the name of deferring those crises- the energy **crisis**, the national economic **crisis** and the national balance of payments **crisis**.

* In view of the mounting problem of pollution in our cities and the urgent need to take action before it reaches **crisis** point, will the relevant Government department make a study of the Clean Air Act passed by the House of Commons 2 or 3 years ago, which has already beaten pollution in London and several industrial cities of England?

* Up to the present time, the stimulus therefore of a recurring or possible balance of payments **crisis** has been removed from the Australian tale.

* Nothing has been done to solve these problems, despite a 12 per cent revaluation, or to solve the problem of the looming balance of payments **crisis**.

* An economic **crisis** would then be created which  Dr Cairns  makes plain in the document is the ground work for revolution.

* There is a pending and looming international **crisis** in that area, which this Government utterly ignores.

* But the **crisis** will be with us very much in the next few weeks.

* Here we have an industry with a combined capital investment of $8,000m with a chronic **crisis**.

* Undoubtedly contributing to the **crisis** is the fact that the auction system, so long a sacred procedure for many, is the middle man's market and the grower and the user never meet.

* Of vital importance is the attitude of the Government at this time of **crisis**.

* They want to know whether there will be a reserve price based on the cost of production and what steps will be taken to end the present **crisis**.

* Yet the situation is urgent; there is a **crisis**.

* As the energy **crisis** looms before us we are reminded that the railways do give a better return on fuel consumption compared with road transport, using less than one-third per tonne kilometre of fuel.

* The Commonwealth's help is commendable because there is a **crisis**.

* It must be borne in mind that if there were not a **crisis** the Commonwealth would not be helping at all.

* But the Commonwealth should not think that because it has given some help the **crisis** is being solved.

* The **crisis** will get worse because insufficient money has been given.

* The **crisis** is getting worse.

* The Minister for Primary Industry has mentioned the **crisis** - to use his word - in the wool industry.

* In his speech introducing this legislation he gave figures to demonstrate the fact of that **crisis**.

* Motor vehicle manufacturing in Australia at the moment is in a state of **crisis**.

* Who will pay the enormous costs of the **crisis** that occurred at Harrisburg?

* The gains at the upper end of the property scale will be great and an opportunity will be lost to collect, over the next few years, what will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, while the Government presses down on those people in the community who have no asset backing, no security and who for that reason live in fear of sickness and potential unemployment or any kind of major **crisis**.

* Much has been said about the constitutional **crisis** and, whilst I do not intend to spend much time on it, I certainly endorse what has been said by my colleagues about what happened in Australia on 1 1 November.

* To that person's credit, when the Budget **crisis** developed last year he did the right thing.

* They did not have the guts to reject it; they just deferred it, thus precipitating a **crisis**.

* I come back to the constitutional **crisis** that erupted following deferral of the Budget.

* Yet the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  has said in this place that anyone who had anything to do with wheat at all could have foreseen this **crisis** developing 5 years ago and therefore, 1 should say, could have acted.

* History shows that whenever the Liberal-Country Party coalition has been in government and has faced an economic **crisis** its immediate and only remedy has been to create a vast pool of unemployment.

* Even though we are more fortunate than most countries, we still face the problem of the oil **crisis** because we have a dependency on oil from overseas sources.

* The oil **crisis** had been one of the most destabilising, if not in the longer term devastating, economic effects that has hit the world economy.

* This increased interest burden has snowballed into increased land costs and the increased cost of housing to such an extent that a **crisis** has developed.

* R. S. Prentice,  President  of the Master Builders Association, reported to Federal Cabinet on 4th February 1970 in the following terms: 
Will the Minister, in view of the financial **crisis** facing non-profit approved nursing homes, make an immediate subsidy of $2 per day (in addition to the ordinary nursing home care of $2 per day or the intensive care of$5 per day Commonwealth benefit) to all full-rate pensioners who are accommodated in these nursing homes.

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Aus-, tralia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* When I speak of emergency housing I mean true emergency housing that could be made available at an instant's notice when a **crisis** arose, whether it be flood, bush fire, some domestic dispute or something else that might cause a family to be immediately evicted and left without proper shelter.

* Maintain all this aid for as long as the **crisis** persists.

* It is clear that the Commonwealth Government at ministerial or high sub-ministerial level has caused a **crisis** of confidence amongst the Commonwealth Police Force.

* The Minister for Housing and Construction  (Mr Les Johnson)  has presided over the greatest housing **crisis** since the War.

* We could have matched West Germanywith inflation of 7 per cent, doubled by the energy **crisis**- and had inflation in Australia of under 4 per cent.

* We are lurching from **crisis** to **crisis** without direction.

* What restraint this man has in a **crisis**.

* It has claimed that all primary production is emerging from a period of **crisis** after **crisis** and so it needs some special considerations.

* Externally there was an international monetary **crisis** and a slowdown in the Japanese economy, which affected the expansion plans of our mineral industries.

* All were involved in one way or another in some sort of government **crisis**.

* Yet within three days the Minister was able to put behind him this **crisis** of conscience and, condoned by the Prime Minister, expect the Australian people to pretend, without any explanation, that it never happened.

* I remind the Prime Minister again of his own words to this House on 9 March 1971 when, in his speech of resignation as Minister for Defence, he said: 
Now, when by reason of the failure of crops in the Northern Hemisphere and the greater demand for grain because of the increased population, we are suddenly faced with a grain **crisis** which has meant that the price of grain has gone up very considerably.

* Already the Pakistan **crisis** has reached proportions of human tragedy which exceed those that took place in Vietnam.

* Yet our efforts to allay the impending **crisis** have been both insipid and insignificant.

* Here was his chance as a Commonwealth leader to help resolve the **crisis** between 2 Commonwealth countries - India and Pakistan.

* This was one of the major actions of government that has led to the **crisis** in the countryside.

* The whole administration has been shocking and inadequate and has contributed to the **crisis** in the countryside.

* Given that at the time it was delivered Australians were facing a fuel **crisis** and petrol rationing, the speech can be seen as little more than a panicked response from the Government.

* Australia's reliance on liquid fuels and in alleviating the gradually worsening world energy **crisis**.

* Given the severe energy **crisis** which is facing the world, Australia has an obligation not only to itself but to the world to do everything in its power to promote energy exploration and conservation.

* Under the heading 'The **Crisis** in Manufacturing Industry ' it says: 
Quite plainly, urgent action to ensure the survival of much of Australian manufacturing industry is necessary.

* The present **crisis** does not lend itself to the theories and experiments of recent years, which have played their pan in bringing about the current situation.

* It has moved from **crisis** to **crisis**, and most of them have been of its own making.

* The Liberal and Country Parties have a plan to deal with the present economic **crisis**.

* The human tragedy and devastation resulting from the Lebanon **crisis** is so immense that they create claims of great moral weight on other nations to take action to alleviate suffering.

* Iraq and Libya have tended to frustrate a solution to the Lebanon **crisis**.

* This is in part because of an atmosphere of deceit surrounding the **crisis**.

* The lack of adequate reaction by the International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the most depressing aspects of the **crisis**.

* This is particularly so because of the oil **crisis** which has meant tremendous suffering to the underdeveloped countries which are not oil producing.

* This country is escaping from the oil **crisis** probably better than most other countries because, in a large part, we have our own oil supplies and our balance of payments position is still very good.

* We are not in a state of balance of payments **crisis**, and even if we stick to the United States dollar I do not see that we will have a balance of payments problem in the near future.

* Finally, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which this Bill is providing funds to assist, will in fact be trying to help the less developed countries offset the problems created for them by the oil **crisis** by raising loans from the oil producing countries which, of course, will have tremendous surpluses of funds available in the next few years if the oil **crisis** remains as it is at the present time.

* They will also be advantaged by the fact that they have an Australian Labor Party Government on the Treasury bench in Canberra which is prepared to take initiatives in a **crisis** in contrast to those honourable members who sit opposite and who in every desperate downturn when in government failed to be effective in discharging their responsibilities to the home seeking public.

* As we know, there is a world energy **crisis**, particularly in regard to the supply of hydrocarbons.

* The United States is facing an energy **crisis** at the moment and by the year 1980 it will be importing about $30 billion to $40 billion worth of energy resources.

* Whilst they possibly will not be in a position to benefit, at least by giving encouragement to others to save to purchase their own home the present rental accommodation **crisis** in all States will be somewhat relieved, thus allowing these homeless people the opportunity of living with a sense of decency and dignity.

* It is no wonder the Premier of Queensland described the Premiers' Conference on 13 August 1974 as a complete waste of time because the Commonwealth did not have a plan and the Prime Minister, who admits he has neither interest nor expertise in economic matters said there was not a **crisis** in the economy.

* The Prime Minister did not admit at the time of that Premiers Conference that there was any **crisis**.

* What this debate does is focus on some aspects of the world energy **crisis** although the matter has not been presented in that way today by Government spokesmen.

* I feel that, given the enormity of the **crisis**, the complexities of the ingredients of the **crisis** and the daunting challenges which the **crisis** presents for the future, we should have had a debate on oil last week, on natural gas last night and a debate on uranium today with the promise of a debate on energy policy later, probably slightly after the arrival of Godot.

* If the Government had prepared and presented an overall policy first into which this commitment to uranium mining and export was slotted I am sure that the community would have been better served and more wisely informed, not only on what the Government was intending but also on how what was being proposed fitted into the international energy **crisis** scene.

* It caused almost single-handedly the economic **crisis** of the last 3 to 4 years, because the problems with oil and petrol flowed over into the whole problem of the motor vehicle- our inability to use the existing high consumption vehicles, the need for vehicles  in toto  the decline in the use of oil and so on.

* It does not occur to him that we are faced with a rural **crisis** with which we have to deal.

* I want to deal with the **crisis** in education, which is approaching a catastrophy.

* I am referring not to the **crisis** that we hear so much about but to the much more serious one.

* This is a **crisis** approaching a catastrophe for thousands of young people in this country every year - this rat race that leads nowhere.

* For the Minister for primary Industry  (Mr Anthony)  to describe the present proposal of restricted deliveries to (he Australian Wheat Board as 'positive remedial action', and this reaction as 'courageous and responsible' is an assessment of the present **crisis** which must surely go down in the varied and changing history of this industry as the greatest piece of selfdeception ever perpetrated.

* To increase the base price of wheat by the equivalent of US19c per bushel in the light of the then global stock position and crop prospects was an act of irresponsibility equalled only by the refusal of the governments, Federal and State, to come to grips with the **crisis** now facing the industry.

* It is not hard to understand how the proposal to deal with the mounting **crisis** offered 100% protection to only one group - the State handling authorities.

* This was the situation when the Minister invited the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation to submit a proposal to cope with the pending **crisis**.

* Yet it not only receives a quota based on the best years of its performance out of which this over-production **crisis** grew, hut it demands and receives a share from he 1 less fortunate Slates as well.

* The **crisis** of over production began after 1.63. yet it is the hig growers who created this **crisis** who are now receiving the lion's share of a State entitlement.

* WOOLLEN MILLS SUFFERING MAJOR **CRISIS**, SAYS INDUSTRY'S LEADER 
CANBERRA - 'There is a **crisis** situation in the wool processing industry which may soon match that of the wool producers,' the  president  of Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia,  Mr S.  D. Kelly, said here today.

* It is part of a global debate which is taking place against the background of an impending world energy **crisis** of quite unprecedented and potentially disastrous dimensions.

* The **crisis** does not lie in some indefinite future.

* Do honourable members opposite believe that at a time of energy **crisis**, which is forthcoming, they could be an influence in the international scene by abdicating from the arena?

* The GovernorGeneral 's Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian parliamentary system as we know it.

* Yet the constitutional **crisis** shook the very foundation of the people's form of government.

* Not one member of this Parliament represents a district, a constituency, a region, a city, a country town or a regional centre that is not affected by the **crisis** of unemployment in Australia.

* They referred to deficiency payments for wool; to the 'rural **crisis**' - and I am using their words; and to the need for the provision of more funds for the rural reconstruction scheme, for long term finance, for rehabilitation, for assistance to local government for the relief of unemployed persons in their areas, and for assistance with rating, tariff, freight and inflation.

* And month by month, week by week, day by day, the underlying **crisis** is deepening.

* The Treasurer cannot wriggle away from the responsibility for our national **crisis** by blaming the Labor Government.

* The **crisis** for young people is an economic disaster and a human tragedy of a kind we have never experienced.

* My colleague the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  will outline in this debate some specific measures the Government should take at once to head off our developing unemployment **crisis**.

* No one in the Labor Party pretends that our unemployment **crisis** is other than difficult and deep-seated, or denies that the long term solutions will involve quite drastic approaches to the structural nature of the work force and our industries.

* It also reported that it was asked to make recommendations on a wide range of **crisis** issues.

* **Crisis** preservation on an ad hoc basis will not enable us to save enough of the best of our environment.

* The Interim Committee claims that in most instances in which it was called upon to make recommendations on **crisis** issues it was able to arrange or recommend a solution.

* As the Interim Committee drew attention in other parts of its report to the importance of public involvement, it is somewhat surprising that it failed to list those items that came before it as **crisis** issues which it did not succeed in solving.

* I would hope that the Heritage Commission in its report would identify **crisis** issues on which it has found a solution and also those on which it has failed to find a solution.

* Has the Minister succeeded in obtaining funds to preserve an adequate buffer zone so that this unique geological feature in South Australia- a science laboratory in its own right- can be preserved, or will we go on spending more money in **crisis** circumstances, because the longer this is left, the more expensive it will become?

* Is the **crisis** now occurring in Queensland building societies in any way due to the monetary policy of this Government and in particular to the issue of the special Australian Savings Bonds?

* Even before the avgas **crisis**, the general aviation industry was beginning to suffer the effects of the Government's oil import parity pricing policy.

* As the stock feeders are asking for neither first advance payments of 120 cents a bushel nor the allocation of a delivery quota at the expense of traditional growers, will the Minister, in the interests of fostering the only effective long term solution to the current meat **crisis**, endeavour to persuade the Australian Wheat Board to adopt a more realistic attitude and revert to its 1972 policy?

* The meeting of young Commonwealth leaders, deeply concerned over the continuation of the Cyprus **crisis** and the continued drama of the youth of Cyprus; 
In 1972 land prices were rising sharply, public transport was run down to the point of breakdown, suburban housing in every major city of Australia was without sewerage.

* Inner city areas were either suffering from urban blight and decay or they were experiencing the early stage of gentrification where the potential capital gains of recycling older established houses were becoming increasingly obvious to the speculators and where above all Australia was facing a future without an effective public transport system at a time in which the oil price **crisis** was appearing as a signal that the time of the automobile as the principal form of urban transport was coming to at least the beginning of the end.

* Funds were now moving out of the manufacturing area, which was itself moving deeper and deeper into a state of **crisis**.

* We are indeed, in this country, facing a fiscal **crisis** in which there are limitations of the funds .

* In the 1 980s, with the coming energy **crisis** and energy price **crisis**, increasingly the kind of pattern in Australian cities will be seen to be catastrophic in terms of servicing costs.

* Already that **crisis** is highly apparent in California.

* The state government of California is moving in a myriad of ways to do something about that **crisis**.

* One sees no sign of the Liberal Government in Canberra, of the various State governments around this nation, of the honourable Minister for Finance  (Mr Eric Robinson),  or of the member for Petrie concerning themselves with that **crisis** or taking any action.

* He made that statement in the context of the Chamberlain doctrine of appeasement, which had already brought about the resignation of Anthony Eden, and in the light of the Czechoslovakian **crisis** of 1938.

* Improved unemployment benefit criteria for farmers will help, but there still will be a cash flow **crisis**.

* As well, the 
It is people who are involved in this **crisis**, not just rural products.

* I believe that in Australia at the present time there is a **crisis** of confidence amongst decent, Godfearing, hard-working people- trade unionists, small business people and people in rural industries.

* The Government has brought on a **crisis** of confidence by incompetence.

* The Government is playing down the **crisis** and the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  has not shown great consideration for the position.

* We must convince men in the Cabinet like the Minister for Overseas 
Trade that it is a **crisis**, that it is a serious situation, and is causing loss of confidence in the business sector right throughout our land and in our country towns.

* It is a matter of record that the oil **crisis** which obtained in the world in recent years had a significant effect on the economies of a large number of the trading nations of the world, particularly amongst the OECD countries.

* That turn around of something in excess of US$35 billion is representative of the effect largely of the oil **crisis** and the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries in pursuing the policy on the pricing of oil that they chose to pursue.

* It is, I think, one of those examples of significant international co-operation in the field of trade that Australia, in concert with other member countries of the OECD, is prepared to undertake commitments which will assist the world as a trading entity to see that the effects of the oil **crisis** will not be too long term and will not cause significant degrees of disruption.

* The Australian economy is significantly dependent on overseas trade and obviously in our economic considerations we have a vested interest in seeing that trade is allowed to continue on a stable and growing basis and that we do not have significant disruptions in the pattern of world trade as a result of events such as the oil **crisis**.

* It is designed by the OECD to meet the problems of particular countries in overcoming the domestic problems that might arise as a result of the actions of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries which caused what is generally called the 'oil **crisis**' of the last couple of years.

* I think it is a credit to the OECD that it has been able to negotiate an arrangement which will work to the benefit of its members, an arrangement which will enable the member nations of the OECD, should they have a problem arising from the oil **crisis**, to have that problem satisfied.

* The whole position is of course being aggravated by the oil **crisis** to which the Treasurer has referred.

* As to the oil **crisis** and the impact that this will have on the establishment of some equilibrium, it is quite apparent that the oil **crisis** has upset - indeed, it has reversed - the pattern to which the Treasurer referred in the beginning of his statement of those currencies which have had a chronic balance of payments problem.

* It is quite apparent that, in the depreciation that some currencies will suffer as a result of the oil **crisis**, there could be a tendency for countries to panic and, at a time when there is no real currency equilibrium, countries like Australia, which as I have explained are still so dependent on having a reasonable currency relativity to those countries with which we trade and with which we are competitors, will need to recognise the impact that marked depreciation can have on our own economic position.

* I believe these developing countries, which are essentially dependant on aid flows from the developed countries and which are selling largely unprocessed agricultural commodities, will be very severely affected economically if there should be aggravated currency instability which seems to be emanating from the world oil **crisis**.

* Could you please advise if there is likely to be any special consideration given to the difficulties of Soldier Settlers in the present rural **crisis**.

* I ask that the Minister have the Government abolish annual rentals or at least waive them for a period of 5 years to allow farmers to ride out the current **crisis** or to withdraw from farming operations if unable in those circumstances to redeem themselves.

* It is obvious that the Government has failed to warn the wheat growers, the public and the taxpayers in sufficient time of the **crisis** that has arisen.

* The criticism that the Opposition levies at the Government is that it did not face up to its responsibilities at least S years ago when the Treasury publicly, together with international agencies, warned that the wheat industry was heading for a **crisis**.

* Plans should have been made when the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill was introduced into the Parliament 2 years ago to solve the problem, but it was not until April of last year that any official statement was made about the **crisis** in the wheat industry.

* Is there a need for expenditure on culture and recreation in 1975 when this country is facing the worst economic **crisis** in its history?

* During the **crisis** I made one or two speeches here round that theme in which I indicated that really it is nonsense for a government to be in a situation of having permanent public servants, legally employed, whom it cannot sack but because of a failure to get a piece of legislation through, not being able to pay them.

* If the position is as stated, will he confer with the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities to see whether these reserve funds may be used in the present serious **crisis** in the egg industry to assist producers in an emergency?

* That there is a **crisis** in Aboriginal Welfare in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor bousing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* -On 1 7 August last year I made a speech in this place about an impending energy **crisis** and its effect on the isolated areas of Australia, particularly areas which have no sources of energy other than oil based energy.

* I do not want to sound like a prophet of doom, as in the book entitled  Future Shock  but a small part of the energy **crisis** is here now.

* Traditionally, 60 per cent of Australia's supplies of aviation gasoline have come from Abadan in Iran, a refinery which almost went out of production during the **crisis** in Iran.

* Because there is a world shortage of aviation gasoline, we are in a **crisis** situation.

* This is a small **crisis** on the national scene but it is a major **crisis** in the isolated areas of Australia which have no alternative means of transport.

* I hope that this **crisis** will be widely publicised.

* I hope that it will help to educate the people of Australia in the problems we will face in the future with fuel supplies because of the world energy **crisis**.

* It might be better described as the **crisis** in nursing throughout Australia.

* In fact, before he would even discuss anything with this deputation he insisted that the industrial officer of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation make an apology for a public statement that he had made that the Minister was not really concerned with the nursing **crisis**, in fact, the Minister in South Australia was more concerned with his own personal feelings.

* There is a great **crisis** in staffing in public hospitals throughout Australia.

* I want to conclude by saying that the nursing **crisis** in our hospitals will not be solved until our attitudes to all aspects of nursing are revised.

* I refer to the **crisis** in the Middle East.

* I am making a belated plea as a Christian to ensure that we in Australia do a little more than we have done in the past so far as this **crisis** is concerned.

* There is not any doubt in my mind that the Jewish people and the Arab nations have taken a battering over a number of years because of the **crisis** in the Middle East, but I make this plea on 3 grounds.

* All I want is to get some assurance that the present **crisis** was incited by the Arab countries.

* The third point I want to raise relates to the report that we ali read in the newspapers yesterday that Israel's Prime Minister,  Mrs Golda  Meir, stated: 
the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system .

* the Speech makes no reference to the need for action to ensure that there cannot be a recurrence of the Constitutional **crisis** which threatens the continuation of the Australian Parliamentary system .

* That would mean that the constitutional **crisis** which this country suffered last year could never recur.

* The honourable member for Corangamite refuted allegations made by the honourable member foi Dawson  (Dr Patterson)  to the effect that the Government had done nothing to deal with the **crisis** in the wool industry.

* Two principles are fundamental to a serious approach to the **crisis** which threatens destruction to thousands of wool growers.

* It is not necessary to highlight the disastrous effect that the present **crisis** is already having in country towns.

* The second fundamental principle required to be recognised in any realistic and serious approach to the **crisis** is urgent and realistic government action, not mere window dressing and confidence tricks on the eve of an election.

* Only the Government has been unable to recognise the **crisis**.

* When one asks the question: 'Does the Bill before the House deal seriously with the **crisis** facing wool growers?

* But rural Australia today faces a **crisis** that has implications going far beyond the confines of the farm or the country community.

* The **crisis** has brought the nation to the crossroads of its own future.

* If the **crisis** in the countryside goes unresolved and if the family farm is abandoned, and with it many rural communities, we will create a vacuum in the countryside.

* The **crisis** in the countryside is just as much the concern of our city population.

* And what did the Treasurer  (Mr Bury)  say in the Budget about this **crisis** in the countryside?

* This is the high urgency of the Government on the **crisis** in the countryside - a single sentence, an anomalous handout and a promise to give some thought to the problems.

* They have dictated every policy, every decision, and their answer to the worst **crisis** in the countryside in  2  generations is to put a tax on wine, and hit the one primary industry not in trouble.

* The Government compounded its betrayal of the nation in this Budget by ignoring the **crisis** in local government.

* It is evident that the **crisis** in the Australian countryside will be blamed on European Economic Community, blamed on the callous British and blamed on the tendency of the world to divide into trading blocs.

* At present because of the rigidities of the present system associated with the exchange rate, the inefficient way in which the exchange rate has been administered and the **crisis** of confidence in the Government- that has been manifested by the behaviour of so many people- we are experiencing problems.

* Has the Minister for Social Security distributed a paper which differs from the Treasurer's analysis of the economic **crisis** and proposes different solutions?

* With an unparalleled school **crisis** - and many members of this side oi' the House and even on the Government side have referred to the **crisis** in education that exists right across the nation - we have seen 3 Ministers for Education and Science in half a school year.

* There was also a food **crisis**.

* Finally there was an oil **crisis**.

* More importantly the oil **crisis** has had a destabilising effect on the world economy as a whole.

* In the Melbourne  Herald  of Thursday, 6 October, 'Australia "Blind" to **Crisis**' is the claim made in the headlines.

* The article states: 
Australia was facing an economic **crisis**, the Victorian director of the Australian Institute of Management,  Mr Ron  Gilchrist, said today.

* Last April in this House I made a statement on the question of the world energy **crisis**.

* The continuing **crisis** in the Gazelle cannot be resolved by dictation from Port Moresby.

* I am very disappointed that people should try to use the anguish and despair of people involved in this **crisis** purely for political purposes.

* I do not seek to canvass this matter at this stage, but I consider that had the Commonwealth given 18-year-olds the right to vote as promised or indicated some time ago this **crisis** could have been avoided.

* But a pessimistic view was put by Emeritus Professor T. G. Hunter, until recently Professor of Chemical Engineering at Sydney University, at the Australian Institute of Political Science Spring Forum 'The **Crisis** in Wool' held at Goulburn in October 1970.

* He said: 
I intend to speak in particular about the beef situation because the beef industry in Australia is in a state of absolute **crisis**, as is the wool industry to a certain extent.

* These two matters- the handing of freight charges to overseas shipping combines and insurance charges to overseas insurance companies- are the two biggest factors in this deficit section of the balance of payments **crisis**.

* No wonder there is a large stock of spec built homes on the market in the midst of this housing **crisis**.

* The amendment goes further and charges the Opposition with putting the living standards of the needy in great jeopardy because of the constitutional **crisis** which it has promoted in this Parliament and in this country today.

* To propose a resolution in this House stating that our problems of inflation are due to economic mismanagement is spurious nonsense, as it is nonsense for the Leader of the Opposition (  Mr Malcolm  Fraser) to give as one of his main reasons for promoting the constitutional **crisis** from which we are suffering in this country today, the state of the economy of this country.

* But as long as the Opposition turns us into another Portugal, which is the sort of thing that is happening in the **crisis** which it has created, there will be no cure, there will be no stability, there will be no hope for the Australian people to steadily overcome this world malaise from which we are suffering.

* Another point that the honourable member for Isaacs wanted to make was that this Opposition-promoted **crisis** right now is stopping necessary funds reaching the Aboriginal people.

* They would recognise not only the humbug of this motion but also the humbug of the excuses that have been used to promote this constitutional **crisis**- this **crisis** which is putting the living standards of needy people in jeopardy right now.
