## Contexts in which the word "freedoms" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent lo all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
Uganda became independent in 1962.

* The erosion of political **freedoms** has been accompanied by continued economic deterioration.

* These are the things that we want to remember- what Australians did fight for in the wars and what they thought were **freedoms** that were to be preserved.

* At the same time, the profession's wholehearted co-operation will provide it with the best possible guarantee of preservation of the **freedoms** which individual doctors now enjoy and the best possible protection of the profession's own interests.

* They have seen Australia as a free country and they are astounded that those things which Australians cherished - the **freedoms** from too much government, from too much arbitrariness and from interfering nonsense - are in the melting pot if they are not out of the window today.

* In other words, this Government is opposed to any explicit expression of the bask human **freedoms** of opinion, of conscience, of movement and.

* I know what my **freedoms** and rights are, and I do not want there to be anything that may be misconstrued.

* My recollection is that Gibbon said that Augustus was conscious that mankind is governed by names and that if he respectfully assured the people that they still possessed their ancient **freedoms** they would submit to slavery.

* The result is that there is now agreement that the events which led to the ministerial changes have been properly responded to, but I do not believe that the House can easily press on to other issues without fairly acknowledging the valuable and honourable role of the honourable member for Lalor to this institution over many years and his honourable and unyielding commitment to the issues of personal rights, civil liberties and the **freedoms** of a democratic society.

* When these people are painting a critical picture with a wide brush they should remember that they are causing embarrassment and ridicule to many thousands of decent and gallant exservicemen without whose efforts in war these people would not enjoy the **freedoms** and rights of criticism in Australia that they do today.

* It was recognised that the main aim, for want of a better term, was for economic democracy and it was agreed that this must be advanced but that in the process the **freedoms** of democracy should never be sacrificed.

* I think it is remarkable, when young people are conscripted to go to a war and make the maximum sacrifice in some cases and a great sacrifice in all cases, ostensibly to protect our **freedoms** and way of life that companies such as Broken Hill Pty Company Limited and Mount Isa Mines Ltd, which are making booming profits this year, do not make sacrifices.

* In 20 months the Australian Labor Party has behaved like an octopus spreading its tentacles to clamp down on the **freedoms** that have been our rights as Australian citizens.

* It is his place in the environment - the good he does, how he lives with his neighbours and the measures of his contentment - but at the same time we must preserve our **freedoms** and our civil liberties.

* by inserting after sub-section (3) the following sub-sections: "(3a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and **freedoms** of any person.

* There is a guarantee of a double onus in this new section, that where there is a suggestion that one had evidence which is illegal and cannot be used, there is still a chance for the prosecution to say that the gravity of the situation is such that it is in the public interest to use it and that it would not unduly prejudice the rights and **freedoms** of any person.

* Over centuries we have designed the way in which parliamentary business should be handled, particularly matters which determine people's rights and **freedoms**, so I do not think that we ought to do this.

* In the United Nations we as a nation applaud the **freedoms** that are there espousedhuman rights, the protection of the individual's life and property, the freedom of countries from aggression, and so on.

* That is the United Kingdom- is currently being asked to accept a series of major infringements on traditional personal **freedoms** largely on the basis of an unproved economic hypothesis- that the main cause of inflation is trade union cost push.

* I cannot excuse any media source which accepts and publishes articles from the AGLS which are blatant political propaganda, for such media are forfeiting the very **freedoms** which newspapers and free peoples have guarded so jealously for centuries.

* He believed that the law and regard for the law were the greatest safeguard of liberty, of the **freedoms** of people.

* The civil rights and **freedoms** of Soviet citizens are very much subordinate to the interests of the Soviet State; this is made clear in the Soviet Constitution.

* All those honourable members have talked about what is needed in Australia, the Liberal Party philosophy and how it protects individual **freedoms**.

* It is another example of the gradual erosion by the Government of the individual liberties and **freedoms** of choice which we enjoy.

* The chief feature of that Bill, as honourable members will recall, and its pertinence to the matter now being discussed is that by the introduction of penalties we will be able to achieve what understanding and reason have not been able to achieve previously, notwithstanding that the resolution, as evidenced in the Schedule attached to the Racial Discrimination Bill, insists that we are to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental **freedoms** for all.

* He would not stand for the little person being hurt or being denied the **freedoms** that he was entitled to have.

* What sort of **freedoms** are left when, if any registered fund - I believe the Minister will, by some intrigue, induce the private health funds to become registered by holding out carrots here and there - dares to take on private health insurance for the purposes listed in clause 16, it will be penalised by being fined $1,000 a day for each day during which the contravention continues.

* One needs to look at the amendments set out in clause 36 within the context of the whole range of measures that this Government has brought in to restrict the rights and **freedoms** of people involved in industrial action.

* We share the same ideals and the same **freedoms**.

* We have grown up to be a nation in which we enjoy the greatest **freedoms**, liberties and opportunities of any country in the world.

* Clause 3 of the Bill defines 'human rights' to mean rights and **freedoms** recognised in the International Covenant or in any other relevant international instrument specified by the Minister.

* It provides that the Commission is to inquire into and report on an act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to the rights and **freedoms** recognised in the International Covenant when a complaint in writing is made by an individual to the Commission, when the Commission is requested to do so by the Minister or when it appears to the Commission to be desirable to do so.

* Had the Government given careful consideration to the civil liberties and democratic rights and **freedoms** of the Australian people in this matter it would have rejected outright the substance of the recommendations of the Hope report.

* I know that many of the members of this House who are associated with Left wing movements and have participated in communist led agitation have professed that they are in favour of all sorts of **freedoms**, that they are - against all sorts of oppression and that they do not believe in genocide and murder.

* I think it is going a little too far when people's **freedoms** are abused in this manner.

* These forms and procedures must be respected if we are not to lose, one by one, the rights and **freedoms** which have been built up in this country and if we are not to see them whittled away.

* In any event, he has a right to make a free political choice within our democratic society, that is, to exercise certain liberties and **freedoms** which inherently belong to an individual within a democratic environment.

* The Leader of the Opposition is not concerned with freedom, only with certain **freedoms**.

* I am one of the people who, in some ways, has doubts about absolute rights being vested in municipalities, particularly concerning personal, **freedoms** and things of that nature.

* I was fortunate early in the year to be able to speak and express my concern at the recent constitutional amendments in Poland and to applaud the efforts of Cardinal Mindszenty and the people of Poland who showed great courage in standing up in public and expressing their concern at the continuing decline of their **freedoms** in Poland.

* There will be the usual **freedoms** of navigation through this strait and the channel, and Australia will maintain navigational aids for the channel.

* The legislation that I am today introducing represents a balance between the needs of the nation for a strong, reliable and highly efficient security service and the need to preserve our individual rights and **freedoms**.

* We value our **freedoms** and we mean to preserve them.

* We as a Government which believes in the basic **freedoms** of all people cannot continue to maintain within the United Nations a country that violates every one of those **freedoms**.

* There are very important social issues which have been debated peripherally while the debate has continued, such as the individual **freedoms** of persons and the extent to which governments and parliaments should intrude into the homes and lives of people and the extent to which they should keep out.

* Of course, this is more a question for the Minister for Labour and National Service, but in passing I must make the comment that it does seem to me to be a reversal of real democratic **freedoms**.

* Will the Minister examine all relevant Commonwealth laws to determine whether any rights and **freedoms** conferred on any citizen by those laws will prevail over any attempted subtraction from the citizen's right to personal freedom or freedom of assembly by the laws of the State of Queensland?

* I find it unbelievable that a government that talks about these religious **freedoms** can introduce legislation to allow listening devices to be placed in the confessional, in the office of a solicitor, in the office of the medical practitioner, and in the office of an accountant.

* That policy leads to a tremendous acceleration in restrictions on growth and independent **freedoms**.

* How can a government appeal to unions for co-operation when it is pushing legislation through the Parliament to restrict their rights and **freedoms** in a way that no other democracy in the world has contemplated?

* The BUI Will thus make it unlawful for a person to do an act involving discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which impairs the enjoyment of fundamental rights and **freedoms**.

* the provision of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services and the right to join trade unions and employment 
Of course, we would expect the disciples of Lenin, Marx, Stalin and Mao Tse-tung to move relentlessly towards abrogating the **freedoms** which so many of us on this side value so much.

* The unsavoury task of smearing Professor Clark in Parliament has been entrusted to the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)-the  Minister responsible for tertiary education in this country and for defending the values and **freedoms** of academic life represented by universities.

* Some of the questions of adulthood by which the relations of unconnected persons are affected are: the age of legal responsibility for con.tractural and proprietary rights; the question of domicile and citizenship; the age at which certain social **freedoms** are permitted; the age at which marriage is permitted without parental consent; the age of responsibility in industrial matters; and age limitations in respect of financial legislation.

* The Government's policies seem to us to give to people of material resources, of some substance- the richer people of the community- these choices, these powers and these **freedoms**.

* The Australian Government has not made any formal protest to the Spanish Government concerning these matters, but its strong opposition to any deprivation of basic human rights and fundamental **freedoms** is well known.

* Article 1, section 3 of the United Nations Charter states that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote and encourage respect for human rights and for fundamental **freedoms** for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* But if we ignore infringements of liberty, freedom and the rights of men and women throughout the world we cheapen the respect we hold for our own **freedoms** and we move closer to the total enslavement of all mankind.

* They have the gall, the temerity, to talk that way about Israel- a country which has all the civil rights and **freedoms** that we have in Australia.

* What a great thing it is that this should happen in a society and that there should be those **freedoms**.

* Those **freedoms** do not exist in many Arab countries.

* Did those changes come into effect last February and do they further restrict the **freedoms** of the Polish people and make the foreign policy of Poland even more subservient to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics?

* This is a disadvantage in the **freedoms** of individuals.

* All kinds of help are given to the multinationals but nothing to the average Australians other than greater and still greater abuse of their **freedoms** and more and more unemployment.

* This would lead to greater **freedoms** for the dealers we all, with one accord, want apprehended.

* We have quite a number of socalled leaders today who persuade people to march through our towns and cities waving banners to declare their right';, privileges and **freedoms** as individuals.

* Perhaps they feel that they are in some way encroaching on personal **freedoms** and therefore are not willing to be tough.

* We pledge ourselves to a continued and determined struggle against all violations of the rights and fundamental **freedoms** of human beings, by eliminating the basic causes of such violations, by promoting universal respect for the dignity of all peoples without regard to race, colour, sex, language or religion- 
A second case concerns the rights and **freedoms** of the individual- subscriber.

* I am sufficient of an idealist to believe that where **freedoms** and basic human rights are threatened anywhere in the world it is the duty of those who support those basic **freedoms** and human rights to stand up in their defence.

* Similarly at about that time the Polish United Workers -Congress, which in fact is the Communist Party,- at its congress, instead of agreeing to those things which were being requested, decided that it would take the alternative course of not only denying those **freedoms** but also of taking away 3 basic rights which hitherto had been the entitlement of the people of Poland.

* I do not believe that we could ever be fierce enough in the defence of our **freedoms** and of the standards which we require to ensure that the systems of authority within our community are answerable; even at times of crisis, they can be made accountable.

* He said there was legal provision for various democratic **freedoms**.

* There is another attrition of our **freedoms** taking place today, and this disturbs me even more than does the fomenting of industrial strife.

* But the exercise of such tactics in pursuit of political aims, or to increase the industrial muscle of a union, is unforgivable and quite contrary to the **freedoms** we cherish.

* I believe in private enterprise because of its respect for individual **freedoms** - freedom of choice tempered by considerations of the public interest - for out of that in the long term will come the correct way to proceed.

* It was quite depressing to me when I was attending the United Nations to find that so many of the resolutions coming forward criticising other countries for an alleged lack of democracy and of political **freedoms** were often sponsored by countries which almost never exceeded the six or seven ranking, which represents the bottom of the possibilities for both political and civil rights, and that countries where the people obviously have no political or civil rights were continuously ranting about alleged interference with freedom in other countries that admittedly also had relatively poor rankings but which certainly were no worse off than the people who were criticising them.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order ... the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and **freedoms** of others.

* Therefore, I find it absolutely incredible, when we are talking about such basic **freedoms**, that we are encountering the opposition that we have had this afternoon and that we had in the chamber only last week.

* Berlin provides a classic example of a city divided into  2  parts, in this case West Berlin and East Berlin- and God forbid that we should ever see West Berlin denied the **freedoms** that the people of East Berlin enjoy.

* But let us look at those **freedoms** according to what we regard as moral standards.

* The need for the Parliament to make known its repugnance to the recent assault upon the few remaining **freedoms** of the Polish people, an assault which throws light on the international tactics of creeping Communism.

* As far as I am concerned, there are a number of fundamental **freedoms** to which every person is entitled and of which he should not be deprived except by the due process of law.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
Yes, he is getting a pretty free run by most sections of the media.

* He overlooks the fact, when dealing with the regime in Communist China, that there are no real **freedoms** in China.

* The great threat to people is not so much that they cannot read books or that they are not given religious **freedoms**, but that they just do not know what is happening and have insufficient means of redress when that which is happening is bad.

* The Government wants to forget Czechoslovakia and the **freedoms** that have been crushed in that country, lt even wants to ignore the restrictions on the freedom of the artists and writers in the Soviet Union.

* It is not a program to nationalise medical and hospital services, nor does it reduce any of the **freedoms** which patients, doctors or hospitals now enjoy.

* The tragedy of the Government's approach is that in order to extend coverage to all Australians it is taking away the rights and **freedoms** of choice of many Australian people and professional groups involved in health care.

* In answer to the second part of the question I would say that I am not satisfied, nor is the Government, that the law in its present state so far as it affects areas of Commonwealth responsibility can protect adequately the **freedoms** to which the honourable member referred.

* If approaches have been made, can he say whether the Governments of any of these countries, and which, have restricted democratic **freedoms** of political opponents not engaged in armed rebellion.

* If we value our **freedoms** that have been referred to we should think about whether we will necessarily increase them or improve them by writing them into the form of a constitutional guarantee.

* The Communists believe they should get into a country and use all the **freedoms** of democracy - free speech, free gathering, free association and no censorship - to obtain their ends until the country is brought to its knees.

* I invite honourable members opposite to name any of the other countries that they admire so much in which these **freedoms** are permitted.

* First, the Bill seeks to ensure that racial discrimination should be proscribed by law and fundamental rights and **freedoms**, without distinction as to race, should be guaranteed by law.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
Of course, the Soviet Union will not face total war- none of us would want that to happenbecause, with the use of today's weapons, little would be left of civilisation or, indeed, of humanity if such a thing were to occur.

* We are being told lies about the **freedoms** in Russia.

* But in a free society individual **freedoms** belong to all and not to the few.

* There are certain basic rules of democracy and freedom which state that there should be equality under the law but it is often overlooked that to obtain equality under the law we also need equality of access to h law if we are to protect those **freedoms**.

* It attempts to deal with a question of major social importance - a matter with a wide range of associated questions of medicine, social welfare, the physical and mental health of mothers, basic human rights, and the rights and **freedoms** of doctors, nurses and hospital staffs.

* If we want to preserve our basic democratic **freedoms**, we are going to have to work for them.

* In accordance with our determined policy the Government has decided to seek to negotiate changed air service arrangements on an endtoend basis, that is, an exchange of the Third and Fourth **Freedoms** of the Air.

* I draw the attention of honourable members to page 6 of the report for an explanation of the **Freedoms** of the Air.

* If people had democratic **freedoms**, the nationality questions would be resolved in a democratic manner inside the United Soviet Socialist Republics.

* This doctrine comprises the **freedoms** of navigation and overflight, of fishing and of laying submarine cables and pipe-lines.

* One of the 4 **freedoms** set out in the Atlantic Charter is the freedom of worship.

* I would say that there are many times when the excuse that we are undermining **freedoms** is used by those who themselves would desire to undermine the freedom and security of this country.

* I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor ASIO itself, has any regard for the individual rights and **freedoms** of Australian citizens.

* This Government knows, as did  Mr Chifley  and the Menzies Government before us, that in this area there is a delicate balance between those individual rights and **freedoms** and the security of our nation.

* The events prior to and during the Second World War had a substantial influence on the awareness of and the respect for human rights and fundamental **freedoms** in the preparation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* Universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental **freedoms** for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.

* Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental **freedoms**, 
Whereas a common understanding of these rights and **freedoms** is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, 
Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and **freedoms** and by progressive measures, national and international to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.

* These rights and **freedoms** may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

* Nothing in this Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and **freedoms** set forth herein.

* It is evident that many states still choose to ignore the terms of these human rights documents and to deprive their citizens of one or more of the basic human rights and **freedoms** to which all people are entitled.

* Referring to the provisions of Chapter V of the Constitution of Kenya relating to the fundamental rights and **freedoms** of citizens and particularly Article 83 thereof which sets limits to derogations which may be brought into operation under the Preservation of Public Security Act; Section 3 of the Kenya National Assembly (Powers and Privileges) Act; the provisions of Articles 2(1) and 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified by Kenya on 1 May 1972), and the provisions of Articles 9, 11(1) and 1 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
The people of this great country of ours, Australia, where we have fought to preserve **freedoms**, face penalties of up to $400 if they even think in imperial measurements.

* Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
So the 35c a week above the poverty level - the price of a pie and peas - for a married couple is the sort of stimulation that the Government wants to give to the economy.

* It is not worried about the basic rights and **freedoms** in a society; and you cannot have basic rights and **freedoms** in our sort of society unless you have at least the minimum economic adequacy to support yourself.

* It is all very well to say that people must have **freedoms** to demonstrate.

* People must have **freedoms** to protest or to strike.

* I want to say quite clearly now that I consider the processes of this Parliament, its right to the proper scrutiny of legislation and the duty of its membership to examine every piece of legislation which affects the rights and **freedoms** of citizens as much more important than defeating Westinghouse.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise, Mi Chipp, that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned.

* A number of measures for the protection of fundamental **freedoms** were outlined such as those relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Human Rights Commission and the freedom of information legislation.

* A great deal has been said about the **freedoms** in our country.

* Recommendations involving human rights especially the rights to privacy and individual **freedoms** are within my responsibility and the Government is vigorously pursuing a policy of protection of individual rights and **freedoms** so far as it has power to do so.

* It is a relic of earlier policies directed to protecting Aboriginal people by limiting their **freedoms** and controlling their relations with other citizens.

* Even if we are genuine in our efforts, certain **freedoms** that we have had in the past and the present high standards of living we enjoy will have to be sacrificed to some extent.

* In the next few days we are going to be privileged as a parliament to receive a Bill which will seek to extend to the whole of the people of Australia, whether they are ex-servicemen or migrants, no matter who they are, the right to one of the basic **freedoms** for which every parliament and every government should strive, freedom from want.

* I believe that the existence of an independent legal profession is vital for the adequate protection of the individual against the state- that point was made very well by the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Ellicott)-  and the proper protection of individual **freedoms**, rights and property.

* If, on the other hand, they fall flat on their face in the struggle in our sort of system and cannot get up, they have freedomthe Leader of the Opposition is talking about **freedoms** lately in a rather vague way which in a general sense sounds unexceptionable but, if one knows the inspiration that is guiding him, I think it is rather exceptionable- and their freedom is to stay flat on their face.

* We believe that individual rights and **freedoms** are basic to our society.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister of Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
Coupled with the achievement of excellence by the efforts of the individual comes a promise to reduce the amount of regulation imposed on individuals by the Australian Government.

* This, he says, is a basic freedom without which other **freedoms**, such as freedom of speech, association and so on, are meaningless.

* A person on an inadequate income may have freedom of choice to send his children to the best schools or to choose the best doctor, but he will find those **freedoms** meaningless.

* Yet efforts to ensure that all Australians are in a position to enjoy the **freedoms** we value are described by the Leader of the Opposition as 'enforced equality'.

* Above all they cherish their **freedoms**.

* Their entitlement to civil **freedoms** would be dependent upon an arbitrary assessment by the state as to what one's personal civic performance should be.

* Whilst we have the principle of absolute equality of citizens before the law - with everyone, no matter what his station, subject to the law - whilst we have the independence of the judiciary and whilst we have the right of freedom of speech and assembly so long as the **freedoms** of other people are not infringed, the rights of individual citizens are protected.

* In surveys made through Australian cities the young people in the final years of high school wish to be able to discuss anything from Zen Buddhism to any of the Christian faiths and to have the sort of **freedoms** that would exist in a university.

* The first thing I noticed was the rather curious way in which countries with totalitarian regimes and with poor domestic records of respect for basic individual rights and **freedoms** always seemed to be most concerned about the preservation of human rights in other countries.

* None of these countries can boast of supporting democratic **freedoms** or even the most basic human rights.

* It is suggested that the following sub-section be inserted after sub-section (3):  (3a) Where, in proceeding in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with, a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and **freedoms** of any person.

* We witness almost daily the steady stripping away of individual **freedoms**- of a person's right to disagree and to have a meaningful opportunity to influence the management of the affairs of his country.

* Australians are known for their independent fighting spirit, which always arouses them when their **freedoms** are threatened.

* Large numbers of them have migrated from countries that have few, if any, **freedoms**.

* We put it under the control of a judge who was trained in the rights and **freedoms** of the British people under British law.

* When the present Opposition came into power it put the security organisation under the control of a military person- I think it was  Colonel Spry-  who was not trained to the same degree as a member of the judiciary in the **freedoms** and rights of the British people, which applied also to the Australian people.

* That, I might add, is entirely consistent with Liberal principles which recognise that in order to create or to preserve **freedoms** in the community it is often necessary to inhibit the activities of some within it.

* His  gaoling is a monstrous violation of normal human **freedoms** and he has been subjected to very bad treatment.

* In this Bill, we have made provision for committees of inquiry whose functions relate to the services provided to pensioners, but I wish to stress that we will be consulting with the medical profession to ensure that, on the one hand, there is no abuse of the medical benefits system and, on the other hand, that the professional **freedoms** of doctors are protected.

* During this Budget debate they have endorsed  Mr Hawke's  actions in taking on the people of Australia and trying to take away from them their **freedoms**.

* The Australian Government naturally would regret any move to inhibit the rights and **freedoms** of individuals anywhere in the world.

* The Australian Government naturally would regret any move to inhibit the rights and **freedoms** of Polish citizens.

* I fear Soviet Russia and so should every Australian who cherishes our basic **freedoms**, our way of life and indeed the very integrity of the Austraiian nation.

* In place of the characteristic Australian philosophy which encourages innovation, initiative and personal choice, the Government by this scheme, seeks to impose a lumbering, bureaucratic monopoly that will stifle all those **freedoms** that Australians value.

* I take on board the point that the honourable member for Bonython so aptly made- and I share his concern- about the preservation of basic **freedoms** in one's own home.

* The member nations of GATT are known as and spoken of in the GATT as contracting parties, because they contract as members of GATT to forgo certain **freedoms** in trade.

* The measures which have been announced today strike the balance between the need to respond decisively to the threat of terrorism and the imperative of preserving Australia's character as an open society and the democratic **freedoms** we all hold paramount.

* The aim of a Labor government would be to ensure that both these **freedoms** are guaranteed.

* Our policy on public broadcasting was decided at the Perth conference this year and it included the following points: 
Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental **freedoms**.

* What is interesting, and what prompted me to make these comments, is that many of the fundamental **freedoms** in the Australian Constitution do not apply to the Australian Capital Territory.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that  tks  concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is  ev',i  and ought to be condemned.

* If there is developed a conspiracy to subvert it can operate under the protection of the **freedoms** to which it is directly or indirectly opposed.

* Has the Government adequate power to cope with attacks on individual **freedoms** which are becoming more prevalent in Australia?

* If not, will action be taken to strengthen the ability of the Government to preserve those **freedoms** that we have long accepted in Australia as part of our freedom loving democratic way of life?

* Without it the **freedoms** which this nation enjoys would be imperilled.

* No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and **freedoms** of others.

* All of this I do not dispute, but nevertheless I must protest that there are times when freedom is not helped by obeying the law, when the most vital **freedoms** have to be defended by defying the law.

* I can stand on this side of the House and say that for 6 years I have been consistent in my requests for open government and for certain civil liberties and **freedoms**.

* Let us start dealing with real **freedoms** and liberties irrespective of whether this man is a communist.

* Let us start look-  ing at the question of our **freedoms**.

* We have to examine, our freedom because people's **freedoms** are being restricted more and more.

* I hope that people outside consider the matter of real **freedoms**, of the individual freedom of every member and of the right of every man to be deemed innocent until he is proved guilty.

* That matter was put on the agenda of the Assembly, not because those individual cases would normally be of international concern, but because it was felt strongly that, in the guise of administering criminal law, actually what was being attemped in those States was interference with fundamental **freedoms**- in this instance freedom of religious worship.

* He is 82 years of age now and understandably is somewhat frail, but he is still alert and still able to bring to us the message of resistance to communist oppression, whether it be on the religious or the secular side because that oppression is anti-religious as well as being a repression of all the things which we consider to be human **freedoms**.

* It is in the most important matters of life that the Government is refusing our **freedoms**.

* I hope that Australia is prepared to express a view, and to express a strong view if necessary, at Belgrade this year at the conference to consider the application of the Helsinki Pact, that we as a country believe it is about time that those countries behind the Iron Curtain which deny basic civil rights to their citizens should think again and should at least acknowledge that they have a responsibility to ensure that those who live within their boundaries have the same basic **freedoms** and rights as we enjoy in Australia.

* We will say that the real **freedoms** are the **freedoms** to think, to speak, to worship, to choose, to be ambitious, to be industrious, to acquire skills and to seek rewards - not the dull, stultifying reflections that come from the socialist philosophy that we are having imposed upon us today by this Government.

* I find that disgraceful, a breach of the spirit of our Constitution, and totally against the basic **freedoms** that we in Australia applaud.

* I certainly do not understand why Qantas should be able to undertake agreements which are totally contrary to the foreign policy of this country and totally contrary to all the basic **freedoms** that we have long cherished.

* To understand that issue requires the question relating to fundamental **freedoms** to be resolved.

* That they welcome the statement by the honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
Mt GARLAND (Curtin) [3.46]- Since this debate allows comment on any topic, I propose to address myself to foreign affairs and its effect on this country.

* But the world in which we must live and make our contribution contains much rivalry for power, great ideological conflicts which directly attack our basic principles and **freedoms**, a world in which one great group of power holds the principles of the Charter of United Nations in defiant contempt.

* He referred to the Government deciding to negotiate changed air service arrangements on an end to end basis- third and fourth **freedoms** of the air.

* What he does not say is that the most likely result of the negotiations in relation to these third and fourth **freedoms** on an end to end basis will be that the airlines that he mentioned- they have been mentioned recently- will withdraw from Australia.

* He says that the only way in which to get efficiency is by total regulation, by third and fourth **freedoms** negotiations, in spite of the comments he made a few weeks ago about free enterprise.

* All these **freedoms**, the Government keeps assuring us, will be preserved.

* Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental **freedoms**.

* by inserting after sub-section (6) the following sub-sections: "(6a) Where, in proceedings in a court in respect of an offence, objection is taken to the admission of evidence on the ground that the evidence was obtained in contravention of, or in consequence of a contravention of, or in consequence of a failure to comply with a provision of this Act, in relation to a person, the court shall not admit the evidence unless it is, on the balance of probabilities, satisfied that admission of the evidence would specifically and substantially benefit the public interest without unduly prejudicing the rights and **freedoms** of any person.

* I disagree with the Minister, as does the Community Standards Organisation, when he argues that 'the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms**'.

* militarism which will rob Australians of the very **freedoms**, the very civil liberties which the Governor-General 's Speech misleadingly espouses.

* It also endeavoured to preserve the basic **freedoms** of movement and access to information which have been the hallmarks and traditions of the Australian nation.

* I am fearful of the infringements to the civil rights, liberties and **freedoms** of the Australian people that have been upheld since federation.

* Australians, many of whom fought in these wars to overthrow fascist regimes and to protect the rights and **freedoms** of the individual, are now being placed in an insidious position of having to look at the prospect of a new form of fascism in their own backyards of clean, respected Australia.

* I am certainly hopeful that Australia will never curtail the **freedoms** or liberties of the people as has been done in some of the countries in South East Asia.

* In particular the Commonwealth should seek to enhance the co-ordination of its activities with those of other organisations similarly committed to the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental **freedoms**.

* We will have instead a universal health insurance scheme which covers everyone in the community, a scheme which gives some meaning to the loose talk of **freedoms**, we hear from honourable members on the other side of the House.

* But the fact is that complete **freedoms** are guaranteed in this scheme.

* Here, with all the **freedoms** that are afforded debate in this place, we can look for security against some of the difficulties and the dangers that I have mentioned.

* Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental **freedoms**.

* These are the matters before the House tonight - the rights, privileges and **freedoms** of the community.

* The Queen mentioned in her opening address that the Government has certain legislation in hand to correct the monopolising power of big unions and the way they are able to extend and impinge upon the rights and **freedoms** of their members.

* I think the provisions that the Government is planning to introduce in this session of Parliament will do no more in their totality than allow the individual in society to have rights and **freedoms** that I believe every Australian citizen has the right to expect.

* Above all, the rights and **freedoms** of the Australian people are the most jealously guarded in the Western world and are the envy of many nations both near to and far from our shores.

* We are not allowed to approach their people; we cannot try to make them see the **freedoms** and advantages of our system.

* The way in which the Australian* Labor Party attacks doctors is vicious, unfortunate and in extremely poor taste, but not as callous and unfortunate as the Labor Party's disregard for the **freedoms** and rights of patients in its obsession with controls and commissions.

* The tragedy of the nationalised scheme is that the rights, the **freedoms** and the humanity of patients are sacrificed to suit the inhuman tidiness of the doctrinaire and bureaucratic mind.

* One ofthe greatest **freedoms** that we enjoy in Australia is religious freedom- the right to worship as we see fit.

* It is headed by Herbert W. Armstrong and is well known to Australian radio listeners and television viewers through the appearance of his son, Garner Ted Armstrong, who 
It is perfectly clear that we are placing on record that we want more open thought, more discussion, more **freedoms** and a more independent expression of attitude by this Parliament on foreign affairs.

* We have given deep thought to this subject, and we feel that we want more **freedoms** and more open discussion in the Australian community, because we believe that the Australian community should be better informed on foreign affairs than it is at present.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and thai, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
The Department will not even let us know what is happening in Russia.

* We hear all this nonsense about their adopting **freedoms** and so on and we are falling for it.

* It is the courts that have given us the great **freedoms**.

* They have ensured the **freedoms** of which British citizenry is justly proud and which it is rightly quick to defend.

* These courts that gave us the great **freedoms** were in fact an informed elite outside the process of government and were very public.

* To do otherwise is to sell out our children on the basic **freedoms** of access to information, vocational choice and even political choice which literacy alone can confer.

* Augustus was conscious that mankind is governed by names and knew that if the people were assured that they still possessed their ancient **freedoms** they would submit to slavery.

* They bring great social advantages which we want to preserve but, at the same time, we must realise that those **freedoms** which we enjoy impose on us economic costs.

* The Soviet Union now has some of the problems of the rest of the world in regard to these matters but, it does have **freedoms**.

* However, it is obvious to honourable members on both sides of the Parliament, having come from the kind of society in which we live, that there are other **freedoms** which often transcend that, including the freedom to be free.

* This scheme, as I have said, has built in **freedoms** which 1 maintain are vital to both the individual patient and to the doctor as well as the nation.

* But Mao murdered a thousand times as many of his own countrymen as Mussolini ever did and destroyed ten times as many of their **freedoms**.

* The fact that the Opposition has chosen to criticise the legislation on the basis that it rejects the new federalism policy is clear proof that it still adheres to its centralist aspirations of bringing all legislative power to Canberra and putting at risk the **freedoms** of the Australian people and the very democracy which provides us with those **freedoms**.

* In short, I am concerned that certain Australian citizens who originally came from Yugoslavia are being intimidated and have had their individual **freedoms** interfered with by a consular representative from another country.

* I bring them to the attention of the House because I find it incredible that Australian citizens living in Australia and ostensibly enjoying the individual **freedoms** which that citizenship conveys, including the right of free association, the right of assembly and the right to practise one's religion, are having their rights interfered with by the consular officials of another country.

* In many cases they have come to Australia because they want to enjoy the privileges and individual **freedoms** which life in Australia can offer them.

* But I do suggest that those who express the wish to become and who do become solely Australian citizens should not be intimidated or in any way have their individual **freedoms** interfered with by any consular official from any country.

* At stake in Australia today are the people's **freedoms**, which are being challenged by the way in which the Government is behaving.

* Journalists say that they support **freedoms**, but the sincerity of their statements must be questioned because of the obvious sympathy of many of them with communist regimes around the world, regimes which practise all the complete antitheses of democracymurder, deceit and class hatred.

* These threats to democracy and to our **freedoms** are not limited solely to the rejected Bills.

* One of the basic **freedoms** which we in the Liberal and Country Parties have always believed in is the freedom of people to have the education of their choice.

* The Bill represents a further restriction on the individual rights and **freedoms** of persons.

* One does not realise the limited **freedoms** that we possess until one steps outside of conformity.

* 1 was able to explain to them that although their **freedoms** were limited within the university once they stepped outside the boundaries of the university grounds their **freedoms** were far more restricted - they had no **freedoms** outside.

* What is wrong with this Government is that it has restricted our **freedoms**.

* It reads: 
That they welcome the statements by the honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
We cannot be seen to be prepared to weaken in the face of aggression, as was the case with the aggression by Indonesia against East Timor.

* We have to acknowledge cultural differences with our neighbours, but if we do not maintain a consistent concern for human rights in our policies we risk more blatant disregard for human rights in neighbouring countries and, we risk, also, a progressive deterioration of and disregard for human rights and **freedoms** in our own country.

* That they welcome the statement by the honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned.

* VII on Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental **Freedoms**, which clearly places an obligation on all signatories to promote and respect human rights and civil liberties in their respective countries.

* Respect for human rights and fundamental **freedoms**, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief 
The participating States will respect human rights and fundamental **freedoms**, including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* They will promote and encourage the effective exercise of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and other rights and **freedoms** all of which derive from the inherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his free and full development.

* The participating States on whose territory national minorities exist will respect the right of persons belonging to such minorities to equality before the law, will afford them the full opportunity for the actual enjoyment of human rights and fundamental **freedoms** and will, in this manner, protect their legitimate interests in this sphere.

* The participating States recognise the universal significance of human rights and fundamental **freedoms**, respect for which is an essential factor for the peace, justice and well-being necessary to ensure the development of friendly relations and co-operation among themselves as among all States.

* They will constantly respect these rights and **freedoms** in their mutual relations and will endeavour jointly and separately, including in co-operation with the United Nations, to promote universal and effective respect for them.

* In the field of human rights and fundamental **freedoms**, the participating States will act in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

* At the same time the basic rights and **freedoms** of the individual citizens in our democracy must be preserved.

* What has to be kept secure is not simply a physical entity; the society which exists within Australia is one with standards and principles which secure rights and **freedoms** as well as obligations.

* That society is not to be safeguarded by a repudiation of those standards or those principles with the consequent erosion of rights and **freedoms**.

* All the **freedoms** that we have cherished and enjoyed are in jeopardy.

* Labor has evolved a practical program to ensure our basic civil rights and **freedoms**- to reshape our laws to meet the needs and aspirations of the seventies.

* The second and possibly more insidious threat to any effective enjoyment of our **freedoms** is an attempt on the part of many governments to disclose as little significant information as possible.

* The United Nations Charter is based on the principles of dignity and equality inherent in all human beings and the Charter provides that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental **freedoms** for all without distinction as to race.

* The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 25th anniversary of which was celebrated on 10 December 1973, proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and **freedoms** set out in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race.

* The participating states will respect human rights and fundamental **freedoms** including the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.

* If we are able to make this report the Christmas best seller for 1979 then we will have played some small part in helping those who are still fighting for basic human **freedoms**.

* Two other major matters hitting the people of Indi very hard and hitting all Australia hard are the high cost structure of the country and the associated actions of communist controlled unions which are dedicated to forcing up our cost structure all the time until they- that is the members of the Communist Party- attain their ultimate objective of wrecking our economy and destroying our society and **freedoms**.

* They protest under the banners of freedom and justice, but they simply do not believe in the **freedoms** and justice which we cherish in our democracy.

* On campus after campus in the United States of America the few have made the many suffer a serious and lasting curtailment or even a cessation of their basic **freedoms**, lt is not even a question of the right to dissent in some places there.

* One concerns the proposition put up by the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr N. H. Bowen)  that no necessity exists to define certain **freedoms** by certain positive statements because he considers that the method that always has been used in this country to be the more liberal way.

* I hope that Hansard when reporting that part of the Attorney-General's speech will spell 'liberal' with a capital 'L 
The proposition that I wish to put to the Attorney-General is this: In clause 14 of this Bill positive statements are made as far as certain rights, **freedoms** and dignities in respect of protected persons are concerned.

* Apparently protected persons in this country in turn are entitled to certain **freedoms** and dignities.

* I certainly object to the proposition that apparently non-protected persons in this country are not entitled to those **freedoms** and dignities.

* I rise to draw attention further to the tragic circumstances in Western Australia where legislation which has been sent from the Lower House to the Upper House proposes to take from Australian citizens their basic **freedoms** at law and to give to an elected government powers which were not mentioned during that government's election manifesto.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
It may be a happy position for the Opposition to have approximately 1 5 per cent of the Australian community uninsured and threatened with poverty when illness strikes, but it is completely unacceptable to the Government.

* There are some **freedoms** that are basic to the Australian way of life.

* There are many examples of the union leadership trying to protect itself and trying to restrict the real rights and **freedoms** of the individual union member.

* Every man on this side of the House is dedicated to 2 things - to the preservation of the great Australian **freedoms** and the high quality of life which was the envy of the world, and to the breaking of the grip which this arrogant, irresponsible unAustralian group of jackboot tyrants have on this magnificent country.

* I believe, for the reasons I have stated, that it violates certain human rights and fundamental **freedoms**.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and women who believe in the basic **freedoms** and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned.

* At the same time, the Government will ensure that any action taken is consistent with the various established **freedoms** in Australia.

* However, they stressed that those **freedoms** and equalities were not apparent to them under State administration in Queensland.

* They could not see any possibility of a State takeover helping them to achieve these **freedoms** and equalities.
