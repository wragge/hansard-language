## Contexts in which the word "asio" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* It is clear that this was not an **ASIO** operation but that somewhere in the State Special Branch in Victoria it was thought: These people are probably engaged in some kind of dangerous activity, therefore it is necessary to treat their activities as potentially subversive so far as Victoria is concerned and tap their phones.

* Let it not be forgotten that the purposes of the Murphy raids on **ASIO**, or the nature ofthe documents that he was so desperate to find, have never been revealed.

* In March 1973 the then Attorney-General, now  Mr Justice  Murphy, led a raid on the **ASIO** headquarters in St Kilda in Melbourne.

* Is it a fact that what  Senator Murphy  found in Canberra was a copy of a document and that, as a result of finding it, he decided to proceed to Melbourne, being preceded by Commonwealth Police who were instructed to seal all safes and to prevent the free movement of members of the staff of **ASIO**?

* It is my belief that the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**,  Mr Justice  Woodward, carries out this responsibility creditably and faithfully.

* However, the class A charges are the dominant source of revenue of ASIA, that is, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, not to be confused with **ASIO** about which we have heard so much, and provide $10.7m of the gross revenue from charges of $13.2m in 1970-71.

* I do not know whether that could have been an earlier attack by  Senator Murphy  on **ASIO**.

* His  argument was: If people have nothing to be ashamed of, what have they to be frightened of if **ASIO** is surveilling their activities?

* Conservative governments have been prepared to use organisations like **ASIO** or simply to stand by and let those organisations deal with people with whom the Government has no sympathy or understanding.

* I believe that **ASIO** is an un-Australian institution in the way that it is conducted.

* For that reason- the third reason- one cautions against introducing into this definition words which subject much of the active and vigorous political debate in the society to the intervention of **ASIO**.

* Finally, which Minister authorised **ASIO** .tq try to arrange for listening devices to be placed in the office of the China' National Resources Corporation in the Bank of China while Chinese-Australian wheat negotiations were in train?

* We have no objection at all to defining activities that would involve or lead to the destruction of a constitutional government, but to use the word ultimately' brings this mental decision by officers of **ASIO** as to how they think people or a number of persons may eventually act.

* We know that he raided **ASIO** headquarters for some reason.

* He says that he made it clear in his reply that **ASIO** would not destroy records and files of actual or potential security relevance.

* In view of the fact that the AttorneyGeneral has said that the Prime Minister does know why he visited the **ASIO** office in Canberra, because he discussed his visit and the reasons for it with him, will the Prime Minister now pay the House and the Australian people the courtesy of answering the question?

* If we leave it as it is in the Bill we will really create a situation whereby public comment by **ASIO** officials will be denied.

* I overlooked the fact that I did see him a couple of months later in my office for a few minutes concerning the appropriations to be made for **ASIO** in the Budget.

* Migrants will not forget the door knocks which followed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation fiasco last year when the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  raided **ASIO** headquarters.

* This will allow the court to operate if necessary at its present strength during the period of  Mr Justice  Woodward's appointment with **ASIO** which will be for a number of years.

* Has he ascertained why the Department of Foreign Affairs should have put forward the view which he stated was put forward, according to the report of the **ASIO** officer, and why the Attorney-General's Department should have accepted the first point?

* **ASIO** may be delighted, but the decision is a disgraceful one for Australia, particularly at this stage of the historical development of southern African politics.

* I cannot believe that **ASIO** spent it in such an accurate manner.

* In his dealings with **ASIO** he was advised by a gentleman,  Mr Milte,  in what capacity one does not know, because a question asked by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) on the subject has been on the notice paper since 4 April.

* If the News and Information Bureau is being used as an adjunct of **ASIO** why does the Government not say so?

* Will the Prime Minister reconsider his statement that he did not know why the AttorneyGeneral visited the Canberra office of **ASIO**?

* They found that the Special Branch in South Australia and **ASIO** had failed to fulfil their charter.

* It is the view of the Government that the administrative control of **ASIO** is properly left with the Attorney-General and not properly with the Prime Minister.

* If so, why has he not taken appropriate action  against the Attorney-General and the Treasurer as the 2 Ministers responsible administratively respectively for **ASIO** and the Budget?

* What is **ASIO** doing about it?

* If the Government were competent it would withdraw the **ASIO** Bill and associated Bills and bring them back in the Budget session.

* In the United States a Bill such as the **ASIO** Bill could certainly not be railroaded through the Congress without proper debate.

* Has he seen criticism of the fact that  Mr Carmody  has offered **ASIO** access to the Australia Police's proposed powerful new computer with the proposal that it will have its own key to that computer?

* I preface my question to the Prime Minister by referring to an article in today's Melbourne  Sun  which reports the Prime Minister as having denied that he was briefed by  Mr Whitlam  on the reason for the dismissal of the then Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and that  Mr Whitlam  briefed him on an alleged infiltration of **ASIO** by the KGB.

* I would not let **ASIO** tell me the time and from what I have seen of its behaviour I would not believe it even if it did.

* I believe that no such document has ever been quoted and I believe that it would be quite unprecedented and wrong for me to confirm or deny the text of any document emanating from **ASIO**.

* I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition is well aware of the well established principle that has been followed by the present Prime Minister and by former Prime Ministers, both Labor and Liberal, namely, not to comment publicly on assertions or allegations about the activities of **ASIO**.

* The point again is that that puts in an extremely subjective judgment, because the word 'ultimately' might mean 100 years, 150 years or 200 years, and that could lead to such an extraordinarily cautious or repressive view being taken of what is legitimate or illegitimate behaviour that we will find **ASIO**'s powers being extended in a way which I think is quite objectionable in a democratic community like ours.

* The Bill provides for the official title of the head of **ASIO** to be changed from 'Director-General' to 'Director'.

* Has the man left **ASIO**?

* Within the operations of each of the Ministers of the present Government there are aspects that need to be condemned, but beyond all else the duplicity that is represented by their behaviour in the **ASIO** raids, in the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and in the deplorable exercise of trying to assert a date for the resignation or cessation of appointment of the present Ambassadordesignate to Ireland in terms of the Gair affair are 3 of the major exercises which mean that the people of Australia must be given an opportunity to express their attitude towards the continuity in government of the present regime.

* The matter relating to what the Prime Minister did with **ASIO** has nothing at all to do with the question before the Chair 
-Does the Prime Minister deny that the only reasonable construction that could be put on the words 'unprecedented', 'extraordinary ' and 'gravely damaging to **ASIO** and to the national security interest' is that a complaint was being made?

* I cannot see how it would make any difference to the **ASIO** operator, at whatever level, in his selection of a matter for a file if the word 'ultimately' were left out.

* The problem with paragraph (c) of clause 8 of the Bill is that it creates a situation in which the Director-General of **ASIO** is entitled to withhold information from the Attorney-General.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  would probably send **ASIO** a copy of his speeches, I imagine, as he is so proud of what he has to say.

* You say you are prepared to make available to me the document which the Attorney-General took from the **ASIO** office in Canberra on 16th March.

* Therefore, I accept fundamentally that if a resolution of this House demanded something from **ASIO** it would have to be known.

* will the Prime Minister examine the Croatian documents again and in particular the **ASIO** theory that Mudrinic was a government agent planted in Australia by UDBA the Yugoslav secret police?

* and (2) It is not the accepted practice to disclose the number of **ASIO** staff.

* that **ASIO** and the Director-General also have a special relationship with the Prime Minister.

* Mr Justice  Hope made it clear that in the past **ASIO** had frequently broken the law.

* That is all **ASIO** does.

* Does this case indicate that the Department of Foreign Affairs is subservient to **ASIO**.

* -I have not asked to see any **ASIO** security documents in my life.

* It is not the accepted practice to disclose the number of **ASIO** staff.

* 1 ) When will the report on **ASIO** be presented to Parliament.

* **ASIO** Surveillance (Question No.

* I think that someone who has to act in that way is better suited to be directly responsibile for the administration of **ASIO**.

* Therefore in making those comments there may be 2 Judases- one on each side of the House- if it is ever envisaged that control of **ASIO** shall be taken from the Attorney-General.

* The policeman says: 'That is not illegal because we listened to  Mr Viner,  you know that very learned lawyer who is charge of the **ASIO** Bill on behalf of the Government.

* We will ring up **ASIO** and if you actually press the button you will be in trouble.

* Well, let me just say to the Minister, more in pity than in anger, that the act of manufacturing a bomb in any residence anywhere in Sydney or in Melbourne or anywhere at all - 
I ask the Prime Minister: Has a complaint or have complaints been made to him directly, to him through any member of his staff, or to his Government, by any member of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation about the raids - termed visits' by the Attorney-General- on 16th March by the Attorney-General with Commonwealth Police on the Melbourne and Canberra offices of **ASIO**?

* In the whole of the **ASIO** documents that have been tabled there has been demonstrably a selection of parts of documents and parts of correspondence.

* I am referring to the **ASIO** document dated Sth March.

* The operation of the **ASIO** spy force in the trade union movement must be some new kind of conciliation.

* Our friend who is proud to have been a member of the National Civic Council is probably drawing on the resources of **ASIO** in that respect to support his own organisation, and good luck to him.

* He made the point that **ASIO** does not, and properly does not, survey employer organisations or trade unions as such.

* Of course, there will be some continuing damage resulting from the Gair affair, the **ASIO** affair, the Cope affair, the Crean affair and all the others.

* As a background there have been further investigations into the activities of these groups by both **ASIO** and the Commonwealth Police.

* My impression is that the Commonwealth Police reports have been more thorough, accurate and revealing than those of **ASIO**.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Did the Director-General of Security in the telex which he says he drafted and issued to the **ASIO** staff use the words 'unprecedented', 'extraordinary' and 'gravely damaging to **ASIO** and to the national security interests'?

* I suppose that all honourable members would be aware that for some time this Government- and no doubt the previous Government- has considered the role and the specific functions of **ASIO**.

* Whatever might come before the Parliament in the weeks ahead, I believe I would be failing in my duty if I did not place on record, before the debate on **ASIO** starts, the admiration, in which I hold this man.

* It is important for the Committee to realise that, for all practical purposes, once this package of Bills has passed from this House, the House virtually has washed its hands of **ASIO**.

* For instance, it is quite clear that questions about **ASIO** will not be answered.

* Secondly, there is no annual report to Parliament by **ASIO**, so there can be no check through that means.

* There is no effective parliamentary audit of **ASIO** and, in the Opposition's view, we have ineffective ministerial control of **ASIO**.

* We are in the paradoxical position where Parliament has no effective control in relation to 
**ASIO**, yet **ASIO** is empowered to investigate individual members of Parliament.

* This is why we are proposing an annual report to the Parliament, both in the **ASIO** Bill and also in the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill, in relation simply to warrants involved with telephone tapping in this Bill and to listening devices in the **ASIO** Bill.

* As far as I can work out, that is a 33 W per cent increase on what **ASIO** received last year.

* Is **ASIO** going to put on more spoofs in order to go there and clean out that travel service?

* Commonwealth employees and persons in certain 'immigration' categories will be able to have **ASIO**'s security assessment of them subject to independent review by the new Security Appeals Tribunal.

* The establishment of the new Tribunal will rectify this and will therefore function as a major civil liberties safeguard in relation to **ASIO**'s security assessments.

* On the other hand, if the report is inaccurate we all have much to fear from inaccurate reports by **ASIO**.

* All applicants for naturalization and pro spective public servants, have much to fear from reports by **ASIO** if they are inaccurate.

* The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the **ASIO** Act do not confirm or deny allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of **ASIO**, continue in force' (Fourth Report, Volume I, paragraph 78 1 ).

* I mention also that **ASIO** has been a target for those with left wing sympathies.

* It has been part of a policy of the left wing within the Australian Labor Party to destroy **ASIO** and to discredit it both in Australia and overseas.

* It ought to be noted in passing that **ASIO**, when it was first set up under the Chifley Government, was set up under significant advice from the British domestic security organisation which had a military origin.

* When **ASIO** was set up it was set up for a reason which was quite clear and which was known to the Australian people.

* Under the Opposition's suggested provision the Minister could say: 'I shouldn't say it, but as a matter of fact there is an **ASIO** file on  Mr U.  E. Innes.

* I have not seen it and I cannot tell you what is in it but there is a file in the **ASIO** office on Ted Innes'.

* Is it not far better for the Leader of the Opposition in his briefings with the Director-General behind closed doors to say: Look, the story is around that **ASIO** has a file on  Mr Ted  Innes.

* So we are going to have more police boxes, more security provisions all around the place and more **ASIO** agents, although heavens knows what they will be for.

* In addition the Director-General of **ASIO** on 7th September 1972 stated in reference to the aide-memoire in a letter to the AttorneyGeneral's Department: 
**ASIO** never retreated from that stand and subsequently agreed with the present AttorneyGeneral that the aide-memoire contained a core of irrebuttable truth.

* It had taken the then Attorney-General only a month to forget the Commonwealth Police's core of almost irrebuttable fact', and less than a fortnight to forget the cautionary advice of **ASIO**.

* We now know for sure that the answer is: Yes, and so do the Commonwealth Police and **ASIO**'.

* Why has his organisation, which flaunts its Ustashi allegiance, and which is acknowledged by **ASIO** in another document which is to be tabled here tomorrow, to be a terrorist organisation, been allowed to continue in existence?

* The officer of the Department who made this recommendation pointed out that **ASIO**'s latest report and the most recent Commonwealth Police report on Marie indicated that he was deeply involved in Croatian nationalist activities and was prepared to support acts of violence against Yugoslavia, that there was a real possibility that he would, if granted a passport, be a participant in acts of violence directed against Yugoslavia and that, if this occurred, it would be an embarrassment to Australia's relations with Yugoslavia.

* Even after these ministerial complaints the attitude of Attorney-General Hughes and his successors was one which **ASIO** described to the present Attorney-General as that of 'indifference' to the problem of Croatian terrorism.

* Even after these ministerial complaints and the other matters to which I have adverted, the attitude of Attorney-General Hughes and his successors was one which **ASIO** described to the present AttorneyGeneral as that of indifference to the problem of Croatian terrorism.

* In the view of **ASIO** the Organisation was not given proper ministerial directives in regard to Croatian terrorism.

* Pending the full report on the operations of **ASIO** and its relations with the executive government which the Attorney-General intends to present to Parliament during this session, the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO** will operate mainly from Canberra.

* In the past there has been inadequate co-operation between **ASIO** and the Commonwealth Police in areas where their operations overlapped.

* This has often meant that **ASIO** has not been supplied with information which bears on matters of national security.

* The only member of **ASIO**, or the only person whom I know to be a member of **ASIO**, with whom I have had any communication since the AttorneyGeneral's visit to the headquarters of the organisation in Melbourne on 16th March has been the Director-General himself.

* It would have been easier simply to remove the clause altogether than to characterise it as requiring some unlawful connotation before **ASIO** could become involved.

* I strongly urge the Committee to reject this amendment and certainly not to curcumscribe this clause in such a way that would prevent **ASIO** from protecting our defence forces in the role they have to carry out for us all.

* Because the conspiracy which he said stimulated  Senator Murphy's  police raid on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was shared by the Prime Minister's own Department and his other Department, Foreign Affairs, and principally supported by the Attorney-General's Department, why was **ASIO** rather than the other departments singled out for the spectacular raid?

* Given that the Department of Foreign Affairs had the dominant role in the alleged plot, as read out by the Prime Minister yesterday in an excerpt from an **ASIO** document, and given the seriousness which he ascribed to it as a conspiracy, why did not  Senator Murphy  bring the matter immediately to his attention rather than allow him to hear about it by other means after the event, on his own acknowledgment, and after it had been widely reported?

* Why did  Senator Murphy  attempt to obtain the information he felt he needed by this method rather than by proper administrative means and in doing so avoid a charade and preserve the viability of **ASIO**?

* Did the present Minister for Labor and Immigration state on 17 September 1 972, with the authority of the present Prime Minister, that in order to give citizens protection against possible unjust or inaccurate use of **ASIO** reports a Labor Government would establish an administrative court of appeals to review administrative decisions, decisions made on security grounds, to lay down regulations governing the conduct of members of **ASIO** and other security organisations and to hear, determine and report to Parliament on the breach of any such regulations.

* **ASIO** would need to know that an unlawful act was being committed before it could even keep the activity of that group of people under surveillance.

* Quite obviously **ASIO** has to have the authority to keep under surveillance activities, lawful or unlawful, which are directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions.

* I think it is quite clear then that if one limits **ASIO**'s surveillance capacity to activities which are unlawful in themselves, then one seriously circumscribes, inhibits and limits its capacity to act in the interests of the nation.

* The purpose of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill is to provide that the recently appointed Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,  Mr Justice  Woodward, should continue to enjoy the rank and status that he enjoyed as a judge prior to his appointment as the Director of **ASIO** and in all respects to preserve his position having regard to his previous judicial status.

* I would like to take the opportunity of wishing the new Director of **ASIO** well in his very important and sensitive task.

* The Opposition, whilst it will not oppose the third Bill- of course it cannot oppose the administrative changes which have brought about a transfer of control over **ASIO** from the Attorney-General to the Prime Ministernonetheless is curious as to why this has occurred.

* One is prompted to inquire why the Prime Minister finds it necessary to transfer administrative control over **ASIO** and authority to tap telephones from the Attorney-General to himself.

* I saw the report of the meeting of 2nd March which the **ASIO** representative had made on 5th March.

* The point is that the Opposition would deny to **ASIO** the opportunity to keep under surveillance a person committing an act which does not constitute an illegal act.

* I think that in the exercise of common sense one would say that **ASIO** ought to have the authority to keep under surveillance a person who is engaging in an activity which falls short of an unlawful act but which is directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the functions of the Defence Force.

* The clause gives authority to **ASIO** to keep under surveillance people who are engaging in this kind of activity.

* The Government undertakes, in the **ASIO** legislation, to consult with the Leader of the Opposition.

* If that had been the interpretation in the **ASIO** legislation the Opposition would have been cock-a-hoop at that prospect.

* The Opposition argues that the Leader of the Opposition needs further power to be involved in **ASIO** to give the Opposition some insight into **ASIO**'s operation.

* We of the Opposition have no confidence in the people in **ASIO** who will have to make the judgment.

* Mr Justice  Hope made a damning indictment of **ASIO**'s past activities when he said:   .

* I must report that I saw little evidence in **ASIO** that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognised, or available in any large measure.

* There is evidence to show that **ASIO** has in the past provided selected people with security intelligence material for publication.

* It seems to have been **ASIO**'s intention that the material be not attributed to it.

* A propaganda activity of this kind by **ASIO** is a misconceived enterprise.

* That illustrates the track record of **ASIO**.

* It is little wonder that we of the Opposition do not trust the objectivity of **ASIO**'s agents when we look at that sort of material which has been written by the learned Justice Hope and, I add, the report on which this legislation is based.

* I think that that is applicable to **ASIO** of Australia in the twentieth century.

* We cannot trust these people in **ASIO** to make subjective definitions of a word such as 'hatred'.

* -There is no truth in  Mr Booker's  allegations which were cited in the  National Times  of 27 February and which were to the effect that he was forced into retirement and that **ASIO** reports were used for that purpose.

* There is no truth in the allegation that **ASIO** reports were made on  Mr Booker.

* All I will say on this matter- this has already been indicated by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government- is that the circumstances in which **ASIO** reports will now be made available is pursuant to the recommendations of  Mr Justice  Hope.

* All I will say in regard to  Mr Booker,  apart from denying that **ASIO** reports were used against him, is to reiterate what I said once before about him, and that is that he was not forced to retire on any ground at all.

* The headline in today's  Daily Mirror  reads: 'Australia's Watergate', 'Gough's files raided by **ASIO**'.

* After 'Australia 's Watergate', 'Gough's files raided by **ASIO**', the article states: 
Security sources in Canberra say **ASIO** agents entered the premises at night and forced open a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam.

* Mr David  Combe, the Australian Labor Party national secretary, is reported as having said 'the **ASIO** link did not surprise him'.

* It is their belief and the belief of a lot of people in Australia that **ASIO** is involved in political affairs.

* Speaking on behalf of honourable members on this side of the House there have been no allegations by the leadership of this Party that **ASIO** should be used by governments in political matters, particularly against other political parties.

* I know that individual honourable members can make allegations against governments, against **ASIO** and against other security forces operating in Australia but never has the Labor Party used this subject in the way that the Government is using it now.

* It is clear from the statement I made and the answer I gave to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the **ASIO** report from which 1 quoted was a wrong report.

* Because of my action it is clear now - it has been discovered, it has been reported, it has been reported to me and to other ministerial heads and it has been reported to the Parliament - that the **ASIO** report was wrong and therefore we now know that there was no conspiracy.

* If it is possible that the **ASIO** officer misunderstood what was said, what do the other departments - Foreign Affairs, Attorney-General's and the other members of the interdepartmental committee - say?

* How can a possibly incorrect report by an **ASIO** officer support the raid on the Melbourne office to preserve information as both the Prime Minister and  Senator Murphy  have claimed?

* Is it not clear that  Senator Murphy  believed there had been a correct report by the **ASIO** officer to the extent of dispatching 27 police officers to **ASIO** headquarters to close all the safes and enclose all staff as they came on duty?

* The question is this: Unless there was a conspiracy - the term used by the honourable gentleman yesterday - what justification was there for  Senator Murphy's  raid on the Melbourne headquarters of **ASIO**?

* If it was possible that the **ASIO** officer misunderstood what was said at the meeting, what do representatives who were present from other departments - Foreign Affairs, Attorney-General's and Prime Minister's - say was said?

* How can a possibly incorrect report by the **ASIO** officer support the raid to preserve information, which is the reason given by  Senator Murphy  and the Prime Minister for the raid on the Melbourne headquarters?

* I do not know what is in **ASIO** files.

* I of course have never seen them, but I know that there is another side to the picture, and it would be surprising indeed if it were not in **ASIO** files.

* It transpired during the course of the interview that the third party with the two Immigration officials was allegedly an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation agent and that this **ASIO** agent informed  Mr Vorstman  that if he was prepared to become an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - that is an informer on the Communist Party, on political activity and on general radical movements in the community - this would favourably influence the outcome of his application for Australian citizenship.

* But it would be even more undesirable that an **ASIO** agent in company with officials of the Department of Immigration should be in a position to say to  Mr Vorstman  or to any other person seeking Australian citizenship that although he was having difficulty and had been having difficulty for some time in obtaining Australian citizenship a more favourable attitude might very well develop on the part of officialdom if that person became an informer for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

* Departments who participated in the interdepartmental committee were Attorney-General's, Business and Consumer Affairs, Health, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Administrative Services (Commonwealth Police), **ASIO**, Prime Minister's and Cabinet and Home Affairs.

* Therefore it is essential that the activities of **ASIO** should be subject to continuous scrutiny through periodic judicial review.

* In the wake of the tragic bomb explosion at the Sydney Hilton Hotel far too many people have rushed eagerly in to use that unfortunate mishap as justification for the past activities of **ASIO** and the State special branches.

* Until the Canberra dinner he had been almost completely silent on the matter, but now he has not only backed the  Senator (and  his posse of Commonwealth police) but has forecast a- major restructuring of **ASIO**.

* We are fully in accord with the principles of **ASIO** provided its operation relates to our needs.

* As to the part of the honourable gentleman's question relating to **ASIO**, it has been a constant practice, ever since the Australian Labor Party was in government in the long distant past, that we do not answer questions relating to **ASIO** in this House, and I have no intention whatsoever of giving the honourable gentleman any information at all relating to the operations of this organisation.

* What is **ASIO** for?

* Perhaps this is where having a judge as Director-General of **ASIO** would be particularly appropriate.

* **ASIO** is an intelligence organisation without executive power.

* The responsibility for security within a government department when it is advised by the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**, rests with the department.

* Unfortunately, the conditions of the appointment of the Director-General of **ASIO** appointed in 1970 contained an expression that 'misconduct included .

* This unfortunate wording in the conditions of service of the Director-General appointed in 1970 were used by former  Senator Murphy  as the authority for his most regrettable raid on **ASIO** and other activities of a similar nature by the former Labor Government.

* He, I think, is entirely suitable for the job, but I do not agree with the concept that the job of Director-General of **ASIO** should always be held by a judicial officer.

* The reason for this is that the Director-General of **ASIO** works in a highly specialised field, and there are 2 aspects to it.

* But that is not all or even the most important part of the job of Director-General of **ASIO**.

* There has been one occasion previously when a judge was the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* In my view the administration of **ASIO** during those years suffered from a lack of direction and control at the top and a number of highly undesirable practices crept in over those years through that lack of control.

* We must be quite sure that the man we appoint as Director-General of **ASIO** is capable of controlling and directing its organisation in detail.

* For reasons I have already advanced to the House I am very strongly opposed to those controls being ministerial under the aegis of the Government because this brings out the opportunity for secret political directives being given to **ASIO** and **ASIO** being exploited for improper political motives.

* i think we should look very carefully at whether it is possible to have bi-partisan control from this House with a small number of members monitoring the activities of **ASIO**.

* If we set up an organisation in this House to monitor **ASIO** we must ensure that we do it in a sensible way and that we do not do harm to and hamper the purpose for which the Organisation is set up.

* I believe that the Director-General of **ASIO** is in such an important position that he must have a fixed term of office non-renewable.

* I would say that after 5 years or perhaps longer the appointment of Director-General of **ASIO** should lapse and a new person should be appointed.

* We must never allow a Director-General of **ASIO** to reach that position.

* On the whole we have to rely on the integrity and independence of a Director-General of **ASIO**.

* I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that this independence so clearly laid down by this House will not be abridged by secret terms and conditions of appointment because the independence of the Director-General of **ASIO** isperhaps paradoxically- the key to our individual rights and liberty.

* I must report that I saw little evidence in **ASIO** that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognised, or available in any large measure.

* I do not think that the whole course of **ASIO** has been changed since  Mr Justice  Hope made those remarks.

* In **ASIO**, which we are not just creating but strengthening in its own work rather than in the nation's work, we are likely to be marching down a path that will perpetuate injustices and probably compound them.

* **ASIO** itself was created out of a particular problem at a particular time in the late 1940s.

* Mr David Combe, who is of course the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party, is also quoted in the  Daily Mirror  of today 's date as saying that the **ASIO** link did not surprise him.

* That is an allegation that **ASIO** broke into the Labor Party headquarters in January 1976.

* It is designed to incorporate in this legislation guidelines similar to those contained in the **ASIO** legislation.

* But, we say that it is an offence for an **ASIO** officer to disclose information unless he does so in a specified way on the authority of the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**.

* In the 'National Times' of 19th March of this year, a Robert Mayne, who I understand is Associate Editor of the 'SunHerald' in Sydney, wrote an article on how **ASIO** exceeds its charter.

* In that article he claimed that he was approached by a New South Wales Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly, who was later shown to be  Mr Peter  Coleman, and a senior officer of **ASIO** to edit a magazine called 'Analysis'.

* The article stated that the **ASIO** officer had offered to give him information to help to discredit ALP members and that in fact this information was given to him and it is at present in the possession of the 'Herald' organisation; that  Mr Coleman  had said at the interview that he had access to **ASIO** information and used it in the New South Wales Parliament and in articles he wrote - J assume for the 'Bulletin' for which he was writing at that stage.

* I think this is a terrible thing for **ASIO** to do.

* I think it is important for this Government to have a departmental inquiry to find out who that **ASIO** officer was.

* He is certainly not a person who should be employed in **ASIO** if he is prepared to become involved in Australian party politics.

* I think even the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  with whom I often disagree, would agree that it is not the job of **ASIO** to get involved in arguments inside Australian political parties.

* In addition, it is necessary for our Government to indicate clearly to **ASIO** that it is not **ASIO**'s job to get involved in any sort of politics.

* I would object to it just as much if it were done the other way around - if information were leaked by **ASIO** to some newspaper run by the Australian Labor Party or a newspaper supporting our point of view.

* I would not agree to the providing of information obtained from **ASIO** files linking members of the present Opposition with, for example, the Rhodesian Government or the Rhodesian Information Centre.

* Do they not understand anything at all about **ASIO**?

* Clause 1 7, which dennes the function of **ASIO**, makes it clear that its function is to collect intelligence in order to advise governments.

* **ASIO** is not, as clause 17 (2) makes clear, a law enforcement agency.

* On that basis the Opposition says that the Attorney-General should be responsible to a parliament for all the information under his control and he should be entitled to all **ASIO** records.

* Has the Prime Minister had any conversation or conversations with the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation,  Mr Barbour,  in which he, the Prime Minister, raised the possibility that a judge could be appointed as the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO** in place of  Mr Barbour?

* If there were a sudden increase or decrease in the number of people employed by **ASIO** I think it is important that the Parliament should know about it.

* The Parliament should be entitled to ask questions about **ASIO** in relation to general issues and the sort of work it is doing.

* That is nearly up to the standard of **ASIO**, in relation to which the appropriation and the expenditure are exactly the same.

* Altogether, there has been an increase of 35 per cent on the 1977-78 allocation for **ASIO**.

* We have a new head of **ASIO**.

* But the legislation does provide for the Leader of the Opposition to be regularly briefed on the operations of **ASIO** .

* and that is why we have provided for the Leader of the Opposition to be given as much information about **ASIO** as he seeks.

* If we are going to get as much information about **ASIO** as we seek, we should get the lot.

* So imbued with office was he that he gathered around him a group of policemen and he invaded **ASIO** headquarters.

* I wonder what would have been the consequences for  Senator Murphy  if we had had the human rights legislation on the statute books before he invaded **ASIO**.

* He knew that the Commonwealth Police believed that there had been lack of co-operation and a failure in information exchange with **ASIO**.

* Officers of my own Department of Foreign Affairs had also repeatedly complained of the lack of co-operation and information exchange with **ASIO**.

* **ASIO** was concerned.

* His visits to **ASIO** headquarters in Canberra and Melbourne were designed to achieve just that, and they did achieve just that.

* We will have in **ASIO** a body that is similar to the Central Intelligence Agency.

* However, in this country **ASIO** is reaching much lower depths.

* The next action that this Government is likely to take is to have **ASIO** tap the telephones of the pensioners to see what they are talking about with their children.

* I preface my question to the Prime Minister by saying that the honourable gentleman will recall that one of the reasons for rejecting a royal commission or judicial inquiry into what has become known as the **ASIO** affair was that it would, to use his own words, destroy the last vestiges of whatever reputation the previous Government and surviving members of it might possibly have.

* Does the Prime Minister recall that it was during the ides of March 1973 that the then Attorney-General made his famous **ASIO** raid and that it was during the ides of March 1974 that the same person made an awful mess of the Gair affair?

* In view of the fact that the previous method of telephone tapping by **ASIO** required the Attorney-General's permission, will the Prime Minister consider that this principle should apply also to the use of laser beams?

* Honourable members will recall that when we were debating the **ASIO** Bill and Telecommunications (Interception) Bills we proposed amendments to both Bills.

* I reiterate that the Opposition opposed the **ASIO** Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill and moved a number of amendments.

* In respect of the Customs Amendment Bill there is a need for the Opposition clearly to indicate that although our amendments to the **ASIO** Bill and the Telecommunications (Interception) Bill in respect of accountability, warrants, annual reports and the question of the Leader of the Opposition being fully briefed on all matters were not accepted the same arguments apply to this Bill.

* Material before me establishes that there have at times been departures by **ASIO** from .

* On page 127 of his report he cited the occasions on which **ASIO** had leaked information for political purposes to members of the public.

* There are instances where **ASIO** has leaked information for political purposes to members or supporters of the government of the day.

* I suppose that every member of this Parliament, on looking back at the record of **ASIO**, is aware of some circumstance in which the rights and the liberties of the ordinary Australian citizen have been abridged to some extent by these actions.

* Because that country has laws similar to those this Government intends to inflict on the Australian people by this **ASIO** legislation.

* I think it was mentioned only once in this Parliament or in the Australian Press, when **ASIO** was under debate here some time ago, that the **ASIO** headquarters in Melbourne was visited by, I think, Richard Helms, the head of the CIA in the United States.

* I would like this Parliament to know how much **ASIO** pays to informants.

* It is the kindred body of **ASIO**.

* In February 1961 the CIA kindred body to **ASIO** sent a box of Castro's favorite cigars which was contaminated and delivered by a CIA agent to Cuba.

* There have been similar failures by **ASIO** in Australia.

* The article continues: 
**ASIO** would fail also, despite the deprivation of the freedom of the people which is provided for in the legislation now before the Parliament - and the war came as a surprise to unprepared Washington.

* Given that 80 per cent of the information that goes into finished intelligence reports is from sources such as scientific and technical journals, political speeches and other public documents- I emphasise that it comes from all public documents- it is not surprising that **ASIO** stuffed it up.

* What do we know of **ASIO**'s activities?

* We know that it is the policy of the CIA to help local services, which in this case is **ASIO**.

* We know that **ASIO** activities involve having surveillance teams for following persons in the streets, observation posts to observe the comings and goings in buildings, multiple forms of photography, access to statistics, police files and information on airline, rail and shipping passengers.

* **ASIO** can no longer have any respect as a result of  Mr Justice  Hope's disclosures last week.

* He had the report available while the telephone tapping debate and the debate of extension of powers to **ASIO** was going on.

* It said that **ASIO** had shown improper preference in the purchase of equipment, that its counter-espionage was neglected and that it lacked co-operation with other institutions.

* I stress the term 'low grade operatives' because there is a tendency when speaking of **ASIO** to feel that all is well because it has a DirectorGeneral of integrity in  Mr Justice  Woodward.

* He said again this morning on the radio program  A.M.  that he knew of occasions when **ASIO** went beyond its charter.

* So we know for a fact by the process of judicial audit, if one likes to put it that way, that **ASIO** has been overly concerned and has exhibited political bias.

* I believe that we need to remove the word 'ultimately' from paragraph (a) of subclause (1) of clause 5 because, as I said at the outset, it would at least put some pressure back on to **ASIO** to be more careful when it handles, when it deals with and when it acts under all the inferences contained in this rather wide-ranging definition of the word 'subversion'.

* The **ASIO** charter is contained in the **ASIO** Act Some of the Organisation's functions require that officers are posted abroad.

* In all cases they are declared to the host Government In particular, **ASIO** has a charter 'To co-operate with such departments and authorities of other countries as are capable of assisting the Organisation in the performance of its functions'.

* Any activities of **ASIO**, at home or abroad, are carried out within the terms of its charter.

* Is it a fact that the **ASIO** officer concerned has none of these rights?

* Has the Government deliberately chosen the **ASIO** representative as the most convenient scapegoat to hide the Government's own duplicity in this affair?

* The Bill provides for the official title of the head of **ASIO** to be changed from 'DirectorGeneral' to 'Director'.

* This will allow the court to operate at its full strength during the period of  Mr Justice  Woodward's appointment with **ASIO**, which is for 7 years.

* Secondly, the Bill provides for consequential amendments of the principal Act arising from the change in title of the head of **ASIO**.

* It was not illegal for me to have attended that party meeting, but in later years I attended meetings of another kind which led to my being under surveillance by **ASIO**.

* From two separate sources I was informed that I was on the files of **ASIO**.

* His  brother-in-law worked in **ASIO** and he had, of course, breached the confidentiality of his job by informing my partner of certain information.

* He informed me gently that **ASIO** did not really think I was a communist but that they were warning me that they were keeping an eye on me.

* Nevertheless there was no doubt in my mind that my name got onto the files of **ASIO** in those days.

* That estate agent's staff was instructed by a member of **ASIO** to report to **ASIO** on whoever made bookings for the hall and when the bookings were made.

* When I made inquiries from the rental agent and from the police station I found that on the Friday prior to that first dance being held an officer of **ASIO** stationed in Newcastle had been sent to the letting agent to find out who had rented the hall, the address of whoever rented the hall and what that person was doing.

* If that is all the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has to do in this nation and if that is why we provided $7.8m this financial year, then it is about time that **ASIO** members went back to school.

* It is not so very long since we debated at length in this House and in the Senate- if I recall correctly we debated for over 50 hours- legislation introduced by the Government to replace earlier legislation establishing **ASIO**, to establish the responsibility between the Director-General of **ASIO** and the Attorney-General and to give the Parliament an appropriate measure of control over the activities of **ASIO**.

* It was this Government which substantially accepted the report of  Mr Justice  Hope from an inquiry into **ASIO** instituted by the former Government.

* That cannot in any way be a dereliction of duty but rather in the strongest possible way the carrying out of the responsibility of the Government towards **ASIO** in the face of the recommendations by  Mr Justice  Hope.

* It provides for an extensive measure of ministerial and parliamentary control of the activities of **ASIO**.

* I simply point out that the legislation requires the Director-General to report periodically to the Leader of the Opposition so that there may be a truly bipartisan approach to the activities of **ASIO**.

* We have had extensive debate on the **ASIO** legislation.

* I move: 
The use of the drug issue to grant **ASIO** telephone taps is not therefore a promising precedent.

* The amendment in relation to the tapping of telephones for drug offences in this Bill has no relevance to **ASIO** powers.

* The Bill asks the Parliament to take **ASIO** absolutely on trust.

* In our amendment we ask whether it is fair enough for **ASIO** to be prepared to take on trust the alternative Prime Minister of the day- the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  in this Parliament- and to give the alternative Prime Minister the same right to be informed as the Attorney-General or the appropriate Minister of the day.

* If the Parliament is expected to take **ASIO** on trust when we know little or nothing about its operating methods or how it goes about its business, then **ASIO** ought to be prepared to go to at least some length and take the alternative Prime Minister of this nation on trust.

* **ASIO**, will the Prime Minister table the terms and conditions as soon as he possibly can this afternoon?

* Above all we need to inquire into the question of why one man - one **ASIO** representative^ - has been made a scapegoat for this affair.

* Let us ask the Attorney-General when he comes before us whether this man has been treated in such a way because the laws relating to public service inquiry do not apply to **ASIO** personnel and therefore he would not have the same right of protest as any other public servant who attended that meeting would have.

* I feel that in recent weeks we have, seen something approaching- 
Australia's Watergate '-Gough's Files Raided by **ASIO**!

* Security sources in Canberra say **ASIO** agents entered the premises at night and forced a filing cabinet crammed with documents from the office of the former Prime Minister,  Mr Whitlam.

* Mr David Combe, the ALP national secretary, said the **ASIO** link did not surprise him.

* The second proposal is that there ought to be regular periodic judicial auditing to ensure that **ASIO** is complying with its charter, that it is not infringing civil liberties and that it is operating efficiently and effectively.

* Thirdly, there is a contention by the Opposition that the Minister, or the Parliament through the Minister, should be fully informed about the activities of **ASIO**, not just in respect of the matters to which he directs inquiries but all matters.

* We propose that the Leader of the Opposition at any time, the alternative 
Prime Minister of the country, should be periodically briefed on all aspects of **ASIO**.

* We then propose that there should be proper financial accountability by **ASIO**.

* Why exclude **ASIO** from that well established practice?

* The Opposition does not oppose the existence of **ASIO**.

* It is in this context that this Government's uncompromising attitude towards the **ASIO** Bills should be viewed.

* The **ASIO** legislation runs directly contrary to overseas trends.

* The Fraser Government has decided to place virtually no legal limit on the activities of **ASIO**, and that is where the Opposition falls out with the Government.

* Instead of following the United States example and limiting the powers of **ASIO** and at least making it accountable to this Parliament and to the people, the Fraser Government has decided to do the opposite and to extend the powers of the Organisation.

* As  Mr Justice  Hope warned: 
In summary, let me say that the Opposition rejects this **ASIO** Bill because it places **ASIO** beyond ministerial responsibility.

* Section 8 of this legislation for the first time empowers the Director-General of **ASIO**- who, after all, is a public servant- to override the Minister who, to all intents and purposes, is elected by the people.

* The Minister in charge of **ASIO** does not have ministerial authority over the actions of the Director-General in the crucial areas relating to who should be investigated and who should get the information.

* The Opposition also objects to a wide range of activity- phone tapping surveillance, the entering of premises, et cetera- in which **ASIO** will be legally able to engage because of the definition of 'subversion' in the Bill.

* The phrase 'likely ultimately to involve or lead to, the use of force or violence or other unlawful acts' is so wide as to permit **ASIO** to involve itself in gathering information on, spying on, et cetera, any individual on the basis that that individual is associated with, comes in contact with, or in the past associated with a person who is the subject of surveillance.

* The Director-General's annual report on **ASIO**'s expenditure and activities need not be presented to Parliament.

* The Labor Party believes that **ASIO**'s annual report should be tabled each year and should contain, in broad terms, information such as the number of warrants issued by the Attorney-General or the Director-General for telephone tapping, mail interception and house entering.

* It should also contain an audit of **ASIO**'s expenditure for the year.

* The 1979 Budget gives **ASIO** $ 14.2m, and the Australian Security Intelligence Service $8.3m.

* Members of the Liberal Party in the Senate were of the opinion that some check should be placed on **ASIO** in this area.

* However, the Government has made only the trivial concession of allowing the Leader of the Opposition access to **ASIO**'s annual report.

* So partisan was the original legislation that the Parliamentary Opposition Leader- the alternative Prime Minister of this country- was not even - 
-Well, at any time the alternative Prime Minister of this country is not even to be consulted or informed on security matters, or to be given the opportunity to express an opinion on future appointments to the position of Director-General of **ASIO**.

* No country in the world would put a public servant in such an onerous position at this Government proposes to do in respect of the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* He has refused to answer many questions that I have asked him concerning the simple proposition: Why did the Attorney-General attack **ASIO** headquarters in Canberra?

* Why this unusual act of the Attorney-General going into and torpedoing **ASIO**?

* The action of going to **ASIO** has spread terror and fear amongst the whole Yugoslav community in Australia and that fear is spreading further to all new Australians.

* At present there seems to be an inconsistency between what the Attorney-General has said in the Senate- that he told the Prime Minister all the related facts about the **ASIO** raid - and the facts that the Prime Minister has told this House and the Press outside this House.

* I think that **ASIO** ought to be prepared to take criticism.

* It is extremely important that, in a political sense, criticisms of **ASIO** are not treated necessarily as being attacks on the Government.

* There is no necessity for the whole of the weight of a government to be used to defend **ASIO** or a police force against what may be legitimate criticism, as happened in New South Wales.

* I would hope never to see a situation in this House in which we could not criticise the head of **ASIO**.

* Criticism of the head of **ASIO** should not be prevented in this House because that head is a judge who has been transferred to that position.

* He said that **ASIO** was supported by the Labor Government both when in government and when in Opposition.

* Too frequently we tend to think in terms of **ASIO** being an organisation of people hiding behind posts and in corners and trying to find out what they can about the character of different people.

* I accept the fact that people given a responsibility in an organisation such as **ASIO** do not investigate or perhaps spy upon a person's private life in areas where there is no necessity to do so in the interests of the safety and security of the country.

* However, I have said that one of the areas of concern- perhaps that is putting it a little too strongly is the transfer of the control of **ASIO** from the AttorneyGeneral to the Prime Minister.

* Today he and the  President  of the Labor Party are suggesting a break-in by **ASIO**.

* So,  Mr Combe's  colleague,  Mrs Marks,  assumes not that **ASIO** had taken the papers but that a Labor Party staffer had taken them.

* It is a most serious charge to suggest that **ASIO** has been acting in the interests of a political party or at the direction of any political force in this country.

* I point out to the House that we have spoken to  Mr Mahoney,  the Director-General in charge of **ASIO** at the time.

* There is evidence to show that on 10 November 1975, the day before the GovernorGeneral dismissed the Whitlam Government, a cable was sent from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation liaison officer in Washington to the Director-General of **ASIO** in Canberra conveying a message from the head of the East- Asia Division of the CIA, a  Mr Shackley.

* The CIA was also apparently concerned with the activities of **ASIO**.

* The CIA was also apparently concerned with the then government shakeup of **ASIO** and other intelligence services in Australia.

* The Director-General of **ASIO**,  Mr Peter  Barbour, had been shunted off to New York as Consul-General and the head of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service,  Mr T.  W. Robinson, had been sacked.

* **ASIO** had been an embarrassment to the Whitlam Government, and in view of the close liaison between the CIA, **ASIO** and ASIS it would be true to say that the CIA had become an embarrassment to the Whitlam Government, and the CIA was aware of this.

* It is an outrageous allegation because, among other things, the honourable member would know that the present practice of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Attorney-General in relation to parliamentary questions concerning **ASIO** is not to comment, that is, neither to confirm nor to deny any allegations or presumed allegations.

* Paragraph 781, at page 259, under the heading 'Parliamentary Responsibility' in the recommendations of that same volume, states: 
That the present practice, whereby the Prime Minister and the Minister administering the **ASIO** Act do not confirm or deny any allegations, or presumed allegations, in respect of **ASIO**, continue in force.

* I should however point out that the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  has already had a number of briefings by the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* As to the other allegations concerning the conduct of **ASIO** and  His  Honour  Mr Justice  Murphy, it is a matter of rehashing what was a great political scandal at the dme.

* Furthermore, the Opposition directly seeks to intrude politics and political considerations into the operations of **ASIO**.

* The Government believes that the general power of direction given to the Attorney-General in clause 8 of the Bill, meeting as it does the longstanding philosophy, does provide the Parliament through the ministerial responsibility of the Attorney-General with a safeguard to watch over the affairs of **ASIO** together with the other safeguards that are built into the exercise of special powers, the requirement of an annual report and the requirement of regular consultation and briefings with the Leader of the Opposition.

* It also legalises many previously illegal activities pursued by **ASIO** which were exposed in the Hope report.

* But I believe also that because the Hope report precedes all of this legislation, it ought to be seen also as morally fraudulent because it identifies problems and then relies on **ASIO** to reform itself from within.

* I was saying that the conclusions of the Hope report were inadequate and, since these introductory clauses also follow the Hope conclusion through, the legislative controls over **ASIO** will also be seen to be inadequate.

* The very nature of the **ASIO** beast ensures that security will remain a matter of subjective definition.

* **ASIO** lives in the shadows of overseas multinationals that control Australia and the structure of the society which incorporates the **ASIO** creature must be retained if **ASIO** is to survive.

* So **ASIO** will always oppose political and social change, because such a change challenges its very existence.

* If one reads the Hope report one will see that  Mr Justice  Hope was not at all impressed by the calibre of the **ASIO** agents who would be seen to exercise judgment.

* As I have said, if honourable members read the Hope report they will see that  Mr Justice  Hope did not have any confidence in the ability of employees of **ASIO** to reach such judgments.

* That is why, during the late 1960s and early 1970s we had the spectacle of **ASIO** agents placing under surveillance people who marched in anti-Vietnam demonstrations- clergymen, academics and trade union leaders- because in their judgment those actions were ultimately bound to lead to threats against security and constituted subversion.

* When the record of **ASIO** agents is considered, I suggest that one can have no confidence in their judgment on these matters.

* I think this is an important matter to appreciate when we are talking about **ASIO**.

* I simply say to the honourable member for Cunningham  (Mr West)  that **ASIO** is not a foreign beast like the KGB or even the Central Intelligence Agency.

* Let me also remind him that **ASIO** began under the charter of Prime Minister Chifley in 1949.

* All along the way the Parliament of this country has been improving, strengthening and tightening the framework of **ASIO**.

* Subversion necessarily being a matter of judgment, as the honourable member for Lilley has pointed out, one cannot limit the judgment of **ASIO** to conduct presently being committed.

* We believe, as the Hope Commission did, that any body or any organisation which believes in or has a commitment to the use of force or violence at some future stage, even though it may not be engaged in such activities at the moment or may not intend to engage in them in the near future, for the purpose of overthrowing the constitutional government of the country, should be regarded as subversive and therefore should be capable of being kept under surveillance by the **ASIO**.

* As with all the clauses in the **ASIO** Bill, there is a question of judgment on the part of **ASIO** as to what is considered subversive under this particular clause.

* I am bound to say that some real progress might have been made in apprehending the culprits in respect of the Hilton Hotel outrage if our security organisations had been doing their job instead of acting as professional snoopers on people who are concerned to express their rights as citizens in the community and take political positions and attitudes which do not necessarily agree with those of the government of the day or the people who adopt the standards that apply in **ASIO**.

* I have not been able to determine accurately what proportion of adverse and qualified assessments resulted in action prejudicial to the persons the subjects of the assessments because it has not always or uniformly been the practice of employer authorities which receive **ASIO**'s security assessments to inform **ASIO** of the decision they reach after consideration of those assessments.

* **ASIO**'s function in the provision of security assessments is advisory only.

* However, I am informed by the Director-General of Security that it is unlikely that more than one or two people in the last three years have been rejected for employment in the Australian Public Service or for promotion as the result of an adverse **ASIO** report.

* In view of  Senator Murphy's  reluctance and failure to explain in his statement and to reply to repeated questions in another place as to why he raided **ASIO**, and in view of his statement made yesterday that he was not denied information by **ASIO**, will the Prime Minister now respond to repeated requests by the Opposition and the Press to explain to the Parliament and to the Australian people why  Senator Murphy's  action was necessary?

* I believe that as the Prime Minister is the Minister responsible under the Act for **ASIO** he should answer the question.

* I believe that if it is followed by this Committee it will have the effect of taking **ASIO** to an position where it can command the respect and support of the community, because the average member of the community will know that whatever changes of government take place, the Leader of the Opposition, whether he be a member of the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or the National Country Party, will, as a matter of right, be fully informed.

* I had a detailed knowledge of **ASIO**, both as Foreign Minister and as Prime Minister.

* Firstly, I refer to the statement that he made when he implied that **ASIO** may have exceeded its powers and engaged in activities irrelevant to its functions and that it may have impinged upon an individual's right of privacy.

* I want some means to exist by which there can be an oversight of **ASIO**'s operations so as to protect the rights of those individuals and do it well.

* The second point that was made by  Mr Justice  Hope was that **ASIO** had been guilty in the past of departure from its basic functions.

* When I was Prime Minister I had actually to parade the senior man at **ASIO** because he was not making any reports.

* Referring to the general level of political sophistication outside **ASIO** he emphasised that he saw little evidence that the qualities of mind and expertise needed in intelligence assessments were recognised in any large measure.

* I do not believe that any Minister or anyone else should have the right to interfere in that regard, provided **ASIO** acts within the law.

* Neither the late  Mr Chifley  nor the late  Dr Evatt  relied on anything more than one scrap of paper that gave total power to the senior officer of **ASIO**.

* We have had in the Senate an Attorney-General who actually made a raid without a warrant on the **ASIO** offices.

* When I look at the proposed amendments I am alarmed because I believe that if we were to adopt even a quarter of them we would destroy the secrecy of **ASIO** and its power to operate successfully.

* Has his attention been drawn to the statutory declaration by  Mr Robert  Mayne in 'The National Times' of 10 March 1975 that early in 1972 or late in 1971 he had been given 8 or 9 folders with **ASIO** material on individual citizens by  Mr Peter  Coleman, Liberal MLA and editor of 'Quadrant', and  Mr Ernest  O. Redford of **ASIO** for use in a forthcoming magazine for which  Mr Coleman  had registered the name "The Analysis '.

* Did  Mr Coleman,  former editor of 'The Bulletin', receive any of the **ASIO** documents of which 'The Bulletin' published portions in June and July 1974 and of which the Prime Minister released the titles and dates on 2 July 1974.

* They spoke about parliamentary control over **ASIO**.

* Even with the full credit that one can give to the officers of **ASIO**, I say that any organisation which is above the law in the way **ASIO** appears to be above the law until one looks at the terms and conditions of employment of its Director-General, must make mistakes.

* I cannot believe that honourable members who are now in Opposition and who were once in government have not had similar experience of complaints about **ASIO** reports which there was no way of challenging.

* In the time remaining to me I refer to the mistake - the error, if honourable members prefer that word - that was discovered in the minute prepared by the **ASIO** officer concerning the report from the Department of Foreign Affairs.

* In conclusion I say that, if the man in the street outside is listening to this debate, I have no doubt that if he is asked who should run this country, **ASIO** or the Australian Government, he will side with the Australian Government.

* There was no doubt that this organisation existed; no police or **ASIO** report ever questioned that.

* Police and **ASIO** reports confirm that.

* On this occasion there was complete co-operation between **ASIO** and the Commonwealth Police, between **ASIO** and my Department of 
Foreign Affairs, between **ASIO** and the AttorneyGeneral's Department and my own Department.

* When one looks at Division 2 of Part III of the Bill which details the special powers of the Director-General of **ASIO** in respect of the entry of premises, listening devices and the inspection of postal articles, one sees that it is necessary for a warrant to be obtained before those special powers can be exercised and that that warrant must be obtained from and given by the responsible Minister- in this case the Attorney-General.

* Those provisions show the concern of the Government to bring a bipartisan approach to the operation of **ASIO** consistent with the responsibilities of government and with the special nature of the Organisation itself.

* Tonight I want to address some remarks to **ASIO**.

* It was established in days gone by and under another government, but there are features of **ASIO**'s administration which I think require the attention of the Attorney-General  (Senator Greenwood).

* If he is to be appointed to certain positions there is a file on him in **ASIO**.

* If for some  reason  or other there is something against a public servant on the **ASIO** files he is denied promotion, as well as appointments abroad and things of that nature, probably for a lifetime.

* There is no appeal against  it  and as far as I know the public servant concerned is never told the reason for the **ASIO** report.

* All kinds of strange things can happen and we could well find people unjustly treated by an **ASIO** report.

* Whilst one cannot expose to the light of day everything that **ASIO** is doing for the sake of the defence and security of the country, at least there is a case to be made out for a review of its activities, particularly since there has been a great increase in its expenses in recent times without there being, from what I can see, no great increase in efficiency.

* I make these submissions to the Minister not to be critical but in the hope that they will be taken into consideration, particularly as they refer to **ASIO** because in the community today there is a concern over its activities and the fact that there may be files kept on public servants who know little about them and because of which many are suffering.

* Normally, therefore, I would, insofar as the questions concern **ASIO**, decline to answer them.

* The system of vetting, whether by **ASIO** or by a review tribunal, is an inquisitorial procedure rather than an adversary procedure, and requires a flexibility of investigation and judgement which would deny the general application of such a rule.

* It is sufficient reason to overturn accepted norms as to the security of mail, the security of telephones and other elements that we take for granted in private life because the secrecy experts have decided that it is necessary that, for reasons of State it has to be and we simply have to accept it; **ASIO** has its reasons and they must not be questioned?

* As I say, I make an exception in the case of the deity; I am not prepared to make an exception in the case of **ASIO**.

* The Budget provided for an increase of 13% for **ASIO** to enable it, among other things, to take photographs of the pensioners, at over 50c a pop, which is the increase that the Budget gave them.

* We are going to stand up here and solemnly declare that we who are the direct representatives of this democratic society are going to allow ourselves to be treated as inferior to public servants- in effect the faceless people who are nameless and who constitute the Public Service- called **ASIO**.

* I do not trust the Public Service at all and I certainly do not trust **ASIO**.

* **ASIO** is made up, to a very large extent, of people who could not get a living anywhere else except in **ASIO**.

* I have the number of a car which, I am satisfied in my own mind, was used by **ASIO** at a quarter past 12 one day of last week to come down to my place at West Lakes to take pictures of the garage in which some of my precious records are stored.

* I would not put it past **ASIO** to mastermind a Watergate attempt to break into my place and take the records that it feels I should not have.

* The Minister cannot say to **ASIO** after my speech: 'Have you got anything on Cameron?'

* If **ASIO** says 'Yes, we have', the Minister cannot demand that **ASIO** supply Cameron's file to him.

* I say this and I do not say it facetiously: How do members of the coalition know whether they are being spied on by **ASIO**?

* How does any member of the Ministry know that he was not spied on by **ASIO**?

* How does  Senator Withers  know that he was not spied on by **ASIO**, at the behest of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser).

* There is no Minister in this Parliament safe from the prying eyes of **ASIO**.

* The Prime Minister will recall that the Attorney-General, in the context of that Minister's raid on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, has said that it was necessary to seal **ASIO** safes and filing cabinets in order to preserve documents.

* Was there any person or persons in **ASIO** whom the Attorney-General mistrusted, or did the Attorney-General mistrust the Security Service itself?

* The **ASIO** is not a law enforcement agency; it is a security service, and the principle of ministerial responsibility and accountability is appropriate to that area.

* We are concerned that the **ASIO** legislation and the Customs legislation were introduced as a package on the same day.

* This is likely to give the public the wrong impression that the **ASIO** legislation was in some way related to drugs.

* The **ASIO** legislation and the Customs legislation raise very different sorts of considerations.

* We are prepared to support the use of phone taps and listening devices by both **ASIO** and Customs, but according to quite different safeguards.

* Did he authorise  Senator Murphy  to take possession of any goods or property in the possession of **ASIO**, a Commonwealth authority?

* It was working as an arm of **ASIO**.

* If the Minister cannot have this information as to whether files are kept, **ASIO** will keep files on everybody.

* That is the sort of thing which will be done by the **ASIO** forces unless there is some restriction on their activities.

* **ASIO** is listening and says: 'Let us keep a file on him.

* **ASIO** will say: 'Let us keep a file on him'.

* As the honourable member for Lalor  (Mr Barry Jones)  said, most people in **ASIO** must be filing clerks, because it has so many files on people.

* If at any time we say that the Minister shall be informed whether a file is kept on any citizen of this country, there will be pressure on the **ASIO** forces to restrict the number of files that they keep on people.

* The Labor movement will continue to be hounded by the **ASIO** forces.

* **ASIO** will be another group of anti-Labor movement people in this country using the resources of government to harass the Labor movement.

* The green light will be given to **ASIO** by the Bill which has been presented by this Government.

* If these quotations are correct- I would be delighted to show them to the Minister- they bring to question the substance of his remark in relation to precisely what was the position of previous Prime Ministers concerning the powers, responsibilities and authority of the heads of **ASIO**.

* As I mentioned in my speech during the second reading debate, there is no doubt that ever since the days of the establishment of **ASIO** under Prime Minister Chifley the Director-General has been able to act and function as an independent person, outside the normal structure of the Public Service, to report to the Prime Minister on matters of policy and otherwise to report to Ministers in relation to their specific responsibilities.

* It is just that I see a major distinction between the history of **ASIO** and what the Minister has said in this House.

* It was vested in his Attorney-General, by the former Labor Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley,  when he established **ASIO** on March 16, 1949.

* The point we have been trying to emphasise is that whilst under these proposals the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  will take on this power over **ASIO** there will be no one else in this country who will be able to question his decisions or prerogatives.

* Another is that the definitions must not be changed because we must trust **ASIO**.

* I refer first of all to the claim that we should not interfere with those definitions because we have to allow the **ASIO** agents an exercise of judgment.

* Indeed, on this exercise of **ASIO** judgment, even if the Government accepted every amendment proposed by the Opposition, there still would be enormous room for **ASIO** to make judgments.

* What we are arguing on this side is that this Parliament has a responsibility to be as precise as possible in the definition of the functions of **ASIO**.

* So, even if it accepted all our amendments, there still would be a considerable area in which **ASIO** agents could exercise their judgment.

* There is then the issue of trusting **ASIO**.

* However, because there is inadequate supervision provided by this Bill, on the evidence I do not believe that we can trust the **ASIO** agents with the kinds of extensive powers that they are being given in this definition of their functions.

* Why should spending on **ASIO** expand at such a rate when the Government is setting an example by eliminating conspicuous spending?

* They deserve to be put in his own mind and in the minds of Opposition supporters because they concern the substance of the amendments which the Opposition proposes to move, especially the substance of the amendments foreshadowed in respect of the **ASIO** Bill.

* The proposition from members of the Opposition is that they are not opposed to the **ASIO** legislation yet they put forward a multitude of amendments so as to cut off the Organisation 's arms and legs and effectively emasculate it.

* In 1971-72  Senator Murphy  made no threat that when he got into power he would lead a raid on **ASIO**.

* When in 1979 the Opposition says that if it gets into power in 1980 it will not lead a raid on **ASIO**, what guarantee is there that there will not be a repeat of the former circumstance?

* Overseas bodies which dealt with **ASIO** were concerned.

* I merely say that **ASIO** can be killed by a succession of wounds and contradictory amendments.

* We need no more episodes such as Attorney-General Murphy's raid on the **ASIO** headquarters which took place in the Labor Government years.

* The Labor Party's tied vote in the 197 1 Launceston Conference on a motion to reject **ASIO** shows the necessity for independence.

* Certainly, such a raid reveals the necessity for **ASIO**'s independence.

* However, **ASIO** has to be responsible.

* The **ASIO** Bill introduced into the Senate in March of this year has been carefully debated in that House and amended in certain respects as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  has said.

* 185 pages of  Hansard  reporting on the debate in the Senate indicate the awareness of the importance and delicacy of the Bill and the necessity for a non-party political approach to the subject in the interests not only of **ASIO** but also the Australian community.

* None of these is contemplated within our present **ASIO** Bill although I am firmly of the belief that all Australians should be possessed of some form of identification or social security number, as is the situation in the United States, in order to prevent the abuses under our Government's welfare and national health programs, but that is not related to the security of our country.

* The powers that the legislation gives **ASIO** for the tapping of telephones and intercepting mail are not, in themselves, great causes for concern.

* The question is the degree to which people believe that **ASIO** will be made accountable for its actions.

* As I mentioned previously, the Bill provides accountability to the Minister, the Prime Minister and also the Leader of the Opposition but, in some instances, if it appears that security may be breached the reports may not be as full a record of the activities of **ASIO** as some people would want or expect in order to form the accounting judgments that may be necessary.

* Whilst I have read the Bill with the lack of specialised knowledge that a lawyer would have, I feel that the appropriation of funds and staff ceilings protects the continuance and functioning of **ASIO** free from that frustration.

* The Attorney-General did not see fit to contact the head of **ASIO** to discuss with him the questions with which purportedly he is concerned.

* In this House over the last 9 years there have been consistent attempts by members of the Australian Labor Party to express concern at the actions of **ASIO**.

* If the motives of the Attorney-General are only the destruction of **ASIO**, it is essential that we in this place have an opportunity to examine him and to ask why he is proceeding in this manner.

* I submit that if one creates the situation in which the Minister has the right to be informed of the existence of any- and that means all- files, dossiers or records, one immediately politicises **ASIO**, because there would be nothing to prevent any member of the Parliament asking the Minister questions in relation of the Parlian to the names of persons in respect of whom files, dossiers or records were kept.

* In fairness, the Leader of the Opposition was good enough to remind the House that **ASIO** was established under a Labor Government under a Labor Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley.

* The **ASIO** which we have today is, for the first time in its career, getting a statute, a code under which its powers are expressly laid down and under which the citizens of Australia can see exactly what are the powers of **ASIO**.

* I am very conscious of the fact that I have not been able to participate in this debate until now, but I find it a little hard to understand why there has been such wide criticism of this **ASIO** legislation when many of those making the criticism were in a position to bring in a code or a Bill with respect to **ASIO** between 1972 and 1975.

* It will bring **ASIO** into the political arena.

* I would have thought from the very careful remarks in another place by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  and by  Senator Button  leading for the Australian Labor Party, that it was an accepted proposition from both sides of the House that the worst thing that could happen to **ASIO** would be to politicise it.

* I share the views expressed by  Senator Button  in the Senate that **ASIO** must be apolitical and that this legislation must be looked at on a bipartisan basis.

* To agree to this amendment is to write politics into **ASIO**.

* If the Opposition does so it is likely to destroy **ASIO** or destroy its capacity to protect the security of this nation.

* -Briefly, I would like the indulgence of the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr Enderby)  to make it perfectly clear that whilst the Opposition can in no way oppose the altered administrative arrangements under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation, in the event of a change of government it is the intention of a Liberal-National Country Party government to reverse this Government's decision and to return administrative control of **ASIO** to the Attorney-General, for reasons that were adequately canvassed during the course of the debate.

* I stress that these amendments have the intention of attempting to strengthen the power of the Parliament vis-a-vis the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, whereas the purpose of this legislation is to strengthen **ASIO**'s powers visavis the Parliament.

* The Opposition wants to stengthen the standing and the rights of the ordinary citizen vis-a-vis **ASIO**.

* We are trying to attempt to strengthen the processes of the law relative to **ASIO**.

* As I have suggested earlier, there is a serious side to **ASIO** and perhaps a more trivial side to **ASIO**.

* Most of what we know or what leaks out about **ASIO** suggests that **ASIO** in Australia really concentrates very much on easy targets -on targets on street marches, especially in Brisbane, Aboriginal land rights campaigners, pacifists, environmentalists, trade unionists and so on.

* There is abundant evidence, I think, that there is a great deal of collusion between the great international systems and that **ASIO**, MI6, the KGB and the Central Intelligence Agency have more in common with each other than with the democratic system in our own country.

* It could not be said that the Hope report had the effect of destroying **ASIO**.

* Why did the Attorney-General raid **ASIO**?

* On  4  April this year the honourable member for Indi  (Mr Holten)  asked the Prime Minister why  Senator Murphy  raided **ASIO**.

* Did he attempt to discredit **ASIO** so that he would have an excuse to dismantle the organisation?

* Has **ASIO** too much information about certain members of the Australian Labor Party with left wing tendencies?

* Why have certain Ministers not agreed to have certain members of their staffs cleared by **ASIO**.

* What were the files the AttorneyGeneral sealed when he raided the **ASIO** headquarters in Melbourne?

* We were told that it was an **ASIO** official.

* There is a lot built up about Lionel Murphy and the **ASIO** raids.

* Honourable members may recall that on the last occasion when this Bill was debated the right honourable member for Lowe  (Sir William McMahon)  said that when he was Prime Minister he did not once get a report from **ASIO**.

* Let me remind the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, what  Mr Justice  Hope said in relation to the direction and control of **ASIO** and whether Ministers should have access to certain information.

* In paragraph 364 he said: 
However, neither the Minister nor anybody on his behalf would be entitled to seize or to inspect or otherwise to interfere with **ASIO** files holding intelligence except to the extent that the Director-General, having duly considered the matter, comes to the conclusion that the intelligence in a particular file .

* The report of the Hope Commission into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation uses condemnatory words about an excess of power and bureaucratic designs by **ASIO** to show that its officers were capable of detecting crimes that had never been committed and having people wrongly blamed.

* It is worth mentioning what the Hope report said in relation to **ASIO**, particularly that part of it that was quoted by an honourable senator in another place.

* To clear the decks, let me make it clear at the outset that I am not one of those who believe that an organisation such as **ASIO** has no place at all in the Australian context.

* In summary ] put it to the Minister, and I expect him to accept, that the matter I am about to raise is not advanced with any view to obstructing or harrassing **ASIO** but only to ensure that a proper balance is maintained between the duties and functions of the organisation on the one hand and individual rights on the other.

* Essentially the legislation establishes that **ASIO** may tap telephone conversations only upon a warrant of authority from the Attorney-General himself and that the Attorney-General must previously have been satisfied by the Director-General of Security that the issue of such a warrant was justified on the grounds of national security.

* It is this: While the theory and philosophy of the legislation may be unexceptionable the Act is worth nothing if its provisions cannot be properly and adequately supervised, and 1 am concerned that such supervision may not now be possible due to the mechanics of the tapping system which **ASIO** recently adopted.

* It is this latter method of tapping which recently has been installed by **ASIO** in Western Australia, and given the likelihood of uniformity in the Department it would appear reasonable to assume that a similar system has been adopted as well in all other States.

* Attorney-General and in the Post Office and, indeed, in the Security Organisation itself, that we should have not merely an assurance but an absolute guarantee from the Attorney-General that the new mechanics of telephone tapping adopted by **ASIO** will not operate to subvert the authority reposed in him by the Telephonic Communications (Interceptions) Act.

* On how many occasions has **ASIO** sought this permission in each of the past 5 years.

* If permission is not obtained, is it the usual practice for **ASIO** to conduct checks of mail and maintain surveillance of the contents of mail addressed to people in whom it is interested.

* The other extremity is where **ASIO**, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or whatever it is- the law enforcing authority- is so far a law unto itself that it is utterly remote from any kind of political scrutiny whatever.

* There are many people who take the view that politics is a dirty business and that therefore we ought to keep **ASIO** out of politics.

* The reality is that **ASIO** is inevitably in politics.

* I am quite satisfied that the majority of **ASIO**'s employees are not hit men but filing clerks.

* I can imagine the typical **ASIO** worker driving home after a heavy day at the office clipping out editorials from the Melbourne  Age,  the  Sydney Morning Herald  and  Australian Financial Review,  pasting them on sheets of paper, numbering them and stamping them 'SECRET' or 'TOP SECRET'.

* The general rule of classification in **ASIO**, I understand, is that publications with a circulation of between 100,000 and 500,000 are routinely marked SECRET' and those with a circulation of less than 100,000 are marked 'TOP SECRET'.

* I think that we need to know far more about the operations of **ASIO**.

* If a Minister is not answerable in this place, we lose any pretence of democratic control through the Parliament about what is going on in **ASIO**.

* I remember allegations being made in this Parliament by the former Leader of the Opposition, the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden),  and it was obvious from what he said that within an hour of a certain debate taking place in this chamber he got in touch with **ASIO** and asked what it had on its file against the honourable member for Lalor  (Dr J. F. Cairns).

* It is obvious that **ASIO** was being used as a political police force.

* I appreciate some of the remarks of the honourable member for Bradfield, particularly when he said that no Australians want to see this country become a police state, but is was his Party which was close to developing this country, under **ASIO** and  Colonel Spry,  as a police state.

* I know from my previous occupation that many files in **ASIO**- I have never contributed to the compilation of any of them- could and may have wrecked the promotion prospects and the careers of many decent Australian public servants because of the methods that **ASIO** was using at the time of the present Opposition's administration.

* That matter has been lightly treated by the Press and by members of this Parliament, but it amazed me during the last 6 months that it was disclosed by one section of the media and played down considerably when the chief director of the Central Intelligence Agency of the United States had visited Australia and conferred with the administrator of **ASIO**.

* (Quorum formed)  Before the call for the quorum I was informing the House that to the amazement of many Australians the director of the United States CIA was in Australia two or three years ago when the previous Government was in office conferring with the director of **ASIO**.

* That was the way we were drifting, for obvious reasons, when the Director of the American CIA saw fit to come to Australia and confer with the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* The appointment of a judge to administer **ASIO** is something that the Labor Party for many years said it would do when it came into office so that the lives and careers of decent public servants and Australians shall not be put in jeopardy by scurrilous informers who can ruin careers by putting on an **ASIO** file something in respect of which a person has no redress.

* If he was so convinced in his scepticism about the adequacy of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation one would have thought that he would have been able to convince his colleagues to take one certain line, that is, the line he took which suggested that **ASIO** is an organisation unworthy of worry and concern.

* I was even surprised that he wanted to come into the chamber and support the amendment when he was so sceptical about **ASIO** and its adequacy.

* Perhaps he was almost schizophrenic in the way in which he described **ASIO** as being totally ineffective and yet being an organisation that had to be feared in the way in which he described it towards the end of his speech.

* In an article headed Unpleasant **ASIO** facts',  Mrs Joan  Coxsedge puts the view that **ASIO** ought to be able to bring in spies, as it were.

* Her  criticism is in these terms: 
**ASIO** has failed to bring to book a single spy, traitor, saboteur or terrorist.

* It is quite clear that this legislation is designed to create for **ASIO** a charter under which it can carry out its functions with greater certainty than has been possible before.

* He is someone whom I have known as a judge of the Supreme Court of New 
Is it a fact, as alleged on 'Federal File' that the **ASIO** representative at the interdepartmental meeting on 2nd March is not a public servant?

* In so far as the question does not refer to the possible activities of **ASIO**, there have been no official or unofficial contacts between Ministers and officials of the Australian Government and the South African Department of National Security since November 1 975.

* The **ASIO** Bill which is before this House represents one of the most dangerous attacks on democracy that we could ever see in Australia.

* Firstly, I am concerned about the kind of society that will result from the activities of **ASIO** operating under the proposed Act.

* Let us consider what **ASIO** is empowered to do under the proposed Act.

* Under this Act, the functions of 
**ASIO** are to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security and to communicate any such intelligence to the appropriate persons.

* In order to carry out these functions, **ASIO** will be empowered to obtain warrants to allow agents with reasonable grounds for believing that premises require investigation for suspected material: First, to search the premises for the purposes of finding records relevant to that matter and, for that purpose, to open any safe, box, drawer, parcel, envelope or other container in which there is reasonable cause to believe any such records may be found; secondly, to inspect or otherwise examine any records found in the premises and to make copies of transcripts or any record so found that appears to be relevant.

* The discretion to use those powers and to make those interpretations is under the control of the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* It will create the problem that in the name of defending our freedom, **ASIO** will act to restrict our freedom.

* There is no way that the people can call on **ASIO** to account for its actions.

* This measure will worsen the difficulties that are already apparent in **ASIO**'s activities.

* Enough evidence has been put on the record to date of the corruptness of the power used by **ASIO** in the past.

* **ASIO** will have more power than it has even now to become involved in domestic politics and to take sides in political differences in this country.

* It is very difficult to find out just what **ASIO** has done in respect of spies but there is one case history that is worth examining.

* **ASIO**'s ugly sister in New Zealand is SIS, the Security Intelligence Service.

* One wonders what sort of **ASIO** operation might one day be mounted against somebody of the eminence of  Dr Coombs.

* That is the kind of triumphant success story that **ASIO** and its relatives have had.

* In looking at the competence of **ASIO**, I doubt whether **ASIO** could track a bleeding elephant through snow.

* Security services such as **ASIO** seem to have three main functions: Intelligence gathering, intelligence suppression and negative employment.

* I thought that the negative employment agency within **ASIO** could, on the basis of past experience, well be run now or in the future by the Minister for Industry and Commerce  (Mr Lynch)  on a fee-for-service basis.

* With all this talk of spies and the importance of **ASIO** and protecting our way of life, we find over and over again evidence of the CIA and the KGB operating collusively.

* It may happen perhaps once or twice in a lifetime; it would not be something which happens three or four times a month, as we understand is the situation in **ASIO** at the moment.

* This is the logical time- we are all going to break off in a few minutes to go to see  My Brilliant Career- 
I am concerned that such reports have already been issued because I believe that  Mr Justice  Hope went into these matters with a great deal of care and a greaf deal of concern for the civil liberties of Australians, as one would expect, and I would believe that was one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition, in his time, in government appointed  Mr Justice  Hope to examine Australia's security intelligence services- not just **ASIO** but the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Division.

* It needs to be emphasised that in the fourth report concerning **ASIO**  Mr Justice  Hope's basic finding was that Australia needs and should have a security intelligence service to investigate and provide intelligence about threats to the internal security of the nation.

* His  Honour stated: 
I find that Australia faces and has faced, or may face, threats to its internal security and that **ASIO** should investigate espionage, active measures, subversion, sabotage, terrorism, the organisation in Australia of or assistance for violent political activity in foreign countries.

* But on the other hand perhaps it is not surprising that  Mr Hawke,  as  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, is sensitive about more effective **ASIO** operations.

* The Government has no doubt that a more effective and efficient **ASIO** is of fundamental importance to Australia's internal security just as it has no doubt that it needs ASIS and the Defence Signals Division, as the judge also strongly recommended.

* The second was appointing  Mr Justice  Woodward to head **ASIO**.

* But it is quite clear that **ASIO** did not want it described in terms as broad as the definition in this Bill.

* If one also looks at the section of  Mr Justice  Hope's report as to trade unions one will see that it states: 
**ASIO** does not, and properly does not, surveil employer organisations or trade unions as such.

* However, the surveillance by **ASIO** of left-wing radical organisations judged to be subversive or potentially subversive, and of the members of those organisations, has led to **ASIO** obtaining intelligence concerning the activities of trade unions which are controlled by members of those organisations or which the members of those organisations seek to control.

* However, industrial disruption may affect security, and thus properly attract the attention of **ASIO**.

* The upshot of the conclusion by  Mr Justice  Hope is that intelligence collected by **ASIO** could be referred to the Department of Industrial Relations.

* It states that it may be fair enough to collect intelligence on the activities of people within trade unions, but I do not think that our amendment conflicts in any way with what  Mr Justice  Hope said about the communication of intelligence about trade unions or with what **ASIO** said when it put up some definition of subversion to the Royal Commission.

* The Director-General of **ASIO** simply will have to report to the Minister and to the Leader of the Opposition.

* The previous  speaker  advocates that **ASIO** should be fully accountable to the Parliament.

* The very nature of **ASIO**'s duties requires it to work behind the scenes in many an instance.

* I speak as one who recalls very vividly the raid on **ASIO** by  Mr Justice  Murphy.

* The tragedy is that Opposition members had developed such a paranoia over so many years about what **ASIO** supposedly represented, that in Launceston in 1971 the person who was later to be the responsible Minister  (Senator Murphy)  had to defend the very right of a security organisation to exist.

* It was ironic that some two years later he was to lead that early morning raid on the **ASIO** headquarters in Melbourne.

* Indeed, the history of **ASIO** goes back to 1949 when the then Prime Minister sent a letter to  Mr Justice  Reed appointing him Director-General of Security and requesting him to establish and operate a security service.

* How can we review a Bill if we are not to be told anything about **ASIO**.

* I acknowledge that the Organisation, by virtue of clause 5 of the **ASIO** Bill, is to be responsible for ensuring that there are no activities directed to obstructing, hindering or interfering with the performance by the Defence Force of its functions or the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purposes of security or the defence of the Commonwealth.

* In the closing moments of my contribution this evening I make the suggestion that I believe it is desirable for the Director-General of **ASIO** to be made answerable to members of this Parliament.

* If, after consultation in relation to the way in which **ASIO** was working, the group came to the conclusion that **ASIO** was not carrying out its responsibilities in the way in which it should, then instead of talking to the world, to the Parliament and the Press, it should carry out its very high and responsible position by consulting with the Director-General and the Attorney-General.

* It should say: 'Well, really, if **ASIO** is to be a trusted organisation about which we have no fears, things should be done this way and with a little bit less pressure than is presently being applied.'

* The head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation said that the remarks of the Attorney-General were gravely damaging to **ASIO**.

* Certain newspapers have published what purports to be the text of a telex message sent to **ASIO** staff.

* Late on 28 March in Canberra I drafted and issued a telex message to **ASIO** staff.

* When it became apparent that some person or persons outside **ASIO** had access to it, I immediately instituted an investigation within the Organisation.

* Late on 28 March in Canberra I drafted and issued a telex message to **ASIO** staff.

* The Director-General of **ASIO** said that he drafted and issued the telex message on 28 March.

* It is conceivable that the report which the **ASIO** representative made and which I quoted was inaccurate.

* It is possible that the **ASIO** representative misunderstood or misinterpreted what was said by the representative of the Attorney-General's Department and/ or what was said by the representatives of the Foreign Affairs Department.

* The Attorney-General obtained this document from the **ASIO** quarters in Canberra late at night on Thursday, 15th March.

* 1 heard the contents of the **ASIO** report from which I quoted yesterday on the afternoon of Friday.

* The report from which I read was dated 5th March and it was made to **ASIO** headquarters in Melbourne by an **ASIO** officer in Canberra who had been present at the interdepartmental meeting.

* I shall read the passage from the **ASIO** report again.

* They were: The Department of Foreign Affairs, the AttorneyGeneral's Department, the Department of Immigration, the Commonwealth Police and **ASIO**.

* The inquiries show that the **ASIO** representative gave, in what was admittedly an internal minute, a wrong report of what was said by the officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and that as a consequence he wrongly represented the remarks of officers of the AttorneyGeneral's Department.

* I disagree with nearly all, if not all, of the political organisations with which, I assume, **ASIO** normally deals.

* There ought to be a report to this House by the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* The important thing is that it ought to be plain to the people who run our intelligence organisations that they are under parliamentary supervision, that the people in general believe in the democratic process, that we do not want **ASIO** to interfere with what we consider to be legal though perhaps extremely unpopular political movements and that we have to protect the civil liberties of individuals in this society although they may be people who hold the most unpopular views.

* I have concentrated on this aspect of **ASIO** because I think it is a more important one as far as this Parliament is concerned.

* At this stage I have ignored **ASIO**'s work, if any, related to foreign spying in this country.

* When the Prime Minister was asked why he considered the **ASIO** raid as the biggest mistake made by his Government he replied that his Government is not accident prone.

* The existing **ASIO** Act which the Prime Minister of the day, the then  Mr Menzies,  introduced into this House 23 years ago, will be repealed.

* Thus, there have been substantial changes to **ASIO** since the appointment of  Mr Justice  Woodward on 9 March 1976 and particularly since the recommendations of the royal commission were accepted in 1977.

* This system therefore provides an external discipline to **ASIO** in regard to its overall efficiency.

* He found that the proper fields of investigation by **ASIO** should be more clearly defined than in the present legislation and went on to indicate in detail what these should be.

* It should be noted that, while **ASIO** will be empowered to collect intelligence concerning these matters, criminal offences are not thereby created.

* **ASIO** is not a law enforcement agency.

* Honourable members will recall that an important theme in the Royal Commission's report is that **ASIO** should at all times comply with the law.

* It has also been the concern of the present Director-General that **ASIO** should comply with the law but existing laws present problems for effective intelligence collection.

* Thus, Division 2 of Part III of the Bill provides for certain powers to be exercisable by **ASIO** subject to significant safeguards.

* At the same time **ASIO** will be prohibited from carrying on these activities except under warrants provided in the legislation.

* Balancing this re-definition of the functions and powers of **ASIO** are a number of important considerations.

* A further major consideration is the creation in Part IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communication of **ASIO** security assessments in respect of individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial security assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over by a judge.

* Thus, in effect, the legislation will cause 'the slate to be wiped clean ' so far as past **ASIO** adverse or qualified assessments are concerned.

* The relationship between **ASIO** and State governments and agencies raises important considerations.

* In accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission, the Bill provides for **ASIO**, subject to directions of the Minister, co-operating with departments, police forces and authorities of the States.

* This legislation will give **ASIO** a charter appropriate for the circumstances of today and the tasks it will be called on to perform.

* It will equip **ASIO** with the powers essential for those tasks and at the same time provide safeguards for the rights of individuals and the continuation of our democratic institutions.

* First of all, the context in which this clause appears is that the activities of **ASIO** are to be exempt from scrutiny.

* The question of ultimately' is that it can be argued that it gives **ASIO** a dragnet power.

* But if, by some extraordinary act, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs  (Mr Viner)  were appointed the next Director-General of **ASIO** - 
-I am not so sure it would be such a wonderful choice although he could hardly do worse than he is doing now.

* I think that for the purpose of this argument you would agree that the words of preamble in clause 5(1) have to be read concurrently with clause 5(l)(a)- We have been given no specific example of the kind of subversion which might legitimately be regarded as being within **ASIO**'s field.

* We would all be in the debt of the Government if somebody could provide a specific example or two of what **ASIO** is going to fight against.

* Another problem is that we know so little about **ASIO**'s track record.

* Since 1949 **ASIO** has produced virtually a nil return.

* I would like somebody on the other side of this chamber to give us one example of one **ASIO** triumph, a single **ASIO** success since 1949.I think it is no accident that the members of **ASIO** are known as spooks' because essentially they are ghost hunters pursuing paranoid nightmare fears.

* We know that members of **ASIO** have had enormous success in picking targets such as school cadets for example.

* I think that is a fair description of **ASIO**.

* If in fact **ASIO** has succeeded in saving this country from subversion and revolution in the last 30 years then somebody on the other side ought to be able to get up and timidly squeak out some evidence.

* The ALP at that stage wanted to abolish **ASIO** altogether.

* Many Australians remember him, as the honourable member for Fadden  (Mr 
Donald Cameron) said, not as a senator but as the Minister who in the quietness of the night led an assault on the offices of **ASIO** in Melbourne.

* Essentially we must remember that **ASIO** is an intelligence organisation; it is not a court of justice.

* Opponents of the legislation are assured that before **ASIO** can exercise its powers in any particular or general situation, the Director-General, who is appointed only after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition for the time being, must- I stress that it is mandatory- make a formal request to the Attorney-General, who must be satisfied that the request is reasonable before he will issue a warrant.

* It would appear that the operations of **ASIO** established in 1 956 have resulted in safeguarding our security through its modus operandi.

* The honourable member for Oxley had asked whether **ASIO** had to obtain permission from the Attorney-General or any Minister or Government official before it opened and scrutinised the contents of the mail contract.

* Most Australians surveyed would compliment the Government on its decision that **ASIO**'s security assessments should be subject to an appeals system.

* I particularly applaud clause 61 of the **ASIO** Bill which reads: 61.

* This clause appears to me to guarantee the rights of any person who may be aggrieved in relation to any assessment made of him under the **ASIO** legislation.

* The approval of the Minister is required for **ASIO** to obtain the issue of warrants for the making of inquiries.

* The amendment assumes that the existence of a file implies that a particular person is adversely known to **ASIO**.

* Again one then has to recognise, on the basis of the argument I was offering in relation to the other clause, that if no file exists and if that person finds out from inquiry to the Leader of the Opposition that no file on him exists- unless that same undertaking is going to be given in relation to proposed new clause 7a (2)- that same person on inquiring whether his civil liberties have been affected could, by asking whether there was a file on him, find out whether he was known to **ASIO** and draw certain deductions from that.

* Would it not be nice for a spy if he were able to go along to **ASIO** and, by asking whether a file was kept on him, find out whether **ASIO** was monitoring him?

* He, a former Prime Minister, claimed that he had been denied information by the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**.

* Has authority been given to the Commonwealth Police, **ASIO** or other Government bodies to monitor telephone calls during the period 1 1 November 1 975 to date.

* **ASIO** did not have to report to anyone, including the Prime Minister.

* In the last few statements that the honourable member made relating to the function and operations of **ASIO**, he showed that the Australian Labor Party is prepared to ignore the main issues and the main problems involved and degenerating the debate into the most flimsy arguments in order to try to win some political support from its left wing associates.

* The first one relates to the actual functions of **ASIO**.

* Before speaking on this point I must mention that when I was Foreign Minister and later Prime Minister I had my worries about **ASIO** and, for that matter, about the entire joint intelligence organisation and what they chose to call M09.

* I also remember that when the American forces marched into Cambodia, north of the Parrot's Beak, I asked **ASIO** to give me the Vietnamese signal intercepts.

* Let me speak about the functions of **ASIO**.

* In his report  Mr Justice  Hope implied that **ASIO** may have exceeded its powers and engaged in activities irrelevant to its functions and which may have impinged on individual freedom.

* He went on to say that **ASIO** has been guilty in the past of departures from its basic functions.

* I wish first of all to evaluate clause 17 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill, which relates to the function of **ASIO**.

* Nobody could ever doubt the relevance of those matters to **ASIO** and **ASIO** alone.

* They are within **ASIO**'s powers and I do not believe that it should suffer any interference in that regard from the Parliament or any other sources.

* That relates to communication between the various government departments and **ASIO** in accordance with the law as set out in clause 17.

* I have known a former Attorney-General to go out and make an assault on **ASIO** headquarters.

* I refer again to the functions of **ASIO** and the qualifications set out in the Bill.

* If we have doubts we can always as a parliament and as a government, if it is a government of the Fraser kind, take action to see that there is some inquiry to ascertain whether **ASIO** has acted properly and whether the communication of intelligence relating to the individual is justified.

* As to the nature of the advice given to the Minister, I do not think it is right and proper that it should be the Director-General who decides on the nature of advice to be given in the communications that take place between **ASIO** and the government and its agencies, such as the Department of Defence.

* Mr Justice  Hope said about the general level of political sophistication inside **ASIO** that he saw little evidence that the qualities of mind and expertise needed in intelligence assemblies were recognised in any large measure.

* I do not accuse **ASIO** of this today, but it can happen again.

* Having won the battle there, I thought it would be immediately translated into the area of **ASIO**'s activities.

* Clause 8 (2) (a), for example, shows that neither the Attorney-General nor indeed the Prime Minister can instruct **ASIO** or its agents to stop spying even on them or on any Minister or member of this Parliament.

* Does this clause really mean that if the Director-General so decides he can give secret information gathered by **ASIO** on the highest personages in the government of this country to.

* Clause 8 (2) (b) means really that **ASIO** can collect information on anyone and really make its own decisions.

* A close look at that paragraph shows that **ASIO** can release information to whom it pleases.

* Is it true that **ASIO** would be able to release information- against the advice of the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the Government- to overseas intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency or the Bureau of State Security or any other national intelligence agency overseas?

* tradition to mask intrusion into just about anything that **ASIO** desires.

* This is the way in which **ASIO** can collect information about members of parliament, the Ministry and even the Prime Minister.

* This situation has been exacerbated by limits to **ASIO**'s resources; these have restricted what it can do.

* I shall recommend that this view should be adhered to in the future, and that any statutory independence of the Director-General should not preclude the Prime Minister from giving **ASIO** general policy directions and guidance.

* I refer to the report relating to the former Ambassador to Yugoslavia,  Mr Malcolm  Booker, where he indicated that his embassy had been subjected to surveillance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and that he himself had been subjected to **ASIO** surveillance, contrary to the official rules.

* In accordance with the spirit of the Security Appeals Tribunal and the Hope report on security and intelligence, which refers to grave and permanent injustice being done to people in the Public Service by such **ASIO** reports, could those reports be made available to  Mr Booker?

* What we are dealing with is the right of the Attorney-General, acting on information in his possession, to say: 'I think it is perfectly all right if **ASIO** wants to enter the house of the honourable member for Dundas, to break and enter, to remove documents and make photostat copies of private records because I think **ASIO** ought to have that information '.

* If I may posit the position of the Opposition, it was in fact to offer a multi-faceted pattern of control for **ASIO** involving the Parliament, the judiciary and a principle of judicial audit.

* That is, in a sense if the Executive is given too direct and specific a control, then it may be found that **ASIO** is abused for political purposes, as were the secret agencies of government in the United States.

* I fear that in clause 8 the Government has been too fearful of that abuse and has rather neglected the other great danger of security organisations or such organisations as **ASIO**.

* It is my view that the way in which clause 8 has been phrased opens up this society to the danger that **ASIO** will effectively escape democratic control.

* I would not worry so much about that if we had some effective involvement in the judiciary in the control of **ASIO**.

* In formulating its amendments the Opposition has gone along with those paragraphs of the Bill because we accept a necessity to prevent political interference in **ASIO** as it relates to specific individuals.

* What the Opposition is trying to do is to give to the democratically elected Executive general access to the information of **ASIO**, subject to the limitations about specific individuals.

* We believe it is necessary to make it clear by stating quite clearly the authority of the democratically elected Executive to have access to the information provided by **ASIO** with the specific exceptions listed in the Bill and in our own provision.

* Unless that is done, Ministers of the Crown and their colleagues, leading figures either in Government or Opposition, might be subjected to **ASIO**'s surveillance without the knowledge of any member of the democratically elected Executive.

* I ask members on both sides of the Committee to take this clause very seriously because it remains the only major clause which allows some form of democratic control through the Executive over **ASIO** operations.

* I believe that if the clause were worded in that way that would be a sufficiently wide mandate to enable **ASIO** to properly discharge its responsibilities to the Government and to the people of Australia.

* Looking at the background of **ASIO**, no member of Parliament can say that in the past it has not abused its prerogatives and has not- in many cases wrongly, on a number of occasions illegally- jeopardised the fundamental rights of many thousands of Australian citizens.

* Following previous speakers, I should like to add my warm congratulations to  Mr Justice  Woodward for the excellent manner in which he is performing his duty as Director-General of **ASIO**.

* Particular areas which are covered by this bill and which are most important to me are those which effect the checks and balances mechanisms within **ASIO**.

* They are **ASIO** 's values which allow us to go to sleep at night reassured in the knowledge that every measure that could be adopted to safeguard our liberties has been taken.

* If correspondence that I and many other honourable members have received has been any indication, the procedure for telephone tapping, the issuance of warrants for tapping, opening mail, installing listening devices, the supply of information for the responsible Minister, the scrutiny of **ASIO**'s finances, the guidelines for security assessments and the notifications of adverse assessments are problems about which many in the community have expressed grave apprehension.

* On 3 April this year, after a very lengthy and sometimes passionate second reading debate, the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  in his reply said that he was considering whether the Minister in charge of **ASIO** should provide to Parliament from time to time some statement in relation to some of the matters contained in the report and thereby give the Parliament an opportunity to discuss the Organisation.

* The Bill proceeds on the basis that the personal integrity and bona fides of two men- the Attorney-General and the Director-General of **ASIO**- are sufficient to assure our continuance in the security process.

* Who takes over as head of **ASIO** then?

* In 1973 as Attorney-General he disclosed that in the previous 10 years **ASIO** had conducted an average of approximately 100 telephone taps.

* Neither would our security be damaged now if **ASIO** revealed to the Parliament the numbers and the kinds of warrants issued for taps, listening devices, mail interceptions and so on.

* That must also hold true for **ASIO** and its relations with this Parliament.

* We are able to say, Yes **ASIO** is accountable', only if we can be assured that the line of accountability can be traced unfalteringly from Director-General to Attorney-General to Parliament.

* The revelations which surfaced in the Senate in the debate on this Bill and which concerned the apparent free-wheeling and unrestrained expenditure of **ASIO** must convince us of the obligation to rewrite the rules, not to formalise this illegality as the Government did in the last session.

* In view of the answers that he has given to the Leader of the Opposition and in view of the reference which he made to the existence of a Senate committee, will he- make available to that Senate committee an authenticated copy of the telex sent from the Canberra office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to other branches of **ASIO** on 28 March?

* On the assertion of conservative politicans, **ASIO** was believed to have been a supremely effective and efficient security organisation.

* Those which have not been made available to the public merely consolidate to an alarming degree that failure, that complete shortcoming of **ASIO** to measure up to the task set to it which conservative politicians alleged that it was achieving.

* In the case of **ASIO**, the problems were nepotism, lack of education, lack of training and poor recruitment.

* With **ASIO** and the Narcotics Bureau, we have the two extremes of agencies of investigation and surveillance.

* As time goes on in this debate it will be most revealing to see where those speakers who spoke against the inclusion of the word 'ultimately' ultimately stand with respect to the very existence of **ASIO**.

* I do so because people listening to this debate might think that neither this Government,  Mr Justice  Hope, nor **ASIO** itself, has any regard for the individual rights and freedoms of Australian citizens.

* We know also that at times it presents dilemmas to us - 
I have started by considering whether Australia needs a security service such as **ASIO** was created to provide.

* **ASIO** is an organ of the executive government of the Commonwealth.

* I quote that because the honourable gentleman quite fallaciously said that **ASIO** is not answerable to the Government or the people.

* This legislation shows how **ASIO** is answerable to the 
Attorney-General and, through the AttorneyGeneral, of course, to the Parliament and the people.

* Furthermore, as **ASIO** is an organ of the executive government of the Commonwealth, this Government must be answerable for the activities of **ASIO** to this Parliament and to the people.

* We know that no man or woman in this world is perfect and therefore it is understandable that  Mr Justice  Hope said that: 
As an organisation **ASIO** needs management.

* Over a number of years **ASIO**'s management was not as good as it should have been.

* When speaking of the fact that he found some disorder in **ASIO**'s files he said this: 
I think those words might well be quoted to some of the honourable members who have spoken in this debate.

* I make it quite clear that the State Special Branch is not **ASIO**.

* It will be borne in mind if one appreciates the three fundamental elements in the meaning of 'subversion', and that is why the word 'ultimately' is critical to the authority of **ASIO** to act in the interests of national security.

* He made absolutely no contribution to the debate on the **ASIO** Bill, but he did make some most enlightening disclosures about his ideological beliefs.

* These are the sorts of things that the honourable member for Reid, in opposing the provisions of the **ASIO** Bill, would seek to render on the Australian nation.

* He went on to say that the existing **ASIO** Act will be repealed.

* There needs to be a community consensus that an organisation such as **ASIO** is necessary and that the powers contained in this Bill are necessary.

* If there is not a community consensus to that effect the Bill will not work and **ASIO** will not work because there will be community reaction to it.

* This Bill gives to **ASIO** powers which are much wider than it has under the present legislation.

* But what needs to be recognised, I think, is that people in the community were expressing views.on the way in which **ASIO** had operated in the past.

* If the security organisation is to work and is to be accepted by the community, there needs to be an opportunity for individuals and groups in the community to express their views, not on the way in which **ASIO** has worked in the past, but on the provisions of this BUI.

* It should be remembered that this Bill does give considerably wider powers to **ASIO**.

* The Minister said: 
Honourable members will recall that an important theme in the royal commission's report is that **ASIO** should at all time comply with the law.

* It has also been the concern of the present Director-General that **ASIO** should comply with the law but existing laws present problems for effective intelligence collection.

* In other words, the Government has accepted that in certain circumstances **ASIO** or security organisations should not be required to comply with existing laws in Australia.

* It may be the conclusion of the Government that **ASIO** need not comply with those laws under certain circumstances, but I challenge the Government to prove that that view is shared by the community.

* A further major consideration is the creation in Pan IV of the Bill of a totally new statutory framework for the preparation and communication of **ASIO** security assessments in  respect of individuals and the giving to most persons affected by prejudicial security assessments of a right of appeal to a tribunal presided over by a judge.

* I think that **ASIO** ought to be prepared to take criticism.

* It is extremely important that, in a political sense, criticisms of **ASIO** are not treated necessarily as being attacks on the Government.

* There is no necessity for the whole of the weight of a government to be used to defend **ASIO** or a police force against what may be legitimate criticism, as happened in New South Wales.

* I am pleased to hear that control of **ASIO** is to be transferred back from the Prime Minister to the Attorney-General.

* I could not quite catch whether he said that he expected  Mr Justice  Hope in his report to recommend that **ASIO** be placed under the responsibility of the Prime Minister.

* If this Bill were interpreted narrowly an honourable member could not criticise the head of **ASIO** in that capacity, in the same way that allegedly he cannot criticise other judges or Governors-General.

* I hope that I will never see a situation in this House where we cannot criticise the head of **ASIO**.

* But I do not think that a judge should bring with him his privilege as a judge whereby honourable members are unable to criticise him, because he would not be acting in a judicial capacity when he was acting as head of **ASIO**.

* The Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security recommended that **ASIO**'s powers of interception should be extended to interception of information passing over all telecommunications systems and this Bill so provides.

* It is also made unlawful for an officer of **ASIO** or Customs to have access to telegrams except as provided in the legislation.

* Provision is then made in Part III for the issue of warrants by the AttorneyGeneral and, in emergency circumstances, by the Director-General, authorising **ASIO** to intercept communications passing to or from specified telecommunication services subject to safeguards similar to those provided in the present Act.

* To meet the urgent national problem of narcotic offences, the Government has decided that the power of interception of all forms of telecommunications should be available to assist in the detection of Customs narcotic offences subject to the same safeguards as apply to interception by **ASIO**.

* I told him- the **ASIO** tape recording of our conversation will confirm this-that I refused to believe that the Minister had leaked it; that I believed it had been leaked by other persons, perhaps from the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* I repeat that the tape recording of the conversation which **ASIO** has in its possession will confirm those remarks.

* It is terribly important that the Minister have the right to call for dossiers and for the files that **ASIO** might keep.

* When he was the Attorney-General, one Thursday night after the Senate adjourned he decided to go to the headquarters of **ASIO** in Canberra with  Mr Kerry  Milte and Maureen Barron to have a talk about concern that was being expressed by the Commonwealth Police regarding the security of the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, who was expected to arrive in Canberra within a few days time.

* **ASIO** had previously said that there would be no threat to the Prime Minister's life.

* When  Senator Murphy  got to the **ASIO** headquarters he discovered that in point of fact **ASIO** had received information that it was the intention of Croatian terrorists to put cyanide in the air conditioning system of the Lakeside Hotel.

* Senator Murphy  asked the people at **ASIO**: 'What have you done about this threat?'

* So the people at **ASIO** handed over the file.

* What I am telling the Parliament now in revealing these facts publicly for the first time ever is information given to me by one of the people who was present at that meeting with **ASIO** that evening.

* But **ASIO** was immediately told of his attempt to get a VIP aircraft and started to prepare for his visit to the **ASIO** headquarters in Melbourne next day.

* The reply was:' No, but there have been some bookings made by **ASIO** for all the empty seats.

* It was not until Murphy discovered about the phantom bookings made by **ASIO**, for the purpose of preventing his getting a seat to Melbourne, that he asserted his authority as head of **ASIO** and demanded that seats be given to him.

* **ASIO** was quite prepared to pay for booked seats it was not going to use in order to prevent its own Minister travelling with one of its officers.

* On the flight Murphy found himself sitting next to an **ASIO** officer named Marshall who had been told by his headquarters in Melbourne to bring with him a particular file.

* The officer said: 'I am sorry, you cannot have a look inside this file because I am working for the Director-General of **ASIO**, not for the Attorney-General'.

* The Hope report provides no basis for reform of **ASIO**.

* The report is the inadequate and sorry climax to the suspicions, the abuses and the troubles which have plagued **ASIO** since its formation in 1948-49.

* Before exposing the inadequacies of  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations, let me examine some of the abuses of power as outlined in his report regarding **ASIO**'s operations.

* In paragraph 1 1 4 in the second report he said: 
The inspection of hundreds of files and the examination of numbers of witnesses, including officers of **ASIO**, have satisfied me that some security assessments it has provided have been wrong.

* In paragraph 116 of volume 1 of the fourth report  Mr Justice  Hope said in relation to 'particular principles of propriety, including legality, to which **ASIO** should have regard in fulfilling its functions' that 'material before me establishes that there have been departures by **ASIO** from these principles'.

* Mr Justice  Hope accuses **ASIO** of acting with impropriety and illegality.

* Indeed, it is particularly damning that  Mr Justice  Hope should make the startling statement that over many years **ASIO** has been allowed to operate without guidelines or questions of propriety.

* Propriety, it seems, plays little part in **ASIO**'s operations.

* that despite control procedures, many **ASIO** personnel in fact have had access to files, sometimes without adhering to proper procedures, and at other times without any sufficient need to know.

* In most substantial dossiers, it can be seen that there has been movement of information to and from **ASIO** .

* The involvement of any other organ of the State- that is, **ASIO** and /or the military- should, according to  Mr Justice  Hope, 'be concerned only with politically motivated terrorism'.

* A definition of 'terrorism' proper must, in the view of  Mr Justice  Hope, include: 
The most dangerous of  Mr Justice  Hope's recommendations are those which seek to provide legislative confirmation of the already dictatorial powers of the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* At the end of this consideration  Mr Justice  Hope came to the amazing conclusion that: 
Let us see how far the powers relating to the Director-General of **ASIO** would go if the Government took the recommendations contained in the Hope report to force of law.

* This Government, in accepting these recommendations, if indeed it does, will in fact be seeking to deny both the people and their elected representatives in Parliament control over the activities of **ASIO**.

* Rather, this reactionary Government seeks to place **ASIO** above the law, above the people and above the Parliament.

* It seeks to place the Director-General of **ASIO**-- 
The honourable member for Hume would not know anything about civil liberties.

* This Government seeks powers for **ASIO** to legalise the use of bugs, the breaking, entering and searching of premises and the opening of mail.

* It does this by accepting the line that the elected 
Minister responsible for the administration of **ASIO** will have no right to seize or otherwise inspect **ASIO** files other than at the discretion of the Director-General- an appointed official with no direct responsibility to either the people or the Parliament.

* The published telex from **ASIO** in Washington is scandalous, not because the document was leaked, but because of its disclosures.

* Following message received from **ASIO** liaison officer Washington: 
However, CIA feels it necessary to speak also directly to **ASIO** because of the complexity of the problem.

* Has **ASIO** HQ been contacted or involved?

* Implicit in the CIA's approach to **ASIO** for information on events in Australia was an understanding that the Australian organisation had obligations of loyalty to the CIA itself before its obligations to the Australian Government.

* I want to acknowledge that the Acting Director-General of **ASIO** did his duty.

* It appointed  Mr Justice  A. E. Woodward as Director-General of **ASIO**, thus restoring a precedent established by the Chifley Government in 1949 when **ASIO** was formed.

* As honourable members are aware, **ASIO** was originally established by a previous Australian Labor Party Prime Minister,  Mr Chifley,  on 16 March 1949.

* The amendments which have now been proposed by the Government are quite significant to the conduct of **ASIO**'s relations.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  is taking unto himself administrative powers which previously have been vested in the Attorney-General, despite the fact that successive governments have emphasised that at all times the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO** was to have access to the Prime Minister.

* Mr Chifley,  when he established **ASIO**, and later  Sir Robert  Menzies, adopted the same practice in their respective directives which were issued to the Directors-General of **ASIO**.

* It is not impossible, in fact it is quite likely, that  Mr Justice  Hope has already given the Prime Minister a memorandum suggesting these amendments, but it is not unreasonable for us to suggest that the exercise of responsibility conducted by the previous Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, in his actions in raiding **ASIO** in 1973, and the profound effect which that action had on the Organisation, could well have led the Prime Minister to conclude that he could not trust any other Minister within his ministry to conduct and oversee the vital work which is the responsibility of **ASIO**.

* But  Mr Whitlam  's attitude is in contrast to that of  Mr Chifley,  who set the tone as to how Parliament should consider questions concerning **ASIO** when he emphasised in this House on 9 June 1949 that 'the Director-General had been given complete authority on security matters' and that he did not propose to interfere with him in the discharge of his functions.

* On the other hand, however, we feel quite justified in stating before this House that a government which declares itself to be in favour of a policy of open government, which declares itself to be in favour of advising the Australian people as much as it can on the reasons why actions have to be taken, should inform this House and therefore the Australian people as to why the Prime Minister considers it necessary to change the administrative arrangements concerning the conduct of the affairs of **ASIO**.

* The legislation of 1956 upon which **ASIO** was founded is by its very nature less than concise, but it is worth while on this occasion emphasising what are the functions of the Organisation as set out in that Act.

* It is a regrettable fact that over the period of its existence **ASIO** has been on many occasions subjected to a continuing campaign of denigration, vilification and irresponsible questioning both through the media and in this Parliament.

* An effective internal intelligence organisation such as **ASIO** must be devoted to protecting Australia's internal security.

* I wish merely to make it quite clear that no State can maintain its sovereignty unless it has a system of internal surveillance such as **ASIO** to defend the state against those persons, both within and without, who want to see the Australian people lose their freedom.

* While my faith in appointments from the judiciary has been shaken in other contexts, I continue to believe that it is important for the head of **ASIO** to be a judge.

* The first head of **ASIO** was a judge.

* The activities of organisations such as **ASIO** have been the focus of a great deal of public attention in recent years, both at home and abroad.

* I have, somewhat to my surprise, had expressed to me qualms that this might enable a judge who was appointed as head of **ASIO** to exercise more extensive powers than those which could be exercised by a head of **ASIO** who was not a judge.

* The office of head of **ASIO** is an executive office.

* It is not intended that in any action he takes as head of **ASIO** he should exercise any additional authority that he would have when he is acting as a judge.

* The first one concerns the retention of the title DirectorGeneral for the head of **ASIO** instead of changing the title to Director, as was the case in the Bills that the House passed last October.

* There may be directors in **ASIO** but they are not public figures so known.

* A great number of people do not know who the Director-General of **ASIO** is; still fewer would know the titles of any other persons in the organisation.

* The head of **ASIO** has always been called, since it was a statutory office, the Director-General.

* However, if the report was not an accurate one or if it is the case that an **ASIO** representative misunderstood or misinterpreted the proceedings at the meeting, there is also a great deal of concern, surely, not only among members of the Parliament but also among members of the public.

* It should be recalled that employees of **ASIO** make reports on a great number of people who, for instance, seek appointment or promotion in the Commonwealth Public Service, and on a great number of people who seek to be naturalised as Australian citizens.

* But I do not make assertions or assumptions about malevolence or incompetence of **ASIO** representatives or about a conspiracy between members of the Public Service from different departments or in any one department.

* Nothing has been revealed which could in any way justify the disastrous actions of the Attorney-General in raiding **ASIO**.

* The Prime Minister has been asked over and over again why  Senator Murphy  visited the Canberra office of **ASIO** in the first place.

* The Attorney-General claims that he has ministerial authority to do what he did on the night and morning of 15th and 16th March when he went to the offices of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation in Canberra and Melbourne, stood over **ASIO** staff and took possession of information which was the property of our Security Intelligence Organisation.

* It seems to me that unless he can cite directly the authority on which he relies to establish that he is an authorised person in terms of the Crimes Act in the situation he engineered when he raided **ASIO**, we are entitled to say that the Attorney-General has acted illegally and has placed himself above the laws of this Parliament.

* Mr Speaker, this Parliament has passed a law which places **ASIO** under the control of the Director-General.

* The law passed by this Parliament did not place **ASIO** or its DirectorGeneral under the control of any Minister.

* There is nothing whatsoever in the terms and conditions which could justify even remotely the AttorneyGeneral's action in raiding **ASIO** in the way he did.

* Parliament, the supreme authority, placed the administration of **ASIO** outside the scope of ministerial responsibility.

* It is not good enough merely to say that it is inconceivable that a statutory body such as **ASIO** is not responsible to a Minister or under the control of a Minister.

* Control means domination or command and the Parliament has specifically placed **ASIO** under the control - the domination or command - not of a Minister but of its DirectorGeneral.

* The AttorneyGeneral may be responsible for the administration of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, but he cannot take upon himself any power or authority to administer **ASIO** other than in strict conformity with the Act under which **ASIO** was established.

* Parliament itself determined the functions of **ASIO** and neither the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General nor anyone else can act in any way which contravenes these functions.

* Parliament decided that the Director-General of **ASIO** should not be directly responsible to a Minister and thereby subject to political control or interference.

* But the Attorney-General has no right whatsoever to go to **ASIO** and take information from it.

* Certainly he cannot resort to the melodramatic midnight raiding of **ASIO** and the direction of swarms of Commonwealth police to seal safes and containers.

* It is understood that  Mr Whitlands  staff volunteered to be cleared by **ASIO** to prevent any possible trouble that might arise if there were a major security breach.

* It is important to look at the previous debates in this Parliament, not the least of which one that took place in 1956, at which time the **ASIO** legislation was before the Parliament.

* For example, on 28 February this year, that is, before this legislation was introduced, the honourable member for Denison  (Mr Hodgman)  was able to boast in this House that he had greatly enjoyed the opportunity to cross-examine at length the DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**,  Mr Justice  Woodward.

* Over the last 25 years the Opposition has been far from satisfied with the performance of **ASIO**.

* His  fourth report, volume 1 , reads: 
Despite our disenchantment with **ASIO**, we still believe that such an organisation is necessary.

* We see two main general areas of need for **ASIO**.

* The second need for **ASIO** is to identify cases of espionage and related activities.

* On the other hand, it is just as simplistic to say we should abolish **ASIO**, which is a naive and dangerous view.

* Let me say that the Opposition has complete faith in the integrity and the sense of propriety of the Director-General of **ASIO**  Mr Justice  Woodward.

* Such bipartisan confidence in the DirectorGeneral gives a real basis for a bipartisan approach to **ASIO** itself.

* This legislation is the charter for **ASIO** for years to come under yet unknown Directors-General.

* It is equally clear that both **ASIO** and State special branches have operated on an entirely different basis.

* I have no doubt that the same thing occurred in relation to **ASIO**.

* Let me quote from page 7 of the report of  Mr Justice  White: 
1 ) Is it a fact, as reported, that the Government is using **ASIO** to provide surveillance over Australian trade unions.

* Has **ASIO** been instructed to scrutinise the activities of conservation organisations.

* In the past there have been clear, substantial and justified grounds for concern about the way in which **ASIO** has functioned, and justification for criticism of that organisation.

* In the past-  Mr Justice  Hope established this- **ASIO** was a badly demoralised organisation.

* They were serious deficiencies in the financial administration and in the distribution of funds within **ASIO**.

* Again, in the published reports of  Mr Justice  Hope it is clear that **ASIO** had been engaging in illegal activities.

* It is obvious that in some cases the Minister responsible for **ASIO** had been making available security files to at least one government backbencher in an effort to embarrass members of the Opposition or people in the community.

* Records were in a chaotic condition, and most disturbingly of all **ASIO** had what we might call rather loosely its own dirty tricks department, a special projects section which, among other things, was responsible for leaking stories to friendly journalists or other sources which could use it to put across the point of view that **ASIO** wanted bruited about in the community.

* I received submissions and information papers in some numbers from **ASIO**.

* That is disturbing, and that completely confounds the smug confidence of many conservatives from the coalition parties in the 1960s and 1970s about the alleged excellence of service of **ASIO**.

* In paragraph 20  Mr Justice  Hope says: 
I am bound to record that I found **ASIO**'s files in such disorder that, in the time that has been available to me, I have,  been quite unable to establish the truth or otherwise of many of the particulars of matters alleged in evidence, or raised with **ASIO** as the result of other inquiries.

* I must report that I saw little  evidenc  in **ASIO** that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognised, or available in any large measure.

* They destroy the credibility of **ASIO** in that period up until the point when this inquiry was completed, the report formulated and presented to government, and those parts of it to the public, and action subsequently taken by the Government.

* One has only to reflect on the spectacular activities of the Central Intelligence Agency- harmful and illegal- or the tactics of blackmail, physical threat, public smearing and so on by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, especially in relation to the late Martin Luther King, to feel that there is a justifiable case for making **ASIO** or any security institution accountable to the maximum which is practical within our society, and consistent with the needs of secrecy for its operation.

* Accountability by **ASIO** must be improved in the Bill.

* This can be achieved by maximising ministerial responsibility, guaranteeing bipartisanship by increasing access by the Leader of the Opposition to security matters; periodic judicial audits of **ASIO**'s operations; a proper and independent system of financial accountability; annual parliamentary reports and a so-called sunset clause which would guarantee periodic legislative initiative to continue the operations of **ASIO**.

* As the Bill is now framed there is no adequate ministerial supervision and control of **ASIO**.

* How far should ministerial responsibility extend without undue political interference in the operations of **ASIO**?

* How far does the need for professional autonomy to guarantee efficiency extend before **ASIO** becomes monolithic and uncontrollable?

* This Bill does nothing to ensure a proper balance between adequate ministerial control and undue ministerial interference, despite the fact that the thrust of the Hope Report was that **ASIO** had in the past transgressed its charter and acted illegally.

* There can be no doubt that the potential for political abuse of **ASIO** is great.

* Ordinary justice demands that the public must be protected against the misuse of information gathered by **ASIO** for sinister and often petty political vendettas.

* In my view, this is all the more reason why the legislation now before the House must clearly delineate between the responsibility of **ASIO** to the government of the day and the responsibility of that Government to the Parliament.

* In our view, the Hope report gives far too much residual power to the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* Whilst the Attorney-General ought to know of the existence of individual files, their contents should be withheld unless the Director-General of **ASIO** considers the Minister's access is wholly in the interest of national security.

* The Opposition strongly opposes clause 8 (2) (c) for its restrictions on the power of the Attorney-General to give specific directions 'concerning the nature of the advice that should be given by **ASIO** to a Minister, Department or authority of the Commonwealth'.

* We see it as the means by which the Director-General of **ASIO** could justify the withholding of information which should not be withheld.

* In the original Bill, the only access to security matters by the Leader of the Opposition was one of consultation by the Prime Minister before the appointment of the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* There is no guarantee for specific details to be given to the Opposition Leader of the exercise of **ASIO** 's special powers.

* In our view, the principal Bill should also allow the Leader of the Opposition to be told, on request, of the existence of any **ASIO** file or record on a particular person.

* He should also be informed promptly of the details of the issuing of any warrant to **ASIO** to exercise its special powers, such as the opening of mail or the tapping of telephones.

* But their guarantee by legislation would help prevent improper or overzealous use of **ASIO** 's powers, and they would go a long way towards ensuring that the cloak of security is not abused for political advantage.

* The Opposition strongly supports the concept of the periodic judicial audit of **ASIO**.

* We want to see incorporated in the principal Bill a provision establishing a triennial inspection, by a judge, of all **ASIO** records, dossiers and files to ensure that **ASIO**- complies with its charter; does not unjustifiably infringe civil liberties; and, operates effectively and efficiently.

* Similarly, the Opposition is insisting that **ASIO** should be accountable for all expenditure of funds.

* Last year **ASIO**'s budget jumped by 27 per cent to just under $13m.

* For the last 30 years **ASIO**'s accounts have been audited illegally in the sense that the auditing system did not comply with any specific exemption under the Audit Act.

* Yet the Parliament is still told nothing of what **ASIO** and its growing empire does with its burgeoning budget, not even in the most general terms.

* Even  Mr Justice  Hope found that **ASIO**'s financial procedures are capable of some improvement, though we are not told why.

* We believe the legislation must include a provision for inspection and audit by the Auditor-General of all **ASIO** accounts and subsequent report to the responsible Minister.

* This legislation gives a degree of privacy to **ASIO** which the Government refuses to give the ordinary citizens of Australia.

* Clause 18 of the principal Bill would probably prevent disclosure of even the most monstrous breaches of propriety and the law within **ASIO**.

* This attempt to impose a total proscription on information about **ASIO** would raise an enormous barrier against actions of conscience or a sense of higher duty among **ASIO** employees.

* Clause 92 of the principal Bill seeks to ban the disclosure of the name of any **ASIO** officer with language so wide-ranging that it becomes ludicrous.

* If a student, a trade unionist or a member of a political party discovered the identity of an undercover **ASIO** agent they would commit an offence by warning their fellow members or colleagues, even if they did it on the basis that their personal privacy was endangered.

* What about the 344,000 Public Service applicants who, according to  Mr Justice  Hope's report were subject to **ASIO** checks over the last five years?

* But they are not the only people affected by unfavourable reports by **ASIO**.

* The legislation is also too narrow in its definition of the information that may be given to a person affected by an **ASIO** report.

* There is also provision in clause 59 for **ASIO** itself, through the Director-General, to decide whether certain documents or information will go before the Tribunal on security grounds.

* The extreme powers conferred by this Act should not be used as a matter of routine operation by **ASIO**.

* The legislation talks about 'emergency situations' where the actions may be authorised by the Director-General of **ASIO** rather than the Attorney-General.

* Unless they are there, we will never be able to convince the Australian people that **ASIO** truly represents their interest, collectively and, in so many important cases, individually.

* Attorney-General's action and statements concerning the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation have amounted to a campaign of denigration and villification of the former Government, its Attorney-General and **ASIO**.

* That statement purported to be a detailed disclosure of terrorist activities within Australia - a disclosure of conclusive evidence of the existence of persons and organisations whom the Government could prosecute - and a full explanation in justification of the AttorneyGeneral's unprecedented actions in carrying out raids on **ASIO**.

* It has long been the objective of elements within the Australian Labor Party to destroy **ASIO**.

* Just how great that pressure is can be concluded from the fact that there was a tied vote at the Australian Labor Party Federal Conference on a motion to abolish **ASIO**.

* **ASIO**'s standing in the eyes of allied secret services has been irretrievably impaired and its prospects of maintaining the pre-existing flow of information from those services have been severely diminished, as the Attorney-General himself so well knows.

* The impact of the Attorney-General's actions has substantially lowered the morale of **ASIO**'s staff and compromised many of the essential undercover sources on which it relies for vital information.

* In spite of the many serious consequences of **ASIO**'s treatment and the unprecedented nature of the AttorneyGeneral's actions, a wall of silence has been constructed not simply in this national Parliament but throughout the Australian nation.

* In relation to his words on **ASIO** he has stated: 
He thereby effectively removes any valid reason for his raids.

* It is a fact that the Canberra head of **ASIO** was without warning detained in the middle of the night and interrogated.

* It is also a fact that the Attorney-General raided **ASIO** headquarters accompanied by 27 Commonwealth police^ men.

* Senator Murphy  stated: 
I did not inform the Director-General before  I  went to **ASIO** headquarters.

* Canberra and Melbourne **ASIO** headquarters which may have foreshadowed the Attorney-General's intentions.

* He has said only: 
Et is probably not correct to say that that was the specific reason for my visit to **ASIO** headquarters.

* The Government asked the public to believe that there was a conspiracy either within **ASIO** or among senior public servants whose discussion on the question of security was subject to the report by **ASIO** subsequently seized by the Attorney-General and now revealed by the Prime Minister to have been a wrong report.

* There is no point in blaming **ASIO** or the Public Service.

* If so, what procedures exist for the Attorney-General to examine reports or files of **ASIO** in order to establish whether illegal activities did take place?

* The statement purports to find that an **ASIO** officer made a wrong report.

* In other words, it convicts an **ASIO** officer, and that in itself is important.

* It says only that the **ASIO** officer made a wrong report of the meeting.

* The inquiry now having taken place, the statement does not explain why that inquiry could not have been the proper step to take instead of the raid on the **ASIO** headquarters.

* I believe that  Mr Thwaites's  qualifications are undoubted, and I also belive that the fact that he has been with **ASIO** should not prejudice him in any position that he might seek in the Public Service in which he has served for 20-odd years.

* The position he filled in **ASIO** in the last  20  years was, namely, the supervision of staff engaged in research work, analysis and evaluation work, and supervision and editorial duties in relation to the production of reports and research papers.

* The most glaring example of CIA interference in Australia affairs was the telex message sent from Washington on 10 November 1975 to the Acting Director of **ASIO**, the text of which was published in the  Australian Financial Review  of 29 April.

* I want to see members of **ASIO** photographing these subversive elements in the Country Party and the rural industries.

* We could talk about the infamous **ASIO** affair.

* What is less ludicrous is the extreme difficulty for this Parliament to evaluate in any serious way the activities of **ASIO** and its sister organisations.

* We are also told that we should accept that the present DirectorGeneral of **ASIO**,  Mr Justice  Woodward, is a man of integrity and that we can trust him not to carry out any of the excesses of his predecessors in office.

* Some political associates of mine see **ASIO** as a sinister organisation.

* But it is true that over a long period members of **ASIO** have put out an extraordinarily ill informed picture of the world.

* Soon after he was approached by an **ASIO** man.

* He made an arrangement to meet the **ASIO** man in an out of the way suburban pub in Melbourne.

* After the **ASIO** man had established his identity he dropped his voice conspiratorially and asked my friend: 'Who's this Leon Trotsky we've been hearing so much about?'

* It is impossible to evaluate **ASIO**'s track record because we know so little about it.

* The Victoria Police has great contempt for **ASIO**'s methods of investigation.

* **ASIO** failed dismally in its handling of security at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sydney which culminated in the tragic bomb incident at the Hilton Hotel.

* If we have to rely on **ASIO** to protect us against terrorism then it is about time we left the country.

* **ASIO** failed dismally in its handling of the various bombing incidents against Yugoslav property.

* We do know that **ASIO** spent a good deal of time snooping around trade unions trying to find out what unionists were doing but so far as actual, active, serious work in security is concerned in relation to subversion, real or apparent, and trying to deal with terrorism **ASIO** has no track record at all.

* The security of Australia depends not on **ASIO** but on an alert, informed and sceptical Australian democracy.

* We have had much discussion lately about work value cases and I find it almost impossible to make any judgment on the work value of **ASIO**.

* If the entire staff of **ASIO** went on long service leave for 12 months without anyone knowing, would anything change in Australia?

* **ASIO** can claim that after all there has not been a single revolution in Australia since **ASIO** was set up in 1949; therefore it must be doing a great job.

* It is very difficult to make out any kind of rational case for work value so far as **ASIO** is concerned.

* I must report that I saw little evidence in **ASIO** that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognized, or available in any large measure.

* **ASIO** needs to encourage those in the organization who have manifested these qualities, and to seek vigorously in the market place for more such.

* The need for **ASIO** to attend to this matter is very great.

* **ASIO** does not have a good record here.

* Thirdly, **ASIO** needs people with some expertise in political science and related disciplines.

* **ASIO** should be a place where the study of marxism, in all its forms and manifestations, is a high academic discipline.

* Some people in **ASIO** should have not only graduate, but postgraduate, qualifications in these areas.

* Fourth, since **ASIO** is so much involved with looking at people, there ought to be officers with skills in sociology, psychology and related areas.

* **ASIO** should develop processes of evaluation of sources, independently of the operations area.

* Each intelligence report should also be read by the appropriate **ASIO** intelligence desk officer.

* Without monitoring income intelligence, **ASIO** could not gauge whether it adequately covered existing intelligence targets and properly determined new ones.

* Without checking information supplied by agents against independently verified information, and without having regular assessments made of the agent operations, I do not see how **ASIO** can place reliance on its agent reports.

* In part E of this report I shall examine changes in **ASIO**'s structure and working methods needed to achieve adequate assessment of intelligence.

* I must report that I saw little evidence in **ASIO** that the qualities of mind and expertise needed were recognised, or available in any large measure.

* The whole basis of **ASIO** is that it has a special God-given, rather than statute-given, right which places it above public scrutiny, able to act on its own conception of public duty, secure in its secrecy and able to do things that are denied the elected Parliament.

* I conclude from my reading of  Mr Justice  Hope's report that **ASIO** in its present form lacks the sophistication and capacity to evaluate that we should expect from an intelligence organisation.

* The point about it is that if one looks at **ASIO**'s contribution to Austraiian politics in the past one sees that it led us completely up a blind alley over the Vietnam war.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  pointed out this afternoon, if it was a matter of providing something for the Army Minister, such as a report on a child in a school cadet corps who was thought to be harbouring subversive thoughts, yes, **ASIO** was absolutely capable of producing a report on that.

* But in respect of any kind of sensitive intelligent evaluation of what was going on in Vietnam, no, it was out of **ASIO**'s depth; not quite its scene.

* Mr Justice  Hope, referring to what **ASIO** was doing in the trade union area, wrote: 
The third area concerning which difficulties arise in respect of the communication of intelligence is that of trade unions.

* **ASIO** does not, and properly does not, surveil employer organizations or trade unions as such.

* However, the surveillance by **ASIO** or left-wing radical organizations judged to be subversive or potentially subversive, and of the members of those organizations, has led to **ASIO** obtaining intelligence concerning the activities of trade unions which are controlled by members of those organizations or which the members of those organizations seek to control.

* As in the case of the organization and of their members, the communication of this intelligence can only be a matter of concern for **ASIO**, or justified, if it is judged to affect or to be in the interests of security.

* Therefore, maintaining the existing authority organisations in society is valid and deserves the protection of **ASIO** whereas any organisation which takes a contrary point of view has to be under the surveillance of **ASIO**.

* Paragraph 245 states: 
Evidence is available to me that satisfies me that **ASIO** has in the past provided selected people with security intelligence material for publication.

* It seems to have been **ASIO**'s intention that the material be not attributed to it.

* So far as **ASIO** is concerned, the only thing I will do in relation to the rest of the question is to follow the course taken by other Prime Ministers, including  Mr Whitlam,  and that is not to say in answer to a question anything that would confirm or deny allegations in relation to that Organisation.

* I draw the attention of the House to the fact that a royal commission report in relation to **ASIO** has been received from a most learned and respected judge and the Government has acted upon that.

* I also draw attention to the fact that the present Director-General of **ASIO** was appointed by the previous Government and certainly has the confidence of this Government.

* I also pointed out that a major security appeals tribunal is to be established and that the Bill also deals with the staffing of **ASIO**.

* It has been indicated that the Opposition does not oppose the existence of **ASIO**.

* The Opposition wants a regular, periodic judicial audit to be conducted to ensure that **ASIO** is operating in accordance with its charter, that it does not infringe civil liberties unjustifiably and that it is operating effectively and efficiently.

* I refer honourable members to a statement on **ASIO** that was issued by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  at the beginning of this week.

* The Opposition wants to be able to get people into this House so that it can ask detailed questions about the operation of **ASIO** and say: 'Well, you 've got the information; you have to tell the House; you have to be responsible to Parliament'.

* Really, if anybody wanted **ASIO** to be used as a political organisation by the party which happens to be in office at a particular time he would seek to give it that power.

* It will be of more advantage to Russian security organisationsthe KGB or something of that nature- for them to know how much money is going into **ASIO**, where it is spent and what are its priorities.

* What the Opposition is saying is that if **ASIO** identifies a spy in the Commonwealth Public Service- someone who is in a fairly senior position and whose existence one does not wish to disclose for a whole lot of security reasons, such as wishing to see who his other contacts are- one ought to tell him that he has had an adverse security report, warn him that he had been found out and give him the opportunity to appeal.

* Let it be said that this package of measures at least attempts to lay down a charter for **ASIO** and a definition of its functions, the extent of its powers and the rights of citizens with respect to the Organisation.

* Material before me establishes that there have at times been departures by **ASIO** from these principles.

* Mr Justice Hope was very discreet, but let us not pretend that we did not have our own McCarthyism in this society in the 1950s, that we did not have our own anti-communist hysteria and we did not have **ASIO** involved in the slime of those events.

* As  Mr Justice  Hope points out, there was much bias, inaccuracy and sheer waste involved in the material collected by **ASIO** in Australia.

* Mr Justice  White stated: 
Again, we know that **ASIO** in this country has leaked material to the Press in order to help to corrupt the democratic process itself.

* Information collected by **ASIO** surveillance has then been leaked and used politically.

* In this regard  Mr Justice  Hope stated: 
Evidence is available to me that satisfies me that **ASIO** has in the past provided selected people with security intelligence material for publication.

* We are not prepared to leave this legislation unchallenged because the present operators responsible for **ASIO**, the Attorney-General,  Senator Durack,  and the Director-General,  Mr Justice  Woodward, are men of integrity.

* We know that organisations like **ASIO** are themselves corrosive of the integrity of men, and others, with previous reputations ibr integrity, have been corroded by such organisations.

* Firstly, there is the supervision and accountability of **ASIO**.

* We want to institute a proper system of financial accountability for the organisation and we wish to reduce the inhibitions on public discussions of **ASIO**.

* Only by that whole complex of changes can we assure effective supervision of and accountability by **ASIO**.

* Let me take each of those briefly in turn and particularly the all important issue of the supervision and accountability of **ASIO**.

* It is exemplified by the Weimar phenomenon, or, in South Australia, the Salisbury phenomenon where the secret service believes it has a loyalty to some higher concept- to the state, to the Crown, or in the case of **ASIO**, to the Central Intelligence Agency; it has some loyalty over and above, higher and more important than its loyalty or responsibility to the elected executive.

* All of these situations which I have just mentioned- the Weimar, Salisbury and the **ASIO** responsibility to the CIA- deny the responsibility of the intelligence agency to the democratically elected government of the day.

* Further he argues that Ministers should not respond to parliamentary questions on **ASIO**.

* In addition he opposes provisions to ensure the presentation of an annual report by **ASIO** to the Parliament, and he is against adequate financial information on **ASIO** being placed before the Parliament.

* Whilst Justice Hope dismisses all of these proposals for the Parliament to play a role in **ASIO**- he says that none of those things are possible and that Parliament cannot play a rolebut at the same time he maintains that **ASIO** has a role in supervising individual politicians.

* The Labor Party believes that it is necessary to involve Parliament in the supervision of **ASIO**.

* -There are similarities between these secret arms of government and the role played by **ASIO**.

* Thus Parliament provides no answer in itself to the complex task of supervising and rendering **ASIO** accountable in Australian society.

* If honourable members have followed the argument that I have tried to build up about supervision of **ASIO**, they will see that what we need to meet a complex problem is a complex, multifaceted system of control.

* Believing that the autonomy of **ASIO** is the least recognised danger, the Labor Party would strengthen the powers of the Minister vis-a-vis the DirectorGeneral to ensure that the only information the Director-General could withhold from the Minister would be the content of files relating to particular individuals.

* Secondly, we would try to involve the Parliament by providing it with an annual report and financial information on **ASIO**.

* It is simply nonsense to suggest that useful information on these matters could not be provided to Parliament without endangering security of **ASIO** personnel.

* It was on that basis that we suggested that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted and that it provide, for example, for annual reports to the Parliament so that the Parliament itself could be fully informed of the activities of the intelligence organisation; that there be a regular, periodic judicial audit so that the guarantee was there that the organisation had complied with its charter and that it did not interfere with civil liberties; that it operated effectively and efficiently; that the responsible Minister be fully informed by the Director-General of **ASIO** on all matters other than the contents of files relating to particular individuals; that the Leader of the Opposition be fully and regularly briefed on all aspects if he so wished; that there be proper financial accountability of **ASIO**; that there be a redefinition of the concept of security and, in particular, the element of subversion in order to narrow its scope and limit the possibility of its misapplication; that the restriction of circumstances in which the times at which warrants may be issued also be properly controlled; that a security appeals system be given retrospective operation as recommended by the Hope report; that no person be denied notification of the existence of an adverse security assessment; and that communication of information purporting to identify an **ASIO** employee or agent be penalised only when such information would endanger the safety of such person or persons.

* Not only is the type of security checking objectionable on the grounds of civil liberties; it is also extremely wasteful of **ASIO** 's limited resources to identify those few people who will be genuine security risks.

* Operations such as that conducted by the South Australian Special Branch, and clearly also by **ASIO** in the past in conducting surveillance and maintaining files on people who are clearly not security risks, are not only a gross and unjustified infringement of civil liberties; they are an absurd waste of time and a waste of public money.

* The net of **ASIO** should be cast as narrowly as possible.

* At the Committee stage we will be moving amendments to each of the three elements of the definition of 'domestic subversion' under proposed section 5(1) in order to limit their scope and to prevent them being used as an excuse for stupid and objectionable forays by **ASIO** into domestic politics as distinct from domestic subversion.

* Firstly, we believe that subject to one exception there should be complete ministerial accountability for **ASIO**.

* Secondly, we believe that the Leader of the Opposition should be advised completely about the operation of **ASIO**.

* Thirdly, we believe that there should be annual reports to Parliament detailing the general operation of **ASIO**.

* Fourthly, we believe that a proper system of financial accountability of **ASIO** needs to be established.

* Fifthly, we believe that there should be regular judicial audit of **ASIO**.

* But the true effect of clause 8 (2) (c) is that it enables any Director-General of **ASIO** to withhold any information at any time from any Minister.

* **ASIO** is not, as clause 17(2) makes clear, a law enforcement agency.

* However, clause 8 makes a mockery of this enabling the Director-General of **ASIO** to withhold information from governments.

* It is our view that the Minister responsible for **ASIO**, the Attorney-General, should be entitled to access to all **ASIO** records, with one exception: We do not believe that Ministers should be entitled to inspect the files of individuals.

* There is no doubt that **ASIO** has, as have State police forces, engaged in unauthorised telephone tapping and bugging of premises.

* There should be an annual report to Parliament on the activities of **ASIO** during the previous year.

* On the question of accountability I want to make one point: It has been the practice over the last 30 years for Ministers responsible for **ASIO** to refuse to provide any information at all regarding **ASIO**.

* At present, no information at all is provided about **ASIO**, yet the Government is still talking about ministerial accountability.

* Clause 28 of the **ASIO** Bill, as it stands, allows the Director-General to issue warrants of 48-hour duration in emergency situations.

* Mr Justice  Hope, in talking about departures by **ASIO** from the principles of propriety and legality, said: 
It is not only a proper principle to intrude on a person's privacy as little as possible.

* It should also, in the main, be cost-effective for **ASIO** that it should do so.

* My impression is that **ASIO** may have made rather too little of open sources of information .

* Some **ASIO** officers have made the same kind of mistake.

* In view of this criticism and the dangers inherent in giving these new powers to **ASIO** it is essential to ensure that **ASIO** does not treat them as a new toy or does not rely on them when less intrusive methods of investigation are available.

* Unless the civil liberties of Australians are safeguarded and protected, we cannot support any new powers being given to **ASIO**.

* The Labor Government's two appointees to **ASIO** were  Mr Justice  Reed and  Mr Justice  Woodward, the present appointee.

* Significantly, they are the only two judicial appointments to **ASIO**.

* How could any government object to a judge taking a look at the performance of **ASIO**?

* One of the major objections to the **ASIO** Bill is that security assessments could be provided to others- for example, to State instrumentalities.

* As I have said, on behalf of the Opposition I move: 
What is the legality of the Attorney-General's actions in relation to the events of 16th March at Australian Security Intelligence Organisation offices in Canberra and Melbourne and the way in which officers of **ASIO** were treated; 
What will be the effects of the AttorneyGeneral's actions upon the capacity of **ASIO** to discharge its statutory responsibilities'.

* Where is the justification for the raid upon **ASIO** offices in Melbourne or in Canberra, only supported by the Prime Minister on the ground of the Attorney-General satisfying himself that he was receiving information when on the Attorney-General's own statement, volunteered in question time, he was not being deprived of any information?

* What was missing was the anticipated explanation of the infamous **ASIO** raids.

* It is probably not correct to say that that was the specific reason for the visit to the **ASIO** headquarters.

* But not a word about the visit to **ASIO**.

* It was a note prepared by an **ASIO** officer of a meeting on 2nd March.

* He and the Prime Minister have persistently refused to offer any explanation at all of the initial decision to go to **ASIO** headquarters in Canberra at any time.

* At about 7 a.m. that day a force of about 27 Commonwealth policemen arrived at the Melbourne headquarters of **ASIO** in St Kilda.

* Contrary to  Senator Murphy's  constant assertions, it is my belief that watchmen at the **ASIO** headquarters are not Commonwealth policemen nor are any of that force normally on **ASIO** premises.

* Apparently, already in the building was the Director-General of **ASIO**.

* This raises the corollary to the second point to be considered by a judicial inquiry - the justification for the actions preceding the Melbourne raid on **ASIO**.

* The staff of **ASIO** was stoic in this abuse.

* The tape and seals brought by the Commonwealth police to seal the safes would not stick, so the **ASIO** officers provided them with selotape from the office stores.

* Only with the specific authority of the Attorney-General could any officer of **ASIO** open a safe or otherwise retrieve papers, and then only those papers demanded by the Attorney-General.

* This raises the third point for a judicial inquiry - the nature of the authority of  Senator Murphy  in taking possession of information and treatment of **ASIO** staff concerned.

* **ASIO** together, addressed them and gave them a homily exhorting them to good behaviour and high morale.

* I cannot believe that other officers of **ASIO** who were held would not have sought assurances from the Director-General that a complaint had in fact been made.

* The classic example of saying nothing until the Parliament sat was a Press release on the AttorneyGeneral's official statement paper written in terms of 'discussions are understood to have taken place' between the **ASIO** DirectorGeneral and  Senator Murphy,  'it is expected that  Senator Murphy  will table', 'it is known that  Senator Murphy  has impressed' and  Senator Murphy  is eager to dispel'.

* When in 1949  Mr Chifley  established **ASIO** he built in safeguards to prevent its being used for political purposes of the Government of the day.

* **ASIO** has established close relations leading to the interchange of intelligence information with the security services of our allies and other countries in the Western world.

* In spite of a barrage of misleading and derogatory propaganda, **ASIO** has a reputation of being one of the best and most responsible security services in the world.

* Honourable members will have heard derogatory criticisms of **ASIO** which it has not been able to deny or affirm because if it affirms sometimes and does not affirm at other times, it gives information; if it denies sometimes and does not deny at other times it gives information, and so on.

* So **ASIO** has had to adopt this attitude of refusing to confirm or deny, as I did as AttorneyGeneral in this House.

* I have heard people talk about **ASIO** documents floating around.

* Apparently he did not see any **ASIO** documents lying around and, of course, the Intelligence Organisation is staffed by firstclass professional men whom you would be proud to call your friends for they are true Australian patriots and they are just as devoted enemies of the extreme Right as they are of the extreme Left.

* The damage which the raid has caused to the standing of **ASIO** in the eyes of all other world intelligence services to receive their information cannot be measured.

* Their safety is preserved by other services - so should it be by **ASIO** - but can an agent have this confidence if a political Minister, accompanied by executive police, can seize files?

* What trust in the security of critical and sensitive information will foreign agencies now place in **ASIO**?

* The issue comes down to this: What possible justification could  Senator Murphy  have had for raiding **ASIO** with a platoon of Commonwealth Police?

* **ASIO** raids.

* What he fails to do, and what the judicial inquiry must determine, is assess the effect on **ASIO** of the events of the 16th March and since.

* **ASIO** officers were mere accomplices in this conspiracy theory, as were the Commonwealth Police.

* Why use one part of the conspiracy, the Commonwealth Police, to raid another part of the conspiracy, **ASIO**?

* We had  Senator Murphy  implying that his actions were taken because if he did not sneak up on **ASIO** and catch it unawares, **ASIO** would deliberately destroy data he should properly have.

* The judicial inquiry must determine how much, or if at all, the Public Service can be blamed for the **ASIO** raid.

* Could it be that he was stimulated to this act by an erratic adviser with an over-developed sense of drama who promised him all sorts of mysteries in the **ASIO** files- someone who thought he knew the mysteries?

* There has been a vitriolic and totally unwarranted attack on the probity and competence of **ASIO** from sections of the ALP for more than a decade.

* The **ASIO** report of the 2nd March meeting interpreted in one way at best gave  Senator Murphy  an unsatisfactory excuse to grandstand at **ASIO**.

* The contempt the Labor Party has shown to the Parliament in answering questions on the **ASIO** raids and explaining their purpose and effects has led us to call for a judicial inquiry of 3 judges into the whole question.

* In fact the operations of foreign agents in this country are the responsibility of **ASIO** which necessarily works in secret and reports to the Minister.

* The head of **ASIO**-  Mr Justice  Woodward- was appointed by the Whitlam Government.

* What this proposal in fact says, in essence, is that the Opposition has no confidence in the direction of **ASIO**.

* I think **ASIO** does an excellent job under very difficult circumstances.

* There is no practical way in which **ASIO**'s activities could be taken over or controlled by a parliamentary committee.

* I say again that the essence of the proposal is a vote of no confidence in the direction of **ASIO** and the head of **ASIO** who was appointed by the Whitlam Government.

* By the way, a very strong motive to destroy **ASIO** seems to exist in some parts of the Labor Party.
