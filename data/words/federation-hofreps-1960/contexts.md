## Contexts in which the word "federation" was used in the hofreps during the 1960s

* and  Mr. L.  H. Heaslip, representing the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation;  Mr. H.  W. Adcock, representing the Australian Woollen and Worsted Textile Manufacturers Association; and  Sir William  Gunn, K.B.E., C.M.G., whois the  chairman  of the existing Australian Wool Bureau.

* We all know that primarily Malaysia was the concern of the United Kingdom, the Federation of Malaya and the territories involved.

* Many of us in Australia would have liked to see the emergence of something like a Melanesian **federation** in that area, because it is foolish to draw an arbitrary line across a large island like New Guinea -  3s  we have done between the Territory of Papua and New Guinea and the Territory of West New Guinea, and to say, " Here is one nation, and there is another "..

* We receive nothing at all except the grants that the Government makes - I acknowledge them freely - to the Australian Olympic Federation to help meet the expenses every four years of an Olympic team or a Commonwealth Games team.

* I recognize the Wheat and Wool Growers Association and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation as the radical voices of the wool-growers with 2,000 or 3,000 sheep rather than the two organizations that are recognized by this bill.

* In 62 years of **federation**, the Labour Party has been in office for only fourteen years.

* After all, the States make up the **federation**.

* We can go back to the days of **federation**, when we advocated the protection of Australian industry.

* As to the honorable member for Barker  (Mr. Forbes),  I was astounded earlier in this debate to hear that gentleman -I use the term only to comply with the Standing Orders - describe the honorable member for Barton  (Mr. Reynolds)  as being the leader of a pressure group and a member of the Teachers Federation.

* Some of its leading members, I believe, include Judah Waten, a well-known Communist Party writer; and Sam Goldbloom of the Communist-sponsored International Congress for Peace and Disarmament, of which the organizing secretary is Ernest Platz, a member of the so-called World Federation of Democratic Journalists.

* This has been the Opposition's method since Federation.

* by leave - It is my pleasure to inform the House that the Government intends within the next few days to open a diplomatic mission at Lagos, the capital of the Federation of Nigeria.

* There has been, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, just about since Federation, provision to allow for variations of the quota of constituents in an electorate to 20 per cent, above or 20 per cent.

* I think this leads to the conclusion that there is a deliberate attempt by the Sydney branch of the **federation** and by the job delegates of that branch to stop effective work on the Sydney waterfront.

* The Malayan people have expressed appreciation, through their leader, of the work done by the Australians in ridding the Malayan jungles of Communists and in assisting Malaya - now joined with other countries in the Federation of Malaysia - towards nationhhood so that it can become a worthwhile member of the Commonwealth of Nations.

* What happens now in relation to the payment of increased social service benefits has been happening to my knowledge for the last twenty years, and probably for a lot longer - perhaps ever since pensions were introduced soon after Federation.

* In Regina v. Spicer and others, ex parte Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, reported in Commonwealth Law Reports volume 100 at page 313, the House will see that the High Court held that a section giving a right of appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court was invalid in that it purported to confer on a judicial body created under chapter 3 of the Constitution powers of a non-judicial character.

* Also, our contribution to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaya, in which our forces play a notable part in the anti-terrorist operations, at the request of the Federation Government, and in adding to the security of the area.

* The Marine Board has lost over 200 a month in port revenue, without taking into consideration the very important fact that members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and the town as a whole, have suffered a considerable loss of income.

            diseases out of Australia, apart from one or two minor outbreaks, ever since **federation**.

* Protection has been the policy of all Australian governments since **federation**.

* Under **federation** the States have responsibilities and the Commonwealth has its responsibilities in this problem of decentralisation; but there is no better electorate than Kalgoorlie to spotlight what the Commonwealth is doing to overcome the problem and to meet its responsibilities.

* Perhaps the Minister may be able to tell me whether there is any reason now why a person from the Northern Territory could not be put on the committee, perhaps as one of the representatives of the Graziers Federation.

* Perhaps I should add that  in a **federation** where six State premiers have a vested interest in not paying more than they have to for the money they use in building great capital facilities for the services of the public there may be an inhibiting factor which does not obtain to the same degree in the United Kingdom or the United States of America.

* But this Government has resisted not only the representations that have been made from year to year by members of the Opposition but also the recommendations and representations made by parents and citizens organi sations, the Australian Teachers Federation and academics generally, and certainly those made by the State Ministers for Education and Directors of Education.

* Unless we can obtain the services of the real leaders of this country outside the Parliament, whether they be in the industrial, pastoral, or financial spheres, assisted by those government departments associated with the movement of population, every government will fail in this objective as all governments have failed since **federation**.

* The Philp Committee recommended that the Australian Wool Industry Conference be created, that it be comprised of 20 members from the Australian Wool Growers Council, 20 members from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, six merino stud breeders, one Corndale breeder, one Pol worth breeder and one representative of breeders of British breeds.

* T remind honorable members, particularly those who come from north Queensland, that the financial provision which the Commonwealth has made for the Mount Isa railway is in point of fact the largest provision that has been made by any Commonwealth government for a State project in the history of our **federation**.

* Further, the Prime Minister said his reputation had grown steadily since 1952 when he first entered politics in the Nigerian Federation.

* Port facilities, and the loading facilities in the ports, have since **federation** been a matter, as schooling has been, entirely within the responsibility of the State governments, and this responsibility is delegated to special port authorities.

* It is a reflection on this country that a great electorate like Gwydir, which has been in existence, I believe, since **federation**, should be wiped out - not reduced in area as one might have expected but wiped out - and other country electorates enlarged.

* Last week-end  Mr. J.  R. James, secretary of the Queensland Employers Federation - not a Labour man - pleaded for positive action to relieve unemployment among juniors.

* The decisive point was reached when a representative from, I think, the Victorian Trades and Labour Council asked a woman representative of the Teachers Federation how much the introduction of equal pay for women would cost.

* These issues were such that the division of the parties in those days, not only in the colonies but also, after **federation**, in the Commonwealth, was based on them.

* I remember that during my term in the shipping industry numerous deputations from the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia came to see me, generally with the plea for the establishment of an Australian overseas line.

* We saw that even in our own **federation**.

* As the  president  of the Federation of Australian Taxpayers Associations said recently, this Budget is a tired old men's budget.

* The Parliamentary Public Works Committee examined the matter and heard evidence from a great many people, including Captain Shields, who gave evidence on behalf of the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* For instance, the Waterside Workers Federation in my constituency gave 2,000.

* I have grave doubts whether it met with the approval of the full executive of the Waterside Workers Federation itself.

* I think the time has come,  Mr. Chairman,  when, in the interests of all honorable members, I should say - I speak with a longer experience than any other Minister for Social Services since **federation** has hadthat there is no aspect of social services which has not been carefully examined by successive Ministers for Social Services and by the officers of the Department of Social Services.

* I say that no government, in the history of **federation**, has provided more opportunity for the discussion of private members' business, on the days set aside for that purpose, than has this Government.

* That democratic and constitutional process has been made freshly evident in the last few days first by the report of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral after the examination of the situation in North Borneo and Sarawak and more recently by the results of the free elections in Singapore, which clearly show that the majority of the people of Singapore endorse the action of their Prime Minister in joining with the **federation**.

* Conservative parties have been in government in this country most of the time since **federation**, yet until now they have always supported leasehold as against freehold titles for pastoral land in the Northern Territory.

* As the people of northern New South Wales are predominantly of English, Irish and Scottish descent, and the English have an implacable, cold determination, the Scots a dour determination and the Irish great fighting qualities, will the right honorable gentleman have regard to the fact that all these characteristics are being brought to bear on the effort to enable another State to enter the Australian Commonwealth in the same way as, recently, two new States were admitted' to the American **federation**, bringing the number of American States from 48 to 50?

* At the beginning of **federation**, when our population was four million and our annual Budget was about $10m or $15m, Parliament sat on 113 days.

* Taxation in Australia today is more unfair than ever before in the history of our **federation**.

* We now know that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund contains certain provisos and has strings attached to it in much the same way as the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  wants to attach strings to the provision of long-service leave for members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I am glad to say that lately foremen stevedores who were members of the Waterside Workers Federation have resigned, and have become members of the Foremen Stevedores Association.

* When the honorable member refers to something which is happening in the Waterside Workers Federation now, that is something which will happen in the future - forget it!

* Indeed, I am proud to recall that it was during my term as Minister for Labour and National Service that the first Australian conference on industrial safety in the history of this **federation** - it was held here in Canberra - was organized.

* It resulted in the following survey being provided by the Teachers' Federation.

* I do not know whether the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has considered this aspect, but it could have a serious effect, especially on the younger pilots.

* Last week I met the Australian Dairy Industry Council and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation to discuss this very problem and from those discussions we felt that the best way to tackle the problem would be to set up a committee representative of interested bodies to assess what the problem was, the area and the degree of it, and to try to come up with ways and means of coping with this rather difficult situation.

* Whether or not it was purely a decision of the Government that the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation should be the only bodies to represent the wool producers or to have representatives on the Australian Wool Industry Conference is not a matter for debate in this House now.

* On 16th September, representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation visited Canberra and stated that the increase would need to be at least 10s.

* Has the Minister noticed that the International Olympic Federation has decided that for the next two or three years at least it will accept teams from both West Germany and East Germany, even though the East German team is to be known by a different name?

* Air transport did not precede Federation.

* While the argument about West Irian was active Indonesia apparently accepted the Federation of Malaysia calmly and certainly without any sign of hostility.

* Some Catholic schools are overcrowded and lack teaching facilities, but if one can judge by the clamour that is made by the Premiers of the States, by the Teachers Federation, by parents and by teachers' organisations, so are many of the State schools overcrowded and lacking in teaching facilities.

* In its seventeen years of office, this Government has brought about more improvements in our social welfare legislation than were introduced in all the other years since Federation in 1901.

* Every successive Government since the days of **federation** has allowed a variation of 20% above and below the electoral quota to enable more representatives from country areas than would be the case if there were one vote one value.

* The whole history of referendums in this country, no matter what the honorable member for East Sydney may say about the prospects of getting approval from the people for these recommendations, is that in 61 years of **federation** only four out of 24 referendum proposals have been approved, and those four were concerned with comparatively minor matters, two of them very minor.

* Is the Minister aware that more than 2,000 exservicemen are engaged as members of the Waterside Workers Federation on the Sydney waterfront and that that core is claimed to be the main component of the discontent in Sydney arising out of the non payment of the award public holiday entitlement for Anzac Day this year?

* Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and other interests.

* Discussions are being held, under the chairmanship of  Mr. Woodward,  between the Waterside Workers Federation and employers, and we hope for progress as time proceeds.

* Would the Australian Government accept a union or a **federation** between North Vietnam and South Vietnam?

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether it is a fact that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia was fined 500 for contempt of court by the Commonwealth Industrial Court because of a stoppage of work in Melbourne on 15th March last.

* Is the Prime Minister aware that the new syllabus has been received with lack of enthusiasm by every branch of the Christian Church, that it has been temporarily suspended and that the New South Wales Minister proposes a review by a committee of departmental officers and representatives of the New South Wales Teachers Federation?

* When in 1956 the Government reviewed the policy, which had been followed since Federation, of not admitting persons of non-European origin for permanent residence, it introduced several significant reforms.

* The Government commends the Grants Commission for the valuable work it has done over the years in developing the principles and methods which have contributed so much to the progress of the less wealthy States and of the Federation as a whole.

* It is most unfortunate that expressions such as " confrontation " and " crush the new Federation of Malaysia " have been used so freely.

* Mr. John  Burgess, a director of the Textile Federation, has been very critical of the frequency of these inquiries.

* More than half of this amount was incurred by the
              Waterside Workers' Federation, the rest being borne by eight other unions.

* Discussions were held between representatives of the trade unions, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service and we worked out a formula that was regarded as satisfactory to all parties, including the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Such an arrangement would also attract more attention to the balanced development of Australia; to the better use of our natural resources; to the attraction of population away from our overcrowded metropolitan areas; to the strengthening of our **federation** generally and of our parliamentary system; and ultimately to the objective that the New England New State Movement so ardently seeks - more selfgoverning areas in the Commonwealth.

* Finally, is it the responsibility of the Waterside Workers Federation to see that the safety measures applying to its industry are adhered to?

* At that time separate colonies were taking action to exclude non-European people from Australia and the demand for a white Australia policy was part of a tide of fervent nationalism which led to Federation.

* The Department's air safety investigators have been assisted by experts from the Defence Standards Laboratory, the University of Melbourne, the Aeronautical Research Laboratories, the manufacturer of the aircraft and many of its components, the engine manufacturer, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and Ansett-ANA.

* Prior to the implementation of permanent employment, there were small pockets of permanent employment in the industry under special arrangements negotiated between the Waterside Workers Federation and particular stevedoring employers.

* The Government set up a committee under the chairmanship of  Sir Alexander  Fitzgerald to ascertain the national debt of the Post Office since **federation** in 1901.

* The policy in question, I might add, is one which has, as I said in a reply to a question yesterday, been supported ever since **federation** by both sides of this Parliament.

* Four of them are representatives of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and four are representatives of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, and there is an independent  chairman.

* Is the Minister aware of the hostile reaction of the Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers Association and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to this measure?

* The circular that has been sent around also revealed that a  Mr. Kurashige,  who is  president  of the Japanese Wool Importers Federation, gave evidence against the opening of secondary markets to the committee of inquiry into wool marketing.

* The difficulty to which the honorable member refers arises from the fact that Australia's original defence support to Malaysia was given when the Federation was intact and before the separation of Singapore from Malaysia.

* He is a prominent member of the Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the executive of which has asked for a committee of inquiry.

* This is to be associated with the 100,000 tons of flour that Ceylon buys each year by negotiation, the protected market for 80,000 tons of flour in the Malayan Federation, the restraint of competition in subsidized flour as a result of negotiation with the German Government and more secure sales of flour to Indonesia that we are working towards.

* That reminds me that while the Minister was in that condition we were waiting for the Attorney-General to come into the House to assist us in this matter, and we were informed that he was doing the job that the Minister for Labour and National Service could not do, for he was trying to soften up  Mr. Healy,  the well-known Communist, who is leader of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* More has been done by this Government in the past five years in the search for wider marketing opportunities than has previously been done by all Australian Commonwealth Governments since **federation**.

* It might interest honorable gentlemen to know that by the time we conclude this session we shall have broken all previous records in the history of Federation for the volume of legislation with which Parliament has dealt in a year.

* Some time ago I arranged for the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to make a full submission to my Department expressing its views on this matter.

* I suggest that he is completely out of step with them because this Bill and what it stands for has been approved by the Dairy Farmers Federation.

* Later on the Secretary of the Department of Labour and National Service met with officers of the Trades and Labour Council and later with representatives of the contractors and the Western Australian Employers' Federation.

* The irony of it is that a motion of no confidence on the ground of the Government's untruthfulness is presented by a man who, as Leader of the Opposition, has established a record for lack of credibility unequalled, in my experience, in the history of Federation.

* We must all admire the way in which some members, particularly of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, have departed from deeply and sincerely held views over a very long period in order to bring the two parts of the industry together.

* That agreement makes provision for the maintenance of Australian forces in the Malayan Federation within the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve, which is the particular structure.

* If you,  Mr. Chairman,  look at the political history of Australia and the variety of governments that have held office since Federation, you will be struck by the fact that from time to time we have had antiLabour Governments, the political complexion of a majority of which has been of a Liberal or Conservative character.

* On this occasion both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation have indicated their willingness to consult on a matter that will be discussed by this House, but the Prime Minister has stated that he is not prepared to consult until after this Bill has been passed.

* Legislation of this nature was being applied by the Australian States well before Federation.

* Does the Prime Minister agree that many and basic changes have taken place in Australia's economic potential and requirements since **federation** and, indeed, in the last decade?

* I am the only member of this Parliament since Federation who has American blood in his veins.

* In view of the fact that, at the opening sales on Monday of this week wool prices declined by from 5 per cent, to 7i per cent, and in view of the request from growers and grower organizations for action to improve the financial position of the industry, 1 ask the Minister whether he will give consideration to the suggestion by the Wool and1 Meat Producers' Federation that he call for a referendum of growers on the proposals put forward by that organization.

* In favour: 61  -  Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Cameroun, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Leopoldville), Costa Rica, Dahomey, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Federation of Malaya, France, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Mauritania, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela.

* Over the years since **federation** the meetings of the Standing Orders Committee have been held at somewhat irregular periods.

* He was Prime Minister of Australia during six significant years of the history of our young Commonwealth and relatively early in the life of our Federation.

* In 1967 the International Federation of Cotton and Allied Textile Industries prepared a comparison of average hourly -wages in the textile industry.

* State fisheries legislation applies inside the 3-mile limit and has so applied since Federation.

* The fault for this must be squarely and solidly placed at the door of the two wool-growing organizations which are to comprise the conference - the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* It is not so long since the Constitutional Review Committee was appointed to deliberate and report on the need for alterations to the Constitution in the light of all that has happened since **federation**.

* I understand that not more than 600 individuals have served as members of this House since Federation.

* Altogether eighteen groups are now operating, with a membership of about 700 farmers, and the  president  of the **federation** of farm management advisory services has suggested that an additional eight groups might well be in operation within six months.

* I believe that the calling up of young men is the most contemptible action that any government in this country has carried out in the  66  years since Federation.

* I think it is obvious to everybody that for a long time the Waterside Workers Federation has been in the wrong hands.

* Not only do complaints come from parents and citizens associations; they come from the Teachers' Federation, from the secondary school teachers' association and from the primary teachers' association, all of whom are concerned with these problems.

* As a result of the sound, sensible defence planning of the Government in relation to manpower, equipment and the procurement of supplies generally, Australia now finds itself in a situation where it has the best and the best equipped defence forces ever in its history as a **federation**.

* Of course, this was before **federation**.

* In 1941, he joined the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and on 16th December, 1941, he joined the Services.

* In 1939, after all but eight and one-half years of Liberal-Country Party government since **federation**, the only social service benefits paid by the Government were age and invalid pensions, involving  a  total annual expenditure of $36m.

* I am one who possibly does not agree with the leadership of unions like the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union, but the fact that I may not agree with some of their officials is no reason for saying they are wrong, or are not putting forward a proper case for their members.

* So it was that in 1950 this Government recognized, for the first time in nearly 50 years of **federation**, that the housing of our aged people was one of our most pressing social problems.

* A report by the New South Wales Teachers Federation tells us that fewer than half of the 10,000 secondary school teachers in New South Wales State schools have university degrees or diplomas.

* A decision such as this has never previously been taken since Federation in that Australian nationals will be sent to a war in which modern nuclear weapons could be used; and I submit that we are virtually on the brink of a nuclear war now.

* We have some sort of letter of affiliation or commitment to the Federation of Malaysia.

* The Minister for National Development clearly answered him when he said that Australia happens to be a **federation** in which States have sovereign rights and are very proud of their own irrigation and water conservation departments and public works construction authorities.

* So the honorable member approached none other than  Mr. Roach,  the Communist secretary of the Port Kembla Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In addition, they are unfortunately more or less at the mercy of the Communist-controlled Seamen's Union and Waterside Workers Federation.

* Furthermore, as yesterday's disgraceful scenes in Djakarta have arisen over the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, does the Australian Government believe that the attitude of Indonesia towards Malaysia represents a threat to peace?

* But the Australian Labour Party seems to have some fixed idea that if there is any weighting of country electorates, such as there has been since Federation and such as there is in the large country electorates which are represented by many Labour members, it is gerrymandering.

* One must state forthwith that the two other successor States to the Central African Federation, Zambia and Malawi, cannot be said to have bad governments.

* When I was negotiating an arrangement with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in 1958, I pointed out, before the conclusion of the arrangement, which included this provision about rubber, that there was to be established in Australia a synthetic rubber industry, and that it might prove to be necessary to impose a duty on raw rubber to protect that synthetic rubber industry.

* Some fines were imposed by the Commonwealth Industrial Court in respect of applications under section 109 in relation to the Waterside Workers' Federation.

* Section 1 27, 1 believe, is an anachronism which survives from the early days of **federation**.

* I ask the Treasurer whether he is aware of the excellent work carried out amongst the youth of the community in New South Wales by the Federation of Police-Citizens Boys' Clubs.

* It has been used since **federation** because every Treasurer, when producing a budget, has used it.

* Now let us come to what has happened in the Australian Railways Union in Victoria, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union.

* That would be contrary to the spirit of **federation**.

* In the early days of **federation**, before we had air travel, members from Western Australia were required to travel by train to and from parliamentary sessions.

* It is kept under control among groups, towns, districts and the states of a **federation** by the rule of law.

* The honorable member for Cowper won for Labour a seat which has never been held by the Labour Party since **federation**.

* If this boycott is extended to Australia because of Australian support for the idea of the Federation of Malaysia - I know thai the  Deputy  Prime Minister cannot anticipate, a crisis,, which has not.

* Watching the influences at work inside the State system - I make no apology for introducing this - one cannot disregard Communist influence in the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* When was it decided to charge interest on capital works expenditure, dating back to Federation, in the development of the Australian Post Office?

* Is it a fact that the Waterside Workers Federation throughout Australia is today continuing its planned campaign involving 24-hour stoppages at all ports?

* Milner said that the solution was not a close union in which Afrikaaner nationalism would triumph over the English-speaking viewpoint, but a loose **federation** in which the Cape could maintain its franchise and in which the franchise would be extended to Natal and inevitably, if the natives were really participating in government, would spread farther.

* The Tasmanian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation finds that the number of its members is rapidly dwindling with the growth of mechanization and the use of roll-on, roll-off ships.

* Governments, and especially central governments in a **federation** such as ours, have a positive role in the matter.

* I say that this measure will create more confusion than any other piece of legislation that has ever been placed on the statute book since the inception of Federation.

* The Australian Leather and Allied Trades Employees Federation has expressed much concern over the position and its Branch in my State, Queensland, has advocated restrictions on the export of hides.

* 75 of 1966, which provides for an amendment of the Customs ("Prohibited Exports) Regulations and which bears the signature of the Minister for 

 Sir, the right honourable gentleman's defence is one of the weakest that has been put up by a Prime Minister since Federation.

* I have here, without time to read it al'l, a statement in the Tasmanian Farmer', which is the paper of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* It was said very positively that the concept of territorial waters no longer operated and never did operate; that the various sovereign Australian States at the time of Federation had no rights whatever in respect of the long prevalent theory of territorial seas.

* In my opinion, and in the opinion of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation, this provision amounted to a kind of double-banking.

* This Parliament has almost twice as many members as it had at the time of Federation, or even as recently as 1946.

* There have been a number of meetings in recent years where university teaching staff, hospital consultants and others involved in undergraduate, resident and postgraduate medical education have been able to discuss the major problems involved, in particular, a very successful joint conference on medical education, sponsored by the Australian Postgraduate Federation in Medicine and the Australian Medical Association was held in Canberra in 1967.

* Firstly, the membership of the House of Commons is vastly greater than ours is or is likely to be for a long time; and that House has wider responsibilities, exercising many functions of government carried out by the States in our Federation.

* Can the Minister for Labour and National Service tell the House which trade union leaders received on May Day congratulatory telegrams and letters from Liu Ning-Yi, the  president  of the so-called All China Federation of Trade Unions?

* I agree with the Australian Teachers Federation that there should be an' inquiry into primary and secondary education, but, in my view, the purpose of the inquiry should be, not to establish that education in those fields is a Commonwealth responsibility, but to establish where the responsibility lies.

* Owing to the fact that the wharf labourers were unable to get transport to their jobs on Sundays, it was agreed by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the shipowners that no work would be done on the waterfront on Sundays.

* Representatives of the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation were members of the Australian team at the negotiating conference, and made valuable contributions to the work of the delegation.

* The fact is that the legislatures of the colonies prior to **federation** were called assemblies.

* The Post Office was required to pay interest on money provided for its capital works programme only from 1959 onwards, when the principle of paying interest was introduced, but the Government decided that interest should be charged on all money provided for the capital works programme since Federation in 1901.

* I can go further and say that the reasons sometimes given by the officials of the Waterside Workers Federation for calling the strikes are usually associated with United States support of the South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam.

* Historically, there have been three major nomenclature changes in Australia's customs tariffs since Federation.

* 1 had not intended to participate in this debate but after hearing the contribution made by the honourable member for Higinbotham  (Mr Chipp)  I am impelled to do so for personal reasons and because of my special obligations to my constituents, particularly the 700 of them who are members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* My own leader, for several years past, has put the argument that we merely wish the people of the whole island to be given the opportunity, in sections, if you wish, to determine how they shall be governed - independently, as part of Indonesia or as part of some Melanesian **federation**, if they wish, within the British Commonwealth of Nations.

* Between 1942 and 1948 a number of them were gradually absorbed into the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Recently the  President  of the Victorian Employers Federation visited the city of Bendigo.

* He is a former  president  of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation and later served as a member of the Dairy Industry Investigation Committee from its inception in 1953 until it was disbanded in 1962.

* I am sure that any honorable member who surveys what has been happening in SouthEast Asia will agree that the dangers and threats are now far greater than they were even at the time when the Federation of Malaysia was born on 16th September last.

* Is it also a fact that the Port Kembla Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation agreed to an increase in the quota of 100 men and that a list of names was submitted?

* When I remind members that there are thousands of post office buildings, many of which were erected prior to **federation** and which should be replaced, I think they will have some sympathy with me in my endeavour to make the $202m which was available to us this year spread over the obligations that we have to meet.

* This system has been in operation ever since Federation and has deterred departments from disposing of land and buying land in other more suitable locations.

* Indeed, it is the only government since **federation** which has progressively increased rates, liberalized the means test and granted additional assistance for the children of civilian widows and, within the limits of the income means test, granted allowances for each child of the civilian widow.

* These would include sites for various purposes (post offices, exchanges, line depots, drill halls, rifle ranges, &amp;c.) and many of them were transferred to the Commonwealth at **federation**.

* In Australia, the principle became part of the law of the Commonwealth shortly after Federation when section 61 of the Defence Act 1903 exempted from the general obligation of service in time of war 'persons whom the doctrines of their religion forbid to bear arms or perform military service'.

* It would be as well to look at the official statistics, not the statistics which have been dragged out by the Teachers Federation and other organizations which are trying to make a case for a salary increase or for some other purpose.

* Since **federation**, Western Australia has been incorporated compulsorily in a common market as a purchaser of manufactured goods from the other States, which, in turn, require very little from Western Australia.

* It has the right to receive nominations submitted by the Waterside Workers Federation and it has limited powers to investigate the medical and other records of people whose names are submitted.

* In the first instance, I want to bring to the notice of members the increase in the complexity of the work, the amount of work in the whole range of activities for which this Parliament is responsible, and the fact that in recent years we have met consistently less than Parliament met in the early years of Federation, in the 1920's, or even the late 1940's.

* Would the Minister agree that the wise fathers of **federation** probably did not envisage that section 128 of the Constitution would ultimately deny to a population numbering hundreds of thousands the right to vote on proposals to alter the Constitution?

* I think that it was a very perilous argument to come from the Leader of a political party that at the last election received the greatest drubbing ever given to a political party since Federation.

* He was promoted to be Assistant Parliamentary Librarian in 1928 and became the third Parliamentary Librarian since **federation** on his promotion to that office in 1947. 
 in reply - I did not know that the honorable member for Parkes  (Mr. Haylen)  intended to raise this subject to-night, but before the House adjourns 1 should like to make one or two observations in reply to what he has said.

* As I said this afternoon, if the Government decided to let in a not inconsiderable number of illegitimate Japanese children, it would enunciate a new principle altogether, not merely in international relations, but certainly in the immigration policies that have hitherto been accepted by all sides of politics since the **federation** of this country.

* The first was  Mr. Allan  McLean, who was, before **federation**, a Premier of Victoria.

* I should just like to make the point that since **federation** referendums have been held on fourteen occasions, and 26 questions have been submitted to the people in this way.

* By way of preface to a question addressed to the Acting Prime Minister, I refer the right honorable gentleman to the pleasing and courteous practice which has been observed since **federation**, and which is in accordance with the dignity of this Parliament, whereby a Minister, in accepting a public engagement in the electorate of another member, subjects that acceptance to two conditions.

* I am very glad, too, that the honorable gentleman has drawn attention to the problem because I think that rank and file members of the trade union movement must be warned that now that the Communists have failed in some union elections, particularly in the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Waterside Workers Federation,, they will be trying every method that they can to foment industrial disputes.

* In the 67 years since **federation** only 600 individuals have been members of the House of Representatives.

* But because of what has been achieved in New Guinea through education and by bringing the local people to a higher level of understanding of what is happening in the world, these people now know what is happening and are concerned about the fact that their blood brothers in West Irian are faced with becoming part and parcel of a **federation** to which they do not want to belong.

* As to the importance attached to education, I do not think anybody could seriously argue that any government in the history of the Australian Federation has done more than the Government of my predecessor to assist the States with the development of education facilities.

* Much misunderstanding will be overcome by the adoption of the new method suggested by the industry, which is to set up a dairy cost index committee, made up of representatives from the equalization committee, the Dairy Produce Board and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation to determine, in consultation with the Division of Agricultural Economics, as has always been the case, the cost movements.

* These provisions have remained unchanged since **federation**.

* History knows Henry Parkes as a founder of **federation**.

* I think the deputation represented in the main, State organizations and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* In view of the fact that these guaranteed prices seem to have
              had the desired effect of inducing primary producers to ship their lamb early, will
              the Government now extend the increased minimum' price guarantee to cover all lamb
              shipped from Tasmania, and so remove the unfair discrimination against us, and against
              the spirit of Federation, having in mind that we are unable to ship during the earlier
              three months period because of our climatic conditions?

* The Commonwealth Government has been taking an increasing interest, and making increasing financial provision, in the field of education, going beyond anything contributed by any prior Government in the history of the Federation.

* Has the right honorable gentleman's attention been drawn to a statement made yesterday by the  president  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that he had asked the All-China Federation of Trade Unions of Communist China to send two delegates and!

* The honourable member for Oxley sought to make much of the fact that in the Commonwealth hostels case the Commonwealth has appealed against the decision of the Conciliation Commissioner,  Mr Clarkson,  who awarded equal pay for women and men in an application for an award by the Liquor and Allied Trades Federation.

* The secretary of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation was reported as claiming that many waterside workers would be inconvenienced or unable to get to work on 25th September because of the 24-hour rail stoppage.

* In the question I drew attention to the fact that the Victorian Employers Federation had suggested, in relation' to this matter, that the Postal Department be handed to an independent board with complete powers of internal management.

* Certain superannuation funds are made available to public service organizations' building funds, such as that conducted by the New Soutn Wales Teachers Federation.

* I refer also to the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria has also refused to allow its members to work on Sundays and has held unauthorized stop-work meetings.

* Honorable members may be interested to know - I am sure,  Mr. Speaker,  that this is a matter of which you are aware physically - that this Twenty-fifth Parliament has established an all-time record in the history of Federation for the volume of legislation carried through the Parliament in the course of a year.

* This has been done in the greatest **federation**.

* Surely it is possible in our **federation** as well.

* If they wanted a change, they should go to a board of reference and if the board of reference gave a decision adverse to the Waterside Workers Federation, the shipowners would facilitate an appeal and would do everything possible to simplify the appeal before the presidential member.

* To show that it was not the shipowners who were at fault, the Australian Council of Trade Unions ordered the **federation** to go to the presidential member responsible for waterside matters.

* It is one which ought to be welcomed by honorable members on both sides, by the Waterside Workers Federation and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* As the honorable member for Blaxland  (Mr. E. James Harrison)  has said, section 36, which first introduced penalties, was introduced by a Labour Government on the recommendation of a Communist -  Mr. Jim  Healy, the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In the main, it may well be that the consequences of the establishment of a strong and united Europe, whether it be by the formation of a **federation** or a conferederation, as the Prime Minister suggested, will affect the future of the world and will ultimately bring to Australia far more benefits than we may get by short-term insistence on the maintenance of the present order.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation submitted to me for consideration a request that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics undertake a survey of certain aspects of the industry.

* I have received a communication from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation containing items of importance.

* He was a delegate to a recent meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions in Budapest.

* You have to be fairly strong stomached to be a delegate to a meeting of that **federation** in Hungary.

* Not only did he attend that meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions which is denounced by the Labour Party as a proCommunist front, but in fact he chaired some of the sessions.

* This balance is the balance either of equivocation or, in the case of the honorable member for Reid, a distinct refusal to recognise that Malaysia is entirely in the right, despite the fact that the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations conducted a thorough investigation of the question whether a majority of people in the Borneo and Sarawak territories wished to join the **federation** and found that they did.

* What are the obligations of our forces in the event of internal dissension between the components of the Federation of Malaysia?

* At page 71 he says - 
I ask the PostmasterGeneral - and I ask as one who hates to see the means of mass communication and mass' persuasion in the hands of a few millionaires: Will the Postmaster-General act on the view of the  President  of the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should cater only for the minority audience and leave popular programmes to commercial stations?

* In view of the incessant demands of the States for more money to carry out their individual programmes and to meet their financial commitments, and of the national responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to protect the nation's economic stability and security, will the Prime Minister call together, as early as practicable, a convention of the States and the Commonwealth to discuss, first, means by which the resources of the nation can best be applied to the orderly development of Australia as a whole and, secondly, how within the framework of this national objective the States can operate on a formula to give equity to each State and at the same time preserve its sovereign rights in the **federation**?

* This Parliament has not shown itself over eager to increase its size during the period of our **federation**.

* In fact, since 1901 when the **federation** was formed there has been only one substantial increase in the size of this Parliament.

* There has not been, on an average, a redistribution every six years in the life of the **federation**.

* I have already pointed out that this is not the way that this system works - as the history of our **federation** has demonstrated.

* I repeat that it has been done but once in the history of our **federation**.

* The proposal to form a political union, whether a **federation**, or confederation, or some other kind of association, was also discussed.

* The convention of 1891 was presided over by  Sir Henry  Parkes, whom we now respect as the father of our **federation**.

* Let us remember that the proposal was to form an Australasian **federation**, but between 1891 and 1900 New Zealand decided that it would remain outside the Australasian economic community.

* At that time the United Kingdom decided to remain outside the community, just as New Zealand decided in 1901 to remain outside the Australasian **federation**.

* Six countries joined together to provide not a common market but an economic community, a community which must result in either a **federation**, a confederation, or some kind of United States of Europe.

* I pointed out that, after ten years of negotiation, the six States of Australia formed an economic community in the Australian **federation**, but New Zealand decided to stay outside it.

* I pointed out that, just as Australia has prospered under **federation**, so New Zealand has prospered notwithstanding that it stayed out.

* If Britain joins the community, it is idle to imagine that she can do so without losing part of her sovereignty, just as it would have been idle for the six States of Australia to have imagined that they could form a **federation** without losing part of their sovereignty, and in fact they have lost part of their sovereignty.

* On 16th July, 1962,  Mr. Gaitskell,  the Leader of the Opposition, said that Britain could not possibly enter the European **federation**.

* He was at pains to stress the decisions arrived at by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation at Surfers Paradise.

* I ask: When the earlier pamphlet on Vietnam was printed and distributed at the Government's expense, did the Council of the New South Wales Teachers Federation carry a resolution protesting about the dissemination of a one sided approach to a highly controversial international question in violation of the practice of presenting both sides of an issue?

* The Tasmanian Farmers Federation, which has 6,000 members in Tasmania, has fought hard, through its secretary,  Mr. R.  Curtis, to persuade the Minister in the last few days to review this appointment, but the Minister has refused the request.

* His  representations have been added to those of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, the honorable member for Franklin and myself, this being the first chance I have had to bring the matter up in the House.

* However, the general charter for the Conference will be to deal with those matters relating to the WWF which were raised by the employers and the WWF during the conferences between them which broke down in May and also the matters raised by the Federation on 30th' Jury.

* Since 1941 the Federation has been trying to institute an industry pension scheme, and pressure for it mounted when such a scheme was introduced in the coal mining industry in 1942.

* The parties shall establish and maintain during the life of this agreement, Industrial Relations Committees in each port of Australia in which there is a Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia.

* The matters contained in the report of the Conference affect mainly the Waterside Workers' Federation, but there are other groups of workers who are likely to be affected by the proposals of the Conference.

* This agreement must prove for all time that the Waterside Workers Federation and its members are ever ready to sit down and negotiate industrial problems - whether they are big or small - in a real and gentlemanly manner.

* Further to that, the Australian Federation of Staff Associations declared, for a time, all vacancies black at the University of Tasmania.

* This was accepted, despite objections by the Teachers Federation.

* He has, of course, taken this entirely from the policy of the Australian Teachers Federation.

* In 1963, the Science Committee of the New South Wales Teachers Federation prepared a report on the minimum requirements for the effective teaching of the fouryear science course prescribed by the New South Wales Secondary Schools Board.

* The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority is given most extensive powers to move from one port to another members of the Waterside Workers Federation who are registered as wharf labourers.

* We have noted the uncertainties in Laos, the acute problems in South Viet Nam, the conflicts which exist over the creation of the new Federation of Malaysia - which we heartily support - and events in and concerning West New Guinea.

* There is a very sound basis for that: If we are to communicate freely with each other, and the **federation** will work more effectively if this is done, the Prime Minister and the Premiers of the States should be able to feel that what they have put to each other is preserved as a matter of confidence unless there is agreement between the Prime Minister and a Premier that some release can be made of the contents of correspondence between them.

* At this point I might mention that the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, during his recent visit to Australia, welcomed the presence of our troops in his country.

* I want to quote from a case between the Waterside Workers Federation and K. W. Alexander Pty Ltd, which was decided by the High Court in 1918.

* I quote from the judgment of Justices Isaacs and Rich, who had this to say: 
Two producer organizations, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have, over a considerable period of time, thought it necessary that the Meat Board should be altered.

* If the House will bear with me, I should like to repeat that there will be on it four members representing the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, four members representing the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and an independent  chairman.

* These are the Australian Primary Producers Union, and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, on behalf of which the honorable member for Macarthur  (Mr. Jeff Bate)  made so eloquent a plea a little earlier.

* An application has been under discussion for the last few months and efforts have been made to get from the union a membership list so that it may be compared with the membership lists of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council.

* Why should the name not be crossed off the **federation**'s or the council's list?

* But when we consider the number of persons who constituted the full voting membership of electorates at the time of **federation** it is somewhat paradoxical that the member for the Northern Territory, which has 12,284 people on the roll, cannot get a vote in this House.

* Is he aware of the constant complaints being voiced by State Premiers, parents and citizens organisations, the Teachers' Federation of New South Wales and many individuals in the community regarding the shortage of teachers in State schools?

* A  Dr S.  Y. Chung,  Chairman  of the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, recently stated that wage rates in Hong Kong were 20% higher than those in Singapore, 50% higher than those in Taiwan, and 70% higher than those in the Republic of Korea.

* Only today we met two representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation, who made a special trip to Canberra to impress upon members the need for a better deal for the pensioners.

* Members of the Opposition find their opinions in tune with those of the representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation.

* On the other hand, Government supporters are definitely out of tune with the aspirations of the Federation.

* This is included at the request of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Instead of going through the medium of the Waterside Workers Federation the authority could say, " We will put these men on and register them ".

* The purpose of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions is, by means of the first of these two amendments, to provide that days on which men at B class ports are available for employment shall count towards entitlement for long service leave.

* The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that we believe that there should be some stretegic replacement of Australian bases and that Western Australia should not be treated as if it were not part of the **federation**.

* Will the Minister urgently request or advise the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to support an application by the Waterside Workers Federation for A class status for Gladstone, which is now anomalously classified A seasonal?

* As the Australian Wheat Growers Federation has made a number of recommendations to the Commonwealth and State Governments to restrict wheat deliveries from the 1969-70 harvest to 357 million bushels and has asked that the amount received be distributed on a State quota basis, I ask: In the event of one State not fulfilling its quota will the unfulfilled portion be allocated to those States which have a surplus?

* I noticed the general secretly of the Waterside Workers Federation, a leading Communist, who was an honoured guest  at the convention.

* Has the Department failed to institute performance tests as requested by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots?

* I always understood that, as a genuine federalist, he was prepared to allow the States as much freedom as our system of **federation** permits them.

* Uganda was a **federation** of four States.

* The second, to which the honorable member for Petrie  (Mr. O'Brien)  has referred, concerns alleged discrimination between members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the steamship owners.

* The original section 36 in the stevedoring legislation was inserted as a result of a committee of inquiry which had as one of its members the very revered Communist and leader of the Waterside Workers Federation, the late  Mr. Healy,  who was a great and revered friend of the honorable gentleman from East Sydney.

* When you look at the record, you will see that until the 24-hour stoppage called by the federal council of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia recently, 99.7 per cent, of the strikes were in Melbourne or Sydney, where the local branches of the union are dominated by members of the Communist Party.

* A country like ours, dependent, as this country is, on its overseas trade, could not afford to do without penalties when so many needless strikes are called by the Communist elements in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The strike was not called by the officers of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Subsequently, the decision to strike had to be verified by officers of the **federation**.

* This, also, is a matter that has been effectively canvassed by me, the Department of Labour and National Service, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* Recently we have seen Communistcontrolled unions such as the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union damaging our economy by their strikes to the extent of thousands of pounds.

* The act prescribes that before the Government can take any action, the Wool Bureau must have the consent of both the organizations represented on that body - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Immediately after each examination, the Department in the Post Examination Review Panel meets representatives of the ground training organisations, operators and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to discuss in detail each examination paper.

* I understand that he has already had consultations with the leader of the Waterside Workers Federation in Melbourne and that he will continue his consultations with union delegates to-day.

* Recently the Waterside Workers Federation was fined 500 plus costs because it refused to carry out a court order to supply labour on Sundays.

* This Government has a record in the field of education unequalled by any other Commonwealth government in the history of **federation**.

* I think that it was my honorable colleague from Queensland, the honorable member for Petrie  (Mr. O'Brien)  who said that the penalties imposed since April, 1960, on the Waterside Workers Federation amounted to not less than 7,900 in addition to the 700, 000-odd lost in attendance money.

* The Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation consider that once the authority has determined that a suspension was wrong the payment should be mandatory.

* Is the Minister aware that those poor conditions include ridiculously inadequate salaries and an excessive number of increments before attaining the maximum standard salary; a six day working week; three weeks annual leave - a condition unaltered since Federation - compared with four weeks annual leave applying in other sections of the Department; a longer working week- 
The honorable member said also that there would not be an adequate safety margin when the north-south runway is extended to 8,500 feet at Mascot.

* One of the people who gave evidence to the Committee was  Mr. Shields,  who appeared on behalf of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* When giving evidence he said - 
I shall read again to the honorable member what the representative of the Federation said in sworn evidence.

* Mr. Williams  was an accredited British observer at the congress of the International Federation of Automation Control which has just ended in Moscow.

* the honorable member for Richmond  (Mr. Anthony)  referred to the fact that the Banana Growers Federation had said there was a strong possibility of Fijian bananas coming into Australia.

* The manager of this **federation** rang me and asked me to do something about the importation of bananas.

* The Banana Growers Federation and its branches held a few meetings, and then the matter was dropped.

* The **federation** intimated that Suva could supply bananas at 28s.

* Although the manager of the **federation** had asked me to do what I could about the matter, when I dealt with it, the suggestion was made that I was trying to make political capita] out of it.

* The Australian Citrus Growers Federation, on behalf of the Citrus Growers Council of New South Wales and the Australian Apple and Pear Board, has approached the Commonwealth for some financial assistance to support the sending this year of one or two trade missions to the United Kingdom and Europe.

* There is the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Farmers and Settlers Association and a great number of others.

* I understand from the figures made
            available that, in the very near future, Australia will have as many men in the Army as
            it had at the time of Federation in 1901.

* Therefore, I do not think there is any necessity to alter the system which has been in existence since Federation.

* The Government has been one of the most favoured and fortunate governments in the history of our Federation, lt has relied very heavily on something to turn up to rescue it from its self-created dilemmas, lt was very fortunate in the succession of extraordinarily good seasons it enjoyed in its early years of office.

* Recently I saw some remarks which were attributed to the  President  of the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters and which criticised the Australian Broadcasting Commission for altering the basis of its broadcasts.

* Before I comment on that report let me say that the joint advance of the two parts of New Guinea could mean the future establishment of a Melanesian **federation**.

* Every Australian realizes that after 61 years of **federation** the Constitution which was handed to the nation all that time agc must be very substantially outmoded to-day as a result of the passage of time and the increasing complexities of civilization.

* They need only read the evidence of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Egg Board and other organized marketing groups.

* The company reaffirms these views in annual reports to shareholders and it sent me also a copy of cables from the Woolcomber group, the United Kingdom Woolcombing Employers Federation and the British Wool Federation, all of which have a firm support for the scheme.

* In the letter the company stated - 
In 1951 all the woolgrowers' organisations in Australia - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union - jointly interviewed the Prime Minister, myself and other senior Ministers in the Cabinet room, and asked for the introduction of a reserve prices plan for wool.

* From **federation** until 1958-59 there has been an accumulated total loss of 58m on this type of postage.

* It has been suggested that the Solomon Islands and other contiguous areas might, with Papua and New Guinea, become part of a **federation**.

* The normal pattern in our **federation**, as in the American and Canadian federations, is that the National Government participates in any of these inter-governmental activities.

* The Premiers have said, in effect, that where the interests of education and **federation** may conflict, they must now put the interests of education first.

* Other organizations mentioned in the clause are the Australian Post-graduate Federation in Medicine, the College of Radiologists of Australasia, the Australian College of General Practitioners, and the College of Pathologists of Australia.

* Let me go back: Ten years or so before **federation**, the citizens of New South Wales, then a sovereign State, went to great expense in erecting a worthy General Post Office.

* Its father and mother were the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Australian forces, in conjunction with United Kingdom and New Zealand forces, are stationed in Malaya under arrangements agreed with the Government of the Federation of Malaya in 1957; these arrangements continue at the desire of the Federation and other Commonwealth governments concerned.

* In view, however, of the particular security threat with which it was faced, the Federation Government sought the continued assistance of Commonwealth forces in operations against the Communist terrorists remaining in the area of the border between Malaya and Thailand.

* The other, negotiated by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, states hours of duty to be in accordance with Air Navigation Orders and provides that a pilot shall receive four days free of duty at his home base each fortnight.

* The Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, in a letter dated 22nd October 1964', addressed to the Federation invited commercial television stations to schedule a 30-minute "Report to the Nation " which was to be broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission on 19th November 1964.

* Is the Minister aware of the deep concern of the Government members industrial relations committee regarding the serious deterioration of industrial relations on the waterfront, including the number of unauthorised stoppages, the erosion of discipline, the wilful breaking of the so-called Woodward scheme by the Waterside Workers Federation and the irresponsible acquiescence of the employers?

* However, section 29 of the award provides that if the Waterside Workers Federation takes part in any ban, limitation or prohibition of work, it can be taken before the commission.

* There is also in the act provision for a fine of up to 500 to be imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation.

* One would think that the logical concern of the Government, having decided to grant long service leave, would be to consult the Waterside Workers Federation or at least to consult the Stevedoring Industry Authority, which is the body authorized to conduct the affairs of the waterfront.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is concerned that the livelihood of its members may be lost.

* Also at this address at 324 Pitt Street, in room 5 on the fourth floor, are Francis and Grimes, solicitors, and in room 9 on the third floor is the New Settlers Federation.

* When our **federation** was launched the United States consisted of 45 States and five territories.

* It has been in existence since **federation**.

* This has been the idea since **federation**.

* In spite of the Government's spoken denials of any move towards this great project it is interesting to know that only within the last three weeks an official of the Australian National Line is reported to have visited Sydney to consult with, and seek the co-operation of, the Waterside Workers Federation on this very issue.

* I should like him to say, later in this sessional period if not today, to the Parliament and the nation, whether or not this conference took place between the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* When opening the annual convention of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria, he pointed out that estimates varied but the general feeling in the industry and the community was that building in Australia was getting further behind housing demand.

* Speaking at a conference of the Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations of New South Wales on 15th August last, he said - 
Will the Minister for Labour and National Service inform the House of the grounds on which the Waterside Workers Federation yesterday called for a strike in which all 2,600 men on the day shift in Melbourne walked off 34 ships?

* Since the Stevedoring Industry Authority does not seek this information from applicants, does this not mean that, if the Minister's statement is correct, the responsibility for the position that he alleges exists rests squarely on the Authority and not, as he has implied, on the Waterside Workers Federation?

* An investigation team from the Department of Civil Aviation is on the site supported by technical and operational specialists from Ansett-A.N.A., the Air Pilots Federation of Australia and the airframe and engine manufacturers.

* I am pleased to say that at a meeting recently of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation there was unanimous agreement of all the representatives that this scheme had great virtues and that it is one with which we should press forward as quickly as possible.

* I ask whether the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has agreed to increase the registered strengths of its Sydney and Melbourne branches by the recruitment of 344 men in Sydney and 295 in Melbourne to bring the strengths up to the port quotas of 5,300 and 4,370 respectively.

* If the **federation** has so agreed, what arrangements have been made concerning the recruitments and when is it expected that the required men will be available for work to relieve the continuing shortages in the two ports?

* I hope that when this Parliament reassembles for the autumn session in 1965 and the formula comes up for review there will be much greater contemplation of this matter by the House and also a much mors considerate, realistic and tolerant approach by the Commonwealth to these problems which inevitably beset a federal system in which there are considerable disparities between one part of the **federation** and another in economic resources and in which the principal receiver of revenue is the Commonwealth.

* If any government since **federation** has done everything possible - perhaps not all it would wish to do - for this unfortunate section of the community, if any government has made an honest endeavour to improve conditions for these people, it has been the Liberal-Australian Country Party Government which has been in office since 1949.

* Because of his work in this House he has an honoured place in the history of our **federation**.

* I know that many producers in Tasmania join with  Mr. C.  E. Napier, the  chairman  of directors of the North West Cooperative Freezing and Canning Company in condemning the present proposals as totally unacceptable, undemocratic and contrary to the spirit of **federation**.

* The " elementary " training is carried out by the aero club or clubs selected by the **federation** - in practice this is the club located nearest to the trainee's residence or such other club as may suit his convenience.

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether the decision of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, given on 11th February last, that the port quotas of waterside workers in Sydney and Melbourne be increased, and requiring the registration of 600 additional men in Sydney and 300 in Melbourne has been implemented by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* When amendments were last being made to the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation requested that the Australian Wheat Board be given power to erect storage facilities.

* I then pointed out that there was a power to deregister under section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act but that the Waterside Workers Federation had great powers and privileges under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* The judge, I am told, was prompted by the donor of the Cup to give it to the team from the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The leader of the Waterside Workers Federation team was none other than one of the most dangerous Communists this country has ever seen,  Mr Ted  Roach, and the honourable member cannot deny it.

* He came up and in a craven, slavish fashion we saw him almost genuflecting to Ted Roach, the Communist leader of the Waterside Workers' Federation, as he proudly presented to him the Illawarra Star Cup.

* Further inquiries were made because the other unions, the right wing unions, claimed they had won the march competition and they asked why it was that the left wing Communist controlled Waterside Workers Federation should have been given the prize.

* It was later discovered - this has been alleged against the honourable member and never denied - that  Mr Ted  Roach spent two evenings before the day of the march secretly closeted in the house of the honourable member for Mackellar, and it is pretty clear that it was then that the conspiracy to give the cup to the Communist team was worked out between the honourable member for Mackellar and the Communist leader of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I believe that goodwill was shown by all parties at the conference - the A.C.T.U., the Waterside Workers Federation, the employers and my own Department's representatives.

* What is the cost of the fine of 500 that was imposed yesterday on the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia?

* I have here a letter from the New South Wales Teachers Federation which refers to the present situation.

* In view of the intense public interest in and concern over the dispute on the waterfront at Fremantle as a result of the registration of the Foremen Stevedores Union, and the strike action that has been taken by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, can the Minister comment on the general accusation in Western Australia that the machinery of conciliation works too slowly, and can he say whether quick action could be initiated in that State in the event of any stoppage or threatened stoppage?

* "Spotlight" takes the line of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions - the non-Communist international trade union body - whereas I understand that the honorable member for Yarra adheres rather to the World Federation of Trade Unions - the Communist and proscribed association of trade unions.

* Fortunately, in almost 62 years of **federation**, Labour has been in office for only a little more than fifteen years all told.

* I have a letter from an operating Boeing captain who is Chairman of the Operations Group of the Overseas Branch of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots N.S.W.

* I think it is fair to say that not since Federation has there been a budget that has not received some criticism from at least some members of this House.

* At the same time, I should not let this occasion pass without expressing the Government's appreciation of the part that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has played since Federation in the Australian judicial system.

* The Government takes up the position that if it is a question of the education of children or **federation**, it stands for **federation**; and if it is a case of more schools or State rights, the Government stands for State rights.

* If it is a matter of adequate education for children or **federation**, we come down on the side of the Australian children.

* This question of **federation** as a barrier to the making of grants for education, as has been pointed out by Opposition speakers, has; been no barrier to the development of assistance to university education.

* Yet we have had nothing but the excuses of **federation** and State rights put forward by the Government in' this House day after day whenever this question has been raised.

* The decision to admit for permanent residence New Zealand citizens of Maori descent dates back to the early days of **federation**.

* 2 Communist, and the  President  of Indonesia,  Dr. Soekarno,  in which those two countries expressed resolute and unequivocal support for the Brunei rebels against the proposed Federation of Malaysia, for the Viet Cong in the war in South Viet Nam, for North Korea, and for the so-called liberation of Taiwan?

* Until now the trend has been completely opposite to that in the American **federation**.

* It is not good enough for the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the Waterside Workers Federation.

* At the invitation of the Government of the Federation of Malaya, units of the Australian component of the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve take part from time to time in operations against communist terrorists in Northern Malaya.

* This rate of return represents the weighted average of the rates of the longest term public loans raised in Australia at about the time each net advance was made to the Post Office from **federation** to 30th June, 1959.

* Will he compare what is happening under a unitary form of government with what is possible in a **federation**?

* The Australian Industries Preservation Act was passed in 1906 in the first flood of Australian nationalism after Federation.

* Did the executive of the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation decide that there would be no work on the Melbourne waterfront on 25th September last?

* .- The honorable member for Wannon  (Mr. Malcolm Fraser)  started off by referring to a large advertisement in Victorian newspapers, setting out the views and opinions of the Victorian Teachers Federation.

* The Diabetes Federation of Australia had a representative appear before the Boyer committee and make submissions about diabetics who were treating themselves with insulin and about their increased ability to work because of improved medical facilities.

* The **federation** had high hopes that its submissions would be favorably received by the committee and that a recommendation would be made which would allow diabetics ultimately to become permanent employees in the Commonwealth Public Service.

* The Council also advised me that it supported a recommendation from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation that the income of the Board should be increased to enable it to intensify its promotion and market development activities.

* The estimated income under the current legislation for 1964-65 is about 760,000, and the increase in the Board's budget for 1965-66 reflects the recommendation of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation that more funds should be made available for promotion and market development.

* If they want to go so far back, why not start comparing pensions with the rates paid by the Bruce-Page Government, the Scullin Government and the Lyons Government - right back to the days of **federation**.

* They will come from the Graziers Federal Council of Australia, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Agricultural Council, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which is an Australia-wide organization, the Department of Primary Industry, whose activities cover the whole of Australia, and the universities, which more or less represent Australia.

* I said that the Government was not prepared to tolerate the kind of action in which the Waterside Workers Federation was indulging.

* As to the Waterside Workers Federation, what the honorable member must decide is whether he is on the side of the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation or on the side of the Communist-dominated Sydney branch of that organization.

* Both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation gave me certain assurances.

* In fact, the Sydney branch is studiously attempting to undermine the influence of Fitzgibbon, the general secretary of the **federation**; and the Australian Labour Party stands condemned for doing nothing to help that man in his fight against the Communists.

* On the other hand, when he realized the danger of the tribal set-up and suggested a **federation** on the Gold Coast, the Premier of Togoland said: " We have been fighting for our independence.

* According to him, evidently the Save Our Sons movement is a fifth column, the Old Age and Invalid Pensioners' Association is a fifth column, members of the Waterside Workers Federation are fifth columnists and members of other trade unions are fifth columnists.

* The Government of the Federation continues to be faced by a campaign of armed Communist terrorism within its borders.

* of the Opposition; nor have I sufficient knowledge to state whether at any other stage since the beginning of the Australian **federation** any similar conversation took place.

* Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Amendment No.

* Has the Government received from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation a request for a top-level inquiry into wool marketing in Australia because there have been a steady downward trend and consequent instability in wool prices?

* It has been stated by the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales that there is a growing shortage of labour and that this is no longer confined to skilled labour.

* I ask the Minister: Is there any evidence of activity among the decent rank and file members of the Waterside Workers Federation to throw out these enemies of Australia?

* Yet honorable members opposite are suggesting that because the Commonwealth Government now wishes to retain in the Act that margin which has existed since Federation, this is a gerrymander.

* 1 ask: Will the conference over which  Mr. Woodward  is to preside have authority to discuss sanctions against registered stevedoring companies such as fines without appeals, inquiries on the Minister's application to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission instead of trial by the Commonwealth Industrial Court, and deregistration by the Minister, similar to sanctions that have been enacted against the Waterside Workers Federation?

* In view of the decision of the Italian Government, by agreement with the trade unions, following two general strikes in the last 3 months, to raise pensions for retired workers from 65% to 74% of their last salaries immediately, and to further increase them to '80% by 1976, will he call a meeting between himself, the Employers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to work out a similar scheme for the retired wealth producers of Australia?

* The honorable member for Wilmot  (Mr. Duthie)  referred a little earlier to a meeting held, by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation in my electorate.

* He evidently does not realize that in recent weeks the new  chairman  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation,  Mr. Heaslip,  and the new  chairman  of the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council,  Mr. Scott,  have conferred together and have joined in deputations to the Minister, and that we now see the beginnings of a most amicable understanding between the two organizations.

* Although the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation is not represented in Tasmania, the Tasmanian Farmers Federation and the graziers in Tasmania have for some time been wanting a full inquiry into all aspects, of wool marketing.

* It is true that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation has gone into several aspects and that the graziers' organization has gone into other aspects, but the results of these inquiries have not been brought together in a proper impartial manner so that growers may look at them and pass judgment on them.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation wants a floor price plan.

* A number of internal upheavals occurred earlier, beginning with the murder of the Prime Minister of the Federation and a number of others in January 1966.

* The plain fact is that, under the terms of this bill, recognition is given to the Australian Wool Industry Conference, an organization composed, on the one hand, of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers' Council and, on the other hand, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* But  Mr. Duncan  Sandys had the idea of forcing North Borneo and Sarawak into the alliance to make the new Federation viable, and this caused the trouble.

* Had the situation been left alone except for the **federation** of Malaya and Singapore, there would have been no trouble.

* Only when Malaysia was created and the new Federation was asked to defend the borders of North Borneo and Sarawak did the trouble with Indonesia begin.

* It is probably more money than all the States have invested in education since **federation**.

* During the days of peace I knew him again when he became Secretary of the Australasian Steamship Owners Federation.

* This was a record term for any member of the "Hansard" staff since **federation**.

* Some time ago a group of Shipping Companies in Sydney decided to form a Committee with as wide a representation as possible, with the principal aims of uniformity in dealing with travel agents, both individually and through the Australian Federation of Travel Agents and  securing  protection for carriers in the event of an Agent's financial failure.

* I refer to the action taken recently by the Waterside Workers Federation on the Melbourne waterfront, as a protest against the usual police search of waterside workers, which has occasioned the loss of two hours per man day.

* Was this information sought when the recent investigation into the background of members of the Waterside Workers Federation was undertaken?

* Speaker,  having established a record term, and the  President  of the Senate having now established a record term, I doubt whether we shall find another Parliament in the history of the Federation which will be able to produce such a conjunction of the planets.

* In Australia, for example, we have a **federation**, and we must ascertain what the Commonwealth Government pays for social services and what the various State governments pay.

* What steps, if any, has the Government taken to support the frequent protests - the most recent was made at last month's congress of the International Transport Workers Federation - concerning the continued interference by the United Arab Republic with ships sailing to Israel from other countries through the Suez Canal?

* However, he must have concluded that any sensible committee would come up with a conclusion that the capital of the Post Office must be clearly defined for the first time in the' history of the Federation and that upon that capital there should, of course, be this notional interest charged.

* This is the most politically contemptible action, I believe, in the history of the **federation**.

* I remind honorable members that in Melbourne recently the Waterside Workers Federation was fined 500 for contempt of court - for having taken the law into its own hands when it could not get justice.

* In view of the concern expressed by the Opposition as to the cost to the trade unions of fines imposed for contempt  of  court and illegal strikes, can the Minister, for the benefit of the House, compare those fines with the cost to industry and the general public of illegal strikes such as the recent nation-wide stoppage by members of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* Has he read the comment of  Mr. P.  J. Self, secretary of the Employers Federation of New South Wales, that the new system would cost some hundreds of thousands of pounds a year?

* Mr. Healy  and  Mr. Roach,  the Federation's representatives, on two different occasions incited waterside workers to strike against their own commission's orders.

* The Government asked for assurance from  Mr. Healy  and  Mr. Roach,  that, while they remained members of the commission, they would co-operate with it and not incite members of their **federation** to flout the commission's authority and disobey its orders.

* They refused to give these assurances and the Government then asked the **federation** to nominate two other representatives in their place.

* When the **federation** refused to do that, the Government had no alternative but to dissolve the Stevedoring Industry Commission.

* Not only does this Bill not cover the questions referred to the Woodward Committee, but also the Waterside Workers Federation itself has arrogantly said: " We are not going to have any business at all with the Woodward Committee."

* I put it to the House that it would be utter futility to imagine that the Government should sit down meekly and wait for the report of the Woodward Committee, which the Waterside Workers Federation, in effect, is boycotting, before introducing this measure.

* Present at that conference were representatives of the Government, the A.S.I.A., the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers.

* Within a short space of time, the Waterside Workers Federation, led principally by those who subscribe to a foreign power, was once again on the rampage, with lost man hours constantly piling up.

* But the Waterside Workers Federation under its present leadership, and under its present working structure, has no interest at all in negotiating or in seeking harmony in this industry.

* I put it to them that history has shown that the Waterside Workers Federation, under its present leadership, is simply not interested in conferences.

* The Federation believes that it can bend the rule of law to suit itself.

* This is something that, unhappily, the Federation has not yet understood.

* As the honorable member for Higinbotham further pointed out the Waterside Workers Federation has been determined to strike as savage a blow as it can against harmony in this industry.

* The effects on his part have been objected to and resisted by the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But, as honourable members will appreciate, in Melbourne there is a very large and powerful section of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia which is determined to do all it can to disrupt the introduction of permanent employment and to embarrass its own federal executive.

* That is the Federation of Australia University Staff Associations.

* The article continued: 
I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether he is aware that a special Federal trade union conference has been held in Perth within the last few days to discuss the aim of the Western Australian Employers' Federation to bring overseas committed labour to work in the North West.

* A week or ten days ago, the Minister informed the House that he had referred the dispute involving the Waterside Workers Federation and the ban on Sunday work to  Mr. Justice  Ashburner for conferences.

* That point was never taken in the first 59 years of the Federation.

* Will he state whether Messrs. L. R. Hilton, N. A. Jensen, J. W. Geurts, B. J. Ashton, C. H. Glaubitz or K. Davis made application for financial assistance under Regulation 138 made under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to meet the cost of their litigation against the Pulp and Paper Workers Federation of Australia?

* The rate of 31% was the rate agreed between the Commonwealth and the States for the purpose of calculating the interest to be paid by the Commonwealth on the value of properties transferred to it at Federation.)

* There is  Mr. Arnell,  of the Waterside Workers Federation, who won his position on the executive of the **federation** on the unity ticket that has been displayed in this Parliament - the same unity ticket of waterside workers as was used in 1958, 1959 and 1960.

* Then there is Alfred John Carruthers of the Queensland Plasterers Union, another member of the Communist Party; Thomas William Chard, of the Queensland carpenters union; John Francis Daly, of the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia, a member of the Communist Party who is employed at the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital; William John Fahy, of the Federated Moulders (Metals) Union of Australia who is a member of the Communist Party; Edward John Hanson - he used to be called Edward John Hanson, junior - of the Operative Painters and Decorators Union of Australia who is a member of the Communist Party; Cyril Bailey Boland, a member of the same union and also of the Communist Party; Gerald McAdam Dawson, of the carpenters union and a leading member of the Communist Party who tries to make out that he represents the Building Workers Industrial Union.

* That is a fine inspiration, but we must recognize that for us to sign the Treaty of Rome would be to accept as the ultimate goal political **federation** in Europe, including ourselves.

* This Government follows the lead of the Metal Trades Federation.

* Will the Australian Government be consulted at tha forthcoming British Ministers' talks in London on the United Kingdom's defence commitments arising from Singapore's break with the Malaysian Federation?

* Has the Australian Federation of Air Pilots been complaining for some considerable time about the absence of these important and essential night flying aids?

* The relationship between Sarawak and the rest of the Malaysian Federation is a matter that is receiving the close attention of the Government in Kuala Lumpur and I believe the outcome there will be one which will be quite satisfactory to Australia.

* Owing to the difficulties of **federation** we customarily find one or two States agreeing and the rest disagreeing to a proposal.

* Fitzgibbon, but since Fitzgibbon^ election to general secretaryship of the Waterside Workers Federation he has been thrown to the wolves by the Labour Party.

* The present scheme is to the credit of this Government and the Minister for Social Services  (Mr. Roberton)  who has the greatest record of service in that department that we have seen since **federation**.

* But it is because of the vital legal situation, the relationship to the Constitution Act and the long history from the first days of **federation** in 1901, that the committee sought evidence from the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth and from the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth.

* T direct the attention of the right honorable gentleman to a news item which appeared in the London Times " of 19th February 1966 and which referred to a telegram sent to the  President  of the United States of America on behalf of 29 unions which are members of the American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organisations' maritime trade department.

* This is the text of the telegram - 
My information is that up to only about 50 per cent, of the members of the New South Wales Teachers Federation have on previous occasions participated in the ballot for the election of officers.

* No changes are made unless there has been a full and penetrating discussion with the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots, with representatives of general aviation in various fields and with other bodies concerned.

* After all, we have been a **federation**- 
The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb  quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* Some few of these items have not been altered since the introduction of the first tariff after **federation**, but many of them have been reviewed on several occasions.

* The Federation asks you, Sir: 'Where is the compassion in the pittance of 75c or $1 a week for the weakest and most defenceless in the communitythe aged, sick and the widowed subsisting on $13 a week or $11.75 a week for the past 2 years?

* Singapore expelled from the Federation of Malaysia.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, which is the supreme industry organisation, attacked the difficult problem of surplus wheat and the difficult marketing conditions by proposing a quota programme.

* Also the Federation was hoping that this would have some dampening effect on increase of production.

* However, if there are to be industry leaders who are prompting people to disobey the intentions of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and to violate the rules and regulations of the Australian Wheat Board only one thing can happen, and that is that there will be chaos in an industry where there has been traditional acceptance of orderly marketing.

* I wonder whether the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation handed over the minutes of its meetings to the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and vice versa.

* The Tasmanian Farmers Federation, which is a constituent body of the A.P.P.U., has 4,000 or 5,000 members, so I am sorry to disillusion the honorable member on that point.

* As the honorable member for Wannon has said, I think that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation should have another look at itself to see whether it qualifies for membership of the selection committee.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation is coming out more strongly on the side of the Minister.

* Messrs Joyce and Couchman interviewed  Mr Fowler  of the Metal Trades Employers Federation.

* Can the honorable gentleman say what is the present position in relation to the stoppage of work on the Australian wharfs, and can he say whether the members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia intend to provide labour for the wharfs to-morrow?

* In view of these submissions and the strongly expressed views of airline companies, the Federation of Air Pilots and citizens generally, that the present proposed length of the runway at Mascot is unsafe and inadequate, will he give immediate consideration to extending that runway while work is currently in progress, to a length of at least 10,500 feet?

* The petition was signed by  Mr P.  Malone, the State Secretary of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation.

* His  letter to the Governor of Hong Kong reads as follows: 
The agreement between Great Britain and Malaya was undertaken at a time before Singapore became independent and, of course, before it was separated from the Federation of Malaysia.

* On Wednesday, a week ago yesterday, I met the members of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, which represents the three bodies concerned - the equalization committee, the Dairy Produce Board and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation - and they presented the industry's viewpoint upon the report of the committee of inquiry.

* During the last few days the Waterside Workers' Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the employers have met and decided the constitution of the industrial committees.

* I ask: Has his attention been directed to a report that Indonesian forces in West Irian have been placed on the alert as part of Indonesia's confrontation policy and because of Australia's support of the Federation of Malaysia?

* Similarly, we have been promised legislation concerning monopolies and restrictive trade practices - the sort of legislation which has been in force in the **federation** of the United States of America since the 1880's in the case of the Sherman Act, and since the First World War in the case of the Clayton Act.

* All members of the Constitutional Review Committee, Liberal, 
All the evidence points to the fact that the Federation of Rhodesia is likely to come to an end and that, instead of a multi-racial system of government which could have come about if there had been time to develop it, there will be another black dictatorship for certain in Nyasaland and probably one in Northern Rhodesia.

* The **federation** has said that it wants the guarantee for 150,000,000 bushels.

* Hundreds of Queensland girls are searching Brisbane for office jobs, and the Federated Clerks Union and the Queensland Employers Federation say that the chances of most of them obtaining them are remote.

* Queensland Employers Federation secretary,  Mr. J.  R. James, last night called for a committee of inquiry into unemployment in the State.

* Some members have talked about the discriminatory action of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and of the Stevedoring Industry Authority against the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Reference has recently been made to the last penalties which were imposed on the **federation**, amounting to  2,000.

* Let us take this procedure to its logical conclusion: I understand that there are  44  branches of the Waterside Workers Federation in Australia.

* Whilst it is perfectly true that not only the Waterside Workers Federation but other industrial unions can expect to receive much fairer treatment from an incoming Labour government, they have to suffer this Government at the moment and they are continually faced with these savage penalties.

* There were 84 job delegates from the Waterside Workers Federation who wanted to attend the conference.

* Then the wheels began to move and another penalty of 500 was imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation for backing up the job delegates who attended this conference.

* At the request of the Government of the Federation of Malaya, they assist that Government in the operations against the Communist terrorists.

* At the 1960 conference of the Australian Teachers Federation - the largest conference of its kind in Australia up to date - resolutions were agreed to unanimously, by the very many persons present, all of whom were experienced in education.

* I will refer the committee to some of those resolutions - 
The Australian Wool-growers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation give an undertaking that, after the first Annual Meeting of the Conference, they will meet in three years' time to review the Constitution of the Conference.

* Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland as a partner in the place of Southern Rhodesia.

* The Government has received another deputation from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations and the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations asking for 4 weeks annual leave, as has applied in all New South Wales State and local government employment for nearly 6 years, in lieu of the ceiling of 3 weeks leave which the statute has ordained since Federation and which is now below the standard in all State Public Services except the Western Australian.

* In Australia the principle became part of the law of the Commonwealth shortly after **federation**, when section 61 of the Defence Act (1903) exempted from the general obligation of service in time of war 'persons whom the doctrines of their religion forbid to bear arms or perform military service'.

* I have before me also a booklet issued by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations and titled 'Report on Research in Universities'.

* That has always been the situation since Federation.

* We are entitled to ask why this great radical organisation, the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations, has cringed away in abject silence.

* Does the 
The Queensland Employers' Federation secretary  (Mr. J. R. James)  said the Budget seemed to nave completely ignored the private enterprise section of the community.

* That is the opinion of  Mr. James,  the secretary of the Queensland Employers Federation.

* The article also states - 
There are opinions from both sides; on one hand, from the Employers Federation and the Chamber of Commerce and, on the other, from the Trades and Labour Council.

* In an address some time ago,  Mr Farley,  who was the  Chairman  of the Printing Industry Employers Federation at the time, said that a great deal more emphasis should be placed on the training of managers.

* Have the differences between the Waterside Workers Federation in Western Australia and the Foremen Stevedores Association been resolved, and has the position regarding hookies-on been cleared up?

* Following his talks with officers of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation on 24th February has he any plans to meet the needs of pensioners at an early date?

* I hope, too, that one day there will be a Melanesian **federation**.

* The interest has been calculated over' a period stretching back as far as 1901. the year of Federation.

* Generally speaking, it will be found that more questions have been answered over the last year or so than in any similar period in the history of **federation**.

* Anybody listening to him knew he was not even speaking as a Christian, because he could not resist the temptation to slander some person who could not defend himself here - to accuse somebody in the Teachers Federation of being a Communist.

* The New South Wales Teachers Federation issued an instruction on 12th June, 1963, in which it said - 
I will read to the House the letter received by the Governor from the State Secretary of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation.

* It begins: 'The Australian Builders Labourers Federation, Victorian Branch, 11 Lygon Street, Carlton, Box 14, Trades Hall, Melbourne.'

* It reads: 
The unions are concerned with the following: Painters, Clothing Trades, Postal Workers, Transport Workers, Sheet Metal Workers, Leather Trades, Federated Engine Drivers, Miscellaneous Workers, Meat Workers, Plumbers, Victorian Plasterers Society, Painters and Decorators, Seamen's, Shipwrights, Furniture Factories, Tramways, Waterside Workers Federation, Builders Labourers, Australian Railways, Boilermakers and liquor trades.

* Most - I will not say all - of the officials of the Waterside Workers Federation in Newcastle are friends of mint!

* The whole question involved in industrial disputes relates to the attitude of the employers or the management- 
One can at least appreciate that the honourable member for Bennelong has had a change of mind on this question and he now agrees with the Australian Teachers Federation, parents and friends associations and members on this side of the House who have pointed to the crisis in education at the primary, secondary and technical levels.

* This brings me to the point made by the honourable member for Bennelong - the crisis that exists in education in Australia; the representations that have been made by the Australian Teachers Federation and by educationalists in every State for a more active participation on the part of the Commonwealth at the primary, secondary and technical levels.

* .- By introducing the Stevedoring Industry Bill 1965 the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  and the Government have made abundantly clear their intention to smash the Waterside Workers Federation.

* A number of unions might readily disagree with some of the past activities of some branches of the Federation.

* The strong, with the knowledge of their superior weight of numbers and their control of the weapons with which this action will be fought, have set in motion machinery with which they anticipate they can completely destroy the Federation, its branches and members, the innocent and reputedly guilty alike.

* The Minister set about his deliberate intent to destroy, using every means at his disposal to ensure that each machinery clause of the Bill added to the impossibility of reconciliation and the survival of the Federation.

* The Minister has taken great pains to point out how fair both he and the Government have been in leaving the Federation a chance of survival.

* He has made provision for a specially constituted tribunal to be set up at his instigation before the Federation is deregistered or loses its rights under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in presidential session will, of course, on receiving instruction from the Minister, make an investigation to determine whether the conduct of the Federation has been such as to justify deregistration.

* So we have a right to assume that, if all union personnel allocated to an overseas bulk self trimmer stop on a matter which they consider to be a safety issue, even though subsequent inquiry may prove that they had been mistaken, then on receiving an absolutely adverse report from the adjudicator action could be taken to deregister the Federation.

* As few as eight members, or as many as 800 or 1,000, could cause all the Federation's members to lose their right to work on the waterfront.

* No matter how careful the Federation or branch officials may have been, no matter how long it was before an overt act took place, and no matter if the members and the branch concerned could be proved to be anti-Communist and their action spontaneous, purely local and not sponsored from outside the branch, that action could be interpreted to be the action of a " substantial number ", it could be said to have prevented or hindered stevedoring operations, and it could result in the deregistration of the Federation.

* Provision is being made for a union, or a number of different unions, to work the ports upon the Federation being deregistered.

* If an eight years period be used, it is found that the argument is much more in favour of the Federation.

* I have not heard of any uh i.matum being served by the pilots' **federation** or its representatives on Ansett-A.N.A.

* In the 60 years of **federation** in Australia no party has been more grievously divided than is the Australian Labour Party to-day.

* To indicate the extent of this problem and the fact that we are still in our infancy in dealing with it let me read an extract from the February issue - the most recent - of the Journal of the World Veterans Federation.

* Dr. Raden  Soeharso, an Indonesion for whom I have great respect, a director of the Solo Rehabilitation Centre in Indonesia, is reported in this way - 

 Dr. Raden Soeharso, of Indonesia, who was awarded the Rehabilitation Prize of the Federation In 1954, on the occasion of its Fourth General Assembly in Vienna, stressed the fact that, " During the past twelve years there has been remarkable progress in the development of rehabilitation services" and that, "to an unusual degree, this has been the result of international co-operation in sharing knowledge, skill, material sources and inspiration ".

* I ask: Has he seen a report of a statement by the secretary of the Victorian Employers Federation to the effect that industry is confident of finding jobs for school-leavers and will be able to place people of any age and any educational level?

* In truth, the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have been engaged in a prostitution of the very purposes of trade unionism.

* We have fought two world wars since **federation**.

* I do not know whether the Minister has seen a report of an address given by Professor A. J. Francis, head of the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Melbourne, to the Australian Road Federation on 22nd June 1964.

* It was a very long address, but this passage is worth quoting - 
The dates on which censuses have been taken in Australia since Federation are 31st March 1901, 3rd April 1911; 4th April 1921; 30th June 1933; 30th June 1947; 30th June 1954 and 30th June 1961.

* I think it will be quickly found that the union that has been responsible for most invoking of the provisions of sections 109 and 111 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act is the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Undoubtedly, this is the most important Social Services Bill that has come before the House in the last 5 or 6 years - certainly in the time I have been a member of this Parliament - and probably it is one of the most important Social Services Bills that has come to the House since Federation.

* This Bill is the most important piece of social services legislation put before us in recent times and quite possibly one of the most important since Federation.

* At the request of the Government of the Federation of Malaya the Royal Australian Navy has provided for the past two years a senior officer to command the Royal Malayan Navy.

* The Minister for Trade and Industry  (Mr. McEwen)  has been closely involved in the discussions and the Australian delegation to the negotiations which were held in London earlier this year included the  chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board, the  president  of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and a representative of the flour industry.

* The production of this documentary was subsequently undertaken by Associated-Rediffusion Limited of London, which is also a member of the Intertel Federation.

* I advise the honorable member for Scullin  (Mr. Peters)  that I have ascertained that the Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers is in consultation with the Department of Trade to prepare a certain case along the lines suggested in a question asked by the honorable member a little while ago.

* As I see the matter at this stage, I do not think that elections for officers of the New South Wales Teachers Federation come under his administration unless the form of ballot is one for which he is responsible.

* Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Proposal No.

* The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation made it clear that they wish to see the report when it is presented and to review its contents in order that they may make their recommendations to me before the Government makes its final determination.

* Following this action by the Association a new body was formed - the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* Then in 1964 the parties got together - that is to say, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the airline interests.

* In July 1966, following negotiations which commenced in May, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots extracted from the airline companies, under threat of an immediate strike if their full demands were not met, a substantial rise in salaries.

* Clause 11 (c) stated: 
The Federation undertakes to suspend the right to strike or to impose any other limitation upon work while a matter is under negotiation or inquiry in accordance with the procedures of this Agreement and during the period of 7 (lays after the conclusion of any conference referred to in clause 9 (d).

* To do what the Federation did in July 1966 - to announce during the course of negotiations for a pay increase that unless its demands were met in full it would then and there immediately go on strike - was a plain breach not only of the spirit but of the letter of the agreement on industrial relations procedures.

* Before I proceed to deal with that breach, let me inform the House that I have in my hand a Press statement that was issued by the Federation of Air Pilots in which it sought to set out the grounds upon which it opposed this Bill.

* Its rather lame answer - in fact it is a response rather than an answer - to the suggestion that it, the Federation, committed an essential breach of the agreement on industrial relations procedures in July 1966 was to say: 'It was not much of a breach because an inquiry had been carried out by a board of inquiry which recommended an increase in salary of 15% to pilots.

* There can be no doubt that the Federation called its men out on strike while negotiations were proceeding in relations to matters which were in dispute between the Federation and Qantas.

* In this Press statement issued by the Federation recently, a copy of which I have in my hand, at least it does not seek to deny that the November-December strike was a breach of the agreement on industrial relations pro cedures.

* Now we come to the present time and find that the Federation of Air Pilots has imposed a limitation upon the flying hours of its members because of a dispute that has arisen concerning superannuation.

* The position at the present time is that two major domestic airlines are in dispute with the Federation concerning superannuation contributions for pilots.

* The Federation leadership has imposed a limitation of work on its members as a weapon towards achieving a solution favourable to the Federation members.

* That again is a clear breach of the Agreement on Industrial Relationships Procedures, to which the Federation remained bound vis-a-vis the domestic airlines.

* It is true that, so far as the Federation and Qantas were concerned, the Agreement came to an end as a result of the November and December strike, but the Agreement remained on foot  so  far as the domestic airlines and the members of the Federation were concerned.

* The Federation, I regret to say, has been less than half truthful in answering the charge that the present limitation of work is a breach of the Agreement on Industrial Relationships Procedures.

* The Press statement is eloquently silent on the fact that the clause also prohibits the Federation from imposing a limitation of work.

* The next matter of some importance to which I want to refer is this: In the Press statement issued by the Federation on 20th October over the signature of  Mr B.  I. Crofts, we find a paragraph which refers to a letter that the Federation received from the Department of Labour and National Service dated 20th June 1967.

* Paragraph 4 of the statement reads: 
The Minister made reference to the current dispute between the domestic airline and the Federation and implied this was an example of the Federation's refusal to accept formal procedures for the resolution of disputes.

* The fact of this matter is that it was originally suggested by the Federation that the issue involved should be resolved under the provisions of the Industrial Relationships Procedures, Discussions were held, at the instigation of the Federation, between the Department of Labour and National Service and Airline Operators and on 20th June 1967 the Federation was advised by the Department of Labour and National Service- 
We can see from that paragraph what the Federation was trying to do.

* The Federation was arguing on the basis of the extract from the letter from the Department of Labour and National Service, which is set out in the Press statement, that it was justified in imposing the limitation on flying hours because the airline companies had denied the application of the Agreement to this situation.

* That was much less than truthful, because the Federation regrettably omitted to add to its Press statement - it should have been added to give the true picture - that the letter which contained the extract quoted in the Press statement also contained immediately below it another relevant paragraph.

* Why did the Federation, one may ask, omit to quote that paragraph?

* If the airline companies took the view, as they did, that the superannuation issue did not fall within the scope of the Agreement on Industrial Relationships Procedures, the Federation had a right under the Agreement to have the question of the applicability of the Agreement to this issue determined by a mediator.

* The position was that, until the Federation had exercised its right to ask for a mediator to determine the issue, it was bound under the Agreement to desist from any reliance on the right to strike or on any limitation of work, which is the relevant part in this context.

* That is why I say that the Federation has been regrettably lacking in frankness.

* After all the only case we have heard against the Bill today in the House is the Federation's case put by the honourable member for Stirling.

* But the Agreement has not been honoured by the Federation and it therefore has no legitimate ground for complaint in the action that the Government has taken.

* We believe that if one is confronted with the choice between **federation** and education, education must come first.

* I ask the Minister for the Interior: Has he had an opportunity to study a report of the Building Committee of the Australian Capital Territory Teachers Federation which, after paying tribute to many good features in our fine modern schools in the Territory, draws attention to many serious major deficiencies in the provisions made for both children and staff in many of the schools in the Territory?

* After holding discussions with Qantas and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, which continued over several weeks, the conciliator - he prefers to call himself the mediator - reported to the parties that he had been unable to prevail upon them to come to a long-term or permanent settlement covering all the areas of dispute.

* The effect on the last occasion was summed up very well in another place by  Senator Ridley,  who was formerly secretary in South Australia of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia.

* Let me read what he said, as reported in the "Sydney Morning Herald" of 21st September last, when he addressed the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation.

* My story is only partly told, but I think  I  have said enough to show that this is the worst Government in the history of Australia, and that the Minister for Trade  is  the worst Minister who has administered trade affairs since **federation**.

* What are the implications of to-day's stoppage, particularly as the Waterside Workers Federation has given an undertaking to desist from further stoppages for a period of one month?

* We all know that at the request of Indonesia and the Philippines a United Nations team went to this area to ascertain whether the people wanted to enter the Federation of Malaysia.

* At page 11 of the record of the convention, none other 'than the Communist Jim Healy, Federal Secretary of the Watersiders Federation, is shown.

* This is the submission, as I have said, of this Pensioners' Association, which is affiliated with the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation.

* The Association further submits - 
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">[Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Amendment (No.

* <para pgwide="yes">That the Schedule to the Customs Tariffs (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) I960,jas proposed to be amended by Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Proposals introduced into the House of Representatives on the eleventh day of May, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-one, be further amended as set out in the Schedule to these Proposals and that, on and from the sixteenth day of August, One thousand nine hundred and sixty-one, Duties of Customs be collected accordingly.

* The other day, he addressed us very briefly about South Viet Nam, but he told us nothing about the important question of the proposed Federation of Malaysia, about which honorable members have asked many questions during the consideration of this group of departmental estimates.

* In its Third Report (1936) the Commission finally rejected the principle of compensation for disabilities arising from Federation, and chose in place thereof the principle of financial need, which it expressed in the following terms - " Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States."

* The provisions relating to the distribution of the States into divisions have not been changed since Federation, and it is not intended to alter in substance those provisions.

* No representations have been made to me by the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* I ask the Treasurer whether the Australian Olympic Federation has yet approached the Government regarding a grant towards the expense of sending an Australian team to Rome.

* But we notice that when the independent Federation of Malaya was formed Singapore was excluded.

* I am thinking of the Hurseys and their relations with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* The action on the Australian waterfront is another illustration of the Communist influence in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* One relates to officials who come from the ranks of the Waterside Workers Federation, having had, say, 10 years of service.

* Has the Minister for Primary Industry or the Depart.ment of Primary Industry received representations from the Tasmanian Farmers Federation requesting a review of the department's decision to withdraw summarily licences held by Tasmanian processing and slaughtering works to export meat to America?

* I have already given assurances to the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations that the provisions of the Act in relation to this matter will be examined and all alternative courses of action considered.

* Unfortunately, the Waterside Workers Federation has fallen under Communist domination.

* I remind the House that of the five principal officers of the Federation, three are members of the Communist Party.

* We know that the Sydney and Melbourne branches, which have the major influence in the Federation, also have a considerable Communist influence upon them.

* It is necessary to bear these facts in mind when judging the effect of the Federation's actions on Australian trade.

* What the Federation has done under its leadership is consistently to use the strike weapon to further political ends.

* The real cause of the dispute - and no one doubts it - was the Federation's opposition which it had declared to the French military campaign in Indo-China.

* Another instance is the action of the Federation in relation to the South African apartheid policy.

* The Federation was criticised by  Mr. Justice  Gallagher for these stoppages on vessels which were trading with South Africa.

* His  Honour said - 
What benefits could flow to members of the Federation from stoppages directed against loading goods for South Africa?

* Do we think that the Waterside Workers Federation is giving effect to the Communist policies and bringing political blackmail to bear on the Commonwealth Government, or do we think it is acting in the interests of its members?

* The Federation has directed political stoppages on domestic policies too, not only against the Commonwealth Government, but also against the State Governments.

* These stoppages are not concerned with the benefit of members of the Federation.

* The Federation tried to influence the Victorian Government by bringing about stoppages when an amendment was made to the Workers' Compensation Act.

* It is true that in July of this year claims were made for the benefit of members of the Federation.

* These were legitimate matters for a union to claim, but did the Federation claim these according to the ordinary processes of the law?

* No Did the Federation come to the tribunal which is set up by the law of this land to look after their interests in such cases?

* Mr. Docker,  at a stop work meeting in Adelaide in August of this year, said - 
This statement is from the Federation that the honorable member for Stirling  (Mr. Webb)  seeks to protect, claims has a right to strike, and says is so delicate it needs protection and should not be interfered with.

* However, this is the use that is being made by the Federation, of the power to strike and it is abundantly clear from the evidence what is behind it.

* It shows that the Federation, influenced by its officials, has in many cases challenged the Government of the country.

* We would not be true to the trust that has been reposed in us as the elected representatives of the people if we permitted this type of activity by the Federation to continue.

* I believe that the people of Australia are sick and tired of these operations by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The action that is proposed in the Bill is directed at curbing irresponsible action by the Federation.

* As a practical matter it is true that the Waterside Workers Federation has had control of the recruitment of labour - subject to submitting names to the Authority - for very many years.

* In 1947 the Act provided that those members who sought registration by the Authority had, at the time of seeking registration, to be members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In a practical way this gave the Federation the right of nomination.

* It provided, for the first time, that the Federation should specifically have the right to nominate those workers to be registered by the Authority.

* That is the proposal which is taking away from the Federation the right to nominate those who will be registered by the Authority for work in the industry.

* It is quite clear that the Federation had had an exceptional power conferred on it.

* It is quite clear, too, by its actions that the Federation has revealed irresponsibility and has forfeited its claim to have this right.

* In his second reading speech the Minister explained not only matters relating to the stoppages that I have mentioned, but also the fact that the Federation was recommending an extraordinarily high pro* portion of persons with criminal records.

* It is difficult to believe that the Federation would be ignorant of the fact that it was doing this.

* When the Authority has prescribed quotas, the Federation has used its right of nominating workers and has been tardy in filling the quotas.

* The quotas have not been filled and the Federation has not submitted its nominations, thus using its power as a weapon of strangulation of trade at the ports.

* It is true that under sections 143 and 144 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act there already exists the power of deregistration of this union, but it is also clear that deregistration under that Act might very well result in a situation where the Waterside Workers Federation was left with its powers under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* It is necessary to deal with that situation and accordingly provisions have been made and a procedure laid down for deregistration of the Federation.

* The deregistration provisions are drastic provisions, but undoubtedly the situation has been reached with the Federation where it is necessary to have drastic powers.

* If the Federation is found to be acting irresponsibly it may be deregistered.

* In other words, the workers are protected but the Federation is deregistered, losing its privileges and powers.

* The majority of Australians look to this Parliament to protect them against the kind of strangulation of Australian industry at the ports that is being carried out for political purposes by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The trouble on the waterfront is due not to the rank and file of the organisation but clearly, if one looks at the evidence, because of the actions of Federation officials and domination by members of the Communist Party.

* It has been a characteristic of all governments since **federation** that none has shown any inclination to get away from the system which centres all authority in the Cabinet and gives the Parliament very little or no say in affairs.

* Since Federation the fisheries legislation of the States has in practice operated out to 3 miles and the Commonwealth fisheries legislation operates from there on.

* If that would be a new international law right arising it would attach to the only international person in the Australian Federation, namely the Commonwealth Government.

* It is to the credit of the radical section of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation that the Government has decided to make this contribution.

* I have before me a list showing the number of sitting days in every year since Federation.

* Yes,  I  inspected terminal sites at Hobart when  I  was there for the meeting of the Australian Road Transport Federation.

* Discussions have been proceeding, under the chairmanship of  Mr. Woodward,  between the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers.

* At a conference in Melbourne in October last year, the justification for the levy for promotion and the operation of the promotion plan were explained to a joint conference of the national executives of the Australian Woolgrowers Council and the Wool and Meat Producers Federation by  Mr. Vines,  managing director of the secretariat.

* The dispute arose because the Ford company refused representations from the Federated Clerks Union of Australia to have a union-company agreement involving union membership on similar lines to that in existence between the company and the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia.

* He found it impossible to escape the conclusion that the Ford motor company was most unreasonable in denying the Federated Clerks Union of Australia the same consideration that it extended to the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia.

* He suggested that the dispute between the clerks and the Ford motor organisation should be settled on the basis of a negotiated agreement similar to that which was in existence between the company and the Vehicle 
Builders Employees Federation.

* Members of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia were not involved at all in the original dispute in connection with which Commissioner Findlay found that the Ford motor company was the guilty party.

* The Federation made application to the court under section 1 09 of the Act.

* We have seen the failure of the League of Nations, man struggling towards the poet's dream of a parliament of man, a **federation** of the world.

* Our own **federation** did not come about overnight,  Mr. Deputy Speaker.

* It is no exaggeration to say that the incidence of taxation is now more unfair than ever before in the history of **federation**, and that it is falling on people who can ill-afford to bear it.

* I do not want to traverse matters that I discussed in my second-reading speech, except to say that I am pleased to hear that talks are taking place between the Minister and the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in regard to future expenditure on long service leave.

* Earlier, in another debate, I complained about the lack of such consultation, and the Minister knows that on the last occasion when we considered this matter- 
Has the Minister for Social Services seen Press reports that he was unwilling to receive a deputation from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation?

* Walls, who significantly is Finance and Economic Consultant to the New Zealand Manufacturers Federation Inc.

* The Boer War veteran is not receiving very much consideration from the Government simply because it contends that the Boer War took place before **federation** in 1901.

* In that connexion may I be permitted to point out to the honorable member that I have now held the office of Minister for Social Services for a longer period than any other man since **federation** and I am in a position to judge the officers of the department.

* The history of the decimal currency movement in Australia dates back to **federation** and, as early as June, 1901, the honorable member for South Sydney moved - 
After we had read what the Minister for Labour and National Service had said, we of the Opposition asked the leaders of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation whether they knew anything about the legislation.

* All that day, and the  president  and secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation were also in attendance.

* The conference continued next day and late that afternoon the  president  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions came to see me, as did also the  president  of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Beitz.

* As a matter of fact, most of the recent entrants to the Waterside Workers Federation are returned servicemen.

* In truth, the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have been engaged in a prostitution of the very purposes of trade unionism.

* They made the decision at that time to withdraw from registration by the Arbitration Court and they took on a new name, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* Since then the Federation has avoided the use of the Arbitration Court and later the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and has sought to deal directly with the airline operators.

* Government has been able to do since **federation** and what no Premiers' Conference has been able to do either and that is divide the tax field satisfactorily between the Commonwealth and the States.

* The committee recommended, among other things that the Constitution should be amended to provide - 
I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question concerning the recent dispute between Qantas Empire Airways Limited and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* Is the Minister aware of the uncalled for and erroneous attack made on the Waterside Workers Federation by a senator in another place quite recently, charging that organisation- 
As the honorable member for Batman has said, and as the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr.

* At that time Communists and other extreme elements on the waterfront were riding roughshod over the decent men in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Today, because of that legislation, decent men in the Labour Party - decent trade unionists - arc responsible for conducting the affairs of the Federation.

* I think the Federation and the industry would better serve the men on the waterfront if they consideration palletisation more and containerisation a little less.

* Of course, in the Federation at the moment a united front is being put to the conference.

* I think the Federation and the responsible, moderate men in it would be doing other  members  a disservice if they forgot that there is a deep philosophical cleavage between men like Docker and men like Stewart and, perhaps, Fitzgibbon.

* This would be tragic not only to the industry but also to the men in the Federation.

* I would imagine that it would be the wish of the moderates in the Federation and the A.C.T.U.

* I have a suspicion - I hope 1 do not have an over-suspicious mind - that there may be some kind of unholy deal between the extremists in the Federation and these other people who want to control the industry to sell out the independent stevedores, because extremists in a union would much prefer to deal with a monopoly than with a democratically constructed industry.

* and the responsible and decent members of the Federation will be deeply conscious of the big stakes involved.

* Basically there has been a demarcation dispute between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Transport Workers Union over the working of forklift trucks.

* Australia is the only **federation** in the world where it has been possible to obtain agreement between State governments and the Federal government under which there will be no litigation.

* I think that the coming into existence of the Democratic Labor Party is the worst catastrophe since Federation.

* After 63 years of **federation** we have at last reached the stage of establishing the first Royal Australian Mint.

* Since **federation**, therefore, we have had the authority to establish our own local Royal Mint.

* If they were to apply a  10  per cent, margin, the position would be nearer to the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review which examined this question very thoroughly, lt felt that the principle of one vote one value had been properly applied during the seven distributions that had taken place since the Federation, but it considered that the provision should be tightened up.

* The Gliding Federation of Australia has made a submission.

* Let me add in reply to the honourable member for Braddon that today I was visited by  Mr Cooper,  who is a representative of the King Island Settlers Association, and a member of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation branch on King Island, in company with  Mr Mills,  the  President  of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* I will read the remarks made by the honourable member for 
Graziers Federal Council of Australia and of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation does not adequately provide for representation of producers throughout Australia, action can quickly be taken to correct the situation.

* Furthermore, if producers in the Northern Territory, in the Kimberleys, in the Channel country, of which we have heard so much, in Victoria, or in any other part of Australia are dissatisfied with the way in which the representatives on the committee nominated by the Graziers Federal Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation are doing their job, those producers, within their own domestic circles, can move to have the Minister requested to remove that member from the committee, as is provided for in clause 11, which states - (1.)

* is sponsoring a candidate for the secretaryship of the Waterside Workers Federation, but one member of the A.L.P.- 
My question is directed to the Minister for External Affairs.

* Is the Minister aware of any discussions with or approaches to the Federation of Malaya and to Japan over membership of Seato and, if so, what is the Government's attitude to this possible increase of membership of Seato?

* Is the Minister able to reconcile the decision of the Executive of the Waterside Workers Federation, announced yesterday, to discontinue the fortnightly stoppages- 
Every State in the Commonwealth adopts  a  different approach to the question of education.

* The Teachers Federation and other ancillary bodies which are concerned with education stir up the parents and citizens associations and other public bodies which in tum bring pressure to bear upon the State governments.

* I am not aware of any request by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots to include these conditions in the operating requirements for these operations.

* I.  Ellis, Honorary Secretary, and other State representatives of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation submitted a number of proposed alterations to Commonwealth social service benefits to me on 4th May 1966.

* It comprises 25 members from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and 25 from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council plus an independent  chairman.

* Over the years there have always been problems arising amongst the three wool growers' organisations - the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* Fairbairn) put up a sterling case on this point He proved very definitely that this Government has done more to achieve decentralisation than any government since Federation.

* The Australian tariff was associated with the early history of the Australian colonies before we became a Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth tariff was introduced at Federation in 1901.

* of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation, and the accompanying petition.

* .- I take the opportunity tonight of replying to the honorable member for Mackellar  (Mr. Wentworth)  in connection with his speech in the House last night in which, to my mind, he launched an unjustified attack on the officials of the Teachers Federation of New South Wales under the privilege of Parliament.

* Last night he bitterly condemned  Mr. Sam  Lewis, the  President  of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, a man who has had the respect, affection and love of the overwhelming majority of members of the Federation for many years.

* The honorable member praised a violent reactionary group which belongs to the Teachers Federation and which is known as the Federation Reform Committee.

* He is one of the leaders of this violent reactionary group in the Teachers Federation of New South Wales known as the Federation Reform Committee of which the honorable member for Mackellar speaks with so much affection and with which he appears to be so intimate.

* It is a small group of mostly ultraconservative or reactionary people who seek to impose their will on the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* The matter referred to by the honorable gentleman has already been taken up with me by  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Prior to that year trade with Southern Rhodesia was recorded against the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

* Following my statement to the House on 9th March 1966, Australian forestry, including this proposed programme, was thoroughly debated both in this House and in the Senate for the first time since Federation.

* Then the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia extended its demand to a 3 overall increase in wages.

* The Federation said - and this is important - that it was prepared to negotiate on the foundry claim, but at that stage the Amalgamated Engineering Union came in and demanded that the 3 overall increase be extended to all employees.

* The fifth ground is that he publicly opposed the formation of the Central African Federation, and also British policy in Nyasaland.

* The terms of the proposals made to the Government in November by the Australian Public Service Federation were that, pending a date for the total abolition of the means test, the following scheme should operate: 
Cabinet has not officially considered the full findings of the committee of inquiry into the wool industry.

* I am under the impression that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation met in Melbourne last week, but I have had no communication from it, and I do not even know whether it had this matter on its agenda or considered it.

* I have been told that there have been some preliminary discussions at executive level between the council and the **federation**.

* I am a bit concerned that affiliated bodies of the **federation** are voicing opinions on the matter.

* This has been brought about by bringing home to each member of the Waterside Workers Federation the fact that when he takes certain action it will cost him a certain amount.

* At page 60 of its report the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority states that the Waterside Workers Federation and the A.C.T.U.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation and promised by the Government at that conference has been incorporated in this measure.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation will carry out the undertakings they gave at that time?

* and the Waterside Workers Federation, and although these requests have been met in the present bill, listening to both the honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable member for Petrie one gathers that the waterside workers, having got certain demands agreed to, as these honorable members put it, are going to bring down a mass log - fifty more demands, in the words of the honorable member for Petrie.

* It is quite apparent that in all the other ports in Australia industrial peace on the waterfront can exist, but it seems that in Melbourne and Sydney some elements have arisen which have tried to disrupt the agreement entered into in good faith by the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation and the A.C.T.U.

* The report deals also with the question of working in the rain and, again, draws attention to the fact that there has not been as much co-operation on this subject from the Waterside Workers Federation as could be desired.

* Then, I submit, there needs to be an improvement in the **federation**'s attitude to safety on the waterfront.

* It would be a pity if by not thinking of what we were doing we drifted into a complete centralization of power and gave **federation** away.

* Can the Minister inform the House of the nature of Australia's obligations for the defence of Malaya and whether any commitment has yet been entered into in respect of the new Federation of Malaysia?

* 24th Board Meeting, International Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, 1964.

* It goes back to the very beginning of **federation**.

* What were the (a) numbers of votes and (b) percentages of formal votes recorded by the main political parties in elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives since **federation**?

* The universities, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation all undertake research, and many of their projects are of  a  similar nature.

* The first wheat agreement was introduced for the purpose of regularizing wheat sales and bringing stability to one of the most unstable industries of the Commonwealth, lt had been a most unstable industry ever since **federation**.

* It is not proposed to prevent cigarette advertising on radio and television, but on 8th October 1965 I announced that, following discussions between the Minister for Health, repre sentatives of the cigarette manufacturing industry and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, a voluntary code to regulate cigarette advertising on television will be introduced by the Federation on 1st January 1966.

* I make special reference to the one pilot policy being followed in relation to the Twin Otters and to the concern of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots about the safety aspects if something were to happen to the pilot.

* Having regard to the donation of the taxpayers' money to the Australian Olympic Federation, will the Prime Minister consider drawing the Federation's attention to the fact that many of these taxpayers are unhappy that Australia's greatest swimmer, Murray Rose, who recently broke a world record, has been left out of the Olympic team?

* The meeting was convened by  Mr Porteus, President  of the Edith Creek branch of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* The Federation is affiliated on a national scale with the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is affiliated with the Australian Labour Party and I have the utmost respect for the waterside workers.

* But the Minister is most critical of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* So that the Minister may understand just who the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation are I remind him that they were in King's Hall yesterday.

* Does he not know that the  president  of the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Jim  Cummings, a prominent member of the D.L.P., was in Canberra opposing this bill with every breath in his body?

* I refer to such men as Jack Beitz, the federal  president  of the Waterside Workers Federation, and Dutchie Young,  president  of the Sydney branch of that body.

* There is one thing of which we can be sure - what occurs on the waterfront occurs because the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation want it to happen.

* I ask the Minister this question: Did the Waterside Workers Federation not ask him, and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, to direct that when a dispute occurs on a ship that dispute should be isolated and that other men should not be sent to work the ship?

* They abide by principles which are the principles of the trade union movement and not only of the Waterside Workers Federation,.

* : Is it not a fact that  Mr. Jack  Beitz,  President  of the Waterside Workers Federation, asked him only last week to consider a request to isolate a ship on which a dispute has occurred, and by that means to avoid embroiling the rest of the industry or the.

* If the Minister, the Government and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority were not so stupid and if they followed the advice of the Waterside Workers Federation, disputes could: be isolated.

* In truth, the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have been engaged in a prostitution of the very purposes of trade unionism.

* How dare the Waterside Workers Federation discuss such important matters as world peace and disarmament!

* The Minister claims that the **federation** is prostituting its principles.

* It is a pity that more trade unionists do not take part in the struggle to obtain a basic understanding of the peace movement and world disarmament because the wider the knowledge that trade unionists have, the greater will the trade union movement become,  i  have spoken to members not only of the Waterside Workers Federation but also of other unions throughout Australia on the issue of world peace, and I state quite frankly that I am honestly proud of the Waterside Workers Federation for- the role it is playing and the lead that it is giving in the struggle for- world peace in the movement, for the banning of the atomic bomb, and in ensuring protection for the people from the terrible threat of atomic fall-out.

* I support the Waterside Workers Federation in its demonstrations on such issues.

* The reason for the consignors and consignees using road transport as against sea transport was not strike action by the Waterside Workers Federation but door-to-door delivery by road at a far cheaper rate than the shipowners were prepared to give because they put profits before service.

* The referendum proposal in this Bill most deservedly should pass on its sheer merits - whether they are spelt out in terms of the logic of our circumstance or whether they are spelt out having relation to the tremendous change that has taken place between the two Houses of the Parliament since Federation.

* One of the fictions which no doubt will be employed in the discussion throughout the country on the referendum proposal will be that there was a steady unanimity of opinion at the time of the founding of Federation concerning proposed section 24 of the Constitution dealing with the relationship between the two Houses.

* It will be said that the founders of the Federation were of the opinion that the House of Representatives should as nearly as practicable have twice the numbers of the Senate, and that this has been maintained since then.

* There was a tremendous division of opinion in the Federation discussions on this particular section.

* The argument that prevailed at the time - and this concerned one of the essential elements of Federation - was that the position of the States would be put in jeopardy.

* The original role of the Senate has in fact changed completely in the 65 years since Federation.

* The role of the Senate, as originally conceived back in the days of the Federation debate, has completely gone.

* Indeed, one could with relish join the exhortation of Alcibiades in " Timon of Athens " - 
Last week the Australian Wheat Growers Federation again met in Perth.

* As a result of that meeting I met the executive of the Federation in Melbourne yesterday, where certain recommendations were put to me.

* The Federation recommended that the Australian Wheat Board be authorised to sell on the domestic market wheat for purposes other than home consumption - that is, as stock feed or for industrial use, such as the making of starch  - at a  price lower than the present horns consumption price of SI.

* This morning I sent a telegram to each State Minister for Agriculture advising that the Commonwealth concurs in the Federation's proposal and asking for the early agreement of the States to make appropriate changes in their legislation.

* In my discussions with the Federation reference was also made to the possibility of a Commonwealth contribution towards making up the difference between the present price and any newly determined price for stock feed wheat or wheat used for industrial purposes.

* Early action to permit application of the prices the Federation has proposed is a responsible approach by the industry to overcome some of the problems that are looming with the prospect of substantial quantities of over-quota wheat being available in the coming season in some States.

* I am sure that the proposals submitted by the Federation are ones which will be welcomed by the industrial users of wheat, by the provender millers and by the users of stock feed, such as the poultry, pig and cattle industries.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation at the time.

* True, a change in the general secretaryship of the Waterside Workers Federation had occurred.

* At that point, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the shipowners were not aware of the Minister's intention.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation will work towards giving Australia that peace in industry so essential to our trading position in the immediate and future periods.

* Is it true that the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria claims that the co-operative bousing movement in Victoria is being starved for funds and that housing societies in Victoria have hundreds of people on their waiting lists?

* The Federation claims that these people are mainly in the low to lowmiddle income group and are suffering from the housing finance squeeze.

* Established as far back as 1860, the movement has progressed and, following **federation**, clubs were incorporated under the Defence Act of 1903.

* Is it a fact that correspondence has been received by the Minister from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots supporting the committee's recommendation and declaring it to be a practical proposal?

* Confrontation has, therefore, this week more or less reached a moment of truth for Sukarno and for Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the young Federation itself.

* We cannot have in the new States the sort of State paraphernalia which we understand to-day, and which has served us so well since **federation**, and even before that.

* The Committee was asked to determine the amount of capital that had been expended to develop the Post Office since Federation in J 901; that is, it was asked to calculate how much had been spent by the Government on building post offices and telephone exchanges, laying of co-axial cables and all the items that formed part of developing the Post Office.

* I suppose the Government said: " We will split the difference of 80 million and assume that the Post Office has cost 340 million to develop since Federation ".

* The Victorian Employers Federation has suggested that the Government might well consider allowing private enterprise a 40 per cent, shareholding in the Post Office.

* Let us remember that the Victorian Employers Federation has its eye on the possibility that if a section of the Post Office becomes a success it will be handed over to private enterprise.

* Yet every honorable member opposite who has spoken in this debate has found something wrong with obeying the law and has, in effect, whitewashed the militants and the Communists in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* As honorable members are well aware, the Waterside Workers Federation is vested with great responsibility.

* Over the years, the Federation has shown, however, that under Communist influence and control it has had little respect for this responsibility, and it is obvious that it has battened on the waterfront in order to carry forward its Communistic objective of eventually bringing Australia to its economic knees and making it ripe for a Communist takeover.

* Under the control and direction of the Communist masters the Waterside Workers Federation, as a responsible industrial organisation, has betrayed trusts, broken agreements, flaunted awards and abused undertakings.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has shown itself to be completely irresponsible and to be well organised in using deliberate actions of disruption which have at times threatened our entire economy.

* I should say that if the losses to Australian industries occasioned by strikes on the waterfront by members of the Waterside Workers Federation were tallied they would amount to millions of pounds.

* As required under section 36 (1) (a) of the Stevedoring Industry Act, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority was obliged, because of the tactics of the Waterside Workers Federation, to serve notice of an inquiry.

* A second waterside worker wrote to the local representative in these terms - 
In my association with the waterfront, I have come to know the prominent Communists whose names have been mentioned in this House, such as  Mr. Docker, Mr. Roach, Mr. Wallington, Mr. Nelson  the secretary of the Sydney branch of the Federation,  Mr. Heidke, Mr. Bolger  the Vigilance Officer,  Mr. Munro, Mr. Maxwell  and  Mr. Fred  Watson of Port Kembla.

* The iron grip of the Communist masters of the Waterside Workers Federation has gradually tightened.

* What chance would he have of influencing the policy of the Waterside Workers Federation with these three powerful Communists breathing heavily down his neck?

* In the days when Jim Healy was Federal Secretary of the Federation, if he entered into an agreement, that was the agreement.

* Let us look at the image of the branches of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But the fact that men of that kind are presidents of their respective branches and councils gives an air of respectability to these parts of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Anyone who suggests that they have a court controlled ballot does not know the make up of the Federation's leadership.

* I doubt very much that the Red bosses of the Waterside Workers Federation want the waterside workers to have any better conditions than they have today.

* I strongly support it and reject completely out of hand the amendment proposed by the Opposition because it is industrially meaningless and because it seeks only to placate the Red bosses of the Waterside Workers Federation so that they can continue along their ruthless way of bringing this country to its economic knees thus making way eventually for a Communist takeover.

* At the very moment the Prime Minister was speaking, Malaysia was experiencing the gravest threat to her stability since the creation of the Federation - a threat arising not from Communism but from communalism.

* No government in the history of **federation** has convened the Parliament so infrequently and achieved so little for Australian industries as this Government has.

* The honorable member for Blaxland, of all people, should have known that  Mr. Monk  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and officers of the Waterside Workers Federation were in this building meeting with the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  before the bill was introduced.

* If he has any recollection of the Minister's second-read'ing speech he knows that the Minister said that he had had those discussions, and that certain proposals in the bill had been changed in deference to representations to the Minister by the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* The honorable member should know, as almost everybody in Australia knows, that the Waterside Workers Federation fought bitterly against the whole concept of radio pickups - a system which is now an integral part of the waterside industry.

* So strong was this resistance that in Queensland the Waterside Workers Federation lost the right, on a demarcation basis, to do certain work.

* That work went to the members of another union because the Waterside Workers Federation refused to have anything to do with bulk handling methods.

* You can go to individual ports and tell by the records of the various members of the Waterside Workers Federation what was the nature of the governing body of the union in that port at the time these waterside workers were admitted.

* A most important factor to-day is that there is still a great build-up of people seeking to be registered as members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and thereby to become entitled to work on the waterfront.

* When this application came before the commission  Mr. Docker,  the industrial agent for the Waterside Workers Federation, put up a merely formal objection to the application - " formal " is the only word which would describe it - and I think the decision given by the presidential member,  His  Honour  Mr. Justice  Ashburner, is worth reciting briefly.

* On 9th June, 1959, among other things he said - I think this is the apposite paragraph - 
Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Bill 1963  -  by leave - taken as a whole, and agreed to.

* Further, has the Minister seen a report that the Waterside Workers Federation has unanimously decided to send a representative to North Vietnam to attend a conference called to discuss solidarity with the workers and people of South Vietnam?

* Has the Minister received a copy of the insulting letter sent by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation, addressed from the Trades Hall, Melbourne, to the Consul for South Viet Nam in Canberra?

* You can study the whole history of **federation** and you will find that no previous Prime Minister has ever, in similar circumstances, run away as the right honorable member for Kooyong has done on this occasion.

* When we have completed our present three-year term, this Government will have been in office continuously for a period equal to the total of the periods of office of the Labour Party since the beginning of **federation**.

* A letter was subsequently received from the Electrical and Radio Federation (Queensland) containing the following statement - 
These were the products Robertson was selling.

* He was then reported to the Federal Association of Wholesale Electrical Merchants - the Australiawide Federation - and a week later he received a letter that I think is worth quoting as indicative of the type of coercion to which he was subjected.

* If the people are to continue to be denied schemes such as the one which we proposed and that which the British people enjoy, as an alternative the Government could adopt a scheme similar to that which has been tried and proved by the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* Under that scheme, after twelve months' membership a member becomes entitled to the following benefits: - 
This scheme has been tried and proved, and in the absence of a scheme of the kind which we would introduce, the Government would do well to examine ways and means by which the scheme of the Teachers Federation could be adopted.

* The fact that the Seamen's Union, the Waterside Workers Federation or any other union - irrespective of its leadership - puts forward a case at this time for a wage increase can never, by any stretch of the imagination, be said to be a Communist plot.

* I remind the Minister that on 14th May, in answer to a question asked after the publication of Press reports that he was unwilling to receive a deputation from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation, he said that he would not willingly slight any pensioner organisation or any pensioner.

* Since that date has the Minister received from the Federation two letters, one dated 14th May and the other dated 30th May, seeking an interview with him?

* From a discussion with some of my colleagues a short time ago I have learned that since **federation** there have been some governments which, although they have agreed to go to the people at a prescribed time, or to allow the Opposition to bring on a debate on the motion to adjourn, have not abided by their undertakings.

* While we continue to act in accordance with that type of democratic principle in this Parliament, we shall continue to contribute to the well-being of the people whom we represent, whether they be on the Australian mainland or in the Territory of Papua and 
Has he received a request from the Australian Parachute Federation asking for a subsidy to help the sport of parachuting?

* The Government expects all parties to the Conference, including the Waterside Workers* Federation, to honour the agreement.

* Has the Miners' Federation made representations for changes in the miners' pension scheme to provide for the scheme to be based on an excise imposed on coal production and paid by mine proprietors?

* The very fact that in 1961 almost half the total area of Australia, the northern half of it, is regarded as remote is a pretty disgraceful reflection on the way our National Parliament has carried out its responsibilities since **federation**.

* part of the Waterside Workers Federation to force the employment of more men in the hold?

* But, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, there have been only two double dissolutions since the time of **federation** and there has never been a joint sitting of the two Houses.

* What this referendum proposal really means is fewer members of Parliament - that for the first time since Federation a limit will be placed on the number of members of Parliament.

* What union officials since **federation** have served gaol sentences for offences against Commonwealth industrial law?

* Why does not the honorable member protest to his own Government about Healy, the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, going to Russia, getting his instructions and coming back to Australia?

* Has the Government in any way informed Sabah and Sarawak that Australia could not or would not defend them if they left the Malaysian Federation?

* Is he aware of any moves for a new assessment of the attitudes of the people of the Borneo .States now that there is no longer so comprehensive a political and economic basis for the Federation which they agreed to join two years ago?

* I have not formally received any proposals from the Australian Wheat Growers Federation although it has notified me informally of its decisions and I have read about them in the Press.

* The Wheat Growers Federation is meeting with me next Friday in Sydney to discuss these proposals.

* The Federation has shown courage and a responsibility in relation to its problems in the proposals it has put forward, but to say that implementation of the proposals will be automatic is premature at this time.

* How many petitions have been presented in each Parliament since Federation?

* Was the implementation of these conditions requested by the Air Pilots' Federation?

* On what dates since Federation has a census been taken?

* The Director of the Queensland Employers' Federation stated - 
I wish to refer to one recommendation made by that committee which has a definite bearing not only on this Budget but also on the future of Australia.

* Prior to **federation** the Imperial Parliament created five colonies out of the territory that was originally administered as New South Wales - New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and New Zealand.

* I have not seen a claim for increased salaries submitted anywhere by the Staffs Association or the Teachers Federation which has not made reference in the first part of the submission to Australian National University salaries, and those references have had influence in the decisions which have been made.

* Federation.

* I cite these things simply to show that the same sort of problems arise in our sister Dominion of Canada, which is a **federation** similar to Australia but which has a population about half as great again as ours, and which is faced with difficulties in relation to tax sharing between the central Government and the provincial or State governments and municipalities.

* They realize that the Budget that this committee is ostensibly discussing to-night must surely rank as one of the most disappointing Budgets in the history of **federation**.

* Quite recently there was a conference between the Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, but the representatives considered it necessary to report back to their organizations after the meeting because they felt bound by the decisions that had been made by their respective annual conferences.

* Has a strong objection been lodged by the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots against a relaxation of regulations, and is this objection supported by evidence of over twenty near misses in full daylight between commercial and light aircraft in Queensland over the last twelve months?

* It is true that in any **federation** you will have two forces at work.

* One is the centrifugal force, which tends outwards to put the control and the power in the organs of **federation** itself; the other is the inward tending, the centripetal, force which tends to put the power in the central government.

* This has been interpreted, since **federation**, as placing the right to make laws concerning aborigines beyond the province of this Parliament.

* During that time - I do not say this in a boastful way - the Attorney-General's Department had a record of activity unequalled since **federation**.

* I have learned to-day that the constitutional review conference of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland has just opened in London under the chairmanship of  Mr. Macmillan.

* The Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya noted with satisfaction that the Netherlands Government are willing, to subject their policies in Netherlands New Guinea to the scrutiny and judgment of the United Nations.

* It was agreed that the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya, who has already held similar talks on this issue with other governments as well as with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, would in the light of the outcome of these various talks consider whether at a later stage further talks might be useful.

* The Ord River has been there since Federation; in fact it was there long before Federation.

* I did see a pamphlet that had been issued by the executive .of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I should say immediately that whenever any propaganda or publicity is issued on behalf of the Federation it has to be accepted with the greatest reserve, because the statements made in such publicity or propaganda are seldom correct.

* As to the first statement which was made in the pamphlet and which has been mentioned by the honorable gentleman, I confirm now that I stated that of the 990 men who were recommended by the Federation, 260 had criminal records.

* I also state that when the breakdown of the kinds of persons who were nominated by the Federation is looked at, all the statements made by the Federation other than the two that I have just mentioned will be found to be incorrect.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is now attempting to create the impression that it is willing to co-operate in the Woodward inquiry, despite the fact that only a few weeks ago the Federation denounced this inquiry as being bogus and an attempt to help the Government and has flatly refused to co-operate with  Mr. Woodward  in the holding of the inquiry.

* Such .anxieties might 'be avoided if the Netherlands -and Australia were to  work  .together to bring  their  respective pants of the island to the point of self determination at the same time giving t'hem a common language (it would 'have to be 'English)  which  would make possible 'a nation of -United New Guinea or ja Melanesian Federation .to .include .some of the outlying islands.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is now asking that four people should be employed to do this job.

* Negotiations were attempted, but agreement could not be arrived at between the **federation** and the shipowners, so the shipowners have said that they should now follow the normal arbitration procedure and have suggested a board of reference to hear the claim of the **federation**.

* If the **federation** is not satisfied with the result obtained from such a procedure, the matter should be taken on appeal to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Waterside Workers Federation have refused to agree to this proposal.

* This particular agreement was of short term duration (fourteen and a half months) and was specially sought by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots in lieu of the normal long term agreement.

* In exchange for this consideration the **federation** agreed not to seek salary increases during the currency of the agreement.

* The company applies the same salary conditions to operating pilots whether or not they are members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* The organizations which have claims with Qantas are as follows: - Australian Federation of Air Pilots, The Airline Hostesses Association, The Australasian Airline Navigators Association, Local Employees Union at Rome, Singapore M.A.L./ Qantas Employees Union, Professional Radio Employees Institute, Australasian Transport Officers Federation, A.C.T.U., Federated Clerks Union of Australia.

* However, there have been no discussions during the pas' three months because Qantas has been in almost continuous negotiation with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots whose representatives also represent the hostesses' association.

* That has been our policy since before the time of **federation**.

* I turn now to the official journal of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria.

* In my book, such posturing is contemptible because, as a political party in and out of office since the beginning of Federation, the Australian Labour Party has made a significantly small contribution to the granting of social service benefits in this country.

* Deakin's story of **federation** tells how Chamberlain attempted to keep control of Australia's foreign policy, defence and similar matters.

* Part of the story of the beginning of the Australian **federation** was a demand by Australian leaders to make their own decision.

* The Commonwealth Industrial Court decided this matter in  1958,  in the case of the Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association against the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, which is reported in the 13th volume of the Industrial Information Bulletins, at page  647.

* For many years after Federation, the immediate security of our nation was never directly threatened.

* Labour has had several terms of office since **federation**.

* We have not had one valid complaint, at least since I have been the Minister, and the records do not disclose any justifiable complaint, by members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* As to the second part of the honorable gentleman's question, I advise him that I have read statements that one representative of the Waterside Workers Federation had been chosen to attend a meeting of the Communist dominated World Federation of Trade Unions in Hanoi.

* Let us take a little look at the history of the wool industry and of reserve prices plans in particular in more recent times After the termination of the Joint Organisation, in 1951. the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union asked the Government for a reserve prices plan.

* Finally, The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation formed the Australian Wool Industry Conference, from the members of which came the statutory body known as the Australian Wool Board.

* Although this is not a record period of service for a member of the Hansard staff, it is interesting to note that  Mr Healy  filled the vacancy caused by the retirement of  Mr W.  Admans, who had been appointed to the staff when it was formed in 1901; so the service of these two gentlemen - original appointee and his replacement - covers the whole span of **federation**.

* This Government takes some pride in the fact that it was the first in the history of **federation** to introduce a provision into the taxation legislation making deductible for income tax purposes expenditure up to a certain amount on education.

* Of course, the ones that asked for it were the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* As the Leader of the Opposition said I entered the Parliament in 1934 and have spent more than half the time since Federation here.

* The Australian Government has been searching for a way to meet its duties to servicemen since **federation**.

* I have made it clear in all press statements, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation have made it clear, that what has been proposed - and only proposed - is that the section should be temporarily suspended whilst the agreement is kept.

* The loss of holiday pay for Anzac Day was due to the actions of the Sydney branch of the **federation**.

* The World Veterans Federation is an organization which includes 153 associations of war veterans and war victims in 48 countries.

* The **federation** publishes a periodical, " The World Veteran ", in which reference is made to the terrific advantages of the Australian repatriation scheme over any other scheme anywhere in the world.

* Federation, with an independent chairman.

* But he did make a great point of the fact that, in the 65 years of **federation**, the Australian Labour Party has been in office federally for only approximately  I6i  years.

* It is, therefore, amazing to look back over the record of achievements of Australian Labour Party Governments in so few years of the life of Federation.

* Also, since the various preference tariffs, for example, the Canadian or New Zealand or Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland preferences, are each contained in a separate basic statute, their amendment requires a separate bill for each tariff.

* The Royal Navy provided us with practically all our defence as we grew up as a young nation, and even before we were a nation, **federation** or a Commonwealth.

* .- The House is indebted to the honorable member for East Sydney  (Mr. Ward)  for his speech this afternoon in which he pointed out how unjustly the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have been treated by the Government, and how the disputes that have taken place on the waterfront clearly have been the result of extreme provocation by the Government and its supporters.

* The Government seems determined to cause trouble on the waterfront in the hope that it can lay the blame on the Waterside Workers Federation.

* They could quite easily set up a national building **federation** or a national building, corporation.

* The future of the building industry is a matter on which a building **federation**, set up by the industry, should speak with ohe voice to the banks, to the insurance companies and to the Government.

* They belong to the great Asian group of Melanesians, and some day a sort of **federation** of Melanesia may be formed.

* Let me say in conclusion that the World Veterans Federation, a **federation** of 157 ex-servicemen's organizations spread throughout 46 nations in the world, which is fighting at all times to improve the benefits available to exservicemen from the governments of various countries, has not yet suggested in any country that cancer should be accepted as a war-caused disability or that it should be automatically accepted as resulting from war service.

* Assuming that we are to have a shipping service, the last thing that 1 want to say is this: Until we remove Communist control from the shipping unions and the Waterside Workers Federation they will hold this country to ransom.

* Time after time, the Communists have used the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union of Australia for political purposes.

* It will not be a tightly-knit **federation**.

* Probably it will be a very loosely-knit **federation**, but  Mr. Khrushchev  knows that if it does come about - already there are signs that it has advanced far more quickly than most people thought it would - his efforts with fear, terror, trade and the other weapons of the total cold war which has been waged, will be far less effective than they have been in the past.

* A meeting was alleged to have taken place at Federation House;.

* There was nothing much wrong with the story except this: Dalziel did not know Klackhorn; Klackhorn did not know Dalziel; Klackhorn had not met Dalziel, then or later, Dalziel did not make such a statement, and the professor did not repeat it; there was no meeting at Federation House on that or any other night.

* At the request of the Victorian and New South Wales representatives, because of the abnormal seasonal conditions prevailing in those States, the tremendous crop and the inadequate storage space available at the moment, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation recommended that it would support any individual Stale in a request for more money for storage provided that the cost of the additional storage was charged against that State and not against the wheat growers as a whole.

* The objective of the Wheat Growers Federation scheme was to dampen down wheat production a little, or not permit it to increase, by penalising people who over-produce.

* It has used the legislation as a bait to bring the Waterside Workers' Federation to its knees.

* His aim is to smash the **federation**, financially if in no other way.

* During the 60 years since **federation** and the 170 years of our existence, we have never had a traitor.

* When the colonies of Australia, which became States at **federation**, were settled, a great part of the common law of England became law there by the very circumstance of the settlement; and amongst this law was the law of treason.

* The question asked by the honorable member follows very closely the lines of a mimeograph circular that has been distributed by the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* I received the original of that circular a week or so ago and have already replied at some length to the teachers **federation**.

* We have the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, the Seamen's Union of Australia, the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Australian Railways Union, with the exception of the New South Wales branch, the Boilermakers Society of Australia, the Sheetmetal Workers Union, the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia and the Miners Federation.

* I believe that the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation will ban the project.

* It was a well established pattern in the early days of the State parliaments and in the early days of **federation** to depend on overseas countries for supplies of money and all sorts of things to a much greater extent than we do now.

* The Executive of the Federation is controlled or strongly influenced by Communists.

* One cannot say that one-half or any other proportion of the members of the Federation are against the Communists and are subject to control by Communists.

* Consequently, the United Kingdom sought other alliances and a **federation** of free trade areas was formed.

* This **federation** included Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and other European countries.

* My subject was Cities in a Federation.

* I am indebted to the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for the current issue of " Maritime Worker ".

* in which the Federation point out that one man with a button can load a ship.

* The publication states - 
1 desire to ask the Prime Minister the following questions: - Was a treaty on external affairs and mutual assistance made between the United Kingdom and the Federation of Malaya on 12th October, 1957?

* Was a further treaty between the United Kingdom and the Federation of Malaysia, applying the treaty of 1.2th October, 1957 to Malaysia?

* Two years later, when addressing a meeting of the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions in East Berlin,  Mr. Elliott,  the Communist federal secretary of the Australian Seamen's Union, declared proudly that " no Australian ship has taken troops or supplies from Australia to Korea and that the Australian Government was compelled to use Air Force planes for this purpose ".

* Sir, when one reflects on his life, one sees how remarkably long a period of our young Federation the public service of the right honorable gentleman has spanned.

* For more than half of the life of this Federation of ours he has been in a key political situation.

* The conference consists of an independent  chairman,  25 members from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and 25 members from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council.

* Nevertheless, in a quiet way, and using as much discretion as we could, we did make what I might call private approaches to express to the head of the Malaysian Federation our concern at the way the Malaysian reputation would suffer by these executions and our hope that something might be done.

* Yesterday, the New South Wales Teachers Federation carried a resolution of congratulation to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  on the work that he is doing in bringing pressure to bear on the Government to do something about the frightful state of education.

* However, the importing countries listed comprise Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, Brazil, Ceylon, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland - and I take it that would include both parts of Ireland, the Republic and Northern Ireland - Israel, Japan, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Liberia, Libya, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, the Philippines, Thailand, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, the United Arab Republic, the United Kingdom, the Vatican City and Venezuela.

* Can the Minister for Civil Aviation say whether the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots has been pressing for a reduction and review of the permissive unserviceability with which a commercial aircraft can be flown?

* We now see the Opposition playing the same kind of role that oppositions have played on many occasions since Federation.

* It cannot be said that the Australian Dairy Produce Board, or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, which is the spokesman for the greater part of the industry, has had its heads in the sand.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation is also very alive, of course, to the problems confronting the industry in the long term.

* The second resolution passed by the **federation** was - 
The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation also recommended - and I think this is something that the Commonwealth Government could look at along with the State governments - 
I heard the honorable member for Indi  (Mr. Holten)  raise in the House last Thursday the fact that the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has requested the Government to provide assistance in the formation of farm management groups.

* The meeting of the **federation** carried other resolutions.

* The last one to which I shall refer reads - 
That this **federation** reaffirms its support for an international agreement to provide for the orderly disposal of surplus dairy products at reasonable prices and recommends to the Commonwealth Government and the Australian Dairy Produce Board that every effort be made to expedite th'e.

* I believe that to have been true ever since **federation**.

* Nor could the pension have been regarded as other than a supplement by those who composed the Labour Government which reduced pensions - the only government in the history of this **federation** to do so.

* I did have a conference with representatives of both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation relating to some anomalies in the long service leave legislation and to what were called injustices.

* At present I say no more than that I want to see real evidence of goodwill on the part of the Sydney branch of the **federation** before I proceed any further.

* Even at that, it would have one more representative than the organization with the next highest number - the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Not always in this federal House do we approach matters in a world spirit or in the spirit of **federation** - in the spirit that Longfellow and Tennyson prayed for when they hoped for the **federation** of the world.

* I wish to ask the Minister for Trade a question concerning representations made to him on behalf of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation and the New South Wales Citrus Growers Council.

* I express my disappointment at the fact that Indonesia, our near neighbour which received sympathetic assistance from the Australian Government and the Australian people at the time of obtaining her independence, has engaged in aggression - it cannot be called anything else - against the new Federation of Malaysia.

* The United Nations survey of the constituent States of Malaysia revealed that the people supported the formation of the Federation.

* Therefore, we are bound to support the establishment of the Federation as being the wish of the people.

* This was a **federation** of Malaya, the Philippines and Indonesia.

* The interpretation which I have obtained of the British Commonwealth is that it is a free association of thirteen sovereign States - the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana, the Federation of Malaya, the Federation of Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone and Tanganyika, together with their dependencies.

* For instance, only a week after his magnificent manifesto at the Orange meeting of the Country Party he went to Launceston to address the Tasmanian Farmers' Federation, and when he was asked about overseas investment on that occasion the right honorable gentleman replied - 
In the Federal Graziers Council, which is made up of the big wool-growers of Australia - you would call them the autocracy of the wool industry - they were solidly behind the proposal.

* But when he got down to the grass roots - the Wool and Meat Producers' Federation - he found the going much tougher, as the honorable member for Wannon  (Mr. Malcolm Fraser)  could tell us, from his knowledge of the position in his own town, Hamilton, in the Wes.ern District, and as mentioned by the honorable member for Lalor  (Mr. Pollard)  who led the debate for us this afternoon.

* But the Waterside Workers' Federation has in many ways forestalled the implementation of the powers vested in that authority under section 36 of the principal act.

* Whenever, after deliberation by the executive of the **federation**, it was decided to demonstrate the feeling of the men and hold a four-hour or a 24-hour stoppage, the Stevedoring Industry Authority was restrained from implementing section 36 of the act by the fact that if all the labour in the port walked off and left the ships idle and the men were suspended for two days the port would be idle for three days.

* I can tell the honourable member that we are the first **federation** in the world to succeed in reaching an agreement of this sort.

* There are a few areas of difficulty with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation on the matter of restrictions on saleable wheat.

* I preface my question to the Minister for Labour and National Service by referring to the current wave of industrial anarchy which once again is being indulged in by the Waterside Workers Federation, during which the whole of Australia has been held to ransom by a 24- hour nation-wide stoppage.

* Is the action of the Waterside Workers Federation in utter contempt of the arbitration system and its machinery to provide justice in the settlement of industrial grievances?

* Could the Minister advise- 
Has the Minister for Territories seen the announcement by the North Australia Foundation - a joint venture by the Victorian Employers Federation and the Constitutional Club of that State - to the effect that it has been offered by the Commonwealth Government three big tracts of land in the Northern Territory for development?

* Their blood brothers or cousins - people who are racially the same - in Nigeria, and in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in particular, are completely equal and completely free.

* The  Committee  feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* We would have a strengthening of **federation**.

* Now, if ever there was proof of the necessity for legislation it is this totally unwarranted strike called by the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation against the law of this country,  a  strike which holds up shipping and which can only increase costs and be of disadvantage to our primary producers and1 prevent them from competing effectively in international markets.

* I have had discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We can be proud of the valiant way in which the States attempted, ever so long ago, to set up their own defence organizations under their own sovereign powers, before **federation** ever became a practicable proposition.

* We can be proud also of the way in which the Commonwealth Government assumed these responsibilities immediately after **federation**.

* In the Sydney " Sun " to-day appears the heading " Government Action Backed ", and further down we have the  president  of the Australian Exporters Federation,  Mr. A.  Sparks, saying some favorable things, with some reservations, about the Government's policy.

* The executive director of the Employers Federation has been saying very nice things, with wee reservations.

* As to what may be done about the incident generally, which, of course, has arisen from the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, the Australian Government's attitude to the formation of that **federation** has been clearly stated to the Australian people and the Australian Parliament, to the Government of Malaysia and to the Government of Indonesia as well as to the Government of the Philippines.

* While appreciating that the conference over which  Mr. Woodward  is to preside will not be authorised to discuss the sanctions imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation by the recent legislation, I am anxious to know, as the honorable member for Grey was, whether the conference will be authorised to discuss comparable legislation concerning the registered stevedoring companies.

* In other words, I wish to ask the Minister whether the stevedoring companies are to be taken out of the purview of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and made subject to action by the Executive before and after the inquiry by the Arbitration Commission as has hitherto happened, alone among the registered industrial organisations, to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* My question to the Minister for Civil Aviation concerns a submission by the Gliding Federation of Australia for an increased grant for next financial year.

* In view of the present acute shortage of suitable personnel for training as pilots and technicians, and also in view of the fact that the total amount requested by the Federation is estimated to be only half the cost of training one navy pilot under the present naval re-equipment scheme, will the Minister give favorable consideration to the request from this very important and worthy organisation?

* One of the most significant actions taken by any organisation was the announcement by the Commonwealth Pensioners Federation on the day following the presentation of the Budget that it would ask its members to work for the defeat of this Government.

* The Commonwealth Pensioners Federation has always tried to remain, what it terms, non-political;, that is, it has not declared its attitude to the two major political parties which are the alternative govern- ments of this nation.

* Is the Minister conscious of the industrial unrest that has been caused by the accusation that the Waterside Workers' Federation has taken 10 per cent, of wages of members working for the Australian National Line?

* Will the Minister, in the interests of industrial peace between the Waterside Workers' Federation and the Australian National Line, make the position quite clear - that the 10 per cent, surcharge on the minimum wages paid by the A.N.L.

* It widens the scope for developing equality in a fiscal sense between each State of the Federation.

* It is one that has not been surpassed by any other **federation** in the world or by any other large country.

* As I have said, from the point of view of fiscal equality between the various States of the **federation** Australia is surpassed by no other nation.

* I went to great trouble to explain in the second reading speech that I made in this House that there are overwhelmingly good reasons why special legislation should be enacted to cope with the activities of the Waterside Workers Federation, which has been guilty of creating a state of anarchy on the Sydney and Melbourne waterfronts and, to a lesser degree, in other ports of Australia.

* I also attempted to explain that the powers which were exercised against the Federation were exercised not only under the provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act but also under the Commonwealth's power in relation to interstate trade and commerce and probably also in relation to defence.

* In Sydney and in other ports ample notice was given by the port representatives of the Waterside Workers' Federation, but in Melbourne it was only at 11 a.m. on the preceding day tha.t two rank and file waterside workers - not officials of the Melbourne branch of the **federation** - gave notice to the port authority that the men would not be working the next day.

* Of course, when the office of the **federation** was rung, the secretary was compelled to confirm their action.

* which provides that there shall be one representative of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation on the research committee.

* It would have been much better - although I do not want to break up this bill as the honorable member for the Northern Territory is trying to do by moving an amendment, and thereby entail referring the matter back to the States for approval - if there had not been provision on the proposed committee for a representative of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation, but, instead, provision for the allocation of a percentage of the fund to the Dairy Research Committee.

* At the time of Federation the State Governments themselves spent no money on housing.

* I have three members of the Waterside Workers Federation in that branch.

* By a process of character assassination in this chamber and by using as a club the threat of deregistration of the Waterside Workers Federation, the Government believes that it has coerced the members of the Federation into its form of discipline and quiescence.

* We were represented,  Sir, at  the ceremonies marking the establishment of the Malayan Federation by a former GovernorGeneral of Australia,  Sir William  McKell, who, of course, played a very active and prominent part in the drafting of the constitution of this new Commonwealth Federation.

* Their concern is spearheaded by the Cereal Committee of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, which is our main farmers' organization.

* of Tasmanian farmers are members of the **federation**.

* The Malaysian Federation has been partly dissolved and any special agreement that we had had with the Federation would have been thrown into confusion.

* We hope that Singapore and the remaining members of the Malaysian Federation will recognise their common interest in defence against confrontation from Indonesia.

* The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the port authorities themselves are taking a tremendous interest in amenities for members of the Waterside Workers Federation and others who work on the waterfront.

* Any permission given to people to enter Australia under an indentured labour system, or any system which may even suggest that it could be of an indentured nature, immediately and quite naturally causes concern, particularly since early 1965 when the  president  of the Employers' Federation in Western Australia was reported as having said that the Federation had initiated positive action to build up the work force of Western Australia by a system of identured labour.

* It is something which the American **federation** has been doing for over 70 years.

* I would hope,  Sir, that  the plea of the honorable member for Herbert in this matter will stir this Government into action which the American **federation** has always accepted as its responsibility and which is also the responsibility of this Parliament under our Constitution.

* He did not join the Teachers Federation until 1965 yet he became a scrutineer in December of that year for  Mr. S.  T. Kelly, candidate in the elections for Federation  President,  although he had joined the Federation too late in 1965 to have a vote in the elections.

* Although not a member of the Federation council, he attended council meetings for many months as an observer, taking notes of proceedings.

* A letter has been received for this group at the Teachers Federation office from the Ministry of Information, Immigration and Tourism, Department of External Services, Salisbury, Rhodesia.

* He has the overwhelming admiration of all those who have studied his public life and his activities in the Teachers Federation.

* So that the House may form some opinion of the claim of the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation about the justice of claims made by the Federation, can the Minister tell the House what changes in waterfront wages have been made in recent years in comparison with those in other industries?

* The name of Isaacs is of historical importance because it perpetuates the name of  Sir Isaac  Isaacs who was one of the fathers of **federation** and one of the most-respected judges to sit on the High Court bench.

* I think it is perfectly true to say that the waterside workers should recognize that it costs from 800 to 900 a day to keep a ship in port and that, in the long run, the people who pay the additional cost needlessly forced upon the community by the actions of the Waterside Workers Federation are the Australian consumers themselves.

* I hope that when it is next listening to  Mr. Docker  the Industrial Court will continue to make it perfectly plain to him that it will not tolerate illegal actions by the Waterside Workers Federation which can result only in inflicting increased costs upon the Australian people.

* Let us now look at the complaint which has been put forward by the Parents and Citizens Federation and by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, as far as my contacts are concerned and, for that matter, by the Australian organizations of teachers.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has been continually urging upon the Government the need to agree to such a scheme, but nothing is done.

* However, in September, 1960, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation asked the Government to set up an independent committee to inquire into the marketing and promotion of the Australian wool clip and related matters.

* After having given the report full consideration the council and the **federation** again jointly approached me in July last and presented a plan for the creation of a central body along the lines of that suggested by the committee of inquiry.

* The Wool Industry Conference is not a statutory body and was constituted jointly by the council and the **federation** on 24th October, 1962, in preparation for the action which this Parliament is now taking.

* 25 each from the council and the **federation** and an independent chairman.

* This provision was specifically requested by the **federation** and the council and its purpose is to maintain a nucleus of experienced members on the board.

* The Australian Chicken Meat Federation recommended to me and after examination I have accepted that the levy be payable on day-old chickens.

* As I indicated earlier, the Federation is representative of all sectors of the chicken meat industry, including hatcherymen.

* Can the Minister for Primary Industry say whether Cabinet has yet made a decision on the request of the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation that the Government institute an inquiry into the wool-selling system?

* Will the Prime Minister ask Victorian members of his party to present themselves in the King's Hall after question time in order to meet an official delegation from the Metal Trades Federation of Australia?

* This **federation** represents 100,000 workers throughout this country and it is the desire of the delegation to meet Liberal Party members to discuss with them the Crimes Bill.

* In fact, a statement was made some weeks ago by the  President  of the Federation of Australian Television Stations, I think, to the effect that limitations should be placed on the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission - that the Commission should confine itself to certain fields and leave others to the commercial stations.

* At the present time discussions are taking place between officials of my department and representatives of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers' Federation about what the members of these organizations claim are anomalies in the long service leave legislation which was recently passed.

* I have told the **federation** that I have some sympathy with certain views expressed and proposals made, and as soon as the details relating to these proposals are worked out I will take the matter to the Cabinet, and I hope to be able, shortly after that, to inform the House what has been decided.

* Is it true that the metal trades **federation** of unions, at its executive meeting on 27th May last, endorsed the action taken by unions and branches of the **federation** against the proposal and threatened industrial action to support efforts to defend the apprenticeship system?

* This is especially true of the Waterside Workers Federation as far as ships' gear is concerned.

* The Federation knows when gear, is or is not safe and its protests and the protests of other unions have brought the matter of safety to the notice of this House so that the laws could be altered.

* The Stevedoring Industry Act 1956 (section 31) gives to the Waterside Workers Federation and the North Australian Workers Union a qualified right to nominate persons for registration as waterside workers.

* Countries from which Australia imported paper during 1956-57 to 1960-61  -  United Kingdom, Papua, Austria, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Slates of America, France, Germany (Eastern), Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Peru, Pakistan, Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Poland, Belgium-Luxembourg, Mainland China, Republic of, Portugal, Hong Kong, Federation of Malaya, Spain, Thailand.

* I know that organizations such as the pilots' **federation** and the Department of Civil Aviation itself have a record equal to anything in the world to-day.

* As the Waterside Workers Federation has agreed to accept a proposal that the disputes arising over the size of gangs employed on wool loading recently on the Australian waterfront be submitted to arbitration, and an inquiry by  Mr. Justice  Ashburner is proceeding, will the Minister say when he proposes to honour his firm undertaking given to the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation to introduce legislation providing amendments to the long service leave provisions in the industry?

* Is it true that after the introduction of Federation three weeks' recreation leave was written into the Public Service Act on the establishment of Australia's national administrative machinery?

* One may have been carried out by the Western Australian Government or by the Western Australian Employers Federation (Inc.).

* I will make inquiries from both the Western Australian Government and the Western Australian Employers Federation, and if I can get any useful information from them I will let the honorable gentleman know.

* Has 'he received representations from the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations seeking a reduction in the licence fees paid by commercial television stations?

* Does the Federation claim that the Commonwealth Government has been the principal beneficiary from a financial standpoint in the ten years of television?

* In respect of a simitar allegation made in the May 1967 Issue of Travel Trade', the Reserve Bank has been advised by the bank concerned that this allegation was fully investigated last year at the instigation of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents.

* The bank was able to assure the Federation unequivocally that the customer's loan application was declined for reasons unrelated to the handling of the travel business.

* The right honorable gentleman may recall the request that I made on behalf of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation that action be taken quickly to limit imports of orange and lemon juices pending a Tariff Board inquiry, although the growers' organizations had supported the importation of lemon juice in years in which crops in Australia had been light.

* I now ask the Minister: Can he inform me of any action that has been taken in this matter as requested by the **federation**?

* I did say to the House that certain alleged anomalies had been brought to my attention and that I or my department would consider the problems involved with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation as soon as both sides of the case had been prepared and presented to us.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation on 9th May.

* We happen to live in a **federation**.

* I question whether there is a democratic administration anywhere in the world which has pressures falling on it more heavily than they fall upon the members of the Cabinet in this **federation** of Australia.

* The only comment I want to make is that if we were not in a **federation** today the whole situation would be as simple as he presents it.

* But the situation cannot be handled as simply as that, because we do live in a **federation** and the existence of the **federation** does complicate the claim of a community to have responsible government side by side with the States which already are members of the **federation**.

* The assumption is, and I suppose it always has been, that the States of Australia, when **federation** came about, had a 3-mile limit - a 3-mile territorial sea.

* This was plainly the assumption at the time of **federation**.

* May I remind the right honorable the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  - of course, in absentia - that in this instance the clash that he contemplates is not with the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia but with the trade union movement of Australia, with the Australian Council of Trade Unions which, at present, is handling the whole of this matter so far as the political and industrial wings of the Labour movement are concerned.

* Has some demon of destruction entered into the thinking of a government which proposes to inflict this travesty of industrial justice on some 22,000 decent Australians who are members of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* The Minister has yet to rebut the statement issued by the Federation in a Press statement of 24th September in answer to his allegation that 260 men out of 900 men in the port of Melbourne had criminal records.

* The refusal to give information is absolutely contrary to the former practice of the Authority, which I am informed used to disclose to the Federation details of convictions in respect of its nominees.

* It is my understanding that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation put forward as a criterion that quotas were not to be transferable between farms or States and that if one State was deficient in meeting its quota that deficiency would not be made up by another State but would be credited to the quota given to that State for the following year's crop.

* I should imagine that any alteration in the proposals which have been recommended would have to be fully discussed by the Federation and the Commonwealth and State governments as all three parties are involved in the present proposals.

* We have a long experience in this **federation** of ours of governmental, industrialor professional organizations in the single States differing on occasions from what turns out to be the majority over-all Australian attitude.

* Will the Federal Government, if requested, fully co-operate with this committee, which is being sponsored by the Victorian Employers Federation?

* Last night a meeting of the Ulverstone branch of the Tasmanian Farmers' Federation was held.

* The  chairman  of the State Dairy Commodity Committee of the Federation,  Mr. T.  Frampton, said at that meeting that a senior representative of a firm which manufactured margarine was in Tasmania, accompanied by a senator, who was unnamed, to examine business prospects.

* Has a report of an attack upon the British Nominated Shipping Conference by the Victorian Employers Federation been brought to his attention?

* Is he aware that the Victorian Employers Federation complains of the rigging of freight rates in favour of British exporters and against Australian merchants?

* Has the Minister been informed of the concern of the Zionist Federation of Australia and New Zealand over the attempt made at the United Nations to bracket Zionism with Nazism, neo-Nazism and anti-Semitism?

* Will he assist to remove the dismay of the Federation by making an appropriate statement regarding the circumstances at the United Nations and the high esteem in which this national movement of the Jewish people is held in Australia?

* I. am informed in general terms that the signatories for the majority of the petitions were members of the Waterside Workers Federation and, as I understand - subject to checking - they signed as individual members of the Waterside Workers Federation rather than claiming to sign as officials of the union.

* 1 now turn to a statement made by the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Snedden)  on 16th September of this year when he was speaking to a convention of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation.

* One must negotiate on behalf of the Commonwealth Government with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and with the State Ministers for Agriculture.

* When I began to negotiate with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation I said that the Government did not want to stand by the old principle of determining a price based on the cost of production because it would have to juggle the figures to arrive at a satisfactory price.

* The honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett)  bit the nail on the head when he said that he supported this legislation and the responsible leaders in the industry who had sat in on the negotiations and when he urged that, having come to a conclusion with the Federation and having got the majority support of the Australian wheat industry supreme council, we should move on as quickly as possible to have the legislation Implemented.

* Having reached a point of agreement with and acceptance of the proposal by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and having managed to get five States willing to pass complementary legislation, to find that the grain section leaders of the Victorian Farmers Union were suggesting to the Victorian wheat growers and to the Victorian Government that a new proposal ought to be put forward and that the present proposal should not be accepted naturally brought resentment from me and caused mc great concern.

* Is the Minister aware of proposals made by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation last week that some flexibility be introduced into the pricing of wheat for stock feed and some other purposes?

* Is he aware also that the Federation is now supporting the principle of extra storage for over-quota and non-quota wheat?

* .- This Bill, more than all other bills we pass, deals with the financial fabric of our Federation.

* Has Australia expressed any view on the proposed merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya?

* In addressing a question to the Minister for External Affairs, I refer to the forthcoming talks between the Prime Ministers of Great Britain and Malaya concerning the proposed merger of Singapore with the Federation of Malaya.

* Further, is there any suggestion for the inclusion of the Borneo territories in the Federation of Malaya?

* After all, achieving **federation** is a difficult enought process at any time.

* Did the Minister for Labour and National Service, at a conference with officers of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation, agree to have amendments made to the legislation dealing with long service leave for waterfront employees to meet some of the **federation**'s objections?

* .- The urgency of this matter,  Mr. Speaker,  is emphasized by the fact that on 21st May, a conference will be held in Sydney under the auspices of the -Australian Teachers Federation.

* The fact is that resolutions are being carried by all sorts of organizations from one end of Australia to the other appealing urgently to the Commonwealth 
The secretary of the South Australian Institute of Teachers told the Australian Teachers Federation conference this year that one child in three in South Australia is in a class of over 40 children, and that one child in eight is in a class of over 50.

* In New South Wales, a survey which was recently taken by the New South Wales Teachers Federation showed that, in the infant schools, 68 per cent, of children are in classes of over 40; in primary schools, 50 per cent, of pupils are in classes of over 40; and in first, second and third years, 60 per cent, of pupils are in classes of over 40 children.

* There is no need or me to remind honorable members of the number of strikes by members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether he has seen the report that an executive of the Waterside Workers Federation has forecast that the industrial committees of the Federation would break down and that it was likely that the waterside workers would then be in a position to bring the export of primary products to a standstill early in 1966.

* In July, 1962, the Australian Cheese Manufacturers Federation wrote to me asking for protection against imported cheese either by an increase in the existing tariff or by quantitative restrictions.

* The **federation** is now considering a possible approach to the Tariff Board.

* No letters have been received by the airline companies from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots forwarding names of pilots who are not members of the Federation and stating there would be no objection if the companies terminated their services first even though they may not be the most junior pilots.

* Yesterday the federal council of the Waterside Workers Federation - 
The  President  of the Australian Exporters Federation  (Mr. R. C. Vine)  told members that the Federation would fight the proposed 10 per cent, increase " boots and all ".

* The organisations were Woolcombers Ltd. of Bradford and the United Kingdom Woolcombing Employers' Federation.

* Has the Government reached any decision on Australia's defence commitments to the new Federation of Malaysia in the case of aggression against the **federation** by some other nation?

* Since **federation** we have noted that from the moment a distribution is determined the march of time and the movement of population have created a difference in electorates.

* It has been implemented either by this Government or by Labour, when it was in office, but Labour has been in office only seventeen years since Federation and during that time quite a lot of reforms were placed on the Statute Book.

* The views of the honorable member for Barton on education have never varied from those openly expressed by the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* He is a teacher and he is a member of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, no doubt.

* Teachers Federation.

* While this was a report for the DirectorGeneral of my Department, we did provide to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots a copy for its information.

* The Federation had knowledge of the report and it has discussed it with my Department.

* It was rather strange that when the strike of Qantas pilots took place last year, the Federation released this report publicly.

* A lot of information which was quoted in the Press, and which was quoted by the honourable member for Stirling, came from the information that was provided at that time by the Federation.

* The principle was agreed to by the Federation in the terms of settlement, and the legislation was designed to replace procedures which it was shown at the time were not successful.

* We will not allow Qantas to use Djakarta airport at the moment, either by day or by night, even though the Australian Federation of Air Pilots' is prepared to have its members fly into and out of Djakarta.

* Prior to the coming into force of the new contracts, which as I said have only recently been signed by the domestic operators and their pilots, lump sum superannuation payments - and these figures are taken from the circular sent out by the Federation of Air Pilots - for a pilot retiring at the age of 55 amounted to a maximum, based on the previous formula pay system, of $92,000.

* 1 have already informed the House that negotiations are proceeding between the unions and the Employers Federation of Western Australia with a view to completing an industrial agreement relating to the construction of the station at North West Cape.

* I do not recollect either the Waterside Workers Federation or the Australian Council of Trade Unions raising this with us, but I think the Stevedoring Industry Authority did.

* Does he deny that a unity ticket was worked at the last branch elections of the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria?

* The Federation has made a number of claims outside the arbitration system.

* I refer to  Mr. R.  A. Coutts,  Deputy Chairman  of the Australian Steamship Owners' Federation.

* He represents members of the **federation** which comprises the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, Huddart Parker Limited, the Melbourne Steamship Company Limited and Australian Steamships Proprietary Limited, all of which have no reason to be grateful to  Mr. Elliott  for the losses that they have sustained because of his actions.

* He is a well known, publicly outspoken advocate of world **federation**, and he is not the only one in his party in favour of it.

* I am not going to read out a list of all the national leaders who have spoken in favour of world **federation** and who have joined the movement but let me say that it includes leaders in English speaking countries and Western democracies as well as one of the Communist countries.

* His  Imperial Majesty, the Shah of Iran, representing one of the smaller powers, said: 
We have to aim at a world **federation** if the world is ever to be free from the scourge of war.

* I am asking for Australia to have as much independence as the little nation of Denmark which has written into its Constitution that it will join such a world **federation** when a sufficient number of other nations agree.

* We were on the point of bloodshed between the States of this country before Federation, and bloodshed was very near in America recently when the Governor of Georgia was thinking of calling out the militia to prevent the integration of the schools.

* This can be prevented by **federation**- 
Before we divide let us test both the logic and the sincerity of the honorable member for Blaxland  (Mr. E. James Harrison)  and, for that matter, of the honorable member for Petrie  (Mr. O'Brien).

* I met the Australian Council of Trade Unions - the supreme governing body of the trade union movement - and the Waterside Workers Federation executive and put my proposals on long service leave to them.

* If honorable gentlemen opposite claim to be so closely associated with the trade union movement - I include the honorable member for East Sydney  (Mr. Ward),  particularly if he claims to know something about the Waterside Workers Federation - how can they explain the fact that there is no mention in that list of suggested amendments of the grant of long service leave for men in B class ports when they are available for work?

* or the Waterside Workers Federation or from anybody closely identified with the industry.

* Federation and one representative from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* Subsequently, the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, under the leadership of  Mr. Young,  decided to hold a strike because the time taken by the police to search the vehicles was too long, so the Federation said.

* The Melbourne Harbour Trust provided additional gates as exits from the wharfs and negotiations were held between the Trust, the police and the Federation.

* The Waterside Workers Federation, as is well known, has a long history.

* If there is any doubt about the attitude of the union in this matter it may be due to the fact that the average age of members of the Waterside Workers Federation is rather high.

* Mr. Healy,  the secretary of the **federation**, in his letter to the " Sydney Morning Herald " made a prime point of the fact that it was because of mechanization on the waterfront and the consequent decline in the number of employees that the average age of members of his union had risen so sharply.

* These arrangements were endorsed by the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia and its branches.

* I have mentioned before the use of farming unions and organizations such as the Australian Primary Producers Union and the Banana Growers Federation in looking after the interests of the farmers.

* Teachers Federation.

* But if Communists get into a **federation** of this kind and can lie under cover they can divert the Federation in various ways.

* If honorable members doubt what I say I ask them to read the files of the official journal of the Federation.

* In this case, there is no doubt, I am afraid, about the way in which the Teachers Federation has been used.

* I refer to such things as the significant support of the Communist stand on Vietnam and the abortive attempt to bring the Federation into the Association for International Co-operation and Disarmament.

* No better body to express an opinion on the length of runway is required than the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* The Federation has stated that a runway of 8,500 feet is not sufficient for large modern aircraft, fully laden with passengers and fuel, to take off, allowing for a margin of safety.

* On the other hand, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is quite definite that a longer runway is necessary, and therefore it would be prudent for the Government to construct a runway of 10,000 feet out into Botany Bay.

* The fact is that the subdivision of Bega, in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, in the whole of **federation**, has always produced a substantial Liberal majority.

* As a result of that special visit by the Prime Minister to Bega for the first time in the history of **federation**, the subdivision of Bega produced a very substantial Labour majority.

* I welcome them all to come again when I see the results of their efforts, as I saw them disclosed at the election when, for the first time in the history of **federation**, this very important subdivision produced a very substantial Labour majority after their visit.

* The Australian Agricultural Council very quickly agreed' in principle to this proposal by the graziers, but for a period of two or perhaps three years there were arguments between the Graziers Federal Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation about who should be on the committee.

* When recommendations for registration on the waterfront are received by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority from the Waterside Workers Federation, is it normal practice for an investigation to be conducted to determine whether each man has a clean medical record and whether any of the men sponsored have criminal records?

* As to the last part of the honorable gentleman's question, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is not a registered organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* and its subsidiaries, Trans-Australian Airlines and East-West Airlines Ltd. and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots - in order to get agreement as to the procedures to be followed when there might be an industrial dispute or a problem that could easily lead to an industrial dispute.

* I believe that this agreement is an historic breakthrough, and I certainly hope that it will lead to a reduction of tension and to better industrial relations between the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and Management.

* Let me remind the right honorable gentleman that in the days before **federation** the States of Australia were just as sovereign, one against the other, as is New Zealand against the Commonwealth of Australia to-day.

* In the days before **federation**, the responsible leaders did not feel the kind of delicacy that the Prime Minister has mentioned.

* They realized that, although there were sentiments against **federation**, it was, nevertheless, in the interests of the people of the Australian States.

* The Australian Wool Bureau consists of seven members - three from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and three from the Australian Wool Growers and Graziers Council, and one Government nominee.

* This afternoon, the honorable member for Farrer referred to the Farmers Union in Western Australia, to resolutions it had passed and to its action in connexion with this wool levy at a meeting of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Those delegates had the task of submitting the view of the Western Australian wool-growers to a meeting of the Australian Wool and Meat ( Producers Federation held in Melbourne last week.

* At a joint meeting on 4th April between the Australian Wool Bureau and the two federal organizations of wool-growers represented on the Bureau, namely the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, it was agreed by the three bodies to recommend that the current wool promotion levy of 10s.

* It is true that that combined meeting carried a resolution in favour of an extension of the levy, but, prior to that meeting, the extension of the levy was discussed at a meeting of the Austraiian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* I quote an extract from the Sydney " Daily Telegraph " of 5th April relating to that meeting, lt is as follows - 
The size of the 1962-63 levy was in doubt until yesterday, when the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation's half-yearly conference voted by three States to two to continue the levy at 10s.

* The resolution continues -  and instructs its delegates to the forthcoming Federation Conference to strongly oppose extension beyond June 1962 of the increase of Ss.

* There must be, in the history of Federation past and future, few people who have been the only member for a federal electorate.

* Development by the Master Builders Federation of Australia in January, 19.58.

* The following statement appears on page 5: - 
I return to the report of the Master Builders Federation published in 1958.

* The report of the Master Builders Federation continued - 
I suggest,  Mr. Deputy Speaker,  that the provisions of adequate incentive, to which the **federation** has referred, would succeed in improving the position in this country also.

* The honorable member for Gellibrand  (Mr. Mclvor),  a man whom we respect for his thoughtful contributions to the debates in this place, referred repeatedly to the ideas of the Master Builders Federation of Australia.

* It is natural to expect that the Master Builders Federation would make strong demands for more finance for housing.

* The States joined in a **federation** under certain conditions.

* It was necessary for that bargain of **federation** to prescribe conditions which would equate the representations from the States in this House by certain means - the method of evolving a quota and so on.

* The Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council, fully supported by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council, submitted proposals to the Government for the financing of the operational cost of the service and investigation section.

* In fact, even the Commonwealth Pensioners Federation is disillusioned.

* Reports indicate that on a visit to Canberra recently members of the Federation were seen by the Minister for a few minutes only on these matters, and the Secretary of the Federation,  Mrs Ellis  of Melbourne, is reported to have said: 
The combined Metal Trades Federation has for the past two years been warning the Minister about this emergency.

* The secretary of the Employers Federation,  Mr. Self,  shifted the blame on to the Government when he declared in a recent interview that the Government's economic policy, coupled with the credit squeeze, had been responsible for the serious shortage of apprentices.

* Of course the trade union movement, jealously guarding the rights of these lads, is justifiably suspicious not only of the actions of the Minister but also of the Employers Federation.

* During the discussions I had with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and with the Waterside Workers Federation I said that if any anomalies were discovered after the act had been working for some time I would have  a  look at them and would, if I thought it desirable, bring recommendations before the Cabinet.

* I also told the representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation that if they could point out to me any injustices that had occurred as  a  result of the legislation, I would bring those matters also to the attention of the Cabinet.

* During the last few weeks I have had discussions with the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation and with the executive of the A.C.T.U.

* The strength of the military forces of the various States on 31st December, 1900 - the eve of **federation** - was 27,353 persons, excluding cadets, reservists and rifle club members.

* I wonder whether it is sheer coincidence that I have had a barrage of questions this afternoon and that there are several members of the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation, including one vigilance officer for the Melbourne Branch, in the public galleries.

* Perhaps honorable members opposite are as closely controlled as the Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Federation.

* When the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority legitimately refused to give reasons why it rejected several members, the Port Kembla Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation refused to submit for registration any of the names submitted earlier to the Authority.

* Yesterday, a small group of people, not representative of the Waterside Workers Federation or the executive of the **federation**, or of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, came to Canberra in order to make representations about the loss of holiday pay on Anzac Day this year.

* I can do no more than repeat,  Mr. Speaker,  that the executive of the Sydney branch of the **federation** made  a  blunder and knows that it did so.

* At a joint meeting on 4th April between the Australian Wool Bureau and the two federal organizations of wool-growers represented on the bureau, namely the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, it was agreed by the three bodies to recommend that the current wool promotion levy of 10s.

* I hope that, first, they will affect the election for the Council of the New South Wales Teachers Federation that is taking place at present.

* This occurred in the face of the fact that the Communist Lewis and his organisation, which consists of the paid officers of the Teachers Federation, had been trying to mobilise votes for those who supported Communist causes.

* If only we can get the other 50 per cent, of the teachers who do not vote, but who in the overwhelming majority of cases are not Communists, to cast their votes in this election and to send in their ballot papers before 4th November, then the Communists will not be returned in the Teachers Federation in the future as they have been in the past.

* In directing a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service I refer to the stop-work meeting held to-day by the Waterside Workers Federation in ports throughout Australia to hear reports from delegates to the triennial conference of the federal council of the union, particularly on the long service leave amendments made last year to the Steve doring Industry Act.

* The Australian Wheat Growers Federation has devised a delivery quota scheme for 357 million bushels, guaranteeing the growers a SI.

* J direct to the Minister for Labour and National Service a question concerning a report in this morning's Press of an offer that has been made to the Waterside Workers Federation of a permanent wage of 47 a week and a pension scheme.

* This offer was announced yesterday by the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Fitzgibbon.

* If not, is the Government concerned that a deal may be concluded in this most vital industry between the Federation and a certain few employers without reference to the Government or to the arbitration system?

* =1 announced to the House last year that the stevedoring employers, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority had agreed that there should be established industrial relations committees and that the work of those committees should be to prevent and settle industrial disputes.

* These proposals were endorsed at mass meetings of the various branches of the Waterside Workers Federation, including those at the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.

* In Sydney the job delegates' association seems to have taken control out of the hands of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I believe that the time has come for the **federation** itself to establish control over the job delegates' association on the Sydney waterfront.

* Has the Minister for Labour and National Service seen statements by the Waterside Workers Federation which challenge the accuracy of the information that was given by him to this House about the numbers of men with criminal records whose names were submitted by the Federation in Melbourne?

* Is it a fact that, despite its earlier refusal to co-operate in the Woodward inquiry, the Federation is now complaining that the Government introduced the Stevedoring Industry Bill without awaiting the report of the inquiry?

* I think that since Federation the Labour Party has been in power for a period of only 15 or 16 years.

* They all work under some gerrymandered system or other; but this Parliament, from the beginning of Federation has, as nearly as practicable, represented the will of the people.

* Criticism has been made from time to time of the fact that there is no continuing constructional, developmental or conservation authority in Australia as there is in the American **federation**.

* All honorable members no doubt agree that it is just and proper that the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation be represented on the selection committee and on the board.

* The Australian Meat Board Selection Committee ... is not a statutory authority and was constituted jointly by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation on 27th February, 1964, for the purpose of this legislation.

* It consists at present of nine members comprising four each from the council and the **federation** and an independent chairman.

* Wool &amp; Meat Producers Federation, have been accepted without question as foundation members.

* An important official of the airline pilots **federation** said in a statement to me that it was a reasonably common occurrence for pilots to be asked to fly aircraft which had allowable deficiencies about which they were not happy.

* Does the Minister for Civil 
Aviation deny that the airline pilots **federation** has been endeavouring for some considerable time to have a review made of allowable deficiencies in aircraft?

* The airline pilots **federation** has been asking for this aid for some considerable time.

* After a conference held recently between the Department and the **federation** this subject was informally raised and an officer of the Department said that the Department could not install this type of aid because it was not getting sufficient finance from the Government.

* The employer and the Waterside Workers Federation are represented.

* Another point I wish to make is the Federation's attitude to agreements.

* The conference set up a working party, which included representatives of the Federation, the employers, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the Department of Labour and National Service, and the A.C.T.U.

* After some weeks of deliberation it reached agreement on a number of matters including one sought by the Federation - the setting up of industrial relations committees in all ports with the objective of preventing on the spot disputes from flaring into stoppages.

* The committees were to consist of equal representation from the branch of the Federation in the port and the employers in the port.

* The agreement provided as follows - 
The purposes of the committees were explained to representatives of the Federation and the employers in all the capital city ports by a personal deputation of members of the national conference, including representatives of the Federation.

* They were accepted by mass meetings of members of the Federation at all ports throughout Australia.

* A further example of the Federation's attitude in Sydney came in July 1965 when the Federation began a series of stoppages over gang sizes in relation to the loading of wool - a matter which clearly should have been brought before the Industrial Relations Committee.

* In not one dispute on this matter which ran for some weeks on a largs number of vessels, did the Federation seek to bring the issue before the Industrial Relations Committee.

* These, were matters on which, although there could well be a genuine dispute, there was no reason for any stoppage if the procedures which the Federation itself had sought had been observed by it.

* However, it might be questioned whether these disputes were in fact genuine disputes when it is a fact that the Federation on 30th July in setting out its industrial claims made no mention at all of the question of gang size issues.

* The Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council, fully supported by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation and the Australian Meatworks Federal Council, submitted proposals to the Government for the operational cost of the service and investigation section to be financed by income from a special levy on the slaughter of livestock with matching Commonwealth contributions.

* The club is affiliated with the Australian Canoe Federation and is fortunate in having four representatives in the Olympic Games events.

* Of course various Labour governments have been in power for periods of many years since Federation, and one is forced to conclude, therefore, that they have sadly neglected their opportunities to introduce this kind of legislation.

* Some discussions took place between the police and the Trust on the one hand and the Waterside Workers Federation on the other.

* Towards the end of last month a blue was put on by the Melbourne branch of the Federation on the grounds that too much time was lost in the police search and that additional gates should be provided so that the workers could get out of the dockyard more quickly.

* The Federation thought also that if searches were to be made they should be made in the boss's time.

* The only other matter in dispute - that is, the time during which searches should be made - has been referred to the Industrial Relations Committee of the employers and the Federation for discussion and, I hope, for quick settlement.

* It is a **federation**.

* One of the States in that **federation** is Buganda.

* I do not think that this is a co-ordinated policy but its effect is much worse because it does mean that the Waterside Workers Federation and the executive of the Federation cannot control the job delegates and consequently cannot control the number of strikes.

* When I think of the Commonwealth of Nations, I do not think only of Australia, New Zealand and Canada; 1 think also of India and Pakistan and the Malayan Federation.

* As the project covers the history of defence policy since **federation**, it is a lengthy task involving much research.

* Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation in which it again raised two points which concern the **federation** and pensioners receiving the base rate of pension.

* In this document, copies of which, I have no doubt, all honorable members received, the **federation** has requested, first, that immediate action be taken by the Government to increase the base rate of pension to one-half the basic wage.

* Whether the House agrees on that point is another matter, but I acknowledge at once that the **federation** is in a position to make a just claim for an increase in the base rate.

* So it is from the Australian Labor 'Party that we have had a motion which suggests that there should be a rejection of the principles which are enunciated within the Commonwealth Electoral Act and which, although varied slightly, have been, in substance, in existence since **federation**.

* One of the reasons why the principles were introduced was that **federation** itself was a compromise amongst a number of people, all of whom felt very strongly about their own State rights, about their own communities and about the causes which up to that point of time they had progressively been advocating on their own behalf.

* In **federation** each one of the States necessarily had to subordinate something of their lot for the sake of the whole.

* Walcha Subdivision has been within the existing Division of New England since Federation; and 
The Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment to the motion before the House.

* However, the inequality is substantially below the percentage that has existed in the Commonwealth Electoral Act since **federation**.

* New Zealand took an active part in the deliberations which led up to our **federation**.

* After **federation**, in 1901, a New Zealand commission came to Australia to study the problems involved.

* It was apparent from the outset that he was not in favour of **federation**, and so great was his influence in New Zealand at that time that what he thought was accepted.

* I do not know whether any representations have been made by the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots to my Department on this particular subject.

* It could be that the Federation has referred matters from time to time in relation to permissive unserviceability, and no doubt the lists are changed from time to time.

* They are worked out between the manufacturers, the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots, the Department of Civil Aviation, the component manufacturers and quite a wide group of people associated with the aviation industry.

* I shall make some inquiries to see whether any recent representations have been made by the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots.

* In the United States of America, the greatest **federation** in the world, federal funds and State powers are used to resume urban land and then guarantees are given by the federal administration to any financial institutions which come in and develop the land.

* He comes from Mildura and is managing director of Elliott Provincial Newspapers Group Pty Ltd and also  chairman  of Sunraysia Television Ltd. From the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations there is  Mr H.  M. Goodsall, who is executive secretary of the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters.

* is the assistant general manager; and from the Federation of Commercial Television Stations there is  Mr Arthur  Cowan, who is the general manager of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and also executive officer of the.

* Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations.

* United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Union of South Africa, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana, Federation of Malaya, Federation of Nigeria, Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Cyprus.

* It is rather interesting to note that although the Government was prepared to pledge Australian troops and risk their lives in that area, to-day, when there is talk of the development of a Malaysian Federation, the Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, has made it clear to.

* That is according to a report in the " Sydney Morning Herald " of 23rd November, 1961, which also stated -  
In the event of a merger, the greater Malaysian Federation would have to be consulted on the movement of any British troops stationed in Singapore.

* The Malayan Government would have to be consulted if Britain decided to move Malaya based Commonwealth troops outside the **federation**.

* The honorable member for Blaxland  (Mr. E. James Harrison)  said that prior to the introduction of the long service leave bill in 1961 I failed to consult the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I made a press announcement and I had consultations with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Has the Minister received a strongly worded protest from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation that the entry of even limited quantities of cheese and pig meats under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement is the thin edge of the wedge that will ultimately have disastrous effects on the standards of living of Australian dairy farmers?

* Minister for Primary Industry tell the House whether Cabinet has yet examined the proposals put forward by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council for an overall authority to manage the affairs of the wool industry?

* Labour spokesmen have denied in this House that the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union are Communist led.

* There is no doubt that when, at the 1891 Constitutional Convention, it seemed that New Zealand might join the Federation, one of the motives of  Sir George  Grey, a representative of New Zealand, was to keep Maori affairs in the hands of the New Zealand Government.

* They are representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which is opposed to free trade unions.

* A fight for trade has been declared by  Mr. Sparkes  of the Australian Exporters Federation, and  Mr. Chislett,  an economist, has declared that there is a need for a subsidy on wool.

* Honorable members opposite have used this debate as a medium to disperse throughout Australia the type of propaganda that the Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation wish to be dispersed.

* I should like to tell the honorable member for Warringah that the best workers for me against the Communists at election times have been members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has been told to transfer a couple of hundred men so that the apples can be shipped The waterside workers themselves want the apples to be shipped because they know that their own prosperity depends upon the country's prosperity.

* But the employers have had the audacity to expect the Waterside Workers Federation to transfer 200 men from their home port to another port to meet a seasonal condition.

* He had to get himself lighter work to carry him over for several years until he regained his strength and rejoined the Waterside Workers Federation in 1947.

* At the present time there is a new general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I knew him when he was an active member of the Trades and Labour Council, before he ever worked on the waterfront or was elected to the presidency of the **federation**.

* We all know that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation is very strongly established in Western Australia; not so strongly established in South Australia; well established in Victoria and New South Wales.

* So, on any reasonable interpretation, that **federation**, which occupies four seats on the selection committee, under the constitution of the selection committee is not qualified to be on it.

* I believe - I hope not too naively - that if one organization accepted an applicant another organization would not be able to stand up against the public opinion that would rise against an organization which alone tried to prevent the Australian Primary Producers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation getting some sort of reasonable representation.

* Or is it because the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Wool Growers and Graziers Council have deliberately and with foresight tried to make it very nearly impossible for another organization to be represented on the selection committee?

* I repeat that on the basis of an organization being required to be established in five States, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation is not entitled to be on the selection committee at the present time; or at least it is no more entitled to be on the committee than is the 
I have dealt with the principal matter on which I wanted to speak to-night, but I should like to comment on several other points that have been raised by honorable members on this side of the House.

* Since **federation**, this Parliament has been much more democratic in its electoral system, its electoral laws and the drawing of electoral boundaries than have most of the State parliaments.

* find something which would enable him to link the debate with the Waterside Workers Federation or one of the other unions which he seems to detest so strongly.

* In contrast, representatives of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation strongly advocated the introduction of a reserve price scheme for wool.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has engaged able advocates to appeal before the court.

* Well, I met the leaders of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation in Canberra a month ago and I put it to them whether they accepted the proposal or not.

* For instance, in the United States, which has had **federation** for a great number of years longer than we have had it, the Federal Government has assumed exclusive responsibility only since 1936.

* An urgent request has been made by civic leaders in the valley, municipal, State government and industrial, and by representatives of the Miners' Federation, that the possibility of establishing a thermal power station in the valley should be considered.

* First, when the 10 years old Federation ceased to be at the end of 1963, Southern Rhodesia was the only one of three members which was not granted full independence.

* The Federation of the World."

* I cannot be precise about the date, because of the lapse of time, but about 1955 a group of men who were members of the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia went over to the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia in Brisbane, with permanent status at that time.

* Unless my amendment is agreed to, service of those men counting for entitlement to long service leave will go back only to the day in 1955 on which they joined the Waterside Workers Federation.

* These are men who in the interim joined the Waterside Workers Federation.

* As an illustration, I mention the position of a particular member of the Waterside Workers Federation at Burnie, in Tasmania.

* He was a permanent employee of the Burnie Marine Board and transferred to the **federation** when he was employed driving a shorebased crane.

* I understand that his permanent service prior to joining the **federation** will not be counted in his entitlement to long service leave unless my amendment is agreed to.

* Does anybody now believe in the eternal solidarity of the Malaysian Federation?

* Basically, I think my electors want me to act in the interests of Australia, in which each State is an integral part of the Federation, an Australian nation with rising strength, importance and responsibilities.

* 1 refer in particular to articles published in the " Tasmanian Farmer ", the official organ of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* He has even officially opened conferences of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation and 1 know that many members of this organisation are friends of his.

* and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation - two organizations of like character - that they should confer.

* In past years the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have been recognized as the major organizations representing grazing interests.

* Special thanks are due to the honorable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr. Birrell)  who, when secretary of the South Australian branch of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation, gave our committee some really handsome support by authorising and meeting the fees of one of the leading industrial lawyers of South Australia,  Mr. L.  J. Stanley, to go through the whole of a model bill which we had prepared, with a view to improving it and offering constructive criticism of it.

* If I may, I want to use some remarks that are contained in the annual report for 1968 of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* He says: 
T intend ' to speak mainly -about the inquiry that 'has 'been requested by 'the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Australian Wool and Meat 'Producers ^Federation and the Australian -Wool-growers and Graziers Council.

* The first is  Mr. Lloyd  Heaslip, the recently appointed  President  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* His  influence has, to a large extent, I understand, enabled the **federation** to face this hurdle and ask for a referendum.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation has always supported the floor price plan.

* The **federation** decided not to insist on a referendum but to ask for an inquiry in an effort to get this matter cleaned up, and a great deal of credit for the decision goes to  Mr. Lloyd  Heaslip.

* We must recognize that, for us to sign the Treaty of Rome would be to accept as the ultimate political goal political **federation** in Europe, including ourselves.

* This was stated by Sherrard at the annual conference of the Australian Road Transport Federation on 9th October 1962.

* I would like to refer to an excellent report brought out by the Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation on the Australian chemical tariff.

* In reply to a similar question from the honorable member, I made it quite clear on 24th October, 1962, that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots had said that the board's recommendation should be interpreted in a particular way and if the Government accepted their interpretation the **federation** believed the recommendation was a practical proposition.

* As I pointed out at that time, the Government rejected the **federation**'s interpretation because it implied that the board was now recommending the adoption of a procedure which has been followed by air traffic controllers for many years.

* The **federation** agreed that the board's recommendation as interpreted by the Government, by the major airline operators and by the Civil Operations Officers Association of Australia, could not be implemented.

* The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is certainly competent to give advice on operational matters.

* The Government consulted the **federation**, as it did also the Civil Air Operations Officers' Association of Australia, whose membership includes several hundred practising air traffic controllers.

* At the same time, I should not let this occasion pass without expressing the Government's appreciation of the part that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has played since **federation** in the Australian judicial system.

* They are an immeasurably important part of our history, and they are, of course, a vital recorded part of **federation**.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation been drawn to strong criticisms that have been levelled by the Executive Secretary of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents against alleged non-competitive activities and the overrationalisation of services provided by Australia's two major domestic airlines?

* Neither, in such a free trade situation, could our primary industries have supported the industrial development which this nation has enjoyed since Federation; nor could they have created a gross national product to a level anywhere near that which Australia now enjoys.

* lt is incredible that although tariffs have been granted by various procedures since **federation** no data are available to show what is called the effective rate of tariff as distinct from the nominal rate.

* Under Chapter III it is still the practice that appeals which at the time of Federation lay from the Supreme Courts of the States to the Privy Council can go from those courts to the Privy Council.

* The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations sent to all members a letter this week asking for further amendments to section 116 and 117 of the Act.

* Representations on those two matters I mentioned and also two or three others were made by  Mr Cowan,  the General Manager of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* As a result of my warnings the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has studied the matter in great detail and brought forward a proposal to apply a quota system in respect of the delivery of wheat to the terminals.

* Without some orderly system of deliveries there would be utter chaos and the proposal that the Federation has put forward is designed to bring about some orderly delivery system.

* The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is not very happy about some of the conditions under which some of these charter air services are to be allowed io operate but, as I have stated before in this Parliament, they are reluctant to report near-incidents to the Department of Civil Aviation because the Department does not act on their reports.

* The Australian Federation of Air Pilots is concerned about the laxity of the Department of Civil Aviation in granting charter licences and other licences to pilots.

* Of course this process of weaving the wealthy countries together in some kind of loose **federation** is bound to continue.

* I am sure that, if we acknowledge the position freely and frankly as it is; if we recognise that we are inter-dependent, as the former Prime Minister of England stated; that we are in fact members of a **federation** of rich countries; and if we concert our plan for building up the developing countries through multilateral aid funnelled primarily through the United Nations, then we shall strengthen our own position and also strengthen the position of the underdeveloped countries.

* When the Australian Federation was set up none of the States thought that the Commonwealth Parliament would achieve the primacy which history has thrust upon it, but achieve this primacy it did.

* For example, the last report of the Common Market Commission openly expresses the hope that the European Common Market will develop into a political **federation** of Europe.

* I believe that we can give guidance in a sensible way to our Australian youth and direct their loyalty and allegiance to the World Assembly of Youth which is, of course, the democratic world association of youth in contrast to the World Federation of Youth which is a Communist-front body.

* The first youth festival in the capital of a neutral nation was held in Vienna in 1959, and had there been a retreat from a policy of holding the festivals in neutral nations, I am sure this would have been accepted across the world as a definite gain to the two world youth bodies - the International Union of Students and the World Federation of Youth.

* A statement by  Sir Norman  Kipping, Director-General of the Federation of 
In those circumstances, one would have thought that in the course of the lengthy speeches which have been made by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell),  and others behind him, some inkling would have emerged by which the public could have judged what kind of policy it might expect from the alternative government which is being recommended to replace the Government now in office.

* Because of the warring factions and the personal rivalries which we know are rampant, not only in the ranks of those sitting immediately opposite, but also in the organizational structure of the party - the kind of rivalries which have produced the worst split in any political movement in the history of this **federation** - Labour, as at present composed, is utterly incapable of governing this country.

* Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as  a  member of the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States.

* Some further investigations were made recently in view of some submissions from the Australian Federation of Air Pilots regarding the operation of DC3 aircraft in Australia.

* Advice regarding this was submitted in the last few weeks to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* I leave the Parliament with great regret but proud to have been one of the 579 members who have served in this House since Federation.

* In the United States of America, the greatest **federation** of all, there is this combination of national or federal funds and State powers of resumption.

* Of course, the State governments have been in great difficulty ever since Federation.

* The remarkable thing is that the only person at the time of Federation to foresee all this was Alfred Deakin.

* How true this turned out to be, because in essence today, although we have  a  Federation written into our Constitution, we have in effect a mere legal fiction which has resulted from the Commonwealth's power over financing and the lack of revenue raising powers that are vested in the States.

* When the levies that the Waterside Workers Federation tried to impose on the Hurseys were discussed in the Parliament, members of the Labour Party displayed a great reluctance to debate the matter.

* Had he been alive at the time of **federation**, he would have been one of the minority that voted against it.

* There has never been any sovereignty in Australia since **federation**.

* How can you have sovereignty when you divide your powers between the Commonwealth and the 
The whole aspect of our **federation** has been changing since the time of **federation**.

* That decision changed the whole character of our **federation**.

* But, by and large, the document, which could be regarded as a package deal, was something which, if its recommendations were implemented, would promote the well-being of Australia and would open up a new phase of **federation**.

* I remind the honorable member that in 1962 not trade union officials but the Employers Federation of Victoria caused a conference to be called at which the Department of Labour and National Service was represented, as well as the Chamber of Manufactures and various trade union and employer organizations to discuss the problem of apprentices.

* I will not cite the figures; they may be obtained from the Victorian Employers Federation.

* In its report the **federation** stated - 
It is true that a large number of waterside workers walked off ships in the port of Sydney this morning.

* I understand that the **federation** has directed the men to return to work at the commencement of the 5 o'clock shift.

* As to the implications, the first thing I can say is that if it has been agreed that consultations will be held to-morrow morning, I cannot understand why the Sydney branch of the **federation** did not seek consultations yesterday, and so avoid a strike.

* Finally, the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation seems determined to produce a situation that will make it difficult to carry on negotiations in the right atmosphere about possible changes in the long-service leave legislation.

* His name will remain in the annals of this Parliament for a long time, because he was fated to serve here for half the present lifetime of this Federation.

* He served in half the Parliaments which have gone by since the Federation was formed and yet he died at the comparatively early age of 64 years.

* No Prime Minister has been so ineffective, so incompetent and so futile since **federation**.

* It is against the whole spirit of **federation**.

* When it suits the Government it uses the concept of **federation** - of a united Commonwealth of Australia - and insists that all things be branded Australian.

* We also have a Country Party Minister for Trade, who recently addressed in Launceston a meeting of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* As aviation was in its infancy at the time of **federation** it is not surprising that there is no direct reference to civil aviation or air navigation in any of the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution.

* No formal notification was given of this stoppage and subsequently the Waterside Workers Federation was fined 100.

* I ask him: Has his attention been directed to a recent statement by  Mr. Docker,  as advocate for the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia before the Full Bench of the Commonwealth Industrial Court, to the effect that the **federation** will engage in stoppages of work whenever it elects to do so, regardless of whether such stoppages are contrary to the act concerned, the award or the court's order?

* The honorable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr. Allan Fraser)  suggests that Tasmania has paid a higher price for **federation** than has any other State, and, looking through the whole field, I agree with him.

* I hope that I have heard for the last time  a  Liberal-Country Party Government proclaim its dedication to the notion of **federation** in Australia.

* Honorable members will remember that in 1958 the Government set up a committee under the chairmanship of  Sir Alexander  Fitzgerald to ascertain the capital cost of developing the Post Office since **federation** - since 1901.

* In 1959-60, which was the first year after the committee presented its report, the Postmaster-General's Department had to find $30,694,012 to pay the interest on the estimated advances since the beginning of **federation**.

* The **federation** of the United States of America is almost the same size as Australia, and has a similar constitution.

* This organization has been working in the U.S.A. for ten or eleven years, and the American Government has decided that it is no -the advantage of -the **federation** to find the cost of head works and provide the money free of interest.

* But we find, of course, that the Waterside Workers Federation, or its leaders - I am not blaming the men themselves - dictate the action to be taken, and instead of having grievances properly adjudicated upon and equitable determinations made, they indulge in strike tactics.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has had a deplorable record over the years.

* Communists dominate the leadership of two powerful waterfront unions - the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Seamen's Union of Australia.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is a very highly organized body from the standpoint of having men who are in a position to provoke trouble at any time of the day or night.

* The prospects for Australia's prosperity would be poor if the Government of this country adopted the attitude taken by honorable members opposite in their support of the militancy of the Waterside Workers Federation which indulges in unauthorized stoppages to force its demands rather than adopt the constitutional channels of lawful processes - processes in which we on this side of the House fervently believe.

* We realised that the only way open to us was to sell the idea to the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and to persuade the Federation to approach the Commonwealth Government and ask it to impose a levy of one farthing a bushel for research purposes.

* We finally sold our scheme to the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, but only after much trouble with Victoria.

* The question of the representation of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation on the selection committee has been raised.

* It would be just as logical to suggest that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council should be given representation on the Australian Dairy Produce Board as it is to suggest that because the dairy farmers contribute this small percentage of meat they should be given representation on this proposed body to promote and in certain circumstances purchase and dispose of meat.

* I do not think it is possible to prepare a logical argument on these grounds for the inclusion of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation on this body because by the same token you will undoubtedly find that members of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council also produce in certain circumstances an equal percentage of the produce marketed by the Australian Dairy Produce.

* Undoubtedly the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council have been selected in the first place to provide the grower membership on the selection committee because they are the two specialist grower organizations which have affiliations in the majority of States on a specialised basis and on a commodity basis.

* The only two really successful federations operating in Australia to-day are the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation is a federal body specializing in dairy produce and dairy problems.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has followed the same practice so far as wheat is concerned and has undoubtedly done a remarkable job for the Australian wheat industry.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council have been selected by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr. Adermann)  - rightly so I think - to form the nucleus of this new body.

* It does not necessarily follow that membership on the selection committee will be restricted to the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation or the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council.

* It is quite possible that on the committee will be members of the Australian Primary Producers Union and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* There is such a wide cross-section represented in the membership of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council that at times it is virtually impossible to say who is who.

* We have full employment, and we have been fortunate in having one of the greatest Treasurers, if not the greatest Treasurer, since **federation**.

* Restrictive trade practices are always possible in any free enterprise system, and, since **federation**-, the possible need to- deal with them has always been in the minds of Australian governments.

* The introduction of a floor plan selling system has been advocated by the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association and by the Australian Wool and Meat Growers Federation.

* The bureau is made up of three members each of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, with one nominee from the Commonwealth Government.

* As a matter of fact, it is following the lead of of the Metal Trades Employers Federation.

* I am afraid that this is so in a Federation.

* In this Federation, it will never be possible for the Commonwealth to set an order of priorities for all developmental works.

* The movement which he is sponsoring is concerned with world **federation**, which briefly means an organisation based on the United Nations in such a way that it will become more representative of the people of the world; that it will become a more democratic parliament than it is today, lt is now more a diplomatic club than a parliament, lt will give the United Nations more judicial powers, more legislative powers and more enforcement powers to carry out the job for which it was established - to enforce the peace.

* It accepts what the Minister for Housing in another place has already stated in a letter to  Mr Arneil,  the  President  of the Australian Federation of Credit Union Leagues, that the Government wanted to confine its grants to such credit unions as were able to provide funds for the construction of nouses.

* Mr Arneil,  speaking officially on behalf of the Australian Federation of Credit Union Leagues, has said that no less than 30% of their funds are already being applied for housing purposes and that includes the addition of tooms, renovation of homes and repairs to homes.

* One State in our Federation enjoys a guaranteed minimum representation.

* We have noted the uncertainties in Laos, the acute problems in South Viet Nam, the conflicts which exist over the creation of the new Federation of Malaysia .

* And what is the judgment of the Commonwealth Pensioners Federation?

* The Returned Services League- 
A letter sent by  Mrs. Ellis  of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation to the honorable member for Adelaide  (Mr. Sexton)  stated - 
Thinking over all we did while in Canberra for the Budget I feel very satisfied, because I think we are more united and see clearly the situation.

* The Federation covers all major pensioners organisations in 5 States, and we hope W.A.

* In a number of ports, men who had been in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and available for work for varying periods up to 40 years were to receive nothing under the original long service leave provisions.

* They seemed to be aimed solely at the subjugation of the members of the Federation.

* In objection to the penal provisions and to the great number of other unfair provisions contained in the legislation of 1961, industrial action was taken by the members of the Federation in an endeavour to bring about better provisions.

* The Miners Federation had decided on a general national strike.

* The chief of those differences is this: In 1949 the trade union movement resented and repudiated the actions of the then leaders of the Miners Federation and, as I have said, the Labour Government had the complete backing of the A.C.T.U., just as today the Labour Opposition has the complete backing of the A.C.T.U.

* The position with relation to work load per man, as outlined by the Minister in his second reading speech, is a shocking indictment of the Waterside Workers Federation and those who lead it.

* I do not for one moment believe that the rank and file members of the Federation are parties to what the Executive is doing.

* It is apparent from this that the watersiders are being led into go slow tactics by the militant leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* What the Branch Executives of the Federation are doing - and the rank and file ought to wake up to this - is to bring about in the waterfront industry what hap pened in the sugar industry, for these tactics are forcing mechanisation and bringing to an end the use of large numbers of men on the waterfront.

* And the Branch Executives of the Waterside Workers Federation, on some flimsy pretext, hold up the handling of these exports on the wharves.

* They are caused by the Branch Executives of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I believe that it is because the members of the Branch Executives of the Federation are leading the men on and using them to gain their own political ends.

* As a member of the Government Members Industrial Relations Committee, I, with other members of the Committee, met the late  Mr. Charles  Young of the Melbourne Branch of the Federation on a number of occasions.

* I suggest that, half the time, the rank and file members of the Waterside Workers Federation are not aware that there is a legal way of settling disputes.

* But the use of legal methods does not suit the Branch Executives of the Federation.

* I repeat that the rank and file workers in the industry are being used by the Branch Executives of the Federation for political purposes.

* The Federation has shown by its record that it prefers direct action to legal action to gain the ends of members of the Executives.

* I believe that it is more than a coincidence that the issues on which members of the Federation have gone out on strike have been issues that have generally been supported by the Communist Party throughout Australia.

* In 1962,  Mr. Justice  Dunphy said - 
In the SO odd years of operation of the arbitration system, there does not appear to be a parallel with the recent conduct of the Waterside Workers Federation in its policy of frequent and continuous breaches of award provisions and  a  flagrant refusal to obey the rule of law.

* In 1947, the Labour Government gave to the Waterside Workers Federation the right to recruit labour, at the same time giving the Stevedoring Industry Commission that was then established the right to set port quotas.

* In this way, the Federation was given a monopoly over labour.

* Because it could say who could or could not join the Federation, it was able to say, in the long term, who could or could not work on the waterfront.

* Certainly, such a situation would not be tolerated by a private employer in any other industry for one minute The record of the Federation over the years has shown that it is not deserving of the privileges it has had.

* Comment on this situation was contained in The Basten report of 1952 which stated - 
Most branches of the Federation resist an increase in the numbers of waterside workers, even in  a  port where the need for it is obvious.

* The Committee is satisfied on the evidence that the Federation, through the action of its Branches, on occasions impeded and on occasions delayed the filling of the quota and even the raising of registered strength up to demands short of the quota .

* There is a further indictment of the Federation.

* Although the Federation was given the power to fill the quota, it refused so to do.

* We will see a change in the activities of the Federation when it no longer has the right of recruitment.

* The activities of the Federation have been so cynical, so calculated and so costly to Australia and Australians that it should receive no sympathy from practical trade unionists or the Australian people.

* The rank and file of the Federation must realise and understand that the executive of the union has led them into disrepute.

* It was the whole essence of the situation that brought about discussions between the Miinster for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  and his department, and the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation, in order to draw up legislation to dispose of these matters, which were thought to be anomalies and therefore might be discriminatory in relation to some people.

* The honorable member for East Sydney also said that the reason why conditions on the waterfront are so good is that the Waterside Workers Federation has acted militantly.

* The yield basis of 17 bushels per acre used in the assessment of costs for the new scheme was recommended by the Wheat Index Committee which consists of representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, and the Australian Agricultural Council under the chairmanship of the director of the Division of Agricultural Economics.

* The changing direction of our wheat exports in recent years has made this advantage less definite and it was felt by the Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation that under today's conditions a preferable system would be for the Australian Wheat Board to calculate the actual freight advantage Western Australia shows for each pool.

* In presenting the new plan for the approval of this House I must pay a tribute to the representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and to my colleagues on the Australian Agricultural Council, the Ministers for Agriculture in the States.

* Although it has become an easy sneer and gibe for honorable members opposite to make about this Government being unmindful of the interests of backbench members, again  I  say that there has been no Government in the history of our Federation that has shown more consideration to backbench members in respect of staff provisions, travel arrangements, allowances and superannuation benefits.

* I suggest to honorable members that they do not bother about the postulations and protestations of honorable members on the Government side but have a look at the hard record from the earliest days of **federation** in Australia until to-day, and they will find that from its inception and until this moment the Australian Labour Party has been forward in its thinking in regard to the defence of Australia.

* Away back in the early days of **federation**, no other party had upon its platform the formation of an Australian navy.

* Though it is not really so old, because New Zealand nearly came in with us at the time of **federation**.

* Is it a fact that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority has power, under section 31 of the Stevedoring Industry Act, to recruit labour in any port at which the Waterside Workers Federation fails to provide sufficient members to fill the port quota?

* I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether he is aware that the Australian Citrus Growers Federation met in Melbourne last week, with officers of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of Primary Industry in attendance.

* I take it that both the Council and Club members are crooked on the Government for neglecting this particular section  of  the community so long, and their hostility can only be compared with that of the Commonwealthwide Australian Pensioners Federation, which is something like one quarter million strong, which has joined in condemning the failure of the Commonwealth Government to curb prices.

* This is obvious when one considers the conduct of Ministers; their inability to answer questions; in the case of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Territories  (Mr. Barnes)  the fumbling in trying to answer questions about New Guinea; the refusal of the Minister for External Affairs to face up to problems; and the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  - arrogant to the nth degreewalking into the Parliament and seeking to destroy in one night the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In addition, because they seek to destroy the Waterside Workers Federation, they will make the House sit tomorrow until 6 p.m. For 16 years the Government has sat on the sidelines and done nothing to fight Communism anywhere.

* They were prepared to meet representatives of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation in Melbourne for further discussions.

* Conference emphatically rejects the proposals to contribute increased levies for wool promotion until the implementation of a marketing Reserve Price Plan and instructs its delegates to the forthcoming Federation Conference to strongly oppose extension beyond June, 1962, of the increase of Ss.

* The fathers of **federation** went through the 1891 draft Constitution with a fine toothcomb and struck out the word "citizenship " wherever it occurred.

* How would such a tariff affect the Malayan economy and the comparatively recent agreement between the Federation of Malaya and the Australian Government?

* The Waterside Workers Federation is an outstanding example.

* Because of this the members of the Waterside Workers Federation know exactly who is who and what is what.

* When a ballot takes place for the election of officials, members of the Waterside Workers Federation - the same may be said of the Australian Railways Union - have a wide knowledge of the candidates offering.

* After all, the skilled workers of Australia, the artisans, the salaried officers and all the rest of them owe to the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Railways Union, and the Australian Workers Union some debt of gratitude.

* I am very glad that owing to the foresight which he and the Prime Minister of Singapore have shown, these two countries will be working as partners in the proposed Federation of Malaysia.

* It must be remembered that the problems of Malaysia will not end when the **federation** is formally proclaimed next week, but will continue for quite some time.

* They have been told by the industry, that is the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, and the State governments that they must store the grain at home.

* I am fully aware that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation did not support the move for a second pool, and at the same time it did not support the request of the Victorian Government for extra money for the purpose of building additional storages.

* I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has made representations to the Government to take action to protect the interests of dairy farmers against the importation of butter and cheese now that import restrictions are lifted.

* In addressing a question to the Minister for Civil Aviation 1 refer him to the impasse that exists between the Australian Federation of Air Pilots and the airline operators in respect of the crewing of DC9 and Twin Otter aircraft.

* While the final objective of the Citrus Growers Federation is permanent protection, dismissal of the request for temporary protection means that the problems of the citrus industry are not properly understood by the authority.

* The **federation** has asked that its case be again referred to the Tariff Board so that urgent protective action may be taken before the industry is further damaged.

* The points raised by the honorable member were answered in reply to a question without notice on 29th March and, as promised in that answer, a copy of a letter sent to the New South Wales Teacher's Federation on the subject was given to all Senators and honorable members.

* On the one hand, there will be a gigantic struggle between the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council to capture the six seats on the proposed new board.

* They include the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, which will be on the inner; the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council; the Australian Primary Producers Union, which will be on the outer; the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, which will be on the outer; that Wheat and Wool Growers Association of New South Wales; the Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers Association; the South Australian Wheat and Woolgrowers Association; the Farmers Union of Western 
I think it is perfectly clear today that the natives of Rhodesia look to Britain.

* When the Federation of the two Rhodesias and Nyasaland was imposed, very much against native opinion but very much sponsored by the European minority in Southern Rhodesia, it was ultimately to Britain that the natives looked for the breakup of that Federation, which they felt was an extension of the authority of Southern Rhodesian Europeans into Northern Rhodesia and into Nyasaland.

* They have looked to Britain for constitutional action in their defence ever since the dissolution in  1963  of that Federation, which they never wanted.

* The natives of the old Federation of the Rhodesia and Nyasaland felt that the sole aim of that Federal State was to make the rich richer and the poor poorer and that this hopelessness would extend into the far future, denying any political power to them.

* There is another leg to this education campaign organized, if I may say so, by the Australian Teachers' Federation.

* I find that some of the people who approach me on these educational matters, and who represent the Australian Teachers' Federation, are not the most desirable members of our community.

* As to the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, I do not think that the highest officers in the trade union movement, or even in the **federation** itself, are responsible for what happens on the Melbourne waterfront.

* I believe that the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation is more or less derelict of leadership and the degree of irresponsibility it is showing is something which, if I may put it this way, excites the horror of most Australians.

* For too many years - in fact, ever since the beginning of **federation** - there has been a tendency in this Commonwealth Parliament to say that we must keep completely out of the State sphere in respect of the conservation of water, despite the fact that there is one section in the Constitution which gives us, as it were, absolute power over navigation.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is prepared lo confer with the employers to work out a satisfactory system so that this problem can be overcome as expeditiously as possible.

* So much so that the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions last week carried a resolution to the effect that there must be no further recruitment to the stevedoring industry unless by agreement with the ACTU and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The article was authorised by that rather notorious Communist and long time acquaintance of mine,  Mr. Tom  Nelson, the Secretary of the Sydney Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The paragraph reads - 
Our Federation, by its sacrifices,-  more emotional catcheries - 
Concerning conciliation, I recall that the honorable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr. Birrell)  said that members on this side of the House would not know a waterside worker if they saw one.

* I have associated with members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for many years and I have a great respect for 95 per cent, of the members of that Federation.

* Fortunately I had  Mr. Nelson  in the room with other members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I would say, therefore, that the contention that the shipowners rush into court for sanctions against the Waterside Workers Federation without exploring every possible channel, both conciliatory and otherwise, available to them of settling a grievance and getting the job going again is completely without any foundation.

* At Port Kembla a ballot is already taking place to get the 20 men and when this has been completed the names will be passed on to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Some had the two certificates and those nominations will be processed immediately and the names passed on to the Federation.

* Then followed the period of State control which ended with Federation in  1901.

* Some  40  years before Federation, Port Augusta was already linked by telegraph with all the other populated parts of Australia and so the necessity was seen to link it with Darwin and, through the submarine cable link, to extend communications from Darwin to Java.

* If honorable members look at the kinds of government that Australia has enjoyed since **federation**, they will find that for a total period of about 15 years we have had Labour governments and for the remaining 45 years we have had antiLabour governments.

* That is reasonable enough because at the time of Federation education was a matter for the States.

* The total expenditure on education at the time of Federation was probably not more than three or four million dollars.

* No other government since Federation has done half as much.

* This Government has increased the advance under the war service homes scheme from 2,750 to 3,500, and during its first five or six years in office it paid out more money for war service homes than all other governments since Federation.

* It was agreed at the Darwin conference that,  in  view of the widely varying conditions  in  different States of the **federation** and of the fact that so many aspects of aboriginal welfare come within State governmental responsibility in fields such as health, education, lands and settlement, it would not be  in  the best interests of the aborigines to have uniform Commonwealth legislation or uniform administration.

* The recommendations touching this matter were made as a result of negotiations between the Australian Wool Growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* If the European Community becomes a **federation** with Great Britain as a constituent state, then 
This, then, is the test selected by the Prime Minister.

* If the European Economic Community becomes a **federation** and Britain joins, then she ceases to be a sovereign community.

* will become a **federation** and thereby neutralize and abolish British sovereignty.

* Examination of its constitution and the practice of its government under that constitution since 1958 shows that it is not only a **federation** now but also a powerfully centred **federation**.

* A **federation** is a collection of regional governments with a central government over all.

* Not only has it a central government but that government has far more power than is in the hands of any other **federation** in the world to-day.

* They are wider, more complete and more detailed than those of any other **federation** that now exists.

* is already constitutionally more of a unitary state than a **federation**.

* already more powerful than any other existing **federation**, but also it is an unelected body designed not for democratic discussion and decision but for administrative and executive efficiency.

* Here the position taken by the Prime Minister is that if the European Economic Community is a **federation** and Britain is involved, then British Commonwealth ties will loosen up and finally disappear.

* "The old hopes of common policy have gone ", he says, and "... if Europe became a **federation** then Britain's position in the Commonwealth would be regarded as no more anomalous than many other things that have happened ".

* Britain's entry to the European **federation** - make no mistake about it - will produce, according to the Prime Minister, just another anomalous situation.

* In these circumstances, and because  the  possible carriage of containers by road over  much  of Australia has created great interest in both road haulage and Government services circles, the Committee heard much evidence from both users and planners of  the  Australian road systems, represented by bodies such  as  the Australian Road Transport Federation, the National Association of Australian  State  Road Authorities,   and  the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads.

* We can perhaps take the period from **federation** to the First World War as one era, the period after that war to the great depression as another, and the period from the beginning of the Second World War until to-day as yet another.

* As most honorable members will realize, Yugoslavia itself is a **federation** of a number of small countries - Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina and Macedonia.

* the letter from  Mr Cowan  of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations reads in part: 
That is covered by sub-section (5.)

* This is the point which the Federation is on rather than the announcement of 'this is James Dibble of the ABC reading the news', or whatever it is.

* I wish now to refer to the very difficult matter of representation on the selection committee, which at present is confined to the two older grower organizations - the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation - and excludes the Australian Primary Producers' Union and the Australian Dairy Farmers' Association  hich, in their own right, have some claim in the conduct of this legislation by virtue of the amount of meat produced for export by the dairy industry.

* This morning the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia pulled out the members of that branch in an unauthorized strike.

* I can state definitely that this strike was not approved by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and I am fairly certain that it would not have been approved by the federal organization of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, which is the only organization that really wants action in the matter, has urged all parliamentary representatives to support action against pie-buying and other irregularities.

* To summarize the position, it seems that wool-growers want to stop pies from operating, but that, except for the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, they are cautious about what should be done, first, because of the problems associated with the drafting and policing of suitable legislation, and, secondly, because of the possibility that such legislation might " boomerang " against growers.

* The honourable member for Darling  (Mr Clark)  has been a member of this House for more than one half of the history of Federation.

* The House of Representatives is to be fewer in numbers, proportionate to the Senate, than it was at **federation**.

* To illustrate this, in New South Wales at **federation**, there was a population of about 1,000,000.

* At **federation** there was the equivalent of 25 rural constituencies, yet this proposal would provide thirteen rural constituencies.

* If at **federation** the House had had 120 members, there would have been 25 rural constituencies in New South Wales.

* But the proposal would reduce that number to thirteen, although the population of New South Wales since **federation** has increased from 1,000,000 to 4,000,000.

* I think since **federation**, to take care of the movement of population.

* There is no direction in section 19 of the act that people may guess at how population will move, but the electoral commissioners for South Australia made the following statement in their report: - 
I stated in the House that in the case of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation I had gone through the records and read cases of repeated convictions for such offences as assault and battery, thieving and receiving; such offences, well known to the honorable gentleman, as sodomy and similar offences; repeated assaults on females and procuring.

* On that conference there is 50 per cent, representation by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and a 50 per cent, representation by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Much subtle propaganda has been disseminated by members of the Wool Board and in some cases by people who have relinquished their previous views, lt has been so subtle that some members of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have also fallen for it.

* I support that statement by the record of this Government, which stands unparalleled in the history of the Australian **federation**.

* The Government believes that the proposed new Federation of Malaysia can contribute significantly to stability and progress in South-East Asia.

* The joint communique issued by the Governments of the United Kingdom and Malaya in November, 1961, stipulates that after the coming into being of Malaysia, the Federation will allow the United Kingdom to maintain the bases at Singapore for the purpose of assisting in the defence of Malaysia and for Commonwealth defence and for the preservation of peace in South-East Asia.

* When the Minister introduced his proposal to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act he went to some length to assure the House that the provisions relating to the distribution of the States into divisions had not been changed since Federation and that the Bill did not intend to alter in substance the existing provisions.

* of the Commonwealth Electoral Act reads - 
Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States.

* AUSTRALIAN FEDERATION OF AIR PILOTS N.S.W.

* Some honorable members have occasionally wished that this **federation** had to follow the practice of the greatest **federation** - the United States of America - where the  President  negotiates treaties, but where treaties enter into force and become the law of the land only by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, provided two-thirds of the Senate present concur.

* These show the hours of meeting of the Parliament since Federation, the number of public servants since Federation and the sizes of Budgets since Federation.

* The number of public servants at Federation was 22,000.

* Such has been the spread of population in New South Wales during the course of Federation that he has represented part of an area for which my grandfatherinlaw was twice a Labor candidate.

* There has been an outburst by the New South Wales Teachers Federation which complains that when teachers become sick there are not enough replacements.

* Has the Meat and Allied Trades Federation  of  Australia made an application for representation  of  the Australian domestic meat industry on the Board; if so, what was the result of the application?

* If the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia has been denied membership on the Australian Meat Board, for what reason was the application for membership refused?

* A similar position applies to the Federation of Malaya.

* Here it is contended that if we take those countries which have been warring in bygone days into a new **federation** called the Common Market, we will bring about a situation which will be conducive to peace in the world.

* It is true that this morning the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation decided to call an illegal strike, and by a decision reached some time this morning the strike is to be continued for 24 hours.

* What is obvious is that this does indicate a state of " anarchy " - I use the word used by the honorable gentleman who asked the question - within the Waterside Workers Federation, because this strike was called without the knowledge of the executive of the **federation**, which yesterday was conferring with shipowners in an attempt to achieve a solution of some industrial problems.

* I have pointed out here on more than a dozen occasions that this indicates a state of anarchy within the **federation** itself, and that it is under the leadership of the Communists.

* The **federation** and branch leaders on this occasion are not losing their salary or pay, but they are depriving the waterside workers themselves of their day's salary and also of the right to be paid attendance money.

* Requests have been received from a number of school authorities such as the Teachers' Federation, and parents' and citi zens' associations, for further money to  be  made available by the Commonwealth to the States for primary and secondary school education.

* At the time of **federation**, the States voluntarily surrendered a number of their powers and rights to the Commonwealth, but they retained their control of the administration of education, lt is only because of the different nature of tertiary education in the universities that the Commonwealth has been able to assist the States in that phase of education.

* State Courts exercising Federation jurisdiction.

* The Australian Capital Territory has been created by the Sates as part of the machinery of **federation**.

* This plan has been supported by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and by most farming organisations throughout Australia.

* This has been a very fine example of **federation** at work.

* As I say, this is **federation** at its best.

* The first is that we should return to the original provision in the Act which has lasted almost since Federation.

* It is true that the Act has remained almost, if not entirely, unaltered since its introduction in the early days of this Federation.

* I remember some seven years ago, after the publication of the report that has been referred to in this debate, listening to an interesting address by a member of the Tasmanian Dairy Farmers Federation who spoke on the need either to amalgamate the farms in marginal areas or to divert them to some other form of production, such as beef production.

* Yet he cannot realize the facts of life as demonstrated over the last three years have been a continuing factor since **federation**.

* The simple history of it is that, at **federation**, Victoria was a relatively high-tariff State.

* The council is virtually the parliament of the dairying industry and comprises the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Dairy Produce Board and the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalization Committee.

* The position was placed on a full-time basis, in line with some other Commonwealth marketing boards, and  Mr. Roberts  severed his former connexions, including the chairmanship of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, to concentrate on the vital task of marketing Australia's surplus butter and cheese.

* The report goes on to say that  Mr. Holmes,  the advocate for the Queensland Employers Federation, said that in a free society there should be no restriction on petrol and oil sales at garages and that there was no need for rostering of operators of petrol outlets.

* Men who wanted to register as waterside workers applied to the branches of the Waterside Workers Federation in the various ports and those branches, subject to the approval of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, were able to add those applicants to the men working in their ports.

* One of the most satisfactory features of this legislation and the Minister's secondreading speech is the fact that representatives of the people concerned in this industry - the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian " Stevedoring Industry Authority and the employers - have met together since May of this year, when the Minister called the first conference.

* This Government believes in the **federation** of States and the retention of powers in the hands of the respective States.

* For instance, the New South Wales Teachers Federation asked - 
The attitude expressed in the other place - this is an attitude which would certainly be expressed on my side of this chamber - is that this is a power which the Commonwealth should exercise.

* It was one of the great reasons for forming the **federation**.

* It was the reason for the Federal Council of Australasia being formed fifteen years before the **federation** itself was formed This was among the very few powers given to that Federal Council.

* It was one of the first powers chosen for the new **federation**.

* Sir Henry  Parkes, in his autobigraphy, named him as the first effective advocate of Australian **federation**.

* The  Chairman  is  Mr J.  Scully of the Office of Secondary Industry of the Department of Trade and Industry and the members are  Mr A.  P. Beatty of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation,  Mr 
W. Easton of the Australian Cheese Manufacturers Federation,  Mr F.  N. Giles from my Department and  Dr Fairbrother  of the Office of Secondary Industry of the Department of Trade and Industry.

* This attitude on the part of Opposition members has been supported consistently by the Australian Teachers Federation and by those people who have some responsibility in these matters and are able to talk with some authority about the need for additional teachers.

* Two years ago the science committee of the New South Wales Teachers Federation documented the preliminary requirements for the teaching of science in Australian secondary schools.

* In 1962 thirteen unions were fined a total of 9,050 - and this was the year in which the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia was fined a total of 4,800 - and legal costs totalled 12,166 4s.

* In 1963 fines totalling 12,800 were imposed - 9,200 on the Waterside Workers Federation - and legal costs amounted to 775 18s.

* No, of course the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation is not.

* But the dispute has been taken out of the hands of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation.

* The honorable member derided the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* If this organization is denied representation on the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee and the board, surely it is logical that the members of the **federation** should not pay the levy.

* The members of the Dairy Farmers Federation will pay the levy.

* When we apply logic, we see that there is every justification for representation of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation on the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee and the Board itself.

* If **federation** means anything, it means some basis of respect for the mutual rights of both the State and the Commonwealth.

* Also, is it a fact that the Minister has singled out the militant Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for special attention in the campaign that is being conducted by him and the Government, and that he has in fact repudiated certain undertakings that were given to the union?

* Before **federation**, each of the six Australian colonies had provided a statutory procedure, usually commencing by way of petition, for bringing actions against their governments.

* Their union, the Waterside Workers Federation, is trying to provide some kind of security for these men, who have most inhumane conditions of employment forced on them.

* Does he not know that the quota system was recommended by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation?

* I am certain that neither in the Waterside Workers Federation nor in other unions will the Government achieve its ends.

* Those are the penalties to which the trade union movement in general and the Waterside Workers Federation in particular object, and we wholeheartedly support their objections.

* Many other points have been brought to my attention by members of the Waterside Workers Federation in regard to trouble on the waterfront.

* They were members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* 6 jetty, Port Kembla, at 8.37 a.m. on Tuesday, 2nd May, when a member of the Waterside Workers Federation fell down a hatch.

* 6 jetty, the men on the " Tento " stopped work and so also did the members of the **federation** on another ship close by, the " Iron Knight ", as a mark of sympathy with the relatives of the dead man.

* The example I have quoted is typical of the attitude of the authority concerned towards members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It is opposed by the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labour Party as a whole because it is the thin edge of the wedge in the introduction of further penalties in association with long service leave provisions.

* At the time of **federation** the various States retained education as a State function because they were anxious to hand over only the minimum of powers to the Commonwealth.

* Opposition members have agreed, in the past, that that procedure should be adopted, but do they counsel trade unions such as the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia or the Seamen's Union of Australia to do that sort of thing?

* The seriousness of this problem is highlighted in the compre hensive report which was prepared by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* During a broadcast,  Mr. R.  T. Curtis, the secretary of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, stated in relation to this problem - 
Take the honorable member for Yarra  (Mr. Cairns).

* Surely the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Melbourne Trades Hall Council know of the resolutions that were passed by the World Federation of Trade Unions at its world conference and of the directives that have been issued to every Communist Party in every country to employ these tactics in order to tike the trade unions over as far as possible, and destroy conciliation and arbitration courts.

* This fake document was distributed in Lagos, Nigeria, in an endeavour to oust the International Council of Free Trade Unions, a free trade union organization, in favour of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a Communist organization.

* In England today there is a gentleman known as the Kabaka of Buganda, which is one of the states involved in the Federation of Uganda.

* A third organization which seeks admission to the selection committee must be approved individually or separately by each of the organizations constituting the selection committee - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* This procedure seems to follow the pattern of the Australian Wool Industry Conference which was constituted by 25 members of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and 25 members of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* I hold no brief for any primary producers' organization, whether it is the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation; but I say that the set-up of the selection committee in this instance is not democratic.

* The committee comprised one representative from the board, one representative from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, one representative from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and one from the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service mentioned these conferences in passing and I was pleased to note that he paid tribute to the magnificent efforts of the Australian Council of  Trades Unions  and the Waterside Workers Federation as well as the representatives of the employers at these national conferences which preceded this legislation.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Members of the Opposition are accused of many things by supporters of the Government and I was pleased by the references of the Minister in his second reading speech to the activities of the Waterside Workers Federation and the A.C.T.U.

* His  record of service on the waterfront shows that be joined the Waterside Workers Federation in July 1938.

* He rejoined the Federation from the mechanical branch in January 1961.

* In response to representations made by the union to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority be was told that no long service leave would be granted to him because he was ineligible for it, having gone from the Waterside Workers Federation to the Foremen Stevedores Association, and that this break precluded him from being re-granted continuity of service as a waterside worker.

* In a letter dated 4th October 1963, from the Secretary of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the following statement appears - 
This man went from the Waterside Workers Federation to a position which made him eligible to join the Foremen Stevedores Association.

* He was in that position for approximately eight months and then rejoined the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But because he found that he was unsuited to the position of foreman stevedore and asked to go back into the Waterside Workers Federation, the break in his service as a waterside worker is regarded as being a permanent break and he is not entitled to regard his service as continuous for long service leave purposes.

* If he had applied for leave from the Federation in order to take a trip overseas as a union delegate to visit some other country, that break would not have been regarded as a permanent one.

* Surely a man who has worked on the waterfront almost continuously since 1938, simply because he goes to a higher position, finds that he is unsuited for that posi tion and comes back into the Waterside Workers Federation, should be regarded by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority as being continuously engaged in the waterfront industry.

* I ask: Has the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority now the power to reject a man who has a criminal record and who is recommended by the Waterside Workers Federation, if the Authority deems that criminal record relevant to considerations that would exclude the man from the job?

* This Committee also consists of representatives of Australian and overseas shipowners stevedoring companies, The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, The Shipowners' Accident Prevention Organisation, The Foreman Stevedores Association and the Waterside Workers' Federation, 
Australia is a very wealthy country.

* He is there, and he is pursuing now a policy of confrontation towards the Malaysian Federation.

* They are yie organisations which drew up, in conjunction with the Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation, the quota plan in the interests of the Australian wheat grower.

* A comprehensive report came from the conference between the Standards Association, Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia, the Commonwealth Government Printer, the New South Wales Government Printer, Associated Chambers of Manufactures, paper manufacturers, envelope manufacturers and various other organisations that would be interested in the standardisation of paper sizes.

* Throughout Australia, a great revolution has been led by the Australian Teachers Federation and parents and citizens' associations in an endeavour to inform the people on the need for increased expenditure on education.

* Let me read now from the official publication of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria.

* The Governor of Victoria,  Sir Dallas  Brooks, in opening the twelfth annual meeting of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria, stated that building standards in Australia were the highest in the world.

* I quote them only because when the Minister for National Development opened the 1958 conference of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria he said that the decline then in house building was due primarily to the way in which finance had been moving.

* The comparative figures for 1949 and 1956 of the total amount provided for home finance are clearly presented in the following table: - 
Before the turn of the century, when **federation** was being discussed, the supporters of the new-State movement in Queensland were lulled into a false sense of security.

* They have been marked out since the time of **federation**.

* That is not just the experience of the Australian **federation**.

* It is the experience of the American **federation** also.

* Australia will be developed as the American **federation** was developed- by Commonwealth financial resources and by Commonwealth initiative.

* I did see a statement said to have been made by a  Mr. E.  Mccormack who is standing for election as Assistant Secretary of the Melbourne Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Mr. E.  McCormack is not to be confused with  Mr. J.  McCormack who is standing for election as  President  of the Melbourne Branch of the Federation.

* Mr. E. McCormack, the man whom I mentioned first, has made a provocative statement which implies in effect that in the new year the Federation will not stand by the present agreement it has made with the Government and will not willingly cooperate in the all-in conference that is now being held with the support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* He is not a member of the Executive of the Federation, as is suggested in the report; he is a member of the Federal Council.

* Yesterday, the Federal office of the Waterside Workers Federation issued a statement denying responsibility for  Mr. E.  McCormack and stating that it will still participate in the all-in conference and that it will do so with sincerity and with the hope that the conference will ultimately reach a settlement of the various problems that are to be discussed there.

* Most of us have had sent to us in recent times the sixth annual report of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has a new leader, who has now had about twelve months experience of the job.

* They considered the question of boards of reference - a tremendously important factor in regard to peace in an industry such as this; mechanization and redundancy; -the exclusion of members of the Waterside Workers Federation from areas of work; penalties; the general organization of the industry; demarcation disputes; arrangements for keeping ships working while particular matters in dispute other than safety matters are determined; and incentives.

* In view of the leadership that now exists in the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, that may be done.

* The second item considered - redundancy - affects not only the **federation***.

* Our **federation** has existed for 60 years and the document that we know as the Australian Constitution was the best that was obtainable at the time that it was accepted.

* At the time of **federation** it was never thought that the Commonwealth Parliament or any State parliament could play any part in regulating the affairs of the economy.

* There is no doubt that the issues under consideration at present are some of the most important which have had to be discussed at any time since Federation, with the possible exception of the issues involved in the celebrated banking legislation of nearly 20 years ago.

* It is the biggest producer of wool, it is the biggest producer of wheat, and it is the centre of the main industrial conurbation in Australia; but it is getting the lousiest and the rottenest deal that any State has had since **federation** I am no apologist and I am no protagonist for the present Premier of New South Wales, but this is a matter which concerns me.

* Is this the state of affairs that the founding fathers of **federation** would have ever contemplated?

* The Australian Federation of Airline Pilots, manufacturers organisations and everybody concerned with aviation said that the existing runway would not be long enough to handle the Boeing 747 jets.

* We are catching up with the American Federation after a lapse of seven or eight decades.

* There were three members of the Boothby family who were well and very favourably known in South Australia in the years before **federation**.

* As to the substance of the honor- able member's question, the Waterside Workers Federation presented its case to the presidential member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to apply the 10 per cent, metal margins increase to the waterfront.

* The issues were between the **federation** and the employers.

* and from the Waterside Workers Federation that provided certain concessions with regard to long service leave were granted, the A.C.T.U.

* and the **federation** would attempt to conciliate on their differences with the employers and, if that course were not practical, would resort to arbitration.

* Recently, he made a statement which, while supporting the **federation**'s claims, said that whenever the **federation** had a dispute it should resort to the usual methods of settlement of disputes.

* There has been opposition expressed by both the Waterside Workers' Federation and the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour to these surveys.

* What sum has been provided by the Commonwealth Government during each year since Federation for oil search in Australia?

* Do honourable members realise that there have been only 600 members of this chamber since Federation?

* The States in fact with **federation** achieved no more status than they had last century when they were British colonies and their writ did not run on the sea, beneath the sea, on the continental shelf, on the sea bed or below the sea bed for any more than 3 miles from low water mark.

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether he is aware that the Commonwealth Council of the Amalgamated Engineering Union has decided to oppose the adult technical training scheme and has advised the Australian Council of Trade Unions of its decision, ls the Minister also aware that the New South Wales branch of the Teachers Federation has passed a resolution opposing the scheme?

* Is it a fact that the Teachers Federation has shown proof that the New South Wales technical colleges are not sufficiently equipped- 
May f express my indebtedness to the honorable member for Hunter  (Mr. James)  for having underlined what, of course, we have already known for a long time - the alliance between a certain section of the Labour Party and the Communist Party.

* He has risen in this Parliament tonight and defended a Communist, a man called Lewis, a liar, a traitor, a man who is prostituting his position in the Teachers Federation- 
 Of.

* He is a man who is prostituting his position in the Teachers Federation in order to further the aims of the Communist Party.

* The secession of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia has caused a great deal of concern to many Australians.

* We were able to interview representatives of the various political parties represented in the Federation, gaining from them their views about the Federation.

* I think it may be said that as a result of our visit we know many things about the Federation which other people probably do not know.

* Singapore has now seceded from the Federation and has become an independent State.

* We hope that Singapore's action will not lead to Sabah and Sarawak also breaking away from the Federation.

* Was it caused by the social and economic development of Singapore, which was expanding more rapidly than the other States of the Federation?

* Was it caused by the fear that the People's Action Party was getting a foothold in the rest of the Federation by reason of verbal reports of its achievements?

* Was the Federal Government concerned about the solidarity convention of the Opposition parties, which was chaired by  Dr. Toh, Deputy  Prime Minister of Singapore, and which had as its purpose the formation of a united Opposition party in the Federation?

* Was the Government concerned that in the near future it might be defeated in an election and lose control of the Federation?

* Some of those factors must have had a bearing on Singapore's departure from the Federation.

* As an Australian and a member of this Parliament I must be critical of the Malaysian Government for not taking into its confidence the Governments of Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand, which have greatly assisted the Federation through the Colombo Plan.

* We have also assisted the Federation with military aid.

* He may be able to tell us whether there were any feelings at the Prime Ministers' Conference about the breaking up of the Federation.

* Was he informed that the Federation was breaking up?

* It will probably take many years for the breach between Singapore and the Federation to be healed.

* It is obvious that if the employers had exercised their rights under the award, and under the arbitration legislation, they could have imposed severe penalties on the Waterside Workers Federation for unauthorized stoppages.

* In a period of four or five months fines amounting to 7,000 have been imposed on the **federation**.

* Why is it that only this year - a year in which there have been fewer stoppages than in any year since 1947 - has there been the gigantic fining of the **federation** to the extent of more than 7,000.

* The Labour Party would oppose any Australian commitment to defend Malaya or the projected Malaysian Federation.

* lt must have been a terrifically hard day's work lor the Executive Council and the Governor-General to decide on that great matter and, in that phraseology, convey it to the secretary of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Since the beginning of **federation** until recently there had never been a strike in the Post Office.

* The Management Board of the Southern Miners Federation has passed a resolution that unless the north western sector of that colliery can be properly controlled with regard to its roof and the dangers that are there, it will be forced to take certain action that could result in the closing of that section.

* From my own experience - and I worked for many years in the office of the solicitors for the Miners Federation - I would say that no men pay a greater price in terms of occupational hazards and in terms of health than the coal miners.

* I have confined my remarks, as far as contractors are concerned, to the Master Builders Association of New South Wales, but the  president  of the Master Builders Federation of Australia, in a speech published in a magazine called " Building: Lighting: Engineering ", and delivered on the occasion of a farewell to  Dr. Loder,  a former Director-General of Works, paid a remarkable tribute to the Department of Works.

* He said - 
I am quite serious when I say that one of these few items on which our Federation members stand as completely unanimous, is the high regard we hold for the Commonwealth Department of Works.

* Annual leave for Post Office staff working six days a week is three weeks, the same leave as was allowed at the time of Federation, sixty-six years ago.

* A compliment is paid to the State Government Insurance Office in the " Newsletter " of the Federation of Housing and Building Societies of Queensland.

* The "Newsletter" states- 
It is a pity that the Federation has been dismembered.

* The Minister said - 
Whatever the reasons for this period of industrial peace in 1958-59, there is one thing of which we can be sure - what occurs on the waterfront occurs because the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation want it to happen.

* I support this bill and I congratulate the Minister on his efforts always to help achieve the objectives, or the alleged objectives, of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* If, in fact, this is the rule that he uses to discover Communists, the finger points also in his own direction, because he himself always addressed the late  Mr. Healy,  who was a top Communist and General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, as "Jim".

* Tom Nelson, Secretary of the Sydney Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, and Jim Healy, General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, who according to the " Worker " assisted to formulate policy for the A.W.U., were among the other Communists with whom  Mr. Dougherty  collaborated.

* It was also sought, in a somewhat different form, by the Australian Public Service Federation representing a vast majority i of State public servants in Australia.

* As the honorable gentleman has said, the presidential member of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission who is responsible for the Australian waterfront this morning gave his decision on an application by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for an increase of 7s.

* The conduct of the **federation** on the waterfront at these two ports amounts to anarchy, I repeat.

* Mr. Justice  Ashburner was bitterly critical of the actions of the **federation** officials in Sydney and Melbourne, and stated that it was high time they realized that they could not resort to arbitration only when they believed there was  a  reasonable prospect of getting  a  decision in their favour and resort to direct action when they thought that the arbitration system would not grant their demands.

* As to the last part of the question,  Mr. Justice  Ashburner said that if the circumstances on the waterfront changed or if the officials of the **federation** in Sydney and Melbourne agreed to abide by arbitration, the **federation** could apply to him to have the interim increase applied also to both Sydney and Melbourne.

* We,  60  years after **federation**, have increased our population from  4.000.000  'o  10,000,000.

* In fact, in 1959 the Federation of Housing Cooperatives in Victoria when referring to the 30 per cent, direct aid stated - 
In " Education ", the journal of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the following report appears - 
It is a survey conducted by the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* Their leadership is well known and I need not go further than to say that their **federation** is strongly Communist-dominated.

* In these circumstances, one would expect the Liberal Party to explain why it has presided over the financial disintegration of our Federation.

* I quote his words - 
We cannot go on in a sort of twilight zone between federalism and unification, trying to retain political **federation** in the face of financial unification.

* There is still nothing in the Australian Federation comparable to the Hill-Burton legislation of 20 years ago in the American Federation.

* About three or four months ago  Mr Jim  Goddard of Boundary Bend, who is a member of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation, came to me and asked what I could do to get some protection against imports of citrus juices.

* It reads: 
Dear  Mr Turnbull,  1 have received your telegram of 27th July making further representations on behalf of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation concerning the Federation's request for temporary protection against imports of citrus juices.

* As was mentioned in my reply to your earlier representations,  Mr H.  W. King, Secretary of the Federation, is currently compiling information on which the industry's application for increased protection is to be based.

* Wannon last week that the submissions of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council will be the basis for Cabinet consideration of this matter.

* Secondly, I point out that while the power of recruitment has been transferred from the Waterside Workers Federation to the Stevedoring Industry Authority - and the Federation has accepted an invitation to be present at the conference on that basis - a conference will be held with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and my own Department as to the methods by which the recruitment programme can be put into effect, I hope, with the agreement of all parties.

* There was a withdrawal of labour from the " Canberra Star " and immediately the Waterside Workers Federation ordered its Sydney branch to provide labour at every subsequent roster for the manning of this vessel.

* At the same time, the **federation** gave instructions to the Sydney officials that anything connected with South Africa and the loading of cargoes of the kind and under the conditions mentioned by the honorable gentleman had to be referred to the **federation** and determined in accordance with **federation** policy, and that if the **federation** considered it necessary it would refer disputes of that kind to the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* So I repeat that this is evidence that the **federation** is trying to keep up with the agreement it has made with the Government and with me.

* Can he say whether the view is widely held among members of the House that rifle clubs should continue to receive the same aid as they have received since **federation**; if so, will he make a further examination of the matter?

* From  li  per cent, to 10 per cent, of Building Workers Industrial Union members are unable to obtain employment and in the southcoast Wollongong area unemployed carpenters and bricklayers are leaving the industry; 6 per cent, of members of the Carpenters and Joiners Association are unemployed; and 12 per cent, of members of the Plasterers and Plaster Workers Federation are unemployed.

* It has been reported that the Victorian Employers Federation and the Constitutional Club in that State are negotiating with the Northern Territory to obtain vast tracts of good land in the Territory so that it can be developed.

* But both the  President  of the Fifth Republic of France, General de Gaulle, and the Chancellor of Germany,  Dr. Adenauer,  have shown no disposition to consider a **federation** of European states within the realms of possibility.

* The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr. Adermann)  has said that the two member organizations of the selection committee - the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council - are leaders in the industry, or words to that effect.

* However, as the honorable member for Wannon  (Mr. Malcolm Fraser)  says, it is very doubtful whether the **federation** can quality under the qualifications set out' in the constitution of the selection committee.

* It is very doubtful whether the **federation** has a substantial membership in Queensland.

* One might say that its number of members in Queensland is not substantial; but one can say that equally of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* has as good a case as the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation for membership of the selection committee.

* The Minister has said that the dominant factor responsible for bad relations on the waterfront is that Communists hold key positions in the Waterside Workers' Federation and influence the policies and actions of the Federation.

* It so happens that we can turn our minds back to a time when the Waterside Workers Federation was in a situation similar to that which it is in today and behaving in a manner similar to the way it is behaving today and for similar reasons.

* The Minister began this line of attack, and he was followed by the honorable member for Higinbotham  (Mr. Chipp)  who, in my opinion, was most unfair in claiming that there were three Communists on the Executive of the Waterside Workers Federation and that the remaining members of the Executive, although Labour men, probably were elected on unity tickets.

* Leaving aside the three men who, I admit, are Communists, the remaining members of the Executive of the Federation, with one exception, have signed declarations stating that they were not on a unity ticket with Communists.

* Certain powers with respect to the deregistration of the Waterside Workers Federation are to be entrusted to the Executive.

* Prime Minister Bruce continued in this strain - 
Prime Minister Bruce continued his diatribe against the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It was successful in crippling to some extent the Waterside Workers Federation.

* There were no Communists in the Federation in those days and no Communist Party in Melbourne or Sydney.

* The Federation was not dominated by Communists, but was reacting to the rotten conditions under which its members were forced to live in those days.

* Prime Minister Bruce implemented the legislation and crippled but did not kill the Waterside Workers Federation.

* If the Government passes this legislation and gets as far as it wants to get, it still will not be able to form a work force that will not be controlled by the Federation.

* The Government will find it possible to deregister the Waterside Workers Federation, but the Federation will still control labour.

* His return was due to the spate of propaganda that was put out against the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It may be because of propaganda that the Federation is not as popular now as it would like to be.

* Even though the Federation had been reproved by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Government should take no consolation from that because history will again repeat itself.

* The minute the Government applies this legislation and deregisters the Federation and the minute the Government attempts to form a scab union, other trade unions will do as they did on the last occasion.

* Though we may think the Federation has not always done the right thing, we will not tolerate the formation of scab unions.

* But I tell the Government that if it attempts to implement the legislation, it will have not a Waterside Workers Federation divorced from the trade union movement of Australia, but a Waterside Workers Federation rightfully taking its place with the trade union movement.

* Federation of Malaya.

* Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

* Port facilities, and the loading facilities in the ports, have since **federation** been a matter .

* At that late hour in the life of the Parliament he said that since **federation**, these things had never happened in the federal sphere and he asked, in effect, "Why should they happen now? "

* You should not stagnate and you should not hide behind what has happened since **federation**.

* It has been repeatedly stated here by members of the Country Party and other honorable members that the Commonwealth legislation enacted in 1946 was not approved of by the wheat-growers' organizations of Australia, or at any rate by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* During that conference there was read out a letter written by  Mr. Stott,  the general secretary of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, to  Sir Thomas  Playford, who then was and still is the Premier of South Australia.

* The letter is dated 18th January, 1946, and reads as follows: - 
In accordance wilh your request to set out the views of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation in respect to the new wheat plan, 1 report as follows: - 
The Australian Wheat Growers Federation agrees with the broad principles of the plan but our policy stands as follows: - 
Other resolutions carried by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation which affects this plan at the Sydney conference are as follows: - 
That this Federation approves of a guaranteed floor price to growers for a specified period ahead.

* You will appreciate that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation believes that on information supplied to it that there is a reasonable chance of an international wheat agreement being ratified at an early date .

* General Secretary of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation.

* In respect of other differences between the **federation** and the Government, there was some disputation about whether the basis should be f.o.r.

* So, to all intents and purposes, in 1946, the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation completely agreed with the provisions of the measure that the Labour Government introduced in that year.

* There are two big organizations in Victoria - the Wool and Wheat-growers' Federation and the Farmers and Graziers' Association - as well as the Australian Primary Producers Union to which members of both those organizations belong and which acts as a sort of common denominator.

* When I had discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation before introducing the amending waterside legislation in this House, I assured members of the council that if they could point to any anomalies or any injustices in the working of the legislation I would receive a deputation on the matter and, if I thought its representations were fair, I would either make changes administratively or, if it were necessary to make changes in the legislation, I would take the matter to the Government.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation telling them that I am in a position to continue the discussions.

* When the rate of tax was agreed upon in 1957 and incorporated in the Wheat Tax Act of that year, the rate of one fourth of a penny per bushel was fixed in the light of the views of wheatgrowers as expressed through the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and in consideration of the funds necessary for the research programme that was then envisaged.

* The proposal to increase the rate of wheat tax to provide additional funds for research was made at the last annual conference of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation in April 1965 and is an indication of the recognition by wheat growers throughout Australia of the value of the wheat research programme.

* Whilst considering the need for additional funds for the research programme, the Federation also had in mind the approaching change to decimal currency, and the rate of tax now proposed of threetenths of a penny per bushel is exactly equivalent to one-quarter of a cent per bushel.

* As I have already stated, the proposal to increase the rate of tax has the approval of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, which represents wheat growers throughout Australia.

* I have no doubt that what  Sir George  Grey was trying to do was to throw a defensive screen around the Maori people, to defend them from the kind of Aboriginal policies that we pursued in Australia, and when New Zealand withdrew from the negotiations designed to include it in our Federation the provision was left in the draft except that the reference to Maoris was eliminated and the Aboriginal people were the only ones then referred to in the limitation of power.

* The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the National Parliament of a Federation, namely that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* The Minister promised the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the **federation** that there would be no extension of force and no extension of penalties other than what was forgotten in 1961.

* Technically it did, but the Government in fact promoted with Queensland the toughest financial deal for any development project in any State in the Commonwealth since Federation.

* In my speech during the second reading debate I referred to a letter from  Mrs. Ellis,  Honorary Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation which, she says, represents 80,000 pensioners in Australia and Tasmania.

* Mrs. Ellis  states - 
I think the Federation's request is conservative.

* The letter from  Mrs. Ellis  continues - 
Seven - with the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Federation of Malaya, the Federal Republic of Germany, Indonesia, and Canada.

* It is remarkable that Australia is the first **federation** in the world to succeed in getting joint agreement between the Federal Government and the States on an issue of this sort.

* Views of this kind were expressed by  Mr. K.  L. Milne of the Municipal Association of South Australia,  Mr. E.  R. Hill of the Good Neighbour Council of Victoria and Professor Beryl Nashar of the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs.

* The new scheme has been accepted by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, the recognised spokesman for the industry.

* I have in my hand a circular issued by the Western Australian Employers' Federation  (Incorporated) in Perth on  3rd March 1965.

* When the Employers Federation in Western Australia is able to talk in terms of indentured labour in a democracy such as ours our country is being set back to accepting conditions which prevailed at the beginning of this century.

* Let me read one telegram from the secretary of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation of Australia: 
Printers Federation alarmed at huge increases in postal rates affecting printed matter.

* Is the Minister aware of recent statements by government officials in Malaya that some technical diplomas gained by Malayan students in Australia are- not recognized by the Government of the Federation of Malaya?

* When the rejection was challenged by  Mr. Cavanagh  he threatened that unless all the officials were allowed to go his **federation** would have no alternative but to withdraw labour from the rocket range - although at that time this was an offence under the legislation passed by the Labour Government, to which the pamphlet issued by it referred.

* During the last three or four days I have received from my Department several reports about the activities both of the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers Federation and their attitude to the Vietnam problem.

* In Tasmania, the committee will meet representatives of local government authorities, the Fingal Valley Development League and the coal-owners concerned, as well as leaders of the coal-miners' **federation**.

* But then he turned round in the latter part of his speech and said that the penalties imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation are not strike deterrents, that they amount to only 2s.

* Let us examine the position to show how this Government, and Liberals generally, refuse to give any credit to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The reason was that the Waterside Workers Federation and its members were prepared to give the legislation a trial to see how it functioned.

* If they continue to work without strikes, it is said that they are afraid of suffering the penalties imposed by the act; if they go out on strike it is said that they are under the domination of the Communist officials who, it is claimed, have positions in certain State branches of the **federation**.

* The Minister went on, in his criticism of the Waterside Workers Federation, to say that towards the end of last year a series of amendments were suggested by the A.C.T.U.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation, that a number of conferences followed, and that each time there were additional suggestions.

* He went on - 
Despite this, in April a series of stoppages were organized by the Waterside Workers  Federation 
He said that assurances were given by the Waterside Workers Federation that it would do its utmost to settle disputes by negotiation.

* Has the Minister produced any evidence to show that the Waterside Workers Federation did not honour that undertaking?

* carefully organized by the Communist elements in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* How far was it possible to expect fair dealing and the honouring of agreements by the Waterside Workers Federation!

* had no sympathy with the behaviour of the **federation**, though I often wish it would have said so publicly "...

* has been co-operating with the Waterside Workers Federation ever since this legislation was passed, in an endeavour to have the position corrected.

* The Government knows full well from experience that the Waterside Workers Federation is not an organization which will meekly sit down under injustice imposed by this Government, by the employers or by the courts.

* The Minister said that the provisions to which objection was taken would not have been included but for the policies that the then leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation were pursuing.

* He admits that the legislation should never have been passed by this Parliament and claims that it would not have been introduced but for the policies that the then leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation had been pursuing.

* I ask the Minister to indicate what change of attitude there has been on the part of the Waterside Workers Federation between 1961 when the act was passed and the present time.

* If the honorable member for Bruce wants to engage in a little more mental arithmetic - he has been able to work out how much the penalties imposed by the court have cost each member of the Waterside Workers Federation - he might tell us what percentage of the profits made by the shipowners and the stevedoring companies of this country a 100 fine represents.

* So honorable members can see that the turbulence that exists on the waterfront is due largely to the activities of the employers rather than those of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We all know that sometimes spontaneous stoppages of work occur, and members of the Waterside Workers Federation do not strike unless there is some justification.

* In April, 1960, a no-strike order was inserted in the Waterside Workers Federation's award.

* Surely honorable members opposite do not believe that members of the Waterside Workers Federation are the ones responsible for holding up shipping or preventing a proper flow of trade from this country to other parts of the world.

* The authority's report says nothing about the activities of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia being responsible for a fall in our trade.

* In that year, the Waterside Workers Federation was fined 500 plus costs.

* In a second case arising out of the first, judgment was given in favour of the **federation**, which then asked for an order for costs.

* The court ruled that as the **federation** was not represented by counsel it could not claim costs, but could claim expenses.

* The **federation** then claimed all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by its advocate, a  Mr. Docker,  who is an officer of the union.

* It awarded the **federation** only 30 in expenses, although the air fares alone for the advocate amounted to 43.

* So the executive of the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation decided - quite sensibly, in my opinion - to give a nowork direction on the day on which the strike occurred.

* Eighty-four job delegates of the Waterside Workers Federation wished to attend.

* The meeting was attended by representatives of all federal unions, but the delegates of the Waterside Workers Federation were the only ones who were penalized for attending.

* Immediately the Melbourne branch of the **federation** ceased work in protest.

* The Minister was largely only a rubber stamp in the negotiations that took place between the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Department of Labour and National Service.

* Bland's  participation in a conference, said - 
On 9th and 10th May the permanent head of my department conferred with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Minister said, near the conclusion of his speech, that the position on the waterfront would be better if the Opposition would play its part in criticizing and defeating the Communist elements in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Government has provided for union officials - men elected from the rank and file of the Waterside Workers Federation - to be regarded during their periods of office as being on leave, so that there will be no break in their continuity of service.

* Why should they be penalized merely because they occupy these positions and conduct the affairs of the **federation**?

* Some people think it is not a good idea to have a **federation** or a United States of Europe.

* If I may proceed by answering the last question first, I do not know how the Waterside Workers Federation acts because I have no access to its records and I have little or no contact with it.

* The House will remember that some weeks ago it was informed that the embargo imposed by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia on the movement of cargoes to and from South Africa and to and from ports on the whole of the east and west coasts of Africa could only injure the working men themselves and particularly the coloured people of South Africa.

* I have not been advised that the existence of that document has been mentioned to the working members of the Federation, nor that it has been discussed by the Interstate Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* does not agree with the action of the Waterside Workers Federation which has been taken on the grounds of apartheid.

* This measure is necessary because of the steps that have been taken by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots over a period to remove themselves from the conciliation and arbitration system.

* Because of the fundamental tactic of the Federation of Air Pilots that those opposed to it must stand and deliver, it has been virtually impossible to contain the Federation within the procedures worked out.

* In effect, the Federation says: Capitulate or else'.

* Captain R. T. Holt, retiring  President  of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, in a speech that he delivered recently at the eighth annual convention of that body, set out some of the things that have already been achieved on the national front, quite apart from those that are being demanded now and may be demanded in the near future.

* I made it quite clear to the Federation of Air Pilots that as a result of the course of conduct that occurred I would do my best to introduce certain legislation.

* Reverting to the newspaper article of 17th December, 1960, I draw attention to the following passages which report statements by one of the leaders of the Miners Federation: - 
Unfortunately, no help can be expected from the Labour Party, which is so lost in a jungle of unity tickets that it has neither lead nor direction.

* Has the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which is affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, yet is playing around with the World Federation of Trade Unions, not heard of the decision which was arrived at eighteen months or two years ago at a conference of the W.F.T.U., held in the capital of one of the satellite countries of Europe, to concentrate on heavy industries, power and transport and to disrupt and dislocate the economies of the free countries of the world, not by general strikes, which the conference said were out of date, but by the same kind of things as the blackouts which have occurred in Melbourne?

* We are the only Federation in the world which has arrived at an agreement between the States and the Federal Government for the sharing of royalties and the sharing of all the problems associated with offshore oil.

* I have lost a dear and very good friend; the Labor movement has lost a loyal and dedicated leader; the Jewish people have lost a courageous champion of their cause; and the people of Australia and their elected Parliament have lost one of the most talented parliamentarians since **federation**.

* There can be no doubt about the iron-fisted control exercised by  Mr. Healy,  the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* One of the four opportunities to hold authorized stop-work meetings in Sydney in the current half-year was used by the Waterside Workers Federation the other day in order to express publicly its confidence in the regime of Fidel Castro in Cuba.

* These are the sorts of things which have brought public regard for the Waterside Workers Federation to its lowest ebb.

* The Australian Council of Trade Unions does not share the views of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Does the Government fully support the recently determined agreement on the new Federation of Malaysia; if not, what are the factors causing concern?

* In what manner will the Singapore defence establishments be affected by the entry of Singapore into the Federation of Malaysia?

* Sir Abubakar  entered his country's federal politics when the Nigerian Federation was established and in 1952 he was its first Minister of Works.

* But I share the point of view that has been expressed by  Mr J.  P. Cass, Treasurer of the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association of New South Wales, who is also a member of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and  Mr C.  D. Renshaw, who is  President  of that Association.

* Honourable members can obtain from the papers office a list of the days and hours of sitting of the Parliament since Federation.

* In  1901,  the year of Federation, we met for  113  days.

* This seems to me to be the most sensible method to adopt in a **federation** such as Australia.

* The Federation has called on all pensioners to protest by going into mourning for one year, and to wear black arm-bands with the wording - 'Give us this day our daily bread'.

* As each member of the House, and the Senate, stands for the Lord's Prayer, the Federation desires each representative of the people to reflect deeply in their conscience on those words - 'Give us this day our daily bread', and to realise that the consequence of the Black Budget of 1967 is to condemn many thousands of Australia's aged, infirm, and widowed to malnutrition and starvation - subsequent illnesses and possible death.

* After 62 years of **federation**, I believe that we are still in the elementary or infant stages in terms of the limitation or delimitation, or of definition, of the areas of the powers inter se of the Commonwealth and the States.

* The court made an order under section 109 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act directing the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to comply with the award.

* The **federation** went on strike, and the next step in the procedure was for a person to inform the registrar of the court that there had been an offence, and a summons was then to issue.

* I ask for leave of the House to table a statutory declaration, as I previously promised to do, identifying  Mr. Sam  Lewis of the Teachers Federation of New South Wales as an undercover member of the Communist Party.

* The other letter from which 1 wish to read briefly is from the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the union representative of school teachers in New South Wales.

* We have expressed the point of view that has been expressed not only by the New South Wales Teachers Federation but also by other similar organizations throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and the Government has consistently rejected our suggestion for an immediate inquiry into teacher training, primary, secondary and technical education.

* For the first time since **federation** we have a Cabinet that contains not one Roman Catholic member.

* A survey conducted by the New South Wales Teachers Federation of secondary schools revealed that only 44.5 per cent.

* It is incorporating in the statutes something that has never been proposed in the Australian Parliament since **federation** 59 years ago.

* The Minister also made this remarkable statement - 
I wish to refer to the agreement on External Defence and Mutual Assistance concluded on 12th October, 1957, between the Government of the Federation of Malaya and the Government of tha United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

* As you know, the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve referred to in the Agreement, its Annexes and the letters exchanged in connection with the Agreement, includes Australian forces which are or may from time to time be serving in the Federation.

* I should be grateful if you would confirm that the foregoing is the understanding between the Government of the Federation of 'Malaya and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in respect of Australian forces serving in tha Federation.

* On behalf of the Australian Government, I take this opportunity of conveying to you and to your Government the assurance of our continued interest in, and concern for, the well-being of the Federation and its people.'

* In reply, I confirm that your letter correctly sets out the understanding between the Government of the Federation of Malaya and the Australian Government and, in accordance with the suggestion contained in your letter, agree that your letter and this reply be regarded as placing that understanding on record."

* With regard to the second part of the question, the Federation of Malaysia has not yet come into existence.

* The United Kingdom for its part has already indicated to the Malayan Government that after Malaysia comes into being, if will extend the defence obligations now existing in respect of Malaya to the new Federation of Malaysia.

* After all, this is a **federation** and members of this Parliament should take a national viewpoint, but I see a lot of little State.righters around.

* The Australian Forces in Malaya, at the request of the Government of the Federation of Malaya, have assisted that Government in operations against the communist terrorists.

* At the request of the Government of the Federation of Malaya they continue to assist that Government in operations against communist terrorists remaining in the area of the border between Malaya and Thailand, (b) Republic of Viet Nam; At the invitation of the Government of the Republic of Viet Nam, an Australian army training team of 30 instructors assists that Government by providing instruction in jungle warfare and village defence against externally directed communist insurgency, (c) Thailand: A contingent of Royal Australian Air Force fighter aircraft is stationed at Ubon in Thailand at the invitation of the Royal Thai Government to co-operate with the Thai armed forces in maintaining the territorial integrity of Thailand.

* The Minister did a very good job in getting these two organizations together - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* These representations were made by members of the Salinity Committee of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the Mildura and District Citrus Co-operative Association, which is incorporated in the Australian Citrus Growers Federation, and also the Murray Valley Development League.

* It is an amazing victory for cooperation and tolerance and, as other speakers have said, it could lead to an economic and political **federation** of Europe.

* I think the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation have generally conceded that that is sensible.

* The Tasmanian Farmers Federation has been working on the matter and has been in touch with ,ne and other honourable members for at least 2 months.

* The feeling of growers in Tasmania at least can be gauged from the fact that a big protest meeting will be held at Exeter on the West Tamar in my electorate tomorrow night, organised by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* Has his attention been drawn to a statement made by the then Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation,  Sir Grantley  Adams, in London, in December, 1961, that he would ask  Mr. Menzies,  as a champion of the Commonwealth, to accept West Indian migrants and that he would put the question at the next Prime Minister's Conference?

* The very fact that this Bill has been framed in terms of threats and intimidation with the end objective of abolishing the Waterside Workers Federation has made the entire trade union movement and every decent citizen disgusted with the vicious measures it contains.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  began his second reading speech on the Bill by saying - 
The dominant factor responsible for bad labour relations on the waterfront is the domination of the policies and actions of the Waterside Workers Federation by Communists in key positions, and the manner in which it is used as an instrument of Communist Party policies.

* The indication of this practice is shown in the Minister's speech when he singled out the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation and accused that branch .

* I would like to point out to the House that the Waterside Workers Federation in Melbourne was congratulated by  Mr. Jack  O'Neill on the manner in which it handled this intake.

* Undoubtedly it has no plans except the kind contained in this Bill, which will destroy the Waterside Workers' Federation.

* The submissions put forward by the Waterside Workers' Federation in August last were as follows - 
Let us look at the employers' reply to these claims.

* First of all, they were unwilling to negotiate and then, when finally forced to negotiate, they put up to the Federation the following propositions - 
I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whether it is true that the Waterside Workers Federation has called a 24-hour strike for next Tuesday.

* This Government, of all governments which have held office since Federation, is most vulnerable on the question of its economic record.

* He pointed out quite clearly that the exclusion in the minds of the fathers of **federation** was not made on the basis of colour, but has its origin in the question of land tenure, coupled with the fact that that could possibly interfere with State rights.

* The honorable member for Wilmot  (Mr. Duthie)  quoted from the official journal of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria; but, as so many of his colleagues have done, in criticising the Government on its housing endeavours in the past, he omitted to refer to this great headline in that journal: "Housing Boom a 
This brief statement is unnecessary in this chamber of representatives.

* Originally it was the work of the States and it remained so even after Federation.

* Based on this, Britain subsequently vetoed an attempt by the Afro-Asian nations to invite Britain, through the Council, to halt the transfer, of powers back to Rhodesia after the breakdown of the Central African Federation.

* In a long exposition of the British position, which echoed similar statements that had been made previously in other United Nations organisations, the British delegate said:  the essentia) point which I make, with all possible emphasis, is that the freedom of the Southern Rhodesian Government to conduct its own affairs is no fiction but an inescapable constitutional and political fact 
Although the honorable member for Sturt  (Mr. Wilson)  indicated earlier that the Commonwealth was making more money available to the States now than ever before in the history of **federation**, he conveniently overlooked the fact that money was worth a lot more in 1949 than it is now.

* At the same time it is up to us to do what we can to welcome their establishment and facilitate their admission into the Federation.

* Has he heard reports that Tunku Abdul Rahman, in broadcasts, has stated that any future effort that may be made to secede from the Federation of Malaysia will, if necessary, be dealt with by force?

* Two representatives of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Two representatives of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation.

* He made this a political issue rather than an industrial issue by devoting the early part of his speech to a description of the Communist element in the Waterside Workers Federation and to decrying the actions of various members of the Federation.

* The honorable member for Parramatta claimed that the Federation had submitted for registration as waterside workers men who had criminal records.

* In answers to questions in the House the Minister has admitted that the police records that are available to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority are not available to the employing authorities or to the Federation.

* If the Bill is designed to rid the Waterside Workers Federation of Communists, at what cost will this be achieved, if it is achieved?

* This Bill is fuel to the Communist leaders in the Federation.

* The Bill takes from the Waterside Workers Federation the right to recruit.

* Honorable members on the other side of the House have quoted many cases to support their contention that the Federation has used this right as a bargaining stick.

* The Federation, in common with every other union, has a responsibility to its members.

* The Federation, through years of experience, has a reasonable knowledge of the work that will be available at various times of the year.

* Many members of the Federation move around Australia from one port to another and make themselves available for work at various ports at their own expense.

* The Federation has a good idea of the number of men that will be required and it has a duty to act in the interests of its members.

* I believe that the implementation of this provision, which will deny the Federation the right of nomination, will be a serious blow.

* By and large, I believe that the Federation has lived up to its obligation to supply labour.

* We believe that if the founding fathers had been able to foresee the development of this country that was to take place in the six decades after the establishment of **federation**, they would have provided the powers that we suggest should be incorporated in the Constitution.

* Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Federation of Malaya and Indonesia.

* The provisions relating to the distribution of the States into divisions have not been changed since Federation, and it is not intended to alter in substance those provisions.

* This Government is the only government that has standardized one inch of the State railways since **federation**.

* One thing that enrages unionists, not only on the waterfront but elsewhere - there would not be a trade unionist in Australia who did not agree with the attitude adopted by the Waterside Workers Federation on this issue - is that every time the men are penalized and the branch then declares a stoppage in protest against the penalties, another penalty of 500 is imposed on the organization.

* Fines amounting to 7,900 have been imposed by the Commonwealth Industrial Court, and individual members of the **federation** have lost just on 700,000 in attendance money.

* That action by the Commonwealth Government was unprecedented in the history of Federation, lt was also unprecedentedly generous in its terms, as the then Prime Minister,  Sir Robert  Menzies, claimed it to be when introducing the scheme.

* If they think honestly about all that they will come to realize that the Waterside Workers Federation, like the Australian Council of Trades Union, is a component part of the trade union movement in this country which understands its responsibilities and knows where it is going in respect of the problem of proper control.

* I say again, particularly for the benefit of the honorable members for Bruce and Warringah, for God's sake remember that the Waterside Workers Federation is a union in control of a good many unionists.

* The Communists had to be removed from the control of the Teachers Federation and they had to be put out of the parents and citizens' councils.

* In 1954 the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the Parents and Citizens Association in New South Wales supported a campaign for more Commonwealth assistance for education.

* The Waterside Workers Federation wants its members to be registered as casual employees.

* Would honorable members opposite eliminate the penal clauses in this act and allow the Waterside Workers Federation to run slipshod over the community?

* If the attitude of honorable members opposite is that employees should receive a bonus for wrong-doing, heaven help our national economy, which will be at the mercy of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the hierarchy of its leadership.

* I.  Ellis, Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation, has said that the pensioners are so disappointed with the Budget that they have decided unanimously to use their strength at the ballot box to change the Government.

* Now, next door in Malaysia - Australia's sane friend where the old colonial trained Prime Ministers like the Tunku have managed to hold Umno and Islamic fanaticism at bay - there is a slide towards a hatred of the Chinese community, which began with driving Singapore out of the Federation.

* The embargo is not lifted because the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council have never been able to agree on the subject.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation has always opposed the embargo and the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council has never been quite sure of the stand it should take.

* Since **federation**, Commonwealth employees have enjoyed three weeks annual leave and a working week of 361 hours, which was shorter than that of other workers.

* The Tunku Abdul Rahman had the intention of creating the Federation of Malaysia.

* I mean the **federation**, whether it be loose or fairly tight, of Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.

* I also adverted to a unity ticket which had been in the course of preparation in the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria.

* There is a member of the Australian Labour 
We have heard a lot of talk recently about how the Labour Party managed to get a Communist out of the Waterside Workers Federation and replace him by  Mr. Fitzgibbon.

* On the one hand the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation is asking for a fair deal, and all it is seeking is a fair deal.

* When the Waterside Workers Federation is fined for an unauthorized stoppage the cost to each wharfie is 6d.

* All it would cost each of the wharf labourers who came up here the other day would be 6d., if the **federation** were fined 500 for an unauthorized stopage.

* Nobody can unload or load ships unless he is a member of the Waterside Workers Federation, and that is one reason why I dislike closed shops.

* In the first year of Federation this Parliament had an annual appropriation of less than 4 million to approve.

* There is no doubt that the scheme was, with some reservations, welcomed by the rank and file of the Waterside Workers Federation and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* As I explained at the time, the provisions to which objection were taken would not have been included but for the policies the then leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation had been pursuing.

* Towards the end of last year, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation made a series of suggestions to me about the legislation.

* Subsequently there were a number of conferences between the council and the **federation** on the one hand and with me and my department on the other.

* By February this year my study of the problems was sufficiently advanced to enable me to inform the council and the **federation** that I was prepared to agree to a number of changes; that I was sympathetically disposed in principle to others, but desired suitable practical solutions to be evolved between the council and **federation** and my department; and that I was continuing my study of other suggested alterations.

* Despite this, in April a series of stoppages were organized by the Waterside Workers Federation and a great deal of propaganda was directed against the very provisions I had already promised to amend.

* To me this was a saddening and revealing experience; it brought me face to face with this issue, so vital in the conduct of all industrial relationships: How far was it possible to expect fair dealing and the honouring of agreements by the Waterside Workers Federation!

* had no sympathy with the behaviour of the **federation**, though I often wished it would have said so publicly and in clear terms.

* In mid-June I had a further conference with the council and the **federation**.

* During that discussion with the council and **federation** they said they recognized the importance to the Australian economy of avoiding port stoppages and consequently would do their utmost to try to settle disputes by negotiation between the parties which, given goodwill on both sides, would render port stoppages unnecessary.

* were it not for the tactics - the deliberate tactics and objectives - of some of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation to continually disrupt and disorganize working on the waterfront.

* True, a change in the general secretaryship of the Waterside Workers Federation had occurred.

* On 9th and 10th May the permanent head of my department conferred with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Waterside Workers Federation.

* There was nothing spontaneous about them; they were carefully organized by the Communist elements in the Waterside Workers Federation - especially strong in Sydney and Melbourne.

* Finally the Australian Council of Trade Unions intervened - virtually to require the Waterside Workers Federation to return to arbitration on these issues.

* The reason is, I suggest, simple - the Melbourne and Sydney branches are under the control of members of the Communist Party and they have been using their offices in the **federation** in a personal struggle for power and for political purposes - purposes alien to the Australian way of life.

* In the first place, let me say that I have been much influenced by the representations of the Australian Council of Trade Unions - that it was unjust to attach strings to the grant of long service leave - and particularly by the fact that while it has constantly pressed its views on me in relation to this matter it has given no support to the irresponsible and utterly futile campaign of direct action by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In keeping with this, following my June conference with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation, the council demanded of the **federation** that it adhere to the assurance given me at the conference.

* At the June discussions the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation asked that the whole of section 52a should be repealed - that is to say, hot only the part dealing with the deferment of long service leave but also the provisions dealing with automatic forfeiture of four days' attendance money in the event of a port stoppage.

* It took into account the conduct of the Waterside Workers Federation to which I have referred.

* If the Opposition would play its part in exposing and defeating the Communist elements in the Waterside Workers Federation whose purpose is unchanged - to create industrial trouble and chaos whenever they can and to stir hatred between employer and employee - a mighty change would come over our ports.

* I do not think the opinion can be challenged that the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation welcomed the Government's decisions to remove anomalies, extend the long service leave scheme to the remaining waterside workers and cancel the so-called strings on long service leave.

* There can be little doubt that this will be so if the Opposition plays its part and helps to destroy the influence of the Communists in the Waterside Workers Federation, particularly in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.

* During the course of that speech, I reminded the members of the Labour Party of what had taken place eighteen months or two years ago, when the World Federation of Trade Unions, representative of red trade unions - the Australian Council of Trade Unions is not affiliated with this body although it often walks arm in arm with it - had a meeting in Budapest, Prague or the capital of one of the satellite countries in Europe and decided to start infiltrating non-Communist unions.

* You see it in the Victorian railways and in the tactics of the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I do not know whether 1 will ever claim my honorary membership of the Waterside Workers Federation, but I was the dear old sergeant with the Greasy Point push in Williamstown in the First World War.

* Well, of course, we have succeeded in doing something in Australia which no other **federation** in the world has ever done or looked like doing.

* The bill is the result of a joint proposal by the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation.

* Whether that be a confederation, a **federation**, or a union as we know them in the political sense.

* This bulletin makes it perfectly clear that some of the nations of Europe want a loose **federation** and others want a union.

* There are different views as to what is a union, a confederation, or a **federation**.

* The Federation was told that inquiries of this kind are matters for each State.

* The report " Some Needs of Education in Australia ", to which the Federation referred, is an example of precisely such an exercise carried out by the States.

* The information in the Board's summary is obtained from the officer of the Board in the port where the dispute occurs and gives the reason as outlined to him by the Federation representative for the stoppage of work.

* The Federation may give a different reason for a stoppage of work than that which is in reality the true reason.

* Surely to heaven, this nation is not expected to accept the principle put forward by many members of the Opposition that the rule of law must not apply to the Waterside Workers Federation because they are above the law and completely immune to it.

* Is there a divine right of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* There is nothing in any award which prevents any member of the Waterside Workers Federation from appealing if he believes himself to have been unjustly penalized.

* There has been no mention in this debate of the penalties which the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation apply, not legally but by devious means, to waterside workers who get out of line with the policies laid down by their leaders.

* Apparently it is all right for the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation to use threats and intimidation to force a man to do something that he does not want to do because he wants to protect his wife and family, but if is not all right for the Government to apply the rule of law to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* If any member of the Waterside Workers Federation feels aggrieved, he has the right of appeal and, if his appeal is upheld, he has the right of compensation.

* Their hearts are not in it because the Labour Party now has been committed publically by its Leader to two opinions: The first is that the Labour Party does not approve and will not uphold unlawful unauthorized stoppages, and the second is that this country is so prosperous that it can meet all the demands of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* No matter which Opposition member speaks on this bill, his heart will not be in the fight because he knows that the so-called penalties have been taken from the ordinary civil law - or criminal law, if you wish - and applied to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In other words, the burden of the penalty lies not upon the innocent member of the Waterside Workers Federation but upon the one who knows that he is contravening the law.

* Most of the Government's amendments are the result of discussions between the Minister, his department and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* They have got more from us than they ever got from Labour governments in the history of **federation**.

* It should be recalled that the legislation was passed after the acceptance by the Government of a unanimous request from the two largest wool-growing organizations, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council.

* Did Qantas Empire Airways Limited pay the 10 per cent, marginal increase to its pilots who were not members of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots as from 27th April, 1963, and to **federation** members as from 1st July, 1963?

* Do the non-**federation** and **federation** members carry out similar duties and are their conditions of employment similar?

* It was the first time since **federation** that an all-party parliamentary committee tackled such a job, but now the Parliament is left in the air again with this job half completed or two-thirds completed.

* Despite what the Government might say, if sufficient pressure was applied by members of this Parliament I feel certain that a committee would be constituted to complete that job, and for once in the life of this **federation** the Parliament would have something concrete before it in respect of constitutional reform.

* I wonder how many members of the Parliament are aware of the difficulty of getting a copy of the debates which took place during the conventions of the early '90's, before our **federation** was formed.

* In its determination to cripple the Waterside Workers Federation the Government has gone to the limit.

* This Bill is a most vicious attempt to smash the Federation.

* It makes a vicious attack on the Federation, on the officials and on the workers, and it prefers to introduce a Bill such as this at the whim of the employers, entirely ignoring the cause of the trouble on the waterfront.

* I repeat that this Bill is a most vicious attack on the Federation.

* In sub-clause 2 of clause 16, in part III of the Bill, it is provided that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission shall make a declaration if it is satisfied that the conduct of the Federation or of a substantial number of its members has - 
Action must be taken by the Commission in respect of a continued breach or nonobservance of any award or of an order of the Authority.

* If the Federation fails to ensure that its members comply with and observe such an award or order or in any other respect - there is a wealth of meaning in those last words - action can be taken.

* It could be said that if the conduct of a substantial number of the members of the Federation did not promote good will in industry, action could be taken against the union.

* Clause 18 of the Bill provides that where a declaration has been made the GovernorGeneral - which of course means the Government - may within six months declare that it applies to the Federation, and then its registration is cancelled.

* Deregistration under Section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not relieve the Federation or its members of any penalty or liability that has previously been incurred.

* Although it ceases to be an organization, it does not cease to be an association, so the property of the Federation can be used for the satisfaction of debts or the payment of fines upon application by interested persons.

* of Clause 19 states -  any award that applies to the Federation and its members ceases to have any force or effect in relation to the Federation and its members.

* The power to deregister the Federation if it had committed breaches already existed in section 143 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* If the actions of the Federation were such as warranted deregistration in the past, why have not the employers taken action to invoke section 143 of the Act?

* The measure goes on to provide for an award to be made on the application of the authority or of the employers or of an organisation of employees not being the Federation.

* In other words, it provides for the setting up of a renegade union and applies to such an organisation the same terms and conditions of employment as applied to the Federation, which, according to the legislation, ceases to be a union at that point of time.

* What queer figment of his imagination leads him to conclude that he can operate any port without the co-operation of the Federation and the workers who belong to it?

* If the Federation is deregistered the waterside workers are not going to join a scab organisation.

* They will remain loyal to the Federation at all costs, and of course in the present situation in which there is a constant shortage of labour, as the Minister continually stresses in this Parliament, how are the employers going to get a work force to load and unload cargoes?

* This Bill not only deprives the Federation and its members of the benefits and protection of the awards', it goes further and encourages and assists the establishment of bogus unions.

* The Bill provides for additional punishments over and above those already applicable to the Federation and its members.

* The Federation has been fined more than 25,600 since the beginning of 1960.

* Without consulting the Federation or the Australian Council of Trade Unions the Government brought down that Bill which was brimming over with anomalies.

* The Minister took up a lot of his time during his second reading speech in attacking some of the officials of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Under this Bill it is now a criminal offence to refuse to work with a person who is not a member of the Federation.

* The action taken by the Government in amending the Stevedoring Industry Act to provide for deregistration of the Waterside Workers Federation highlights the fact that dual penalties can apply.

* These have been exercised to an unprecedented extent against the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We know that the Federation has been guilty of such stoppages, but legislation such as is proposed in this Bill will not prevent unauthorised stoppages.

* Under this Bill, if a substantial number of members of the Federation take action even without the authority of the Federation, it can be deregistered, and again action can be taken against union officials and members under sections  109  and  111.

* The laws of the land are much more easily applied by the State to individuals for settlement of disputes between them that it is to exercise compulsion over a powerful organisation such as the Waterside Workers Federation.

* During his second reading speech the Minister was insulting to the Federation members.

* But his statement in his second reading speech was  a  distortion, and despite the correction today was insulting to the Federation.

* It was not true to say that of the 990 men submitted by the Federation in Melbourne, 260 had criminal records.

* The Authority, I should point out - and this fact was revealed in answers to questions today - does not ask applicants whether they have criminal records, and neither does the Federation.

* But the Federation is not advised what their record is, and the applicant is not advised of the reason for his rejection.

* How does the Minister expect the Federation to know about these applicants if it is not supplied with the information?

* The present Act empowers the Authority to say what numbers have to be recruited, and the Federation has to recruit them.

* The Federation claims that it gives all possible assistance in filling quotas.

* Once the Authority has fixed a quota, the Federation claims it accepts the responsibility and does its best to fill the quota.

* The head office of the Federation has urged the branches that when new recruits are necessary they should seek them in an endeavour to fill the quota.

* As a matter of fact, the Stevedoring Industry Authority more than once has expressed appreciation at the Federation's work.

* In one report it said - 
In fixing the quota the Authority considers the views of the parties, the employers and the Federation, together with the best information available to it in respect to the movement of ships.

* Any port quota can be reviewed when requested by the Federation or a prescribed representative of the Authority.

* After the Federation has submitted the names of the quota to the Authority, delay occurs because of the method of medical examination that is required by the Authority.

* The Federation has been accused of failing to keep the registered strength up to quota in some ports.

* Yet, by official correspondence on 7th May 1965, the acting local representative of the Authority in Melbourne informed the Branch as follows - 
This document should adequately answer any charges by the Authority or by the shipowners that the Federation has failed to act in a responsible way towards its obligations in respect of quotas and recruitment; and surely it must be obvious that much of the blame for any delays rests on the Authority and in many cases, too, upon the employers.

* The Federation has held this power since 1947.

* The present system of recruitment of labour has had some problems but the responsibility for any weakness in the system cannot be blamed entirely on the Federation.

* They are not all attributable to the Federation.

* The Federation has submitted its ideas on the provision of basic cost stability within the industry.

* For the first time he did not blame the waterside workers, but in his haste to attack the Federation he went off half cocked without waiting for the results of that inquiry.

* This Bill stands condemned  because it is an attempt to destroy the Federation.

* Instead of trying to build up confidence on the waterfront by dealing with the many long term problems of the industry mentioned by the Minister, he sets out to destroy the Federation.

* The Federation seeks the establishment of a non-contributory pension fund for all waterside workers.

* Since 1941 the Federation has been attempting to get an industry pension scheme.

* Negotiations between the Federation, shipowners and the Commonwealth Government failed to bring about results.

* This matter is more important now than it ever was and the Federation is increasing its pressure for a number of reasons.

* Employers have shown an unwillingness to negotiate, but when finally forced to confer with the Federation, they have insisted that the union should surrender many of its conditions.

* The Bill before the House is introduced for the purpose of meeting the wishes of employers on matters that the Federation would not concede.

* The Federation is willing to negotiate reasonably and constructively.

* Obviously the Federation has to protect its members.

* I emphasise the points of disagreement between the employers and the Federation which the Government should act to rectify in order to get rid of the problems on the waterfront.

* The facts are that after Malaya became an independent member of the Commonwealth, an Agreement on External Defence and Mutual Assistance was concluded on 12th October, 1957, between the Governments of the Federation of Malaya and the United Kingdom.

* of this Agreement affords to the Government of the United Kingdom the right to maintain in the Federation such forces, including a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, as the two Governments agree to be necessary to assist the Federation of Malaya in its external defence and for the fulfilment of Commonwealth and international obligations.

* On 1st August, 1960, an Internal Security Act came into force which empowers the Malayan Government to deal with the risks to internal security presented by the threat of subversion, particularly in border areas of the Federation, which have been proclaimed as border security areas under the Act, where operations against the terrorists continue.

* Within the border security area the Federation Government will continue to have the assistance of the Commonwealth Land and Air Forces .

* On the unity ticket for election to the executive of the Trades and Labour Council, were Dawson, Daddow, Daley - that is Daley of the Hospital Employees Federation, in case anybody wants to know - Hanson, Nicol and A. Macdonald.

* None of them denies that he is a Communist, and each has stood on unity tickets with all the members of the State executive who have denied that they have stood on unity tickets, with one exception, that of  Mr. Whitby,  of the Hospital Employees Federation, who did not stand on a unity ticket until 1958, 1959 and 1960.

* For the hall committee, there was J. Daley, a Communist, of the Hospital Employees Federation, with F. J.

* I point out (o the House, particularly the honorable member for Wills, that I have here a letter dated 6th April from the Federation of Parents and Citizens' Associations of New South Wales, addressed to me as Secretary of the Government Members' Education Committee.

* Two organizations which stand out as having merit - I am talking of producer representation - are the Australian Dairyfarmers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* They were the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* He is State secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia.

* The request came from the Federation of Catholic Parents and Friends' Associations.

* The same situation applies to the specific requests for Commonwealth assistance contained in the resolution conveyed to you by the Federation of Catholic Parents and Citizens Associations.

* They were made, first, by the convention that drew up the Constitution, which provided that for the first ten years of **federation** the States would receive three-quarters of the customs revenue.

* I find that the United States of America is dealing with the matter in this way, as a **federation**; and to quote an instance I refer to the way in which that country handles its water supply problems.

* The PostmasterGeneral has said that the installation of each new service costs 570; but this would not have been the cost of installation in 1939 or in the early days of Federation.

* Only one union, the Waterside Workers Federation, has during the last ten years attracted public attention by imposing compulsory levies and, in doing so, it has been just as much out of step with the sentiments of the trade unions generally as it has been on so many other things.

* I have read in the Press some reference to an alleged statement by the  President  of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots on the subject of crewing the Twin Otter aircraft, which is now coming into service with Trans-Australia Airlines, but I cannot provide any information beyond what I have read in the newspapers because the 
Federation has not submitted the matter to my Department.

* So I am not sure of the circumstances under which this statement has been made by the Federation.

* I agree with the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, the Sawmillers Association of Australia, and others, which are not supporters of the Australian Labour Party, but which have said that the lifting of import restrictions and the imposition of the credit squeeze in Australia were the most colossal blunders that have ever been committed by any government in Australia since Federation.

* The dispute between the airline operators and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has been going on for some time.

* The dispute between Qantas and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots is to be regretted.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Bury)  in his second reading speech seems to be happy to lay all the blame on the air crews and their organisations, particularly the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* The Federation, on the other hand, lays the blame on the management of Qantas and the Minister himself.

* The Bill is directed at the air crews at a time when agreement has just been reached between Qantas and the Federation.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service, during the course of his second reading speech said: 
J am glad to say that, under the chairmanship of  Sir Leslie  Melville, agreement was recently reached between Qantas and the Federation, but not without threats by the hitter's representatives of direct action and of walkout from the conferences when matters were raised of which those representatives disapproved.

* The Minister indicates in this portion of his second reading speech that the Federation representatives were prepared to walk out.

* I was handed an article by  Mr Gosbell  who is  chairman  of the overseas branch of the Federation.

* The article states: 
At no time did the Australian Federation of Air Pilots representatives remove themselves from the negotiating arena.

* Certain Qantas pilot negotiators did not attend some of the last meeting; but the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was always represented, and had a full mandate from all branch members.

* He would have the House believe that the Federation walked out of the conference when it was the Qantas pilots who walked out.

* Had he introduced it earlier, possibly Qantas and the Federation would not have reached agreement.

* In his second reading speech' the Minister said: 
The Pilots Federation was registered, but by its own decision placed itself outside the powers of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* Who can blame the Federation for taking that action, when many other unions at present registered have been contemplating taking the same action?

* Here the Pilots Federation and others are not desirous of registering, but there is power in this Bill to declare a body and that body then comes within the ambit of this Tribunal.

* Deregistration could have no worries for an organisation such as the Pilots' Federation or the Airline Navigators' Association, which are to be declared bodies and brought under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act against their own wishes.

* Dealing with section 88za the Minister said: 
No-one can tell me that responsible bodies such as the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, the Australasian Airline Navigators Association and the Australasian Airline Flight Engineers Association, would authorise a stoppage of work or take part in disputes such as those that have occurred unless there was some extreme provocation.

* It said: 
The pilots object strongly to Qantas demands that they obey all lawful instructions issued by the company, fly into any airport approved by the Department of Civil Aviation, and that the Australian Federation of Air Pilots undertakes not to instruct pilots to disobey company orders.

* The last submission particularly annoys the pilots, and Qantas would be wise to think again about asking the **federation** to render itself impotent as an industrial force.

* Tonight the Australian Federation of Air Pilots alleged that a 150-page interim report on the survey had been suppressed because it was critical of the Qantas management.

* The Australian Federation of Air Pilots decided to move for resolution of this problem under the Agreement on Industrial Relationships Procedures.

* After the Department of Labour and National Service had considered the matter, I understand, the Federation received from the Department on 20th June 1967 a letter that stated: 
Surely this is a matter that could have been considered by an independent mediator appointed in accordance with those procedures.

* I do not want to go into a lot of detail about the superannuation issue, but some facts have been stated to me by the Federation of Air Pilots as follows: 
I point out that direct action, or the strike weapon, is not illegal in Australia.

* The laws of the land are much more easily applied by the State to individuals for the settlement of disputes than by exercising compulsion over powerful organisations such as trade unions or, as in this case, to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, 
Forcing the flight crews under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will not mean that all danger of direct action is removed.

* The pilots' **federation** realises this and that is why it wants to remain out of the arbitration system.

* The point was made by  Mr Justice  Higgins when he said: 
I suggest that the honorable member, who has some sense of discipline and unity, and everything else that comes from his background, would appreciate the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I know Labour men who are in the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria.

* I propose to say something in the next few minutes about one of the central problems of our situation as a **federation**.

* This evening 1 want to talk about the lack of understanding, lack of sympathy,lack of tolerance and lack of co-operation that exists throughout the **federation** at the moment in regard to Commonwealth, State and local government relationships.

* That is why I suggest the Government is reaching a very inefficient stage as far as the operation of **federation** is concerned.

* Under the present Wool Tax acts, the rate of the wool promotion levy is prescribed on the recommendation of the Australian Wool Bureau, which in turn is required to consult with the two organizations represented on the bureau, namely, the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* The rate of the wool research levy is prescribed on the recommendation of the council and the **federation**.

* The arrangements which I have outlined when dealing with the Wool Industry Bill envisages that the Australian Wool Industry Conference will take over the role which the Australian Wool Bureau, the council and the **federation** now play in recommending the rates of levies for wool promotion and research.

* Will he advise whether a similar port stoppage in Melbourne has been avoided or whether the Waterside Workers Federation intends to proceed with its original plans?

* If the Minister had this information, supplied to him by the Stevedoring Industry Authority, in his possession why did he not in turn supply it to the Waterside Workers Federation officials so that they could do what he now says they have never done, that is, investigate the records of people whom they introduce to the waterfront?

* In the " Brisbane Telegraph " of 27th February appeared a statement by  Mr. J.  R. James, secretary of the Queensland Employers Federation.

* The report reads as follows: - 

 Mr. J. R. James, Secretary of the Queensland Employers' Federation, to-day said a frank statement on Australia's economic problems was needed.

* Senior nursing staff at the Canberra Community Hospital, making submissions from the Hospital Employees Federation, made strong criticisms of the plans Ibr the Woden hospital.

* In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for St George  (Mr Bosman),  Sister C. O. Thomas,  President  of the nursing branch of the Federation, said that the Federation had not been consulted by anyone.

* I am not surprised at the Council of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation passing a unanimous resolution on 24th September last in these terms- 
The Council of the New South Wales Teachers' Federation welcomes the provision of funds by the Federal Government for tertiary education, but affirms that  the  funds supplied are insufficient to meet the needs of tertiary education in Australia and is gravely concerned that no provision whatsoever is made for teacher training.

* He pointed out that the term was invented about 40 years before Federation and that it had found no place in any of Australia's law.

* Like other honorable members, I have received from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation a document which attempts to deride the Australian Primary Producers Union as an organization claiming to represent the whole of our primary industries.

* In defending the **federation** the honorable member for 
I do not think the honorable member for Bendigo  (Mr. Beaton)  mentioned the A.P.P.U.

* in five States, who run beef-type cattle are as follows: - Victoria 8,333, or 44 per cent, of the membership in that State; New South Wales 4,461 or 50 per cent, of the membership; Queensland 532 or 14.9 per cent, of the membership - as I under stand it, fewer than 200 members are affiliated with the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation - South Australia 2,097 or 33 per cent, of the membership, and Tasmania 1,870, or 47 per cent, of the membership.

* Would the Minister agree that the employers' **federation** is planning reintroduction of the dilutee system that was introduced in industry during World War II.?

* The Conference is constituted by bringing together under an independent  Chairman  25 delegates appointed by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council - representing in the main the big graziers - and 25 delegates appointed by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, who are mainly representative of the agricultural wool growers.

* The Wool and Meat Producers Federation based its policy on the formula used for the 1951 ballot on the Post- Joint Organisation marketing plan - that is, five bales and 200 sheep.

* The Council ultimately modified its thinking to a qualification based on 15 bales and the Federation raised its limit to eight bales.

* Does the honorable member for Stirling suggest that if, for example, we deregistered the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, that action would have an inhibiting effect on that union?

* If I could be persuaded that the Waterside Workers Federation, the Seamen's Union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union or other metal trades unions that have been on the receiving end of most of these fines were behaving like tame cats I should hate to see a wild one.

* For the information of honorable members  I  cite the record of one union, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, in respect of man hours lost through unauthorised stoppages during the past five  months.

* The penalties imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation are, for example, 500.

* The Federation has 22,000 members, and if the honorable member does some quick arithmetic he will soon work out that a fine of 500 works out to about 5d.

* I agree with the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  who said - 
I should like to quote a tetter which we of the Opposition received from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation.

* This organization says - 
The Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation views with grave concern the interference by the Federal Government with the base pension rate for civil pensioners, whereby the single and married pensioners are to be divided into two sections.

* No one can deny that in our **federation** the division of responsibilities has placed the matter of flood mitigation within the jurisdiction of the State governments.

* First of all, let me say that I have in my hand a letter sent to  Sir Frank  Meere from  Mr. G.  E. K. Kerr, secretary of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation.

* It contains the following statement: - 
A director of the Queensland Employers Federation used these words - 
Attitudes to this grand design fall into three categories.

* There are those who are plainly and openly for it, and those who are faint-hearted - who believe that the **federation** or confederation of Europe is an unattainable goal, idealistic and beyond the reach of ordinary man - a goal to be shattered perhaps by the nationalism of earth-bound states and countries.

* A resolution against peace was carried unanimously and, according to the report, there were present at that conference these Australians:  Mr. N.  Wallace, an organiser of the Victorian Branch of the Builders' Labourers Federation;  Mr. G.  Smith, a member of the executive of the 
Plumbers Union;  Mr. E.  Worrell, a shop steward of the Painters Union at Newport workshops;  Mr. J.  McNamara, an executive member of the New South Wales Branch of the Builders Labourers Federation; and  Mr. J.

* Young, of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I have received a letter from  Mr. Murray,  the Acting Secretary at Wollongong of the South Coast Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* I also read a statement by  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, that he would be willing to attend a conference.

* We then came to an agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation and the agreement was accepted at mass meetings of members of the Federation at each of the great ports of this country.

* The industrial relations committees have not worked and, despite the undertakings given to us by the Federation and by mass meetings of members of the Federation, they have not lived up to their obligations.

* If all I can expect is that solemn agreements will be made by the Federation and will be endorsed by the branches, only to have the Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Federation immediately afterwards refuse to adhere to the agreements, naturally I will be reluctant again to call a national conference.

* Nonetheless, as the suggestion has been made, I will have a talk with the employers of waterfront labour, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and my own officers, and if I think that anything useful will come out of discussions with the Federation, I will call a conference.

* One organization - I prefer to call it  a  **federation** - which had representation was the Federal Viticultural Council of Australia.

* executive alleges that it is a full and free member of the International Confederation of Trade Unions, and that it does not belong to the Communist-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.

* I should like to say to the honorable member that, owing to the change in the outlook of the Olympic Federation, this matter is being kept under close scrutiny.

* But I want to emphasize that as long as Australia is a **federation** of States there will be no case for giving a member representing Commonwealth territory full voting rights in this Parliament.'

* But while Australia is a **federation** I do not believe in the special circumstances applying, that we can logically give a full vote to any member for the Australian Capital Territory.

* In the years between **federation** and 1940 all that big business was interested in was the making of colossal profits.

* Has the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service been directed to a letter dated 3rd March 1965 and signed by  Mr. Morrison, President  of the Western Australian Employers Federation, stating that the **federation** had initiated positive action to build up the work force of Western Australia by a system of indentured labour?

* Following representations from the Queensland Minister for Agriculture and Stock, and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation supporting additional Queensland grower representation on the board, provision was made in the 1958 act for the appointment of an alternate member for Queensland who could attend any meeting of the board at which the member concerned should be unable to be present.

* The Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation have indicated their support for an additional full grower-member for Queensland in lieu of the present alternate member.

* This is a matter which the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have looked at.

* It has been put to me very strongly by the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the same language should be used in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (d) of section 17 (1.)

* Having, I believe, established that there is a dangerous concentration of industry and population under the system that has developed since **federation**, and having indicated that it is essential to break through from that system, which has failed so miserably, and to establish as soon as possible new centres of government and administration, I pass on to what I suggest is the first step that should be taken.

* But there has been conciliation and arbitration legislation virtually since Federation.

* As the honorable member for Higinbotham said, a fine of 500 spread over the 22,000 members of the Waterside Workers Federation works out at only 5d.

* for each member of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I am talking about a few of the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation who try to create industrial havoc and embarrass the Government and the nation.

* I am pleased that in the long run, as in so many other instances, it has heard, and been convinced by, the arguments raised over the years by the Labour Party, because throughout the whole history of debates on organised marketing by this House since the beginning of Federation the Labour Party has resisted arguments - produced as a rule by city interests - designed to persuade the farmers that they should be without any marketing protection while all other sections of the community have ample protection.

* I really stood up just tq make a few remarks about  Mr. Sam  Lewis, the  President  of the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* But in the associations 1 have had with the New South Wales Teachers Federation I have come to believe that it is one of the best organised trade unions in Australia.

* If he wants to interfere ' in the" ballots of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, let bini go out and campaign for his people.

* But the New South Wales Teachers Federation is a very worthy representative of the great body of trade unionism in Australia.

* They are not being paid 37 per cent, of the basic wage to-day, and they need retrospective payments more than they ever did at any previous time in the 60 years since **federation**.

* With an audacity worthy of a better cause, the Minister said in his second-reading speech that this Government had been responsible for more increases in social services benefits than has any other government in the history of **federation**.

* The sinister thing is that honorable members opposite have come to what they believe to be the defence of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, but actually they are not defending but harming them.

* Those honorable members know perfectly well that the **federation** is under a substantial measure of Communist control, and has been under it for a long time.

* At that time the Waterside Workers Federation conducted a pro-Nazi campaign designed to sabotage our war effort.

* I do not believe the members of the **federation** knew what they were being used for, but the facts are established.

* The leaders of the **federation** were able to line up the members in alliance with the Nazis.

* Nowadays those events may seem well in the past, but the point is that the individuals who at that time, in the interests of the Communists, used the Waterside Workers Federation for Nazi purposes are still in control of the **federation**.

* It is true that they have been elected by union vote, but this, I think, simply shows that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation do not know what they are doing, because I do not believe for one moment that the average member of the **federation** is a traitor.

* I do believe, however, that the waterside workers have elected traitors to lead them, people who should themselves be capable even of aligning themselves, in the Communist interest, with Nazi Germany at the worst period of the war, at the time of the Battle of Britain, These are the people who still control the **federation**.

* I say again that the leaders of the **federation** .are men with most disgraceful personal records.

* Of course, each member nation will retain its own sovereign parliament for the time being, but some of the architects of the Common Market have their eyes fixed on a **federation** of European countries, with a federal parliament possessing wide constitutional powers.

* Within the framework of such a European **federation** stands the position of political parties and the industrial movement.

* In addition, the party has endorsed as a Senate candidate a man who stood on a unity ticket with Communists in a Waterside Workers Federation election not only in 1960, but also in 1959 and 1958.

* I refer to  Mr. Arnell,  the  president  of the Queensland branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* That was quite untrue because the week before in a magazine entitled: " Branch News "; which is the official organ of the Waterside Workers Federation, Phil Healy published the statement that it was quite all right to have one's name appear on these unity tickets and that no action could be taken because the policy statement applied only to political elections.

* For instance, there are the Australian Wool Growers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* The Australian Wool Growers Council wants the so-called free auction system to continue, while the Australian Wool and" Meat Producers Federation wants a reserve price system.

* The council represents the biggest wool-growers in Australia and the **federation** represents the smaller growers.

* The 60,000 wheat-growers are united in the Australian "Wheat Growers Federation.

* It used the policy of national development during my own campaign and it was futile, because an electorate that had been held by the ALP since Federation swung with possibly a swing that created political history.

* The position at the time of **federation** is set out thus by the first Commonwealth Solicitor-General,  Sir Robert  Garran, in a paper prepared for the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers on constitutional matters in 1934 - 
The House will recall that some months ago the Victorian police decided that, because of the large scale of pillaging on the Melbourne wharves, they would search the vehicles of waterside workers as they left the wharves.

* Subsequently, the Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, under the leadership of  Mr. Young,  decided to hold a strike because the time taken by the police to search the vehicles was too long, so the Federation said.

* The Melbourne Harbour Trust provided additional gates as exits from the wharves and negotiations were held between the Trust, the police and the Federation.

* I think that the Waterside Workers Federation in Melbourne decided to call the strike because of these fines but to attribute it to some other cause.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  and other honorable members from this side who have spoken have referred to the tremendous losses which our economy has suffered because of the present policies of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is Communist dominated.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service has indicated that the Government has tried in every way to meet the wishes and desires of the Waterside Workers Federation, hoping in that way to bring peace to the waterfront.

* It is completely apparent, however, that the only kind of peace which the Federation wants is peace to pursue its activities of disruption and of lowering our standards of living.

* It is said that the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have poor working conditions; that the type of work they do is onerous; and that they have to work in unpleasant conditions.

* Another matter to which honorable members opposite have alluded very often is the criminal element in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In a Communist dominated union such as the Federation, a criminal element is very necessary.

* Members of the Government parties rely to a very great degree on support from members of the Waterside Workers Federation, because members of the rank and file generally are very dissatisfied with the deal that they get from their leaders.

* If we talk to the decent men in the Waterside Workers Federation - the overwhelming majority of its members are decent Australians - they will tell us that.

* What is the total amount of fines imposed by the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission upon the Waterside Workers Federation up to the present time for alleged offences associated with the wool-loading dispute?

* There is an enormous difference between the control exercised by the Longshoremen's Union and the control that is sometimes attempted to be exercised by the Waterside Workers Federation in New South Wales and Victoria.

* The facts are that neither the New South Wales branch nor the Victorian branch of the Federation pays much regard to the decisions of the executive of the Federation.

* I can say that we are approaching a state of near anarchy and sooner or later the Waterside Workers Federation must realise that, unless it ia prepared to take drastic action to keep its own members in order, somebody else will have to show the waterside workers the way in which the waterfront should be worked.

* As to the second part of the question, it is regrettable that a demonstration was conducted by members of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation yesterday.

* This will have no effect at all on the judgment of the Commission, which will look at the facts and the arguments and will not be influenced by demonstrations by a few rowdy members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* will attempt to induce the members of the Federation to adopt a much more responsible attitude to industrial arbitration than they have done in the past.

* This **federation** was something new.

* At one time, it was hoped that Brunei would be in the **federation**.

* He spoke to me about the idea of a Federation of Malaysia a couple of years before this happened.

* The **federation** was his conception, and it was created.

* The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed a mission to discover whether the proposed **federation** was in accordance with the will of the people of Sarawak and Sabah.

* Every teachers' **federation**, every parents' and citizens' organization, every responsible authority in education is anxious for this inquiry to be held.

* The Government set up a committee, under the chairmanship of  Sir Alexander  Fitzgerald, to ascertain the capital cost of developing the Post Office since Federation.

* If decided that the capital cost of the Post Office since Federation was 340 million.

* Honorable members opposite have used this debate as a medium to disperse throughout Australia the type of propaganda that the Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers' Federation wish to be dispersed.

* The attacks that Opposition speakers have made on the bill, and, through the bill, on the Government, are in line with the attacks that Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have made over the years on constitutional authority, to which they are naturally opposed.

* He is told what to do by the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, which is a very militant union.

* If you know anything about the industry you will know that the Waterside Workers Federation has a complete monopoly of work on the waterfront.

* In other words, he was a member of sixteen of the twenty-three Parliaments of our Federation.

* I can understand the honorable gentleman's interest because statements were made in Western Australia by representatives of some interests in the Federation of Malaya that Australian diplomas were not being recognized in Malaya.

* After I read those statements I noticed that the Minister of Labour in the Federation stated that there was no lack of opportunity at present for skilled persons in Malaya.

* I also made inquiries after seeing-these statements, and I found that Australian degrees are fully recognized in the Federation and that Australian diplomas, particularly, I think, in engineering and accountancy - both courses frequently taken by Malayan students here - are given the same recognition as are English diplomas.

* Now that two of the leading organizations of wool-growers, namely, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, have agreed to request the Commonwealth Government to hold a full-scale inquiry into the marketing of wool, is the Minister in a position to say whether the Government has considered this request?

* It has been such a tremendous success in bringing peace to the waterfront that it has worried the Communist section of the Waterside Workers Federation, which is now trying to disrupt this industry.

* Waterside Workers Federation demanded that a wool bale should be handled by four men.

* The strikes are obviously generated by the Communist leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Some time ago,  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  an antiCommunist, was elected to a senior position in the Waterside Workers Federation, with no help from honorable members opposite.

* That election was embarrassing to members of the Communist Party in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* - As I said before, it has been too successful for the Communist members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* They resent very much the election of  Mr. Fitzgibbon  to the executive of the **federation** and they are determined to embarrass him.

* The chicken meat industry, through its federal organisation, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, approached the Government and requested that a research scheme for their industry be introduced.

* The Australian Chicken Meat Federation is representative of all sectors of the industry, including breeders, hatcherymen, growers, processors and feed manufacturers.

* The Research Committee will be composed of 6 representatives from the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, 2 from the Australian Agricultural Council, and one each representing the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, universities and the Department of Primary Industry.

* They are the Australian Wool-growers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and - last but not least - the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* Mr. Justice  Gallagher called together the parties, including the Waterside Workers Federation, and the **federation** agreed to instruct its members to work the ships to-day provided the owners agreed that lighter bales would be loaded at the top of the holds.

* One of the job delegates was deregistered and  Mr. Justice  Gallagher was asked to hear an appeal lodged by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The period of three months was adopted for the convenience of the owners of the hens and with the concurrence of the principal broiler industry organisation, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation.

* The Bill has the support of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation and I commend it to the House.

* Then in 1945, I think it was, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation was recognized along with the Graziers Federal Council.

* We have progressed slightly since then because, under the present proposal, the conference, which includes the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation proposes to include also representatives of the stud breeders.

* It is no truism to say that they do believe it is a step towards the parliament of man and the **federation** of the world.

* But one must concede that The Six have already co-ordinated and planned their economy better under their system, be it federal or confederate, than Australia has advanced in its 60 years of **federation**.

* When, as in the case of the Waterside Workers Federation, there is an award of this sort, what else can it be?

* I shall quote from a communication from the Waterside Workers Federation in relation to a decision by the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission in regard to Sunday work - 
The second Order sought is in two parts.

* The penalties provided for breaches of Court Orders of this type are 500 for each offence by the Federation, 200 or imprisonment for twelve months in the case of an Officer and, in the case of any other person not an Officer, 50.

* Take the issue of the Waterside Workers' Federation.

* As a result of that decision, the Waterside Workers' Federation said, after three weeks of trying to get to work without Sunday trains, that they would not work on Sunday unless the trains were run or unless some other transport were provided.

* That was the position in which the members of the Waterside Workers' Federation were put.

* Only late last night when speaking to members of the Waterside Workers Federation in Newcastle, I was told of a new system of stowing wool bales which has resulted in fourteen men who belong to this particular branch of the Federation losing their jobs.

* Is it a fact that the conference which will be the body responsible for electing the proposed Australian Wool Board has already been instituted by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation?

* However, in view of the representations that have been made to me both by the teachers concerned and by the teachers' **federation**, I have decided to suspend action until' a report is received from the commanding officer at Butterworth and from the headmaster there.

* I have before me a report published by the Teachers Federation of New South Wales, which carried out a survey in 1965.

* In that report the Federation refers to the makeshift accommodation such as rented halls, rooms in other schools, locker rooms, corridors, hat rooms, staff rooms and store rooms.

* That honorable member asked me what the Government intended to do to restore sanity to the waterfront and what action it intended to take in the light of the fact that the Waterside Workers Federation had decided to hold 24 hour stoppages on each alternate Wednesday.

* I made the statement on 30th July this year after the Federation had withdrawn from the Arbitration Commission.

* It is this - 
In the bluntest of terms the Waterside Workers Federation has served notice ii will use industrial blackmail to exact increased wages, noncontributory pensions, a mechanisation fund and a guaranteed wage.

* It so happened that it was the first statement the Federation made.

* I added this comment - 
In simple language, the Federation's position is this: It has abandoned arbitration, which carries the backing of the Australian people and the Australian trade union movement.

* The honorable member will know that in 1963, after there had been a series of strikes almost as serious as those that are now taking place, at the request of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, with which the honorable member claims to be in close association and contact, I arranged for a series of meetings between senior officials of the A.C.T.U., the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the Waterside Workers Federation and the waterfront employers, with myself as  chairman  of the committee.

* This was agreed to by the Waterside Workers Federation and verified at stopwork meetings on the waterfront throughout Australia.

* The representatives of the Federation agreed that they would not call strikes but that if there was an industrial dispute that needed to be considered they would refer it to an industrial committee comprised of members of the waterfront unions and employers' representatives.

* All the parties to the agreement lived up to their bargain, with one exception; that was the Waterside Workers Federation itself.

* The Federation has not kept one single part of the bargain.

* In those circumstances,  Mr. Speaker,  do you think you could enter into a contract for a negotiation with the Federation with the certain knowledge that after it had solemnly agreed to a course of action, and its own members at waterfront meetings had endorsed that agreement, it would live up to its obligations in the future?

* There is no one who can enter into an agreement with the Federation with the sure knowledge that the agreement will be adhered to.

* No one can deny that in our **federation** the division of responsibilities has placed the matter of flood mitigation within the jurisdiction of the State governments.

* It has been put to the Waterside Workers Federation that temporary labour should be recruited, and the Federation has said: in no circumstances will we permit the recruitment of additional labour'.

* I do not know whether the honourable member for Newcastle knows it, but this in fact was suggested some time ago to the Federation, and the Federation placed such outrageous conditions on the transfer of such labour that it became completely uneconomic and impracticable to follow that course.

* One tends, therefore, to doubt the bona fides of the Federation in this matter.

* I can well understand the inbuilt fear of members of the Federation that if too many men are admitted to the industry their jobs will be threatened.

* As soon as the 1965 legislation became law the Australian Council of Trade Unions appealed to the Government, through the then Prime Minister, to establish a national conference comprised of all parties in the industry, including the Waterside Workers Federation, to see whether the problems besetting the industry could be resolved around the conference table.

* But the Waterside Workers Federation had entered into an agreement - a so called package deal.

* It was only in mid 1967 that all the organisations represented at the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, including the Federation, endorsed the package deal.

* Yet today, after the scheme has run for less than li years of its 5-year life, the Federation has decided that many of the major items must be rewritten.

* The Federation has asked for this system and has been granted it by weak-kneed employers though it is outside the recommendations in the report.

* First of all 1 marvelled at the naivete of  Mr Woodward  in accepting, and I sometimes marvel at the naivete of the Government in accepting, the complete absence of any guarantee by the Federation of better rates of handling cargo.

* Many have told me that in 1965 the Waterside Workers Federation was under control but that in 1968 it controls the waterfront.

* The dominant factor responsible for bad labour relations on the waterfront is the domination of the policies and actions of the Waterside Workers' Federation by Communists in key positions, and the manner in which the Federation is used as an instrument of Communist Party policies.

* Then it was forced to dismiss from the Stevedoring Industry Commission the General Secretary, and the Assistant General Secretary of the Federation, Messrs. Healy and Roach.

* Always, however, it has pursued a consistent objective - to secure efficient operations on the waterfront', to ensure that awards and agreements will be observed, and to encourage the Federation to act responsibly.

* In the case of the Federation, this Parliament has conferred special rights and privileges, rights and privileges that go far beyond those enjoyed by other trade unions.

* We were surely entitled to hope that the Federation would exercise them with a sense of responsibility.

* Before I turn to the record, let me say something about the men who exercise the dominant influence upon the Federation's policies.

* The key to the power of the Communists in the Federation lies in the three federal officers named, supported by the professed Communists in other executive positions; in the influence they can exert on Party members and sympathisers and others who will not or cannot take an independent line; and in the apparatus they and the Communist Party control.

* There is no doubt that the controllers of the Federation and the ports of Sydney and Melbourne know this only too well.

* There have been repeated refusals to resort to, and to abide by, the industrial relations committee's machinery - machinery set up, I remind the House, at the request of the Federation in 1963, endorsed by the membership in every port, and agreed to by the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* Unanimously, the A.C.T.U., the Federation, the employers, - the Authority and my Department agreed among other things on the setting up, in all ports, of industrial relations committees.

* The agreements were ratified by stopwork meetings of all branches of the Federation.

* In 1964 the Federation revived claims for a non-contributory industry pension and for a mechanisation fund, and early this year began to hold stoppages in support of these claims.

* They were told that the Federal Council of the Federation had directed that its officers were not to negotiate on any of the matters raised by the employers until they had given an answer to the Federation's two claims.

* The judge then offered to have the Commission consider the Federation's industrial and pension schemes.

* The Federation again refused to resort to the board of reference procedures for dealing with such disputes.

* When the Federation announced on 30th July its programme for direct action - and I want this to be noted - there was not one word about gang sizes.

* The climax came that day when the Federation announced its programme.

* In statements made on 30th July to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and to the Press, the Federation openly committed itself to a policy of direct action to secure what it wanted, and of rejection of arbitration.

* Mr. Docker, the Federation's Advocate, told  Mr. Justice  Gallagher that it did not propose to bring its claims to the Commission; that it had a complete lack of confidence in the probability of its claims succeeding before the Commission; that it would determine how it would act to secure its claims; and that even if all its industrial claims were granted frequent disputes could be expected until the industry was nationalised.

* In short, the Federation refused to take its claims to the Commission because it knew they had no merit.

* On 4th August, stopwork meetings, in all ports, generally endorsed the Federation's attitude as expressed to  Mr. Justice  Gallagher and the press, and decided on regular fortnightly stoppages.

* Meanwhile, on 13th August, the Federation, despite what it had to say about the Arbitration system a few days earlier, sought before  Mr. Justice  Gallagher in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the extension of the Commission's  li  per cent, margins decision to the Waterside Workers' Award.

* that the only circumstances under which the Federation would have a mandate from members to direct that the fortnightly stoppages should not take place would be if the employers indicated that they were willing to engage in bona fide negotiations about the claims the Federation had made.

* Yet seven days later,  Mr. Docker  told the same Judge -  the federal officers of the Federation have completed consultations with the members of the Federal Council.

* The reasons for the Federation's climb down are clear.

* First, the Communists and others in the Federation and Communist Party headquarters had become apprehensive about the Government's intentions - and rightly.

* Finally, the Federation had put itself out on a limb so far as the A.C.T.U.

* Later - this is a matter of common knowledge - the Federation sought 
A.C.T.U.

* The Interstate Executive stated that the Federation had broken A.C.T.U.

* This is how the Federation works.

* The Federation has not changed its strategy; it has merely changed its tactics.

* The General Secretary made it clear in a statement in Perth on 25th August that the Federation was not retreating.

* The Federation is simply biding its time.

* It represents the Government's considered conclusions after studying the activities of the Federation over the last 20 years and reviewing all that the Government has attempted in the past.

* They are not all attributable to the Federation.

* Part III relates particularly to the Federation.

* The Federation was first given the monopoly of recruitment, by statute, in 1947.

* When it fixed the quota, the Federation was to provide the required labour..

* In its 1950 and 1951 reports, the statutory authority referred to the failure of the Federation to honour its recruitment obligations.

* They described an appalling record of appeals to the Federation and frustrating delays in bringing the quotas up to strength.

* and the Federation, my predecessor deferred its introduction.

* In 1952,  Mr. Basten,  who made an investigation of the waterfront, reported that the Federation used its industrial strength to delay recruitment.

* It never became effective because in February 1955, the employers and the Federation agreed on a procedure to be followed, pending the report of the Tait Committee of Inquiry.

* Under this agreement, the Federation acknowledged that once the authority had fixed a quota, waterside workers should be registered with a minimum of delay, and that it would do everything possible to facilitate registration.

* The Tait Committee reported that the Federation on occasions impeded, and on occasions delayed, the filling of the quotas and even the raising of strengths to levels short of quotas.

* It left primary responsibility for recruitment with the Federation but provided that, if it failed in this, the statutory authority - that is the Stevedoring Industry Authority - should, after giving the Federation a last opportunity to do so, recruit itself.

* Since 1963, however, the Federation has again resorted to its old practices - that is, attempts to induce the Authority to reconsider its decisions about quotas and delaying tactics in supplying men.

* As well, the Federation opposed proposals that there should be continuous recruitment to keep the labour strength at the quota level.

* As one illustration only, when the authority sought 600 men in Sydney early last year, over 14,000 applications were distributed by the Federation.

* The Federation has been deluged with applications when it has been asked to recruit new labour - and when virtually every other industry in the country has been clamouring for labour and not getting it.

* This is one answer to the Federation's claims that waterside workers are badly off.

* Some of the men whose names were submitted were actually facing criminal charges when they were nominated by the Federation.

* The Federation cannot say that it is altogether unaware of what has been happening.

* Bitter protests have been made because of the Authority's endeavours to check the history of the Federation's nominees.

* The Federation has been given opportunity after opportunity to behave responsibly.

* This amendment has also been forced on us by the tactics of the Federation.

* Clause 10 will enable the Authority in future to conduct inquiries without being frustrated by delaying tactics by the Federation.

* A few weeks ago, the Federation committed itself to, and went ahead with, a policy of direct action.

* As I have pointed out, the Waterside Workers Federation owes the rights and privileges it possesses in respect of labour in the stevedoring industry to statutes of this Parliament.

* I refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which confers many rights and benefits on organisations registered under its provisions, and to the Stevedoring Industry Act which by specific designation confers on the Federation the special privileges it enjoys.

* Just as it was for the Parliament to legislate to enable the Federation to exist and function under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and to give it powers and rights under the Stevedoring Industry Act, so it is in the hands of Parliament to deprive the Federation of registration under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and of its powers under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* Let us assume the Federation is deregistered under the normal processes of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* The Federation must also be deprived of its privileges under the Stevedoring Industry Act.

* Secondly, because this Parliament has conferred special rights and privileges on the Federation it is right that the Parliament should consider and make special provision for the circumstances in which the Federation should lose those rights.

* In other words, no steps leading to the deregistration of the Federation, and loss of its rights under the Stevedoring Industry Act, should be taken unless a properly constituted tribunal finds that the circumstances are such as to warrant those steps.

* Clauses  16  and  17  authorise the Minister to ask the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in presidential session to make this investigation to determine whether the conduct of the Federation has been such as to justify deregistration action.

* In broad terms, the Commission must be satisfied that the conduct of the Federation, or a substantial number of its members, has prevented or hindered the achievement of an object of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; or overseas or interstate trade and commerce.

* Action by the Government depends on action by the Federation.

* They include cancellation of the Federation's registration, loss of all its rights and privileges under the Stevedoring Industry Act, loss of right to represent members of the Federation and termination of any leases the Federation has from the Commonwealth or the Stevedoring Industry Authority.

* Clause 21 makes provision for the registration of other trade unions on the waterfront in the event of the deregistration of the Federation.

* Upon a declaration the new union or unions would be given the powers the Federation now possesses, subject, of course, to clause 7 of the Bill.

* Whether there will ever arise the circumstances which demand resort to Part III depends entirely on the Federation - or more properly, on the decisions taken by those who are determining the Federation's fortunes - and in the long run on the attitude of the rank and file.

* This Bill is being introduced because of the activities of the Communist controllers of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The 1949 legislation was introduced because of the activities of the Communist controllers of the Miners' Federation.

* Today, the Australian community will expect the Opposition to be no less understanding of the threat to the nation posed by the Communists in and behind the Waterside Workers Federation.

* in reply - This morning, my colleague and friend from Bruce  (Mr. Snedden),  asked me a question about what can be called restrictive industrial practice; by the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union and the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Brown, and the Communist leader of the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria,  Mr. Young,  were deliberately trying to sabotage the system of industrial arbitration in this country and also were trying to form a combination of the transport unions, excluding the Transport Workers Union itself, which would have the effect of tying up the whole of the Australian industrial system.

* Similarly, too, the honorable member for Gellibrand  (Mr. Mclvor)  made a misstatement when he said that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia was willing to allow its members to work on Sundays.

* The Waterside Workers Federation refused to comply with that instruction.

* If the Australian Labour Party also believes in arbitration in these disputes, it should urge both the Victorian branch of the Australian Railways Union and the Waterside Workers Federation to abide by the decisions of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and go back to work.

* The smallness of Western Australia's population, the tremendous area of the State and the fact that it was talked into this **federation**, mean that at times Western Australia needs special consideration and special financial assistance from this Government.

* When the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland broke up in 1963, the Rhodesian people saw Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, and Nyasaland, now Malawi, achieve full independence and go straight into the Commonwealth Prime Minister's Conference as full sovereign bodies.

* Neither did Lord Monckton when, in 1960, he led the Monckton Commission into Rhodesia to examine the future of the Federation.

* I recently had sent to me a very informative leaflet distributed by the Victorian Employers Federation.

* It is a mid-week report produced by the Federation.

* The Federation cannot be said to support the Australian Labour Party.

* The Victorian Employers Federation is not a friend of the Labour Party but it is very upset about the efforts of the States to put their proposals before the new Northern Division.

* The Victorian Employers Federation also said - 
I heartily agree with that view.

* The Federation continued - 
The Federation is not satisfied with the Northern Division that has been created.

* The Federation is concerned at the sorry stateofaffairsinthenorthandhasundertaken to do something about development Itself.

* At one stage it was reported that the Federation was seeking some 9 million acres, but I believe the size of the area has been reduced to 100,000 acres.

* The Federation is willing to do some of the developmental work that should be the responsibility of the Government.

* Obviously, when the Federation's undertaking becomes established, it will be sold.

* Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, which will adopt any pretext it can to stage a strike in Australia and stop the free movement of goods.

* In this field, however, 1 must confess that the Australian **federation** has the advantage of the United States **federation**.

* In the whole question of domestic law, matters of succession, matrimonial causes, maintenance and custody, the United States **federation** suffers from much greater complexity and expense than Australia.

* Does he think the Graziers Federal Council of Australia, or the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, would object to having one more farmer or pastoralist on the committee?

* On the next two days - if my recollection holds good - the ship was not worked, but on the fourth day there was a complaint by the Waterside Workers Federation that Liverpool splices were being used and that they did not comply with the safety requirements of our navigation and safety laws.

* It is true, as the honorable gentleman said, that the fact that they were Liverpool splices was pointed out by representatives of the **federation**.

* The Minister then dealt with Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Proposals.

* Parliament ls after all the Grand Assize of the Australian nation and it is probably true to say that this is the first addressinreply debate since Federation in which a Prime Minister has not spoken.

* The extension of the bounty is strongly supported by the Australian Dairy Industry Council which represents the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalisation Committee Limited, and the Australian Dairy Produce Board, and also by the Processed Milk Manufacturers Association of Australia Limited.

* I remind the honorable gentleman that it was a Labour government which invited  Sir Otto  Niemeyer to this country together with Professor Gregory during the depression, and the most restrictive credit policy every pursued by any government in the whole 60 years of **federation** was adopted by a Labour government during the depression years.

* The union concerned is the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It was run again in 1959, and in 1960 it was again used by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It was used again in the election conducted by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The same unity ticket was used again in 1960, so it was used, I believe, for four years running, and in each of these four years this member of the Queensland central executive of the Labour Party has been a candidate for election to the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation and has had his name on a unity ticket with Communists.

* I thought that  Mr. Macmillan  accepted this when he said, in the same speech, that while European **federation** should be rejected, a confederation of European nations was an acceptable concept with which Great Britain could associate willingly and wholeheartedly.

* The distinction between the organic distribution of sovereignty which exists in a **federation** and the looser association of a confederation is one which I was personally at pains to make in our discussions with  Mr. Sandys.

* For where there is a common economic system established and made enforceable by law, the journey to confederation or even **federation** is half accomplished.

* The Communist influence is very significant in the Teachers' Federation in New South Wales.

* The only other **federation** that I can recall comparable in character to Australia would be the United States of America.

* If we take a similar view to that expressed by the honorable member for Barker  (Mr. Forbes),  we will have a situation in which we put **federation** before education.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, of course, is elected entirely by wheat growers.

* Similarly, the charges levelled at the Government about political pressure in relation to the quota system have been amply refuted by  Mr Price,  the Senior Vice-Chairman of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* He said: 
I would strongly refute that there has been any political pressure exerted on the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, either before the implementation of quotas or since their introduction.

* 1  share the hopes of the honorable member for Blaxland that the present secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation will be re-elected to his position at the union elections to be held, I think, early next year.

* Perhaps the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation will in the future gain greater prestige, a greater following and greater authority for his decisions.

* This point should be clear in the minds of members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and also of those people who look at the problem objectively, as does the honorable member for Blaxland.

* I.  Ellis, honorary secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioner's Federation, which represents 80,000 pensioners in Australia, wrote - 
The Federation denounced the 1965 Budget as a " death knell " Budget for pensioners, for we believe many will sicken and die for want of nourishing food, and from the worry in their old age, and infirmity, to cope with the business of living and meeting weekly commitments.

* Finally, I re-echo the sentiments of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation which said: 
It is time for a change.

* This Federation calls on all pensioners, their families, all those who desire a social welfare system of justice and equality to use the ballot box as their answer by putting all Government candidates last.

* If the details of this redistribution were fed into a computer the answer that would come out would be that this is the most scientific statutory gerrymander in the history of Australia since **federation**.

* Since Federation, there has been a marked increase in the authority of governments throughout the world and there have been constant threats in different parts of the world to individual freedoms, including freedoms of person, speech and assembly.

* The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side or the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* He referred to the New South Wales Teachers Federation as being Communist-dominated.

* As one who has been a member of that **federation** for some time, I say that I personally resent his remark, and I am sure that in so doing I speak for the 20,000 teachers in New South Wales who belong to the **federation** and who have a free choice in electing their executive officers.

* If there is any part of the policy of the New South Wales Teachers Federation which he can brand as being Communistinspired, I challenge him to name it.

* I suppose there is some resentment against the **federation** among some members of the Government parties because it has prodded the Government probably more than any of the many other community organizations that have been prodding the Government for at least the last eight years to give Commonwealth assistance to meet the urgent needs of education in the Australian States.

* This concept which has served him and all his distinguished and learned predecessors for 60 years of **federation** has been abandoned.

* He has emphasised that, in his view, the present arrangements for the functioning of the Court mean that the Court is not sufficiently accepted throughout Australia as the symbol of Commonwealth judicial power and, in this regard, as a symbol of Australian **federation**.

* I recently led a deputation from the coal-miners **federation** and the railways union to the Premier to try to find a solution to this problem.

* That places him in the very happy position of being able to obtain a panel of names from the Australian Primary Producers Union, from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation or from any other primary producers' organization that he chooses.

* Does  Mr. Nixon  now want to wriggle out of the specific undertaking made by the dairy industry to the 1960 Inquiry Committee and out of the equally specific and identical undertaking made by  Mr. E.  G. Roberts, the  President  of the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation, to the 1960 Inquiry Committee?

* Although the Commonwealth Government has to find the money the State governments have the power respecting this matter, lt is quite traditional that the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, when it negotiates in this matter with the Federal Government, seeks the best agreement that it can get for its members This is fair enough.

* the members of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation throughout Australia will be debating this statement.

* In fact, a meeting is being held in Western Australia at this time to debate the proposals made by the Government and by the Federation.

* The honorable member for East Sydney  (Mr. Devine)  raised a number of matters which I believed had been submitted to him by members of the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots.

* The petition was submitted by the New South Wales branch of the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and it referred to certain suggestions in relation to the operation of DC3 aircraft.

* Although the New South Wales branch had submitted the petition, within a matter of days a letter had been received from the Federation headquarters dealing with the same subject.

* Consequently we advised the branch that the reply would be sent through the Federation.

* lt was subsequently sent to the headquarters of the Federation in accordance with normal procedure.

* Some radical suggested at the time of the Federation conventions - I believe Quick and Garran refer to it - that the term had slipped through without delegates realising that it was the term given to Great Britain when it was ruled by Oliver and Richard Cromwell.

* Its father and mother were the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Mr. R. T. Curtis, State Secretary of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, which is a constituent body of the A.P.P.U., expressed the **federation**'s view in a letter to me and to my colleagues dated 26th March.

* To the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, this seems to be an inexplicable and tragic refusal to recognize facts.

* Many thousands of meat producers belong to the A.P.P.U., a fact that can be verified as the result of a recent survey carried out by reputable economic consultants - 
The Tasmanian Farmers Federation is a constituent part of the A.P.P.U.

* Did the reasons for the decision spell out the very poor record of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia in Sydney and Melbourne by, in fact, stating that the attitude of the **federation** to arbitration is, in the most expressive term used, " heads we win, tails you lose", because the **federation** refuses  to  take to arbitration any issue on which it is not confident of winning?

* Finally, what does the Waterside Workers Federation need to do to have the increased margins applied to the ports of Sydney and Melbourne?

* At the conference that was held between the authority, the Waterside Workers Federation and other interests concerned in running the waterfront, the authority agreed that it would not act under section 52a but would act under section 36 whenever that was practicable.

* When the States agreed, prior to 1900, to join in an indissoluble Federation they made it perfectly clear how the freedoms and liberties of the people of Australia were to be protected, and how the powers of legislation, administration and judiciary were to be delineated.

* Since Federation, therefore, no matter what government has been in power it has been commonly known that before a tax is imposed or expenditure is authorised a message must be presented to this House under the hand of the Governor-General and on the advice of the Government.

* No port in the Commonwealth of Australia has a better reputation for industrial peace than Port Lincoln has had since  Mr. Mortimer  has been secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation branch there.

* The 23,000 members of the Waterside Workers Federation have been calumniated and vilified.

* The members of the Waterside Workers Federation have their rights, just as the rest of us have, and their rights are being taken away.

* This 1 have found to be so as a member of the Australian Wheat Board, as  President  of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, as  president  of a farmers organisation and of course more lately as a member of this Parliament.

* In view of the Minister's bitter criticism on Tuesday last of members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia for their embargo on the loading and unloading of goods being shipped to and from South Africa, because of the apartheid policy of the Government of that country I ask: Does the Minister direct similar criticism at the political embargo by the United States of America on goods shipped to and from little Cuba?

* If this is how a Liberal State Minister and a Liberal Federal Minister treat each other in public, and if this is the way that the Federal Government treats a State Government in our **federation**, it gives us very little confidence in the way in which the Minister for Defence will deal with allies and in the goodwill that he can establish in territorial disputes arising in our neighbourhood.

* Dr. J.  R. Rees, director of the World Federation for Mental Health, has high praise for mental services in Victoria.

* It has the full support of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Federation has a special agreement with the Australian National Line under which the Line makes contributions towards, I think, the Federation's pension scheme.

* This has helped relationships between the Federation and the Australian National Line in no small measure.

* Two private companies have also made similar agreements with the Waterside Workers Federation under which, I understand, they pay  10  per cent, of the amount represented by total wages into a pension fund for waterside workers.

* On 28th September I asked the Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Mr. Freeth),  a question in this House as to whether there had been a conference between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian National Line with regard to the building and operation of two bulk ore carriers for our trade between Australia and Japan.

* I asked - 
Party will move in Committee, and he mentioned the sixth annual report which was presented to the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations by  Mr Arthur  Cowan, the General Manager of that organisation.

* When the General Manager of the Federation of Commercial Television Stations can boast of the commercial stations enjoying such a high percentage of the viewing audience and of having so many television sets in homes tuned to commercial stations for so many hours during the week it is time the Australian Broadcasting Commission did something about improving its programmes and increasing the size of its viewing audience.

* I suppose that in any **federation** the problem that is hardest of solution is how one can get a scheme that satisfies all the component parts in the Federal structure.

* As the Australian Government sees it, relations between the Federation of Malaysia and its constituent part, Sabah, are internal and domestic matters.

* The current Budget provides the greatest Commonwealth spending on national development that has ever occurred in the history of Federation.

* This Government is the first government in the history of this **federation** which has not only financed Commonwealth works out of revenue but also has provided out of revenue very substantial amounts - totalling, I think, in the neighbourhood of 800,000,000- for the capital works programmes of the States.

* The Queensland Colliery Employees Union, in common with the miners' **federation** throughout Australia, does not wish progress to be halted.

* What has the Federal Government done towards the proposal of the miners' **federation** that plant should be established for the processing of by-products from coal?

* In 1955, the miners' **federation** carried out research into the value of commodities being imported into Australia which were capable of being processed here from coal.

* One may well ask whether Federation is not likely to fall apart.

* Federation has had a few bumps, but it has worked very effectively.

* As to the substance of the honorable member's question, the Stevedoring Industry Authority has power, when the Waterside Workers Federation refuses to live up to its statutory obligations, to recruit labour.

* What has happened over the years is that when port quotas have not been filled, or when there has been an intention to increase or decrease quotas, the Authority has discussed the problems with the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But, as I pointed out in the House the other night, the Waterside Workers Federation is continually guilty of using frustrating tactics, lt is for this reason, amongst others, that we are determined that the Federation will no longer have the right of recruitment, and that this will be given to a statutory authority established by this Parliament.

* In our view, therefore, the obvious intention of the founders of our **federation** was that the right to initiate money bills, and the power to control expenditure, were to rest with the House of Representatives, because only this House has the power to make or unmake governments.

* I feel justified in saying, too, on behalf of the Opposition, that had this feeling in the United Kingdom been more generally recognized at the time when our **federation** was formed, the powers which the Senate now possesses might have been curtailed by our Constitution.

* [Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Amendment (No.

* That, in these Proposals - " Collector" have the same meaning as in the Customs Act 1901-1959; " Federation goods " mean goods that - 
are entered for home consumption on or after the twenty-ninth day of April, One thousand nine hundred and sixty, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Australian Capital Territory; " the Customs Tariff" mean the Customs Tariff 1933-1959; " the Federation " mean the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

* That, for the purposes of the definition of " Federation goods " in the last preceding paragraph, goods shipped at the port of Lourenco Marques or the port of Beira in Portuguese East Africa for export to Australia be deemed to have been shipped in the Federation for export to Australia if there is produced to the Collector a certificate in writing signed by an officer of Customs in the service of the Government of the Federation certifying that the country of origin of the goods is the Federation.

* That, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, the rate or rates of duty set out in the column headed " British Preferential Tariff " in the Schedule to the Customs Tariff in relation to an item in that Schedule the number of which is specified in column 1 of the Schedule to these Proposals apply to Federation goods - 
That item nineteen in the Schedule to the Customs Tariff have effect, in relation to Federation goods, as if each rate of duty set out in relation to that item in the column headed " British Preferential Tariff " in that Schedule were reduced by Nine pence per pound.

* Mr. Chairman, the tariff proposals which I have tabled relate to proposed amendments of the Customs Tariff 1933-1959, the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1934-1959, the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1959, the Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) 1956-1958, and the Excise Tariff 1921-1959.

* Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Proposals No.

* 1 re-introduces the changes which were placed before this committee on 19th November last year following a review of the trade agreement between Australia and the Rhodesian Federation.

* In re-introducing these amendments opportunity has been taken to consolidate all provisions of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference Tariff into this proposal.

* All I want to do is to refer to evidence that was submitted by the Airline Pilots Federation of Australia in 1965.

* Can the Minister inform the House of the attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation towards the A.C.T.U.

* Has the **federation** taken any action in this matter?

* The Waterside Workers Federation is one of the most disciplined organizations in the community.

* I hope to be able to describe the democratic nature of the structure of the Waterside Workers Federation later on.

* Honorable members opposite may rest assured that in this instance the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has the unqualified support of the political side of the Labour movement and the unqualified support of the trade union movement as a whole.

* We believe in a **federation** of States, each having sovereign rights and being able to determine what it will do with its railway system.

* Mr. Warren  McDonald, the  chairman  of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, when speaking to the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies in Victoria in March, 1963, pleaded for an immediate housing survey by the Commonwealth.

* He said - 
They attacked the Federal Government for not having given adequate consideration to their requests made through the Australian Wheatgrowers' Federation and State bodies.

* I remind honorable members that Labour has held office for fifteen of the 63 years that have elapsed since **federation**, but during those fifteen years it made no attempt to construct a railway from Alice Springs to Birdum.

* Has he received a request from the Western Australian Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations asking the Federal Government to establish a commission of inquiry into Australia's primary and secondary education needs?

* They were prepared to meet representatives of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation in Melbourne for further discussions .

* The conference of the wool section of the Farmers Union passed a resolution in the following terms: - 
Conference emphatically rejects the proposals to contribute increased levies for wool promotion until the implementation of  a  marketing Reserve Price Plan and instructs its delegates to the forthcoming Federation Conference to strongly oppose extension beyond June, 1962, of the increase of 5s.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation as a whole opposed the levy, and still opposes it, just as it opposed the recommendations of the committee of inquiry.

* There is a wide range of possibilities, from regular conferences of leaders and Ministers at one end of the scale - an ad hoc rather than a structural association - to a full-blooded European **federation** at the other.

* What we have sought to make clear is that if Great Britain went in, and if in the course of time the extended European Economic Community became a European political community with the structure of a **federation**, the nature of the present Commonwealth would be clearly and materially changed.

* For, as we know, a **federation** distributes sovereignty between the central or federal authority and the member states.

* In short, if Great Britain eventually became a member state in a European **federation** - I do not say this will happen - she would no longer be sovereign as the other Commonwealth countries are.

* I believe that we, as a not unimportant member of the Commonwealth, would answer that question, as I have tried to answer it in England myself, by saying that United Kingdom membership of an actual European **federation**, involving the great change in the Commonwealth to which I have referred, would be a mistake.

* Whether such a rule of international law already existed at the time of **federation** is a matter of speculation.

* If this ideal is to be fulfilled, we must take steps to remove the legislation which discriminates against aborigines and has discriminated against them ever since **federation** in 1901.

* I would like to remind the House of the words of a hymn written by one of the authors of **federation**,  Sir Robert  Garran.

* A few weeks ago I discussed it with officers of the Miners Federation.

* Was there any provision in that Bill that anyone on behalf of the Government should consult the Waterside Workers Federation, or even the Australian Council of Trade Unions?

* On the other hand, in that Stevedoring Industry Bill, which was produced one day and required to be debated the next and passed before the end of the week - not a matter that was stretched out over five years and nine months - there was provision to take out of existence the Waterside Workers Federation and substitute another organisation designed by the Government in its place.

* Did the Minister hesitate to support the Stevedoring Industry Bill because the Government had not consulted with the Waterside Workers Federation?

* Did he ask for a referendum of the Waterside Workers Federation before the Government introduced the Stevedoring Industry Bill?

* During the hearing,  Mr. Docker,  who represented the Waterside Workers Federation, gave the commission an assurance that if the **federation**'s claim was granted in substance, the **federation** would discourage to the utmost of its ability any tendency on the part of its branches to conduct unauthorized stopwork meetings.

* The history of the industry shows that, since being able to hold eight authorized stop-work meetings a year, branches of the Waterside Workers Federation in numerous ports have either held meetings in excess of this number or have held unauthorized meetings without notice.

* For how much longer can we go on trusting the words of the Waterside Workers Federation and believing that it will do as it says it will do?

* As the honorable member for Bruce  (Mr. Snedden)  pointed out so clearly to-night, these stoppages do not cost the average member of the Waterside Workers Federation anything because if the work is not done to-day as the result of a stoppage,, it is banked up and has to be done to-morrow and often overtime is incurred.

* We have seen how a branch of the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company Limited had to go out of business because it could no longer bear the costs that had been imposed on the industry by the members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Only when the members of the **federation** work themselves out of a job completely will the cost of their actions be evident to them, and that position is beginning to appear just as it did in the coal-mining industry a few years ago.

* The general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Healy,  has talked about productivity and has said that there has been a 30 per cent, increase in productivity over the past few years.

* I am glad that the Waterside Workers Federation realizes the value of productivity.

* First of all, the cost to the Waterside Workers Federation of a nation-wide stoppage will be 20,000 times 4 16s.

* If the community has to bear a cost of 1,000,000, surely it is reasonable to expect the Waterside Workers Federation to accept its share of the responsibility and also of the cost.

* As I am reminded, in such a case the **federation** would have been responsible for a stoppage that was completely unauthorized and for which there was absolutely no need, because appropriate machinery is available to the **federation**, and it can have resort to it if it so desires.

* The honorable member for Mackellar has chosen to attack the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* Apparently there is  a  Liberal Party ticket in the Federation's elections.

* There is a strong effort by the Liberal Government in New South Wales to protect itself against justified attacks by the Teachers Federation for lis failure to carry out a policy on which it .vas partly elected at the last State election.

* Of course, on that commission then: would probably be representatives of the Teachers Federation.

* So there have been consistent efforts, by the honorable member for Mackellar in particular, to smear the Federation and to try to reduce its status in the community so that its justifiable criticisms of the New South Wales Government will not be listened to.

* There is no doubt that the Liberal Party is attempting to take over the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* I also have no doubt that, even if its candidates happened to be acceptable to the general body of the Federation, the support of them by the honorable member for Mackellar would be the most serious handicap that they would have to bear.

* The facts are that the New South Wales Teachers Federation has a very democratic structure.

* The Teachers Federation has a very good record as an organisation.

* In 1962 the General Secretary of the International Transport Federation -  Mr. Pieter  de Vires - was in Australia.

* I think it is common knowledge that unions such as the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the Miners Federation, the Blacksmiths Society of Australia, the Boilermakers Society of Australia and the Sheet Metal Workers Union, if not under Communist control, are at least subject to very great Communist influence.

* Charlie Morgan was a solicitor of the New South Wales Supreme Court from 1920 and in his early days he was legal adviser to the Miners Federation on the south coast of New South Wales.

* More industrial goodwill was created around the conference table between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the stevedoring employers and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority than was ever created earlier in our history.

* The union and the Australian Council of Trade Unions did not raise the question of loss of holiday pay for Anzac Day, but the Opposition is now trying to create a ground upon which again the Communists within the Sydney branch of the **federation**- 

 I must spend a few words to explain this last point.

* When the then pilotsassociation found the Arbitration Court, as it then was, and later the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, were unprepared to award what they sought, the association was replaced by the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, a body outside the arbitration system.

* For years, relationships between the pilots' association and later the Federation and the airlines were in a pretty constant state of ferment.

* The Government, however, took the view that an effort should be made to get a voluntary agreement between the airline operators and the pilots' Federation which would set down agreed means of settling industrial problems.

* The 
Agreement on Industrial Relationships Procedures was signed by Qantas Airways Ltd, Trans Australia Airlines, Ansett-ANA, MacRobertson-Miller Airlines and EastWest Airlines and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, and it was to operate for 3 years from September 1965.

* The Federation undertook to suspend the right to strike or to impose any other limitation upon work while a matter was under negotiation or enquiry in accordance with the procedures, and until the expiry of a period of 7 days after conclusion of the conference action to which I have referred.

* I emphasise that this Agreement was voluntarily entered into and, indeed, reflected in its essentials the previously expressed wishes of the Federation.

* In these circumstances it was not unreasonable to assume that there would be no further trouble of any consequence between the pilots' Federation and the airlines.

* In mid-1966 when the procedures were employed in the negotiation of a new contract between the pilots' Federation and the domestic airline operators, agreement was reached - under, I add, threat of immediate strike action - which gave substantial salary increases and improved conditions for domestic pilots.

* Then the Federation became involved in a dispute with Qantas.

* In short, the Federation repudiated, in a little more than a year, the Agreement they had negotiated and signed.

* I refer to the term which provided that four listed matters and negotiations for a new contract between Qantas and the Federation were to be handled by a committee consisting of equal numbers of representatives of Qantas and the Federation with an independent neutral  chairman  to be appointed by agreement of the parties, and failing that by me.

* I am glad to say that, under the chairmanship of  Sir Leslie  Melville, agreement was recently reached between Qantas and the Federation, but not without threats by the latter's representatives of direct action and of walk out from the conferences when matters were raised of which those representatives disapproved.

* I have to put it that way because, despite the agreement reached last July between the domestic airlines and the pilots' Federation, which gave considerable increases in salaries to the pilots and gave them the North American type agreement they wanted, at this very moment, both TAA and Ansett-ANA are once more being confronted by the Federation.

* To try to get its way, the Federation is prepared to disrupt operations by restricting the hours the pilots will fly.

* It is of no consequence to the Federation that, once again, the public would be the sufferer.

* We hoped that, with the new contract to operate from last July between the domestic operators and the Federation, there would be peace in the domestic airlines.

* I want to point out that under the 1965 procedures Agreement, to which the Federation was a party, the steps were negotiation, mediation, inquiry and conference.

* In the case of the terms of settlement of the Qantas strike, to which the Federation was also party, the steps were negotiation, mediation and arbitration, i.e., essentially the same as the normal processes under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* Put another way, the Bill is framed to provide for these very processes of conciliation, mediation and arbitration to which the Federation earlier agreed.

* As I have already indicated, the pilots' Federation by its own decision placed itself outside the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* The Commonwealth, indeed, has been undertaking a large number of activities which, for the greater part of our history as a Federation, were not considered to be Commonwealth responsibilities.

* There is the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, to which my friend from Riverina  (Mr. Roberton)  would belong, and running parallel to it, representing almost identical groups of growers, is the body known in the federal sphere as the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Under the heading "Australian Road Federation ", it said - 
The Federation holds that Australia's roads problem will never be solved until it is attacked as  a  nation and not by  a  collection of States.

* As to what the cost may be, the Australian Road Federation has a comforting slogan - 
 No; two organizations waited on the Minister, the Graziers Federal Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Is there Communist control or influence in the Waterside Workers Federation, Sir?

* The Federation itself consists of 22,000 members who are spread throughout Australia.

* However, the Federation has five permanent office bearers, three of whom are Communists.

* One of the distressing things is that the Federal Council of the Federation, either by its own wishes or because it has no power, seems impotent and unable to control the branches of the Federation.

* Let us look at the Melbourne Branch of the Federation.

* He is not a member of the Waterside Workers Federation, but he may be a Communist."

* One of the complexities is a legal one, that is, that at the time of Federation the States referred certain rights to the Federal Government.

* The NSW Teachers' Federation said yesterday a survey has shown that more than 35,000 children in NSW State schools are being taught in classes of more than 40.

* These funds are paid to the claimant States of Western Australia and Tasmania for disabilities under Federation and to enable them to discharge their responsibilities on somewhat equal terms with the principal States of the Commonwealth.

* I put it to the House that it would be impossible to consider the problems of Western Australia and Tasmania without having regard to the overall problem of Commonwealth and State relationships and the condition of all States of the Federation.

* The capacity of the States to discharge their duties to the people of those States is a matter that is interwoven with the whole principle of Federation.

* Since Federation, and certainly since the uniform taxation system has been in operation, I doubt whether the representatives of the States have ever left any Premiers' Conference satisfied that they have received fair treatment.

* This affects the State Governments' and their position in Federation.

* It is a matter for gratification that Malaya, the State of Singapore and the former colonies of Sarawak and North Borneo have been united into a **federation**.

* First, the Federation of Malaysia was achieved by constitutional procedures, and secondly, the basis of government is to be democratic - that is, it is to be based on the popular will as expressed by the ballot of the people.

* There is, however, another aspect associated with the advent of the Federation of Malaysia.

* This new Federation of Malaysia should be able to establish with Australia the kind of mutual relationship that we have with New Zealand, our nearest neighbour in the Commonwealth of Nations.

* The new **federation** accomplishes another vital objective in securing to its people the right of self-determination.

* Surely this is a matter on which the peoples of the countries of the Federation of Malaysia alone are the best judge.

* His  willingness to attend two summit conferences in Tokyo and Manila, and his agreement to submit certain matters to examination by the United Nations and to defer the date of proclaiming the new **federation** constitute an impressive gesture of good faith and are evidence of a wish to be on friendly terms with neighbouring nations.

* The honourable member for Chisholm  (Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)  suggested that we want a parliament of man and a **federation** of the world.

* I would not advise any country to join the Australian Federation.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation- 
The Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement was a threat to the standards of living of  thousands  of Australian dairymen,  President  of ,he Australian Da ry Farmers' Federation,  Mr. C.  S. J. Conroy, said in Brisbane last week.

* Some of these farmers are agisting their stock on other parts of the island where assistance is being given by other farmers through the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* Yesterday the Interstate Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions did consider some resolutions from, among others, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, that industrial action should be -taken as a protest against the Government's decision to send troops and equipment to South Vietnam.

* and the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition will lead to a somewhat more responsible attitude by some branches of the Waterside Workers Federation and will lead to a moderation of its policy of holding up the movement of supplies and equipment on any pretext that it can possibly find.

* As I said earlier to-day we have only to read the speech of the vice-president of the All China Federation of Trade Unions to the World Federation of Trade Unions Conference held in Peking, at the beginning of June when he said that war was a necessary part  of  the Communist policy  to  find proof of that.

* Make no mistake about it, this new type of processed pea is a direct and serious threat to the Australian frozen pea industry, and both the Canning Pea Growers Association and the Tasmanian Farmers Federation consider that the protection being afforded the local product, far from being reduced, should be increased.

* Other representations have been made by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation from its headquarters in Launceston and from one of the very active branches at Ulverstone on the north-west coast.

* I have before me a telegram from the Tasmanian Farmers Federation which indicates clearly the concern felt by that body and its opposition to the New ZealandAustralia Free Trade Agreement.

* Tasmanian Farmers Federation strongly support protests and exclusion agricultural commodities from agreement.

* The Federation publishes a weekly paper, the "Tasmanian Farmer".

* The editorial in the issue of Thursday, 12th August, is headed " Victimisation ", and includes one or two important and illuminating paragraphs which I think should be put on record - 
The protest by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation directs attention to the plight of the small farmers, who, the Federation maintains, even now are in economic difficulties.

* In the 63 years of Australian **federation** Labour has been in office for only a little more than fifteen years.

* In fact, crime prevention bulked much larger in State budgets at the time of Federation than the expenditures which now bulk most largely in their budgets, such as education and health.

* I quote the following extract from the evidence given by  Mr. E.  G. Roberts, the respected  president  of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation - 
Then the honorable gentleman said, " We have passed resolutions on it".

* In 1958, when I produced a photostat copy of correspondence that had passed between the Queensland central executive of the Labour Party and members ot the Waterside Workers Federation, what did the then Leader of the Opposition say on that occasion?

* One of the most striking, of course, was the victory by Fitzgibbon in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Fitzgibbon managed to get through the Waterside Workers Federation executive a recommendation on a pensions scheme.

* He then took it to the next body of the Waterside Workers Federation and his recommendation was tossed over because the resurgence of communism within that union is at a less sophisticated level.

* Of this amount, the Waterside Workers Federation has paid only 4,500, for offences committed in 1963.

* In view of the fact that the Amalgamated Engineering Union incurred fines totalling 7,550, that the Federated Ironworkers' Association was fined 4,050, and that the Australasian Society of Engineers was fined 3,500 for 12 offences, will the Minister state whether the Government is planning oppressive legislation against these unions similar to that which was directed at the Waterside Workers Federation and pushed through this Parliament a fortnight ago?

* two persons to represent the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation; 
one person to represent the Australian Dairy Farmers' Federation; 
If the right honourable member will allow me to speak I will try to inform him a little.

* Last year lengthy negotiations were carried out with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the State governments for the purpose of formulating a new stabilisation scheme.

* After the Wheatgrowers Federation had agreed to have a home consumption price, this price then had to be negotiated with the States.

* The question of feed wheat has been examined by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* I believe that the Federation met yesterday in Melbourne.

* At the meeting the Federation was to consider many aspects of the wheat industry.

* One of the most important matters the Federation was to look at was the domestic price for feed wheat.

* I should like to preface it by advising the House that on making a request for an admission ticket for the Speaker's Gallery this morning, I was questioned by a member of your staff, no doubt acting on your instructions, about the identity of the friend for whom I requested the ticket and was asked whether he was a member of the deputation from the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia which is now visiting Canberra.

* Has the Australian Wheat Growers Federation accepted the scheme?

* Today we have a bank overdraft rate of  lb  per cent., the highest bank overdraft rate since Federation.

* Certainly, the provision made by this Government at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council and at the Premiers' Conference earlier this year put the States in the strongest position they have been in as a whole since **federation**.

* All these actions taken together have produced in the aggregate a volume of governmental expenditure by the States which is an all-time record in the history of **federation**.

* But the speech which the -Leader of the Opposition made last week in his attack on inflation must rank as the most irresponsible of any leader since **federation**, 60 years ago.

* The most recent published report of the Australian Educational Council was the report for 1963 which was printed not by this Government but by the New South Wales Teachers' Federation as a pamphlet called 'Some Needs of Australian Education'.

* In spite of the Government's failure to stabilize the economy, it is safe to say that no other government since **federation** has ever enjoyed such favorable conditions for governing.

* The three principles of judgment used have been as follows: First, what disadvantage has a State suffered by being part of a **federation**?

* There have been a number of studies which indicate that Australia has less inequality between the various parts of the **federation** than any other **federation** in the world or any other country in the world which has distinct economic regions.

* I suggest for a number of reasons that the Commission's activities should be widened, that it should be known as the States Fiscal Equalisation Commission, that it should be given the duty of measuring standards as between all States of the Commonwealth, including the Australian Capital Territory, and that it should make grants appropriate to the various parts of the **federation** so as to equalise the standards in terms of the principles of fiscal equalisation.

* Here you find the fundamental division that exists within the Labour Party and has existed since **federation**.

* Excluding one or two of them such as, for example,  Mr. Charles  Oliver of New South Wales, I ask: Where, in this conference which was largely dominated by nondescript trade union members, do you find any of the great leaders  of  such great trade unions in this country as the vehicle builders union, the clerks union and the ironworkers **federation**.

* We are the only **federation** in the world which has succeeded in doing this.

* Not only did we have to get the support of all Australian governments but "the support of their Parliaments in order to pass this legislation which is a milestone in any **federation** in the world.

* Apparently all governments from the time of Federation have been  in  error in assuming that large enterprises or factories necessarily prefer the city areas.

* We cannot achieve any improvement in any field of transport in our Federation, any more than it can be achieved in the American Federation or in any other trading and industrial country, without the initiative of the national Government.

* The honorable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr. Birrell)  was formerly an official of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia and he could tell honorable members that there is not one Communist on the Federal Executive or any executive of the Union.

* This afforded the United Kingdom the right to maintain in the Federation of Malaya naval, land and air forces including a Commonwealth Strategic Reserve.

* By an Exchange of Letters with the Federation of Malaya which took place in March and April 1959, it was confirmed that the various provisions of the Agreement applicable to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve, which included Australian Forces, and in particular the provisions dealing with the status of forces, should apply in respect of these Australian Forces.

* I subsequently announced that, following discussions between the Minister for Health, representatives of the cigarette manufacturing industry and the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, a voluntary code of cigarette advertising on television win be introduced by the Federation on 1st January 1966.

* But three members of the " progressive "' section of the Waterside Workers Federation; visited Port Douglas and in no time disputes.

* The obvious intention of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation is to cause as much disruption as they possibly can.

* I do not want to bring the question of communism into the debate again, but I am afraid that it is tied up with the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I think the Labour Party has a good deal of sympathy for the Waterside Workers Federation, because I believe it suffers considerable embarrassment at the hands of its Communist friends.

* The Australian Teachers Federation held its 48th annual conference in Brisbane in January 1968.

* Bearing in mind that the State Ministers for Education meet as they do, that they invite the Federal Minister for Education and Science to their meetings, that they have produced a document entitled 'Some Needs of-Education', and our constitutional set-up which, despite what the honourable member -for Wills might say, leaves the basic responsibility for education with the States, I would have thought that an education commission such as that advocated by the Australian Teachers Federation and supported substantially in the same terms by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition would lead to confusion rather than solve problems of education.

* Both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Teachers Federation have a Cyclopean approach to Federal assistance for school libraries.

* I can demonstrate clearly this sort of approach to Federal assistance to school libraries that is needed by referring to the motion adopted at the 48th conference of the Australian Teachers Federation.

* Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  himself pointed to the need for careful and slow change when he said that since **federation**, and as the result of two wars, the High Court of Australia had ruled that the defence .power meant a lot more in peacetime now than it once did.

* It has been my conviction over many years of study of this subject that the Commonwealth Parliament, within the confines of our present Constitution, does indeed possess all the powers essential to the proper functioning of a **federation** of Australia if - and I emphasize the word " if " - some of the curses and stupidities of the interplay of party politics do not interfere.

* It is my understanding that the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has already submitted to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority the names of men who have applied to be registered under the Stevedoring Industry Act and that the desire is that the port strengths at both Sydney and Melbourne be brought up to the official quotas.

* The honorable member made an outstanding statement about  Mr, Fitzgibbon,  who is General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* He said that in negotiations with employers,  Mr. Fitzgibbon  was not game to reach a decision and had to go back to the Federal Council of the Federation for instructions.

* During this debate almost every Government supporter who has spoken has tried to show to those listening, and to those to whom they send copies of " Hansard ", that trouble in industry in Australia comes only from the few Communists who have some say in running the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It is designed to deregister and smash the Waterside Workers Federation at any time that the Minister feels so inclined and to replace it with a Government sponsored union.

* Finally, when this Bill becomes law, particularly if the Government pursues its present course to its final conclusion - the deregistration and breaking up of the Waterside Workers Federation - industrial troubles not only on the waterfront but throughout Australia will really begin.

* In these times of relatively full employment, no matter what happens the present work force on the Australian waterfront will still by far constitute the majority of men employed in the industry, and their sincerity, courage and magnificent trade union principles will prevail whether or not the Federation, as we know it is smashed.

* The members of the Waterside Workers Federation immediately demanded that the number of men working on the wool stack should be increased from two to three.

* As would be expected, the arbitrator found against the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Before the dispute had concluded, although it involved only a relatively few men at the outset, 571 members of the Waterside Workers Federation suffered suspension.

* To show to what lengths the shipowners will go in order to defeat the legitimate requests of the Waterside Workers Federation and what extreme provocation is offered to the men in these matters, I point out that the shipowners then had the truck taken elsewhere.

* Let me tell the Minister, because it is not only the waterside workers who are involved, that he always tries to get away from the real issues in respect of these disputes by saying that they are deliberately engineered by the Communist officials of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I have since been informed that the exservicemen members of the Waterside Workers Federation have now sought the co-operation and assistance of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia.

* The non-Federal jurisdiction of the State Courts relates to appeals direct to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council before Federation.

* At the time the honorable member for Mackellar presented the Illawarra Cup to the Waterside Workers Federation at Wollongong was he a Communist?

* The two organizations which the government proposes to have represented on the selection committee will have complete control over membership of the committee and over the appointment of future members, whether they be representatives of the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation or the National Farmers Union.

* We would like to see them have an opportunity to get on the committee and not face this problem outlined in the constitution of the committee where separately and individually each one of those two members - the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Wool and Meat Producers Federation - will have the power of veto over membership on the selection committee.

* I recall earlier in the afternoon the honorable member for Moore  (Mr. Maisey)  saying that perhaps members of the Australian Primary Producers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation might be nominated.

* As I said earlier, I do not advocate representation by any particular organization, be it the Australian Primary Producers Union, the National Farmers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* I would desire to see Papua and New Guinea united and continue in unity, but not if this is going to lead to the kind of disaster that occurred in various parts of the world and where the West Indies Federation, the Central African Federation and Nigeria have fallen apart after the withdrawal of the Imperial Crown, with the withdrawal of colonial authority.

* It is quite true, as the Master Builders' Federation of Australia pointed out earlier this year, that the housing sector of the building construction industry cannot bc separated from the remainder of the economy in overall budget planning, but it is not in the best interests of either the housing sector itself or the economy as a whole for housing to be submerged and lost sight of amongst other interests.

* As to finance, I agree with the points made by the Federation, when it said - 
We feel the proper authority to establish finance quotas for the different sources of finance-  1 take it the Federation is referring to savings banks, life assurance organisations and the Commonwealth Government -  is the Federal Housing Department and not the Federal Treasury.

* The time is long past for the implementation of some of the suggestions of the Master Builders Federation to provide for a well planned policy for housing in this country.

* The meat market development provisions of this bill are based on joint proposals which were submitted by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australia Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* The Australian Meat Board Selection Committee referred to above is not a statutory authority and was constituted jointly by the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation on the 27th February, 1964, for the purpose of this legislation.

* It consists at present of nine members comprising four each from the council and the **federation** and an independent chairman.

* The importance of having commercial representation has been recognized in the proposed legislation but it was considered that the **federation**'s request for equal producerexporter representation could not be justified in a situation where the costs of the board's operations will be met entirely from funds provided by producers.

* The Government has also received representations for membership of the board for representatives of public utilities and of producer organizations such as the Australian Primary Producers Union and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation have received full consideration by the Government but it is the Government's policy that the meat board should not be an organizational board.

* How many sittings of the House of Repre sentatives have occurred in each half-year since **federation**?

* If it has not, and if it decides to implement that section in which it is proposed that an Australian wool industry commission or authority be set up to handle marketing, &amp;c, will the Australian Primary Producers Union be invited to be represented, along with the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, in view of the fact that this union has in its membership 25,000 growers of wool and the other two organizations a total of 68,000?

* It made one hopeful that at some time we might arrive at Tennyson's **federation** of the world and parliament of man.

* It maintains the principle of Australia's established immigration policy which has been endorsed by all governments since Federation.

* The term was invented about 40 years before Federation.

* Let it not be said that because we belong to the Labor Party we are interested only in the Waterside Workers Federation and union affairs.

* He might even have been presumed to have read yesterday's " Sydney Morning Herald ", and in particular the letter to the editor by Jim Healy, the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, who pointed out what he found 'objectionable in the legislation.

* If that is divided among the 20,000 members of the Waterside Workers Federation it comes to 6d.

* Is he able to say whether the New South Wales Branch of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots adopted a resolution on 3rd February 1969 authorising letters to be written to each airline company informing them of the names  of  pilots who are not members of the Federation and advising the companies that the Federation would have no objection if the companies terminated their services first even if they may not bethe most junior pilots?

* If this has occurred what is his attitude to the action taken by the Federation and how does this action compare with the Government's attitude to compulsory unionism?

* Although Canada is a **federation**, its financial relationships with the Provinces are different from the Commonwealth's financial relationships with the States of Australia.

* The shipping industry is one that has been considerably maligned by honorable mem bers opposite, and also by the Communist hierarchy in the Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* He was the visiting secretary of the Transport Workers Federation in Great Britain, which has an affiliated membership of 7,000,000.

* One of the unions that must puzzle him most is the Waterside Workers Federation.

* No doubt the European Common Market will lead to a **federation** of European states ultimately.

* It is true that once any country joins the European Common Market and the **federation**, it instantly loses sovereignty over the question of: tariffs..

* Clearly, if we believe what  the- 
Minister said, it will be wellnigh impossible for Australia to sell agricultural products inside the European **federation**.

* Wa have it on the assurance of the New South Wales Teachers Federation that no fewer than 27 additional high schools, which have been planned and the construction of which has been abandoned, will be needed when the secondary schools re-open in 1967.

* I refer again to the pamphlet entitled " 1965 Survey of Secondary Schools " prepared by the Teachers Federation of New South Wales- 
I feel very strongly about this matter, because these insidious statements, attributing money shortages solely to the Commonwealth Government, continually tend, to break down our federal system.

* But while the States do not have these taxing powers, statements that are made by honorable members opposite merely tend to break down our **federation**, and ultimately to result in unification, which is, after all, the policy of socialist parties.

* The position there is similar to our own in that Canada is a **federation** with ten Provinces.

* I have no wish to engage in any display of creaking provincialism, but this is a **federation** and when one unit in a **federation** is to be exposed to attack I think it is befitting and entirely proper that that unit should be defended.

* This is obviously an important development because it also means that in future the Commonwealth Grants Commission will consider the **federation** as a whole.

* First, that Australia will receive no help whatever from the United States when the Dictator Soekarno launches his expected attack on East New Guinea - second, that the United States is now committed to a policy of " non-involvement " in any development arising from the formation of a Malaysian Federation.

* The Government of the Federation of Malaya has announced that the emergency which has been in force for twelve years, will officially end on 31st July, 1960, and the Emergency Regulations be repealed at the same time.

* When Malaya became an independent member of the Commonwealth in September, 1957, arrangements were agreed between the Governments of the Federation of Malaya and the United Kingdom, with which the Governments of Australia and New Zealand were associated, for the continued stationing of Commonwealth Forces in Malaya after independence.

* Since then, Australian forces have remained in Malaya as part of the British Commonwealth Strategic Reserve and with the agreement of the Federation Government.

* A number of amendments to the Constitution of the Federation of Malaya were approved by the Parliament of that country on 25th April.

* A copy of the amendments as they appeared in the Federal Government Gazette of the Federation of Malaya dated 31st March, 1960, is available in the Library.

* I have heard members of the Government attacking officials of the Waterside Workers Federation; and it might be interesting for me to quote one paragraph from the report of the committee of inquiry into the stevedoring industry, which was presented on 7th March, 1959.

* Moreover, they did not take the opportunity of cross-examining  Mr. Healy  when he gave evidence for the Federation on the question of disputes and stoppages, nor did they cross-examine  Mr. Cullen  who presented the statistical information on behalf of the Board.

* There have been cases of a dispute on one ship when the Waterside Workers Federation has appealed to the stevedoring companies and the stevedoring authority to isolate the dispute on that ship and let the rest of the port go on working, but when the men have walked off that ship the authority has continually called on additional waterside workers, expecting them to take the jobs vacated by the men involved in the dispute.

* The Minister said that the Government was not asked for this legislation by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Of course it was not asked for it by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Does he not know that as a result the shipowners have saved 1.000,000 in wages, and that between 1954-55 and 1959-60 the membership of the Waterside Workers Federation has been reduced by 4,768.

* The Waterside Workers Federation was encouraged to open its membership books.

* Honorable members will recall that, in this Parliament, the Waterside Workers Federation was criticized because it would not open its books, and it was claimed that there was a shortage of waterside workers.

* The **federation** subsequently opened the books and admitted large numbers of new members to the industry.

* But this principle, which has been accepted by the trade union movement, is now to be destroyed by the Government and the reason given is that it is offering some benefit to the older members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The **federation**, for some time past, with the approval of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, has had what is called a disability list.

* We will arrange for the Waterside Workers Federation to call a mass meeting of the members.

* This is an Herculean task, and its increasing magnitude can only be measured by a consideration of the growth in our federal expenditure, decade by decade, during the first 60 years of **federation**.

* That agreement makes provision for the maintenance of Australian forces in the Malayan Federation within the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve, which is the particular structure.

* The Government of the Federation continues to be faced by a campaign of armed Communist terrorism within its borders.

* On August 1, 1960, an Internal Security Act came into force which empowers the Malayan Government to deal with the risks to internal security presented by the threat of subversion, particularly in border areas of the Federation ... An order under the Malayan Visiting Forces Act 1960 provides in effect for the Commonwealth forces in Malaya, including the Australian forces, to assist in operations against the terrorists in such border security areas.

* There has been a tradition over the years for the Commonwealth to negotiate a new wheat stabilisation and marketing scheme with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation and the State Ministers of Agriculture.

* In this instance I have had four discussions with the Federation and three with the State Ministers.

* All the people concerned were informed that I would make a public statement as to the progress of the negotiations on 2nd August, but at the request of the Federation I refrained from doing so.

* The normal system of **federation** is growing weaker.

* Nine of those came from the universities themselves, from the vicechancellors; five of them came from the staff associations; and one of them came from the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations.

* The report states - 
Broadly speaking, the main argument put on behalf of the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations was that a change in long-term income relativities between academic staffs and comparable occupations was necessary, " not to put the universities in a dominant position .

* The Federation, in putting the case for university staffs, in effect, asked for a review of university salaries relative to those of other occupations, but not in order to put universities in a dominant position.

* The Federation indicated that there is what is described as a "scramble for highly qualified people" in Australia.

* The Federation of Australian University Staff Associations said that it did not want the Eggleston Committee to put the universities in a dominant position.

* I suppose the Federation was referring to the professions of law and medicine.

* These quotas have particular significance in relation to the reference by the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations to the intensifying scramble for highly qualified people.

* More than half of this amount was incurred by the Waterside Workers' Federation, the rest being borne by eight other unions.

* The Department replied to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots when it requested information on these performance tests, and said - 
Office of your Federation.

* The Department therefore considers this matter resolved with your Federation and can ill afford the lime required for researching your questions.  "

* For four years the Federation has been negotiating with the Department to make the carriage of life rafts compulsory on DC3 aircraft crossing Bass Strait.

* The first - the taking away from the Waterside Workers Federation of its present unique labour recruiting rights - is specific and immediate in its application The second purpose is far more significant, far more important and far more sinister.

* That purpose - the undisclosed but underlying purpose - is to break the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Minister has made, and repeated, the slanderous charge that the Federation has been deliberately recruiting or trying to recruit men with criminal records.

* In the first place, he has tried to mislead the public as to the real nature of the Federation's recruiting rights.

* It is true that the Federation possesses a unique right in this regard, but it is the right to nominate, not the right to employ.

* The Federation is not.

* Furthermore, the Minister said yesterday that he would not give any information to the Federation about people with criminal records; but he claims that the Federation is putting into the union people who have criminal records.

* In the third place, he has not explained why he believes the Federation should be the moral guardian of its members.

* On behalf of the Government, I would like to express appreciation of the learning and wisdom which members of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have brought to the consideration of appeals from the High Court since **federation**.

* Many notable contributions to the working of our 
The banking laws of the Federation of Malaya enacted in 19S8 contain a provision to the effect that no bank shall carry on business in the Federation if the Minister of Finance is satisfied that 50 per cent, or more of its paid-up capital is owned by or on behalf of the government or an agency of the government of a country other than the Federation, or that all or a majority of the persons having the direction, control or management of the bank are appointed by or on behalf of any such government or agency.

* It is understood that the licence of the Bank of China to carry on business in the Federation of Malaya lapsed in accordance with this legislation.

* Let me deal now with the first petition, which is dated 4th August and which was circulated by a  Mr P.  Ma lone, Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation.

* Mr C.  Bull, the Communist Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, signed with the State  President  of the Federation,  Mr A.  McCormick, of the ALP.

* I ask leave to table the petition to which I have referred, the text of the document issued by the Australian Builders Labourers Federation about a fortnight ago.

* The people know clearly where they stand with the Government which has given Australia its greatest period of development since this **federation** was founded.

* The honorable member for Fremantle mentioned particularly that the Fremantle branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is unique.

* That is perfectly true, inasmuch as the Fremantle branch of the Waterside Workers Federation is the only union in Australia in which the foremen and the waterside workers are combined in the one organization.

* The Waterside Workers Federation clearly had the right to remedy the conditions about which it complained.

* Instead of applying to the court, the Waterside Workers Federation resorted to direct action.

* Now, after having involved industry in huge costs, the **federation** says it will exercise its legal right.

* These stoppages were admittedly directed towards crushing a new foremen's union and, that being so, the action of the Waterside Workers Federation, besides being an offence against the laws of the State and of the Commonwealth, was also an offence against the principles of trade unionism in that a strong organization was attempting to destroy a weak one.

* The only answer we can give is that the benefit is being conferred as a last stand hope that it will be the means of restoring sanity, reason and responsibility to the rank  and file members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It is ridiculous to say that a man cannot be retired, whatever his age and whatever his ability to carry out the work allotted to him, as long as he remains a member of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Government has no alternative but to legislate in the belief that the common sense of the rank and file members of the Waterside Workers Federation will prevail.

* We have held a number of referendums since **federation**.

* We have in Australia a lop-sided form of government because the original conception of the designers of this Federation was the creation of a great number of States.

* There was no longer any reason for lack of business confidence, the  president  of the Employers Federation of N.S.W.,  Mr. L.  T. Ostergren,  said yesterday. "

* Although those special grants originally were clearly designed as compensation for disabilities suffered under **federation**, it would appear to-day the strong element in fixing the amount of an annual grant is not so much a proof of disability suffered under **federation** as a demonstration of a need which those claimant States have which cannot be met from any other source.

* Nonetheless, I think it can be taken as implicit within the resolution passed by the Association that the resolution was in opposition to - in fact, it was completely different from - the resolution passed by the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, which is hostile to the Government's action and, in effect, supports the Communist activities of the Vietcong.

* I wish to discuss briefly some of the problems associated with the formation of the Federation of Malaysia.

* I do not think we need go any further back in our minds than about 1959 when the Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, said that in no circumstances Would Singapore be admitted to the Federation of Malaysia.

* The majority of the populations in the Federation of Malaysia itself is Malay, but the Chinese are increasing more rapidly than the Malay and other races forming the **federation** and for that reason Tunku Abdul Rahman's Government did not wish to include Singapore, for that would bring about a preponderance of Chinese in the Malaysian **federation**.

* It will be recalled that the proposal to include Singapore in the **federation** was proposed by the Prime Minister of Singapore,  Mr, Lee  Kuan Yew, but it became obvious that  Mr. Lee  Kuan Yew's Government or any succeeding government in Singapore would not be able to maintain a free and independent Singapore without the control and domination of the Communists; so the Tunku and his Government realized that it would be preferable to have Singapore within the **federation** rather than have it a Communist centre only a few miles from the **federation** itself.

* It was suggested that the territories of North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak, which had only a comparatively small percentage of Chinese population, should be included in the **federation** so as to maintain tha balance that I have described.

* They believed, either rightly or wrongly, that the proposed **federation** of Malaysia would be loosely knit.

* Should the day come when the European Community became a **federation** with Great Britain as a constituent state, then Great Britain would cease to be a sovereign community .

* Great Britain has no intention of going into a **federation**.

* If Great Britain enters the Common Market, as the honorable member for Yarra  (Mr. Cairns)  pointed out, she will automatically become a party to what is more than a **federation** - and what is really a centralized bureaucracy controlling and administering this great area in Europe.

* Broadly speaking, on the national level, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have both supported this proposal.

* But although the graziers, in total, have supported the measure, two constituent bodies of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation - the Victorian branch and the Western Australian branch - have vigorously opposed any increase in the levy until after the wool inquiry report is available.

* It is only because of the casting vote of  Mr. Heaslip,  the  president  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, that we have this legislation before us to-day and that this levy is being introduced.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation is in a position to examine this matter very fully in the light of the report following the inquiry into the wool industry.

* An element of compromise has been introduced and the federal  president  of the **federation**,  Mr. Heaslip,  probably had that in mind when he tipped the balance and used his casting vote.

* At that time the Government took it upon itself to send its advisers and officers to Washington, but in addition it did consult the Australian Wheat Growers Federation.

* Deputations were received from the Federation and the Agreement was explained to them.

* The executive of the Federation was met and was very plainly informed that the Government was not prepared to become a signatory to the 1949-53 Agreement without a statement in writing from the Federation to say that it was prepared to accept the Agreement and required the Government to sign it.

* Finally an agreement, of which I have a copy, came from Canada and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation expressed its willingness to sign it.

* As we know, since the time of **federation** responsibility for education has rested with the States.

* One might well have expected the Teachers Federation, the Australian Teachers Council, parents' organizations and mothers' clubs to be represented, but in addition there were representatives of the Federal Council of University Staff Associations of Australia, the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Farmers Union of Australia, the Country Women's Association of Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Graziers Federal Council of Australia, the Australasian Trained Nurses Association, the Australian Journalists Association, the Australian Council of the Employers' Federation, the Federal Council of the New Education Fellowship, the Fellowship of Australian Writers, the Australian Primary Producers' Union, the Australian Veterinary Association, the Phamaceutical Associations of Australia, the Australian National Council of Women, the Farmers and Settlers' Association, the National Union of Australian University Students, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations, the Association of Architects, Engineers, Surveyors and Draughtsmen of Australia, the Commonwealth Bank Officers' Association, the Australian Bank Officials Association, the Australian Council for Child Advancement, the Arts Council of Australia, the Wheat and Woolgrowers' Association of New South Wales, the United Associations of Women, the Union of Australian Women, the Parent-teacher Education Councils of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and, in addition, the Premier and Minister for Education of New South Wales, as the Premier of that State was then known, and the Minister for Education of Victoria.

* It is quite obvious that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the implications of the wheat industry proposals that were put by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to the Commonwealth and the State governments because there are no second pool proposals.

* That the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation and the Australian Wool-growers' and Graziers' Council agree to recommend to their members that the levy for wool promotion and research be 12s.

* per bale for one year only, to apply as from the first sale after the winter recess 1961, and that the levy be reviewed at a  Meetng  between the Bureau, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council not later than March, 1962, with the knowledge of the findings of the Wool Inquiry Committee and that the legislation be amended accordingly.

* The  Minister may approve the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Primary Producers Union or any other organization that he considers has an interest in the export of meat or in the promotion of it on the Australian market.

* Such  an organization may be the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, which undoubtedly has a vested interest in the production of dairy cows, with the ultimate production of chopper cows and worn-out bulls.

* It is no good the Minister expressing the pious hope that at some stage the primary producers' organization may become eligible tohave a representative on the Meat Board or that the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation may become a suitable organization from which  to  select an appointee unless he is prepared to accept the opportunity now being offered to him to be in a position to appoint a member from any organization that  he  likes  to  approve.

* I had the opportunity of granting representation to members of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, as it was then known, or any other organization that I thought fit.

* For example, such an organization may be the Australian Primary Producers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* The bill will also entitle donors to deductions for gifts to the Australian Postgraduate Federation in Medicine, the College of Radiologists of Australasia, the Australian College of General Practitioners, and the College of Pathologists of Australia.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, for example, is representative of six bodies - the Selectors Association of Queensland, the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales, the Wheat and Wool Growers Association of New South Wales, the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association, the South Australian Wheat and Wool Growers Association and the Farmers Union of Western Australia.

* The amalgamation of these bodies, in a sense, in the **federation** is a step forward.

* An article in the Newcastle 'Morning Herald' of 4th April, attributed to the  President  of the Australian Metal Trades Federation,  Mr J.  Scotford, will be of some interest to honourable members in view of the organisation that  Mr Scotford  represents.

* It will consist of four representatives from the Graziers Federal Council of Australia, two representatives from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, and one representative from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* It is rather significant that the Treasurer, as he concluded his Budget speech, went on record as refering to it as the finest Budget and the most constructive document perhaps in the 68 years of **federation**, and I for one believe this to be true.

* In view of the right honorable gentleman's great friendship for the Waterside Workers Federation will he arrange for a couple of wharfies to pipe him aboard?

* The Federation has been advised that its application was unsuccessful, but that it would be considered again in any review of the Government's scheme of financial assistance for flying training.

* Federation of Australia.

* Representatives of that Branch of the Federation spoke to the Government members trade committee, of which I am secretary, on 24th October 1968 about this problem.

* In conformity with the usual smearing tactics that are evolved by Government supporters, he referred to the circular letter sent out by the Waterside Workers Federation and placed emphasis on the words " Dear Comrade ".

* The Bill before us at the moment has been brought in for the specific purpose of destroying first of all the Waterside Workers Federation and, if that experiment is successful, the next thing we will have will be similar legislation to destroy other trade unions.

* He inferred that all these problems would be solved by one thing - by refusing the Waterside Workers Federation the right to submit a list of names to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to build up the quota of each particular port.

* What the Minister failed to explain was that after the Federation had submitted these names the Authority would not have to accept them.

* As far as the allegation that criminals are members of the Federation is concerned, I cannot accept the facts supplied by the Minister or his assurance that certain things will not be done because he made a very clear and definite statement during his speech that the Melbourne Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation had submitted a list of 990 names which contained the names of 260 persons with criminal records.

* Out of 1,000 letters that were sent out by the Federation, 200 recipients did not reply, 140 were rejected on medical grounds, 16 because of age or language difficulties and 64 on other grounds.

* I believe that this charge that the Waterside Workers Federation has submitted the names of men with criminal convictions has been made in an attempt to bolster the Government's attack on the waterside workers.

* The same may be said of the application form for the Waterside Workers Federation.

* No such question is asked by either of these organisations - the Federation or the Authority.

* I propose to quote as my authority, not a member of the Australian Labour Party or of the Waterside Workers Federation, but  Sir Alan  Westerman, who is the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry.

* Yet the Minister comes into this chamber and endeavours to convince honorable members that all the trouble on the waterfront is caused by the Waterside Workers Federation, whereas in fact, of the gross nonproductive time on the waterfront, industrial stoppages by members of the Federation were responsible for only .1 per cent.

* I believe that a great percentage of the stoppages by waterside workers are genuine industrial stoppages, whereby the Federation seeks to improve the conditions of its members on the waterfront.

* That brings me to the point that I fully support the demands of the Waterside Workers Federation, first, for industrial pensions, and secondly, for some understanding as to redundancy between the 
I did not think that the Minister would agree, because the Government does not like to have the facts clearly set out in " Hansard ".

* They are the men in between, the members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* A decision regarding the crewing complement of the Twin Otter aircraft has been made and communicated to all companies operating this aircraft and to the Australian Federation of Air Pilots.

* I pay a tribute to members of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation for the magnificent job they did on the fencing.

* In one area of my electorate, Mole Creek, the Tasmanian Farmers Federation organised 230 farmers to work on a post splitting project in the forests.

* I should like to mention also a remarkable adoption plan that has been put forward by branches of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation in the north and north west of the island.

* Another scheme that the Tasmanian Farmers Federation is organising involves rearing in the north a calf or a lamb to the weaning stage.

* Federation has fought this proposal with sufficient vigour.

* A recent report printed and published by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, a copy of which I think every honorable member received, deals generally with the problems of primary and secondary education and, for that matter, tertiary education.

* It says - 
I want to mention to the House the position in the Teachers Federation in New South Wales in relation to the elections which are at present occurring.

* In previous elections, only about one-half the members of the Federation have voted.

* I want particularly to refer to a man named Sam Lewis who is president of the Federation.

* This man Lewis is, in point of fact, a Communist agent and he uses his position in the Teachers Federation to further the Communist cause.

* Round about 1942, when I was living in Wagga, I visited the house in Sydney of  Mr. Sam  Lewis of the Teachers Federation.

* Mr. Lewis, regarding me as a Communist, told me in the presence of his wife that they were both undercover members of the Communist Party, and worked in the Teachers Federation on behalf of the Communist Party.

* He has prostituted the Teachers Federation for Communist purposes.

* It is instructive also to note that when a question was asked in the House with the object of getting a higher poll in the Teachers Federation so that there would be a vote to take Lewis out of office, the honorable member for Werriwa  (Mr. Whitlam),  who is  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, stepped in to protect Communist interests.

* Yet he must have known that the Teachers Federation was represented both on the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Labour Council of New South Wales.

* The main thing that I want to say is that there is now on the record a statutory declaration saying that  Mr. Lewis  is a Communist of long standing and has been using his position in the Teachers Federation for Communist purposes.

* He is playing the usual Labour game of endeavouring to protect the Communists in the Teachers Federation.

* All I am saying is that I hope the members of the Federation will vote at the coming election.

* I hope they will vote for the anti-Communist candidates, namely the candidates sponsored by the Federation Reform Committee, which, in the teeth of opposition from the Labour Party, is endeavouring to break the stranglehold of the Communists on the Teachers Federation.

* It is very instructive to be here tonight, listening to the interjections of honorable members opposite and realising that the purpose of those interjections is to prevent any attacks being made on the Communists in the Teachers Federation.

* I particularly ask the members of the Teachers Federation who are not Communists, and who in the past have not exercised their right to vote, to fill in their ballot papers and to send them in before 4th November.

* I ask those members to vote for the candidates who they can assure themselves are opposed to the Federation being Communist run by this man Lewis, who has perverted the aims, objectives and policies of the Federation for Communist ends.

* Consequently, I approached the  president  of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* Representatives of the **federation** happen to be in Canberra to-day on this very matter, so the index committee is now having a look at the figures.

* When that has been done, I intend to have a discussion with the **federation**.

* I will have a preliminary discussion with the **federation** and then take the matter to the Government for consideration.

* When I go to the Fremantle pickup of the Waterside Workers Federation I find a great many inarticulate Europeans who approach me and put verbally all manner of cases.

* It also emphasizes the fact that we are now, 63 years after **federation**, finally establishing the first mint to be administered by the Commonwealth Government.

* I have just said that, more than 60 years after **federation**, we are finally very close to setting up the first purely Australian mint.

* Since **federation**, moves have been made from time to time by various Commonwealth and State Governments to have the Commonwealth take sole responsibility for 

 His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agony the Paramount Ruler of Malaya, died early on Friday morning, at the age of 64 years.

* He was the first of the Paramount Rulers provided for by the constitution of the recently established Malayan Federation.

* It may be of interest to recall that at the ceremonies marking the establishment of the Malayan Federation, Australia was represented by the former Governor-General.

* Admittedly, our **federation** was eight years old before the Parliament approved of the first piece of social service legislation, but they were eight years of almost constant conflict of opinion and didactic disputation over the relative merits of a variety of proposals and, although great and far-reaching reforms have been effected since then, this Parliament has never been able to compose that conflict or reduce that disputation.

* In 1964 the Federation revived plans for a noncontributory industrial pension.

* I do not propose to discuss the features of the measure which have been covered so well by the honorable member for Stirling  (Mr. Webb),  but I suggest to every thinking parliamentarian that this is not an issue which affects the Waterside Workers Federation only.

* If this is the line the Government is going to take it has made the Waterside Workers Federation its first target.

* If it were necessary to deregister the waterfront organisations the Minister himself, the AttorneyGeneral  (Mr. Snedden)  or any member of the registered waterfront employer organisations could have moved for the deregistration of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Under this clause the Minister may apply to the Commission for a declaration with respect to the doings of the Waterside Workers Federation, and there is very little difference between the procedure set out in that section and the procedure that is followed in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, which we know as the hangman's court, to which anybody can go and allege that a breach of the legislation has occurred and ask for a penalty to be imposed.

* The declaration having been made, the Minister and the Executive have the right to ask for the deregistration of the Federation.

* In 1898, the convention delegates were afraid that Queensland would not join the **federation** at all because the people of central Queensland and the people of northern Queensland might want to form a new State.

* Every teachers' **federation** throughout the country has made such a request to the Prime Minister.

* I feel that it is time some one did something about removing another disability that is suffered by Western Australia as a result of it being a member of this **federation**.

* It is a job which may have been ignored for too long by this Government, but it was ignored also by Labour governments, which did not do anything about it when they were in office not that they have been in office for so very long during the period of **federation**.

* The Minister, by the methods he adopts, shows that he openly allies himself and his Department with the overseas shipowners and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in their continuous attacks upon the Waterside Workers Federation and leaves no shadow of doubt in the minds of Opposition members that the only purpose he has in mind is the destruction of the Federation as a prelude to an all out attack on the organised trade union movement, including my organisation, the honorable Boilermakers Society of Australia, which is militant at all times.

* He says that the principal factor responsible for the trouble on the waterfront is the domination of the policies and actions of the Waterside Workers Federation by Communists in key positions.

* He fails to mention, of course, that the dominating influence in the Federation is a prominent member of the Australian Labour - Party,  Mr. C.  Fitzgibbon, a man who is highly respected in all walks of life.

* But they are ever ready to resist his attacks on the trade union movement generally, of which the Waterside Workers Federation is a part.

* It might be pertinent to inform the Minister that membership of the Federation is comprised of good citizens of Australia, the fathers of large families, all good honest workers who would be a credit to any nation in the world.

* It is interesting to note, too, that Communists are in the minority on the Federal Council of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* This Bill seeks to deregister the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The organised trade union movement will advise all applicants for waterfront work to apply to the Waterside Workers Federation and to no-one else, and anyone who applies to the authority that is set up will be declared an industrial renegade.

* Since the Minister has gone as far back as 1935 to make his comparison, I should point out that in November 1962 the Waterside Workers Federation, honouring its promise to attempt negotiations before taking industrial action, conferred with the employers on its claim for wage increases which the employers refused to grant on the ground that the matter should be determined by none other than  His  Honour  Mr. Justice  Ashburner.

* The Federation had lodged a claim for an increase of 7s.

* Thirdly, he accepted a further contention by the employers and excluded the ports of Sydney and Melbourne from any marginal increase until such time as assurances were given by the Federation, as requested by the employers, or until such time as the Federation could establish that the position in these two ports had altered.

* The Federation, at the request of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, applied to the Commonwealth Industrial Court for the lifting of the exclusion applying to Sydney and Melbourne.

* The Federation could not agree in any circumstances that men should be deprived of a justified wage increase because of the location in which they worked rather than the nature of the work they did or because they did not meet a standard of industrial conduct laid down by an employer.

* The Waterside Workers Federation also points out that the effect of the.

* It is necessary for me to remind honorable members that it antedates **federation**.

* Prior to **federation**, when the State parliaments were the only legislative authorities in our country, there were even then a number and a variety of agricultural and pastoral organizations in all the six States.

* That unhappy state of affairs continued for the first twenty-odd years of **federation**.

* No one ever dreamed that the federations would become involved internationally, but they did, through the International Federation of Agricultural Producers.

* The commodity federations federated first of all with the National Farmers Union and, subsequently, with the International Federation of Agricultural Producers.

* That is how both the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation came to be formed in the first place.

* The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, having reached a measure of unanimity, approached this Government, successfully, for the appointment of the Wool Marketing Committee of Enquiry.

* That recommendation, together with the encouragement given by the Minister for Primary Industry, more than anything else, brought the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation together to form what is now known as the Australian Wool Industry Conference.

* The union is not affiliated with the council or the **federation**, and, as a consequence, it is not a member of the conference formed by the council and the **federation** for the purpose of creating the Australian Wool Board.

* It carries the names of the same Labour Party members and Communists which appeared on similar cards in respect of the Waterside Workers Federation's elections in 1957, 1958, 1959 and 1960.

* This is the unity ticket used in the 1961 elections for the Waterside Workers Federation.

* This is printed and published for the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, Brisbane Branch by A. Arnell, President, 471 Adelaide-street, Brisbane.

* We find now that in "Victoria a demand has been made for the Waterside Workers Federation to be disaffiliated from the Labour Party.

* for an inquiry into alleged irregularities in connexion with the election for certain offices in the **federation**.

* A question of law was subsequently submitted to the Commonwealth Industrial Court by the Industrial Registrar following a request by members of the **federation** for the election for some positions in the **federation** to be conducted under section 170 of the act.

* On 6th February, 1963, Kevin Davis sought, and was granted, a rule to show cause why an order should not be made pursuant to section 140 of the act, declaring certain rules of the **federation** invalid.

* This was granted against the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, but with liberty for that organisation to apply on cause shown to have the injunction dissolved.

* One of the criticisms that have been made of our system is that since **federation** we have given too much attention to arbitration, which consists of forcing a decision on the parties, and too little attention to conciliation, which forces nothing on them but seeks to explore the areas of agreement between them.

* I should say that if there were any such bitterness an Australian Labour Party man would not have been elected secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The honorable member for Blaxland made constant reference to the Chifley Government's policy to end what he termed the continual feud between mine managements and the miners **federation**.

* Two world wars, the decisions of the High Court in regard to uniform taxation, two important alterations of the Constitution - one made by him in regard to the establishment of the Australian Loan Council and the ratification of the Financial Agreement, and the other made by the Chifley Government in regard to the extension of the welfare state and the payment of social services - all these things have changed the character of our **federation**.

* The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of  a  Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* The economic conditions will be laid down by those bodies of the European Economic Community as a **federation** in which the federal government will not be elected by the people at all.

* In April last year, when addressing a seminar on restrictive trade practices convened by the Victorian Employers Federation, the AttorneyGeneral was questioned about public interest.

* In reply he said - 
The AttorneyGeneral said it when addressing a seminar convened by the Victorian Employers Federation in April 1964.

* The present Attorney-General, under the pressure of questions asked by the Victorian Employers Federation in April last year, went to great lengths to explain how specific this legislation was.

* There is quite a difference between those words and the explanation that was given to the Victorian Employers Federation by the Attorney-General.

* First of all I wau: to remind the House that the present permanent employment arrangements in this industry are the result of an agreement between the employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service.

* It is also competent - and this is important - for any of the parties involved in the stevedoring industry, either the employers, the Federation or the Government, to raise questions concerning recruitment or redundancy or any other problem that may arise.

* Discussions are now being held in Newcastle between the local stevedoring employers and the Waterside Workers Federation to secure agreement on shift hours, commencing and finishing times and all the other details which are important in the working of this port.

* Of course there are members of the Waterside Workers Federation, particularly in the port of Melbourne, who have similarly cast doubts, but from their own particular points of view, on the activities of the Conference.

* The industry has been guided politically by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* It is now contemplated by this legislation, and concurred in by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, that the levy should be increased to three-tenths of a penny per bushel, an increase of onetwentieth of a penny per bushel.

* It was obvious when the levy was concurred in by the Federation and adopted in legislation by the Government that the growers would look for some Government support.

* This vessel has been on the run for six months now, and it is assured of full cargoes and a quick turn-round by the members of the Stanley branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* They rap  us  up all right, through the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and the Employers' Federation, but we are rapped up in a very different sense from that suggested by the Opposition.

* In a **federation** there are two forces that can operate, and one of them will operate at all times.

* The fact is that the honorable member for Bruce, the honorable member for Warringah, the Minister for Labour and National Service, his department and members of the Liberal Party say to the members of the Waterside Workers Federation: "You have a duty to work and you must work.

* The deletion of the objectionable words "white Australia" and the reframing of our policy as recommended by the Committee will prevent misinterpretation of the principles which underline our immigration policy - a policy that has been endorsed by all Australian Governments since Federation.

* Federation changing its programme.

* Here is what the senior VicePresident of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation said: 
That is exactly what the Opposition is trying to do today.

* The proposal which was put forward by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation was supported by every wheatgrowers organisation in Australia.

* When the situation became clear, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, which is the main body in the wheat industry, held a meeting in Western Australia and decided on a quota system.

* When the Victorian members of the Federation returned from Western Australia, they worked out the scheme of quotas with the Grain Elevators Board and the Grains Division of the Victorian Farmers Union.

* I point out also that the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation was the body mainly responsible for the introduction of quotas.

* Does anyone suggest that the Government should step in, override the Federation and take charge of the industry?

* The members of the Victorian Farmers Union and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation are dedicated to giving the wheat industry the best deal they possibly can.

* Can the Minister confirm or deny the information which has been given to me that officials of the Australian National Line and the Waterside Workers Federation have met in Sydney with the idea of discussing mutual co-operation between the Australian National Line and the Federation in the building and operation of two bulk ore carriers for our overseas trade between Australia and Japan?

* Since the national welfare scheme started at the time of Federation many beneficial changes have been made to it.

* The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have clashed on the question of what is best for the industry in the matter of marketing.

* The **federation** has talked nearly all this year about a reserve price plan, which is in line with our policy on this side of the House, but which would be put to the growers by way of a referendum proposal.

* He was very disappointed that many of the **federation**'s views were not accepted by the inquiry when he stated them in evidence.

* The same remarks apply to the graziers organization and to the **federation**.

* In my electorate lives  Mr. Ernest  Mills who is the  president  of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* We shall not interfere with the conference at this stage and will allow the present constitution of 25 members from the graziers organization and 25 from the **federation** to remain unaltered.

* In Tasmania, we have the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, with 6,000 to 7,000 members engaged in all branches of agriculture.

* I think that members of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation produce 65 per cent, of Tasmanian wool, which is among the best in the world.

* None of those growers will be represented on the new organization because the Tasmanian Farmers Federation is affiliated with the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* Those bodies are the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union.

* The Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation claims to have 43,000 members.

* In his second-reading speech the Minister said - 
The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation give an undertaking that after the first annual meeting of the conference they will meet in three years' time to review the constitution of the conference.

* But, in the entire experience of the Australian Parliament since Federation, that has worked out not to be a consideration that actually matters.

* But if **federation** was a timid step then, it is a blatant anachronism now.

* But I do want to say to the honorable member for Barton that there is no analogy between the United Kingdom Government, the Netherlands Government, or the government of any other country with a unitary form of government and the government of a **federation** of six sovereign States.

* It is quite ludicrous to compare the government of a **federation** with the government of any country with a unitary system.

* Any comparison between the expenditure of this Government and another government must take into account the fact that in this **federation** the six sovereign States all have individual commitments covering the entire field of social services and other fields, and that superimposed on them is, of course, the Commonwealth Government.

* In its third report, that for the year 1936, the commission finally rejected the principle of compensation for disabilities arising from **federation**, and chose instead the principle of financial need, which it expressed in the following terms: - 
Special grants are justified when a State, through financial stress, from any cause, is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States.

* The Secretary of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation said that the argument about having to pay more overtime at harvest time was not valid.

* Honorable members will, of course, understand that we are not in reality creating a new institution, but are rather proposing that the library services of the Commonwealth which have grown up without formal provisions since **federation** should now be the subject of legislation by this Parliament.

* It has held discussions from time to time with the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations and interested licensees, with the result that a certain procedure has been laid down.

* Whatever hope he may have given to members of the Waterside Workers Federation, he destroyed that hope when he said, towards the end of his speech, "When we are returned as a government at the next election, we will repeal this legislation ".

* The legislation proposes to provide for a form of long service leave and it also proposes to make adjustments concerning various members of the Waterside Workers Federation according to their age.

* The honorable member for Hindmarsh asked why the Waterside Workers Federation should be singled out for the grant of long service leave only if they comply with a set pattern of industrial behaviour.

* I believe the honorable member should concede the fact that what this measure does is to provide a long service leave benefit consistent with reasonable behaviour by members of the **federation**.

* Political issues overseas, from the activities of Castro in Cuba to the policies of Soekarno in Indonesia, were all brought, in one way or another, within the domain of the waterside workers' leaders, and were used to stimulate stoppages by **federation** members.

* The truth of the matter is, however, as can be proved by the record, that time and time again stoppages of work and strikes by members of the Waterside Workers Federation have occurred, on the flimsiest of pretexts and on grounds not touching or concerning industrial matters.

* I suppose that by a little shuffling here and there it would be possible for a group of individuals, if they were not inhibited in any respect and not anchored to any provision, to become members of the Waterside Workers Federation and to become entitled to long service leave without ey-r having worked in their lives.

* Any one who listened attentively to the honorable member for Hindmarsh would have gathered the impression that the leader of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Healy,  is something in the nature of a little Lord Fauntleroy - a pleasant affable gentleman, not given to irrationality and who pursues, in an eminently progressive way, the business of bringing reform to this industry.

* One of the great tragedies of the Waterside Workers Federation is that few of its members realize that Healy has not their interests at heart.

* This is what Lenin said in the matter of reform and revolution in " Selected Works ", volume 1 - 
I have pointed out the need for the leader of the Waterside Workers Federation to subordinate everything that he does to the fundamental task of furthering the goal of the Communist Party.

* On page 25 of  Mr. Sharkey's  booklet we find this statement - 
The last matter that I want to mention in illustrating this subordination of the ideas of orthodox and legitimate trade union activity to the ultimate goal is the persistent behaviour, year in and year out, of members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia in running unity tickets.

* No union has a livelier record of activity with respect to unity tickets than the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I have here a photostat copy of a unity ticket and of various reports, circulars and the like, relating to elections in the Brisbane branch of the **federation** a few years ago.

* As a matter of fact, one of the conditions on which Western Australia originally joined the **federation** was that a standard gauge railway would be provided.

* It is one of the tragedies of Australian **federation** that we have inflicted on the people with the most primitive social organization the most complex laws in the country.

* Is it a fact that these suggestions form only part of an overall pattern emerging from reports over the last ten years of the Joint Coal Board and from agitation and representations by the Miners' Federation and associated trade unions?

* Mr. Speaker,  this is a bill which gives for the first time the benefit of long service leave to members of the Waterside Workers Federation in certain circumstances.

* He says quite openly and honestly that the bill is aimed at disciplining the Waterside Workers Federation in order to prevent disputes and stoppages in the industry.

* They are the leaders of the young men, the teachers of the young men, who are telling the young men who enter the industry of the things that they have had to fight and strive for through the whole history of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In the Waterside Workers Federation, Jim Healy does not raise his finger and say, "The whole of &lt; you 22,000 members will go on strike tomorrow ".

* The Waterside Workers Federation will not decide to reject one of its leaders simply because the Menzies Government says it does not like that leader.

* The Chamber of Manufactures, the Employers Federation, the Graziers Association, of which the grazier from Hume is a distinguished member, the shipping combines and the colliery owners all have their unions for the purpose of taking some kind of action for the benefit of their members, just as trade unions take strike action for the benefit of their members, Government supporters have made a cardinal error in believing that their plea to the wharf labourers to throw out their Communist officials would succeed.

* We think in terms of the setting up of the Federation of Malaysia and the attitude of the Indonesian Government and the Philippines Government to the formation of the **federation**.

* It should be remembered that at the time of **federation** South Australia included what is now the Northern Territory, and hence the aborigines of the Northern Territory were affected by South Australian electoral law.

* Most States before **federation** could not, in fact, have carried out a count of the aborigines.

* Strong representations were made not only by the Returned Services League but also by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation and some local semi-government bodies for a scheme to overcome the problems and to assist those people.

* The national and State executives of two major organisations, the Returned Services League and the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, after a complete examination of all the facts joined the Settlers Association and other interested organisations in seeking an open inquiry.

* These gave substantial advantages to the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Perhaps it was that in 1958-59, the low year, there was less work available and the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation were not willing to take the risk of stopping their men.

* Perhaps it was that since the major claims of the **federation** were still being prosecuted before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the leaders decided they did not want to prejudice their claims by too many stoppages.

* Whatever the reasons for this period of industrial peace in 1958-59, there is one thing of which we can be sure - what occurs on the waterfront occurs because the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation want it to happen.

* As to this, I should mention that the **federation** gave an assurance to the commission that if its claim, which was for twelve such stop-work meetings, was granted in substance, the **federation** would - and here I quote the words of the **federation** - " discourage to the utmost of its ability any tendency on the part of branches to conduct unauthorized stopwork meetings".

* What value can be placed on the assurances of the **federation** I leave the House to judge.

* The Government acted on its own initiative; it was not urged to do this by the **federation**.

* Indeed,  Mr. Healy,  the general secretary of the **federation**, struck me as being most disturbed about it.

* and his senior colleagues and the federal  president  and general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, I was reminded of the trade union movement's objections to the attaching of conditions to the granting of long service leave.

* I do say categorically that this kind of law would never have become necessary were it not for the tactics - the deliberate tactics and objectives - of some of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation to continually disrupt and disorganize working on the waterfront.

* In truth, the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation have been engaged in a prostitution of the very purposes of trade unionism.

* One of the things I cannot understand is the attitude the Australian Olympic Federation has taken in this matter, because it seems to me that by its actions it is saying in effect that anybody in this country who tries to help himself will be penalised.

* The article, which bears a date line from Mexico City, states: 
Told that the IOC had ruled that Australia's entry would not be accepted to replace 'X' - unless ithad the backing of the Australian Olympic Federation,  Mr Phillips  said: 'We have not been told of that'.

* The Australian Olympic Federation will not recognise the water polo team as part of the official Australian team, although the water polo team's application to play in the Olympic Games has been backed by FINA, the world governing body of amateur swimming.

* The Secretary of the Australian Olympic Federation,  Mr Tanner,  said that the IOC decision was final.

* Here is a team that has proved its worth in world class competition and that has gone over to Mexico at its own expense but which is excluded from competing in the Olympic Games because of the attitude of the Australian Olympic Federation.

* Recently we have in fact received and considered such a request from the Federation of Australian University Staff Associations.

* Mr Stott,  the one-time Secretary of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, said that we ought to have recognised Red China.

* Did he mean that he wants to keep both the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers guessing as to how much more time he intends to let go by before he and his Department really make some effort to get all the parties around a conference table with the object of bridging the gulf between the parties in regard to their present opposing lists of demands?

* Review, the journal of the Federation of British Industries, under the title "Australia still a good prospect for British Goods ", which is extremely critical of the standards and quality of Australian manufactures?

* The penalty of 100 has remained unchanged since **federation** despite the decrease in money values since that date.

* Its scope relates to the history of policy since Federation, and the writer has been devoting his full time to this task since his retirement, without remuneration.

* As for the honorable member for Barker, I can only say that I am not altogether surprised that he has identified the request contained in our proposal as coming from a pressure group, the Teachers Federation, or, more precisely, the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* Have any commitments yet been entered into in respect of the new Federation of Malaysia?

* He was a member of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, from 1925-1931  -  advocate for the Western Australian Employers' Federation 1931-1942  -  member of the Western Australian Arbitration Court 1946-1949 - secretary, Western Australian Employers' Federation 1949-1953.

* A breach of those orders results in a fine of 500 on the union, and four such fines have recently been imposed on the **federation**, making a total penalty of 2,000, because of the nation-wide stoppage that was held.

* The **federation**, of course, has had to pay these fines from the proceeds of the levies imposed upon its members.

* Prior to **federation** each State had the right to impose its own customs and excise duties.

* At the time of **federation** these powers were transferred to the Commonwealth and the Department, which was then known as the Department of Trade and Customs, was established.

* 2 of that report we see that it provides an interesting brief history of customs and excise collections in the Australian Colonies before **federation** and afterwards.

* <para pgwide="yes">[Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) Amendment (No.

* <para pgwide="yes">That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference) 1960 be amended as set out in the Schedule to these Proposals and that, on and after the twentieth day of May, One thousand nine hundred and sixty, at nine o'clock in the forenoon, reckoned according to standard time in the Australian Capital Territory, Duties of Customs be collected accordingly.

* Mr. Chairman, the tariff proposals which I have tabled relate to proposed amendments to the schedules to the Customs Tariff 1933-1.959, the Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) 1934-1959, the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1959, and the Customs Tariff (Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland Preference)1960.

* It was determined by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* He was reported in a newspaper to have been criticized by the Employers Federation, but he said that the report was not accurate.

* The Waterside Workers Federation has had the privilege of recruiting labour for the industry.

* From my experience, I do not believe that the Waterside Workers Federation has really respected this privilege or accepted its responsibilities.

* the Waterside Workers Federation to see that the men are available, lt should not be suggested that sufficient men could not be obtained because from memory I think that on one occasion when a few hundred men were required the Federation had at the back door 14,000 men waiting and willing to go into the industry.

* I should like to say as to the concluding part of the honorable gentleman's question that I am glad to see that, in the main ports at least, the branches of the Waterside Workers Federation have agreed to the terms and conditions that have been laid down by the Government and have agreed to participate in the all-in conference with  Mr. Woodward  as  Chairman.

* On many occasions, officials of branches of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia have endeavoured to keep peace on the waterfront, but this Government's legislation has placed them in a position in which they cannot do so.

* No honorable member could disagree with the Minister for Labour and National Service when, in his second-reading speech on the Stevedoring Industry Bill 1963, he said - 
Prior to the introduction of section 52a, the Waterside Workers Federation and its members, either individually or as a federal body, were subject to corrective measures that provided powers for fines, suspensions, cancellation of attendance money and days of annual leave credits, and cancellation of a member's right to work on the waterfront for a day, week, month or for life.

* This penalty is grossly unfair and is considered so by the officials and rank and file members of the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* At the conference a working party, consisting of two representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation, two representatives of the A.C.T.U., two representatives of the employers and one representative of- the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, with  Dr. P.  H. Cook as  chairman,  was set up to inquire into and report on certain problems connected with the stevedoring industry.

* J. D. Kenny and  Mr. H.  J. Souter  of the A.C.T.U, Messrs. C. L. Craig, S.  Joblin  and E. R. Wilkins (employers), Messrs. J. Beitz and C. Fitzgibbon (Waterside Workers' Federation),  Mr. N.  J.

* I assure honorable members that the representatives from the A.C.T.U., the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority on a great many occasions hold very conflicting views on industrial matters.

* The report states - 
Have approaches been made by the National Nursing Education Division of the Royal Australian Nursing Federation seeking financial assistance for research?

* If so, when were these approaches made, and what replies were given to the Nursing Federation?

* The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb quite seriously a principle which the Committee believes to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value.

* Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge Its functions as a member ot the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function al a standard not appreciably below that of other States.

* In principle it would seem that the States which are not claimant for special grants must be regarded as functioning efficiently as members of the Federation or at least as considering themselves to be doing so.

* On this ground it can be argued that in order to enable claimant States to function efficiently as members of the Federation, special grants need not be such as would place them in a more favourable budgetary position than any non-claimant State.

* Since Federation, Western Australia has been receiving financial disability assistance from the Commonwealth Government.

* So somebody within the selection committee has to move for the admittance of a representative of another organization, and I cannot see that happening if these two accepted bodies - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation -say, "No".

* but nothing will happen until a representative of one or other of these two bodies on that committee says, " I move that the Australian Primary Producers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation be included ".

* Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* I ask this one question: Did these two organizations - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation - ask themselves the same questions as they will ask the A.P.P.U.

* As I pointed out in my statement to the Senate, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has also said that this recommendation of the board should be interpreted in another way and that it would be a practical proposal if their interpretation were the proper one.

* The adoption of the **federation**'s view would lead us to the point of accepting that the board, in its recommendation, contemplated no greater responsibility foi air traffic controllers in respect of turbulence than has been contained for many years in their operating instructions.

* In respect to the Government's interpretation of the board's recommendation, the Federation of Air Pilots agreed that such an unqualified guarantee could not be given.

* The fact that the **federation** held both these views I made quite clear to the Senate and in this connexion the honorable member is referred to "Hansard" for 11th October, 1962, at page 790.

* We find that the tariff has been used to protect local industry since **federation**.

* The chief credit, to my mind, should go to three people -  Sir William  Gunn,  Mr. Scott  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and  Mr. Heaslip  of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Such a course has never been followed since Federation.

* Federation.

* These fleeting references to his achievements reveal  Sir- Earle  Page* as one figure working in the public scene who is absolutely assured of a place in the annals of the constructive development of the Australian nation and the Australian **federation**.

* I ask: Will he allow me, as Leader of the Opposition, to sec the files or the names and particulars of the alleged convictions of the persons included in the 260 about whom there is some disputation between himself and the Waterside Workers Federation?

* Mr. Self, the Executive Director of the Employers Federation in New South Wales said - 
Secondly, we live in a **federation**.

* So that as long as we live in the **federation** of course we have to operate within our own sphere and the things which we do in conjunction with the States must be done by agreement.

* Honorable members opposite will know that I am right when I refer to the Sheet Metal Workers Union, the Seamen's Union of Australia - indeed, one of my distinguished constituents is the secretary of this union - the Waterside Workers Federation and the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia.

* Supporters of the Government may point out that there have been Labour governments in office, but Labour has been in office in the federal sphere for only approximately one-quarter of the period since **federation**, and most of the time when Labour had control of the treasury-bench was in the difficult war and post-war years.

* At **federation** the Northern 
Territory had a population density of .01 per square mile and in 1961, after 60 years - most of the period under anti-Labour governments - the density of the population in the Northern Territory was .05 per square mile.

* At **federation** the population density in Queensland was .76 per square mile and to-day it is only 2.28 per square mile.

* For some years now the Federation has recognised that the special provisions of Section 37, subsection (1) and sub-section (2) of the principal Act would be continued only insofar as members of the forces covered by that were concerned.

* What the Federation seeks on behalf of currently serving personnel is: 
To successfully support this proposal the Federation realises it must break down opposition likely to be used against it, be it professional or lay, official or otherwise.

* Therefore, the Association accepts the following as representative of some of the arguments put forward by those who would object to general acceptance of TB for ex-servicemen: 
By and large items (a) to (e) cover any advices which may be tendered you as grounds on which to base a rejection of the extension now sought by the Federation.

* Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Federation wants section 37 (3.)

* In view of this the Federation holds the time has not yet arrived to cancel out a special tuberculosis coverage to servicemen, more especially so when the servicemen are at war.

* This has been the result of the running battle that is constantly waged between the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Graziers Federal Council.

* The Joint Committee's report pointed out that, at the time of Federation, the first House of Representatives of 75 members provided one member for every 50,000 persons.

* One of the precedents, which was set by a notable character, is to be found in the arrangements that were made between the Labour Government and the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation in 1948.

* At that time the Wheatgrowers Federation stood in a position equivalent to that of the Australian Wool Industry Conference today.

* As Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I put forward a wheat stabilisation scheme for the Wheatgrowers Federation to consider.

* There was no reference whatsoever to the contents of the bill which would follow the agreement between the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the Commonwealth Government of the day.

* The Federation and the wheat growers of Australia showed 100 per cent, good faith in the word of the Commonwealth Government under  Mr. Chifley.

* It went even further and said that the principle had been properly applied since Federation.

* I am glad to say that the parties have agreed - they included the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Federated Storemen and Packers Union of Australia on the one hand and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union on the other hand.

* Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a newspaper report of an argument between the Victorian Minister for Health and the Hospital Employees Federation which indicates that the Secretary of the No.

* 2 Branch of the Federation has described some of Victoria's private hospitals as death houses' and 'fire traps'?

* The age to which people remain at school is very much higher now than it was at the time of Federation or even two years ago.

* One would think it to be essential that the " Congressional Record " of the largest **federation** in the world would be available for reference by members of the Federal Parliament in this country, whose Constitution is so largely based on that of the United States.

* Often, he went interstate to cadge from other branches of the miners' **federation** for the relief of the hungry masses in the midst of which I was reared.

* I might add that I found that the delegates at the Federation of Australian Universities Staffs Association Conference found allocations to the Wollongong University College so low as to be inexplicable.

* Federation of Australian University Staffs Association which met recently in Canberra.

* It reads as follows: 
That is an amazing statement when one remembers that we have had **federation** for 60 years.

* Honorable members will, of course, understand that we are not in reality creating a new institution, but are rather proposing that the library services of the Commonwealth which have grown up without formal provisions since **federation** should now be the subject of legislation by this Parliament.

* The following subjects are covered by films that have been preserved: The **federation** ceremonies of 1901, the ceremony connected with the naming of Canberra in 1913, the building of Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the conquest of the prickly pear in 1936.

* If he wishes the conference over which he intends to preside next week, for the purpose of bringing peace to the waterfront, to succeed, will he use his considerable influence with the employers to restrain them from issuing more summons on members of the Waterside Workers Federation, because such action and the imposition of fines merely cause more stoppages and more fines, resulting in an atmosphere which will militate against any possibility of success at the conference table?

* It has been callous, brutal, intimidatory and designed to blackmail the Waterside Workers Federation into co-operation in what the Government thought should be done on the waterfront.

* It is estimated that the membership of the Waterside Workers Federation will be reduced from the present 22,000 to 12,000 within the next 5 years.

* I understand that the Government has guaranteed to the Federation that the men who will be displaced by these new methods of automation will be given suitable other employment.

* The Government wonders why the Federation had to fight back, at times very viciously.

* This Bill tidies up the weaknesses of the 1961 legislation- 
I congratulate Charlie Fitzgibbon, the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, on what I regard as the remarkable example of leadership that he has given since he took up his position.

* The people, the Government and the Federation have much for which to thank him.

* The ALP now has a proper policy; the first one put out by any party in nearly 70 years since **federation**.

* The Melbourne petition was originated by  Mr P.  Malone, who is Secretary of the Victorian Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation.

* The list also contains the names of  Mr A.  E. Bull, a Communist, who is secretary of the Australian Waterside Workers Federation;  Mr E.  McCormick, an Australian Labor Party member of the Central Executive;  Mr H.  Rourke, an Australian Labor Party member;  Mr G.  Swayne, a member of the Communist Party; and  Mr Hillier,  a member of the Communist Party.

* I am sure that this is the first time since **federation** that a government has made grants to encourage young people to acquire homes.

* But the Opposition always glosses over the fact that we are living in a **federation** and the State governments do take seriously their responsibilities in the field of education.

* A neighbouring country, the Federation of Malaya, with whom we have the friendliest of relations, is merging itself with other territories - Singapore, the British Borneo territories and Brunei - in a larger **federation** which will carry substantially greater responsibilities for foreign affairs and defence and internal government and administration.

* As the House knows, this Government from the outset has watched with sympathetic interest the progress towards the establishment of the Federation of Malaysia.

* Not the least of the virtues of Malaysia, we felt, and we still feel, was that it represented a major act of orderly decolonization, bringing, as it would, a number of territories in various stages of dependence but with a common administrative background and currency and with close economic and political ties to full independence and security within a wider **federation**.

* It is in Australia's interests that the **federation** should come into existence, and we have framed and conducted our diplomacy accordingly.

* A most important first step was the agreement between the Prime Ministers of the Federation of Malaya and of Singapore on 24th August, 1961, on the terms and conditions of Singapore's entry into Malaysia.

* Great credit is due to the Federation and Singapore Governments for the realistic way in which they addressed themselves to this situation and concluded the agreement to which I have referred.

* It is, I repeat, a matter for satisfaction that the Singapore Government and people saw that their true interests for prosperity, economic growth and freedom lay in a merger with the **federation**.

* The British and Malayan governments also decided, at the November,  1961,  meeting, that the existing Anglo-Malayan defence agreement should be extended to embrace the whole of the new Malaysian Federation as and when founded.

* When Malaya told us of her intentions to merge with the three British crown colonies of Sarawak, Brunei and British North Borneo as one **federation**, we told them that we have no objections.

* As I shall show, the " will for freedom " of the peoples of Sarawak and North Borneo has been clearly and positively expressed as being for freedom and independence within the Federation of Malaysia.

* Also, President Macapagal of the Philippines publicly criticized the proposed Malaysia Federation.

* This document, however, is of great importance in that it contains the agreed results of the negotiations and discussions among the future partners in the Malaysia Federation on the nature and structure of the **federation**.

* The very wide measure of agreement among all interested parties, taken with the flexible and rational recommendations made, gives solid grounds for the future prospects of the **federation**.

* It became quite clear that the proposed **federation**, bearing in mind its nature and the proposed distribution of powers - so much scope in their own affairs being reserved for the Borneo territories - was the best available practical solution to the problems which the decolonizing of these territories - and Singapore - would create.

* There has never been adequate co-operation between issue, except the Financial Agreement, in the whole history of **federation**.

* It will consist of four representatives from the Graziers Federal Council of Australia, two representatives from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, and one representative from the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation, and the Graziers' Federal Council of Australia will all be able to influence the work of their representatives.

* Mrs Ellis  is the Secretary of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation.

* This is what she wrote: 
On behalf of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation I have been instructed to convey lo your Government the rejection by the Federation of the 1068-69 Budgetary pension increases as being totally inadequate.

* The honorable member doubtless knows that a meeting was held between representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the foremen and the Australian Council of Trade Unions within recent weeks to discuss this matter.

* That being so, I am quite certain that justice is done to the men and I hope that the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation will in future put the appeals to the judge rather than hold them up as they have done in the past.

* I think it is timely to point out that perhaps the gravest blunder committed by any Commonwealth Government since **federation** was the application of the credit squeeze by this Government without first ascertaining what effect it would have on key industries, particularly the building industry.

* They span nearly a third of the time since Federation.

* He was a distinguished figure in that House during the fragile life of the West Indies Federation - which he opposed - between 1958 and 1962, and then as  Deputy  Prime Minister and finally as Prime Minister of independent Jamaica.

* Through the periods of self-government, **federation** and independence  Sir Donald  Sangster was in the forefront of his country's political development.

* We have said that when the people of the whole island make their choice - whether they decide to become an independent republic, whether they decide to become part of a Melanesian **federation**, whether they decide to become a part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, as we would like, or whether they decide to become a part of Indonesia, we shall accept and respect the decision, which will have been made by them and by them alone.

* I know that in 1962 in the Federation of Malaya and in Singapore there were more than 2,500,000 Chinese.

* By way of reference, I would like to go back to the evening of 13th August, 1958, when I produced in this House specific evidence of the use of  a  unity ticket in the Waterside Workers Federation in Brisbane.

* In Queensland, a very mild reprimand was given to those members of the Australian Labour Party who shared in the conduct of the Waterside Workers Federation unity ticket.

* During the Australian Railways Union election in that State last year, there was the most flagrant evidence of the use of a unity ticket, and already a unity ticket is in the process of drafting for the Waterside Workers Federation election to be held in Victoria this year.

* Therefore, the status of the Post Office has never, since Federation been that of a statutory authority.

* May I be permitted to remind the House that over the years since Federation there have been some very deep and detailed investigations into the Post Office.

* I would like to refer to a couple of points in this because these observations back in 1908 underline why it is that we have continued through the history of Federation to look upon the Post Office as we do.

* In my opinion, it is an effective mechanism, which, if applied and used by the Waterside Workers Federation and by the shipowners, will prevent strikes.

* The award made by  Mr. Justice  Ashburner contains a clause which enjoins the Waterside Workers Federation from being a party to strikes on the waterfront.

* The presidential member who deals with matters affecting the waterfront decided the dispute substantially in favour of the Waterside Workers Federation, and varied the award.

* The men had the right of access to arbitration but the Sydney officials of the Waterside Workers Federation preferred to pull on a strike and hold up the operation of the port for some time.

* If the regular procedure were followed instead of strikes being used as a direct means of obtaining the **federation**'s objective, I am certain that not only would the waterside workers receive far more substantial wages than they have received in the past but also that there would be a much faster despatch of cargoes from the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.

* I think that the reason they do not go to arbitration is that some of the officials of the **federation** do not want them to do so.

* During the last two weeks, there have been reports that Norman Docker has said that the policy of the Waterside Workers Federation is not to resort to arbitration.

* I do not think that that is the policy of the **federation**.

* Docker is the industrial officer of the **federation**.

* We must remember that when he states that the **federation** does not want arbitration but wants direct action.

* But he was not until recently an elected official of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* As an industrial officer of the **federation**,  Mr. Docker  was not elected as are the other officials.

* It proves, first, that there is no need for strikes, and, secondly, that the men do not want them but are pulled out on strike by the officials of the Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The loss of holiday pay on this occasion is due to a palpable error, as I said yesterday, by the officials of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* This represents a real threat to the existence of the Waterside Workers Federation as an effective and viable organization.

* If the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation will allow arbitration to work, two things will happen.

* My answer to that statement is in clear terms: The Waterside Workers Federation gave me an assurance that it would cease the stoppages if there was conciliation on the waterfront and that differences between the men and management, if they could not be settled by negotiation, would be settled by recourse to arbitration.

* That assurance was given by both the **federation** and the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* For four months, the **federation** lived up to its promises, and there is no reason why it should not live up to them now.

* has a responsibility to compel the Waterside Workers Federation to stand by the assurance that it gave to me in June last year.

* He obviously obtained his information not from  Mr. Charlie  Fitzgibbon, the secretary of the **federation**, but from some other members of the **federation** opposed to the rank and file, opposed to the Australian Labour Party representatives within the executive of the **federation**.

* It cannot be said that members of the Parliament, throughout the whole period since Federation, have been avaricious or greedy.

* The States are important in the Federation, but their powers are diminishing and the deliberations and decisions of this National Parliament are assuming more and more importance in the public mind.

* It was the wish of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation some weeks ago that no additional storages should be provided because it felt that such action would result in an impost on the Australian wheatgrower and that wheat growers in some States would have to pay the additional charge even though there was not any over-quota wheat in those States.

* The Federation considered that this would be an injustice to those farmers.

* But the Federation reconsidered the position at a meeting 3 weeks later, that is about a fortnight ago, and as a result said that it would support any request for additional finance from a State that had an over-quota problem.

* As a result of a change of attitude by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation arrangements were made with the Australian Wheat Board to use the Board's funds for the provision of temporary storage, but in making the arrangements the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation asked that the States which received the benefit of the additional storage pay for the additional storage and that the cost should not be borne by wheatgrowers over the whole of the nation.

* It is ironic that in the Budget we are discussing, we on this side who are federalists should be doing our utmost to destroy **federation** by handing the States more tied grants.

* What a mass of contradictions the Minister must involve himself in should he try to apply his easy generalisations to the exclusion of Singapore from the Malaysian Federation, for example; and when he applies it to the war in Vietnam, the consequences are calamitous.

* He was asked if he thought Malaysia's support for South Vietnam  would weigh against the Federation in the eyes of the Afro-Asian Nations.

* I will not traverse in detail, as the Minister has already done, the course of events which has led to Singapore's exclusion from the Federation of Malaysia.

* Indeed, both the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the Prime Minister of Singapore have frequently stated that the common will to resist Indonesian aggression served to unite and strengthen the Federation.

* In such a fluid and delicate situation, I do not want to venture into the realm of phophesy as to what may happen in the existing component parts of the Federation, or in Singapore itself.

* Yet we have our troops committed in that area, presumably to defend both parts of what was then a Federation, but is now two separate parts.

* What are the obligations of our forces in the event of further internal dissension between the remaining component parts or States of the Federation?

* It is now an independent nation, though bound very closely by new treaty arrangements to the Federation of which it was, until a week ago, an integral part.

* What little time the honorable member for Lalor devoted to anything but wool marketing he devoted to telling us that members of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation were opposed to this proposal.

* I congratulate the people who have succeeded in achieving the present state of co-operation, in particular the new presidents of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, respectively.

* It is interesting to point out that the member of the Australian Wool Bureau who moved the original resolution advocating raising the promotion levy to 1 a bale in five years' time is a member of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* At present, the bureau consists of three wool-growers from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, three wool-growers from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and one government representative, who.

* Will the Minister discuss this matter with the  president  of that union, who, I understand, is here in Canberra, to see whether the union  president  will enter into discussions with the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to ensure that, even if hardship is caused to women and children and coworkers by such a strike, the Victorian waterfront workers will not be victimized by having to strike as they did a fortnight ago?

* I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry as a result of recent meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council and the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, at which discussions took place in relation to the excess of wheat production over estimated sales.

* As the recommendations suggested by the Federation have far reaching effects on many wheat growers throughout Australia, particularly in Victoria, where the recommended quota of 65 million bushels has been exceeded in 6 out of the last 9 years, I ask the Minister the following questions: Has he considered these proposals?

* Remarkably enough, we had the latest illustration of this only yesterday, when three judges sitting as a bench of the Commonwealth Industrial Court fined the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia 500 because some of its members in Melbourne saw fit to strike when they could not get an industrial dispute satisfactorily resolved.

* It was thought at the time that New Zealand might join the proposed **federation**.

* The main interest of the convention of 1891 was not directed at the prohibition against the Commonwealth to legislate for aborigines, and, assuming that New Zealand would join the **federation**, at any prohibition against the Commonwealth's passing legislation for Maoris.

* The whole section began to be misinterpreted by successive Commonwealth governments after the establishment of **federation** and after it was adopted in its present form.

* I think it was some time during the days of the Chifley Government that the first alterations were made; but it was a long time after **federation** before anything was done to give the aboriginal people the social service benefits that other Australians enjoy.

* The British went around the world at one time hawking their unwanted federations - the West Indies, the Central African Federation and Nigeria - all of which have fallen to pieces.

* 1  do not think the British Government can face the fact that its Nigerian Federation was an unmitigated disaster for the people within it, having regard to the way things have worked out.

* It might be pertinent to remind the Commonwealth that when Federation took place the States handed over for free all the property that was needed by the Commonwealth.

* I quote the following from the March 1965 issue of "Your Home", the official journal of the Federation of Co-operative Housing Societies of Victoria - 
There are a good many silences in the statement made by the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies);  but he was not silent on 14th July of this year when he said that he understood the United States view that the defence of the new **federation** should be a Commonwealth of Nations responsibility.

* Bearing in mind the fundamental agreement of the three participating governments in the Manila meetings, and the statement by the Republic of Indonesia and the Republic of the Philippines that they would welcome the formation of Malaysia provided that the support of the people of the territories was ascertained by me and that, in my opinion, complete compliance with the principle of self-determination within the requirements of General Assembly resolution 1541 (XV), Principle IX of the Annex, was ensured, my conclusions, based on the findings of the Mission, is that on both of these counts there is no doubt about the wishes of a sizeable majority of the peoples of these territories to join in the Federation of Malaysia.

* So, insofar as we can say that an effort has been made to get an objective view of the state of opinion in the Federation of Malaysia, the people do desire to unite.

* In fact, we have had a great negative verification of that in the decision of Brunei not to enter the **federation**.

* No one coerced Brunei to enter the **federation** and it has not entered the **federation**, although at one stage it was expected that it would.

* Let us now have a look at some of the fines imposed, under the terms of the Act, on the Waterside Workers Federation of 
Australia.

* The Federation is under the control of its Federal Secretary,  Mr. Charlie  Fitzgibbon, who is a member of the Australian Labour Party - and a very well respected member, too.

* Since the making of the 1960 award, fines imposed on the Federation have totalled 17,000.

* At the request of the Government of the Federation of Malaya, they assist that Government in operations against the communist terrorists remaining in the area of the border between Malaya and Thailand.

* The use of Malayan bases by overseas Commonwealth forces is provided for in the Defence Agreement of 1957 between the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Federation of Malaya.

* We must bear in mind the tremendous importance of our export trade with Indonesia, the Federation of Malaya, India and other Asian nations.

* Before **federation**, the area that now comprises the Territory was rapidly going ahead.

* I turn now to the condemnation, not by the Melbourne Trades Hall Council or  Mr. A.  E. Monk, but by the secretary of the Victorian Employers Federation - a highly conservative body.

* It states- 
This year's Federal Budget gave little evidence of the much-publicized talks between the Government and industry, the Victorian Employers' Federation claimed today.

* The **federation**'s weekly service letter says the business world might well be pardoned for considering that the series of conferences were to all intents and purposes a waste of time.

* The specialized local knowledge of Trade Commissioners has been particularly valuable in the negotiation of trade agreements with overseas governments, including those of the Federal German Republic, the Federation of Malaya and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.

* For my part, I feel I would be negligent if I did not support a policy which since **federation** has meant the building of a society of which we are proud and in which, with tolerence and understanding, many of those people are intermingling as an indication that we are not racial but are humanitarian and idealistic in a practical way.

* It was never thought of at the time of **federation**, but the High Court has ruled that it has something to do with the postal powers of the Commonwealth.

* Last night the spokesman for the Opposition devoted his time, very properly, because it is a large matter, not to attacking the transfer of the right of recruitment to the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and away from the Waterside Workers Federation - I could not detect that he said anything about that point; that seems to go by silence, and he also said nothing about the rights of appeal or disciplinary procedures, that I could detect - but, as the Leader of the Opposition did this morning, entirely to Part III of the Bill.

* The Minister said that Docker told the Commission that the Waterside Workers Federation -  would determine how it would act to secure its claims; and that even if all its industrial claims were granted frequent disputes could be expected until the industry was nationalised.

* Should the Waterside Workers Federation retain its monopoly right of recruitment?

* Just let us remember - indeed everybody does - that under the existing legislation this Federation has a position of privilege, described just now by the Leader of the Opposition as a unique position.

* The selection of the person to be presented in the first instance is made by the Federation.

* Should the Federation retain this right?

* There has been no serious attempt, in the face of the facts put before the House by the Minister, to say that the Federation should retain this right.

* It has yet to be said by the Opposition, if it is ever going to be said at all, that it wants the present state of privilege for the Federation to continue.

* The Federation has had an industrial privilege.

* Was this unplanned, or was this desired by the Communists who are the real directors of the Federation?

* They are real directors of the Federation.

* However, in the case of the Waterside Workers Federation, the union that has these tremendous and unique privileges, the loss has been 55 hours a year.

* Therefore, I conclude by saying that the Communist Docker, to whom I have made a reference before - the advocate of the Federation - summed up the whole position with singular lucidity.

* Docker said - 
I repeat, this is the advocate for the Waterside Workers Federation.

* There is an official challenge on behalf of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Participants were the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the Waterside Workers Federation and my Department.

* In the first place, the organisational framework which came out of the National Conference, and to which we are now giving effect, is fundamentally of the making of the employers and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* lust what comes out of the new arrangements will depend heavily on how the Waterside Workers' Federation and the managements of the individual operational companies and the holding company discharge their responsibilities.

* On the Federation front, I discern a new attitude.

* I would not for a moment imagine it was universally held, but there is plainly abroad, at long last, the realisation that the interests of the Federation's members can be advanced best by putting co-operation to the forefront in the resolving of the industry's problems.

* If the employers and the Federation both bring to their responsibilities a conviction that their respective interests in the industry are matched by obligations to the community at large, we will be well on the way to a stevedoring industry which is both efficient and notable for sensible human and industrial relations.

* In that event there would be many serious effects on the economic and financial position of the poorer States, and this could bring into question the very basis of **federation**.

* I realise that the whole basis of Federation is that there should be an equal distribution throughout the Commonwealth, but if we compare New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia we find that in New South Wales, which has 38% of Australia's population, the combined total per head of capital payments and general revenue from the Commonwealth grants is $168.

* I think this demonstrates perfectly how well the Federation is working, in spite of the difficulties mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.

* If we are going to have a look at this matter fully, I think we should go back to the time of Federation.

* Since Federation the cost of living has gone up about 51 times.

* But the consultation fee received by a doctor for treating a patient has gone up since Federation only one and a half times.

* fee about which we hear so many grumblings represents two and a half times the fee at Federation.

* I contrast this with the increase in the cost of living which is now five and a half times more than it was at Federation.

* In other words, doctors' fees have risen by approximately half the amount that the cost of living has increased since Federation.

* There is nothing contrary to the federal principle in it, because the American **federation** has done it.

* I know there are certain differences, constitutionally, between the American **federation** and ours, but this authority obviously could operate at the Commonwealth's own wish in the Northern Territory and it could, with the permission of the governments of Queensland and Western Australia, operate within their territories, because that is precisely what the Snowy Mountains Authority did.

* The Cotton and Manmade Fibres Federation points out that the Tariff Board Report indicates that the Board failed to obtain cost evidence from Japan and the United States of America, although imports from these two countries represent 62 per cent of total imports.

* The Board's failure to do the necessary job of obtaining cost information in the opinion of the Federation indicates a peculiar attitude- 
I think that is quite mild -  particularly when the Board has decided to remove emergency duties.

* Some members of the Federation have expressed the view that serious unemployment could follow and that the Board has given the " kiss of death " to a very important secondary industry.

* The Federation has asked the Government to take the initiative to remedy the situation and has asked for advice as to what the Government proposes to do.

* The honourable member for Wimmera said that he did not like opposing the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation.

* 1 do not mind opposing the Federation; in fact, i enjoy it because 1 have found out that the Federation was determined to accept the wheat stabilisation scheme, come hell or high water.

* In a motion, they accepted my suggestion but they could not get moving until the Federation meeting the following Friday.

* When they put the proposition to the Wheatgrowers Federation in Melbourne, I understand that  Mr Saint,  who is  Chairman  of the Federation, said: 'We do not want any politicians leading us to Canberra'.

* 1 have the right to do so from 800 wheat growers but not from the Federation'.

* As soon as the Federation heard about this the  Chairman  decided that he would get in touch with the Prime Minister and come up to Canberra himself, because he did not want any politicians introducing him.

* I wired back to him and said: 'I appreciate the sentiments contained in your telegram, but the Wheatgrowers Federation gave me no chance whatsoever to assist in the negotiations'.

* Why should I worry about the Federation?

* As aviation was in its infancy at the time of **federation** it is not surprising that there is no direct reference to civil aviation or air navigation in any of the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution.

* I have a keen awareness of the deterioration that has occurred in the river system of northern New South Wales over the 63 years since **federation**.

* The Liberal Party of Australia, under either that name or other names, and the Australian Country Party have sat on the treasury bench for more than 46 years since **federation**.

* In fact, it has been in the Constitution since **federation**.

* Mr. T.  W. Lillie, who was  president  of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation in 1945, said - 
One thing has happened here to which I wish to draw attention.

* This should have been well known to the Sydney officials of the Waterside Workers Federation, but they made a palpable blunder, for which the men had to pay, when they pulled on the strike on the days on which they did.

* The Sydney officials of the **federation** have only themselves to blame.

* Faced with a choice between remaining British colonies and becoming part of the Malaysian Federation, the public men and citizens of Sabah and Sarawak made it plain that they wanted to join Malaysia.

* In my opinion, therefore, die territorial limits of an Australian colony at **federation** did not include any part of the territorial sea or the seabed subjacent to it Federation did not increase those territorial limits so mat since **federation** the territorial limits of a State are to be found at the low water mark on its coasts.

* I remind him that the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation supports this legislation and can see merit in it.

* I say quite frankly that the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has agreed to this proposal and is prepared to be a party to it.

* Part of the arrangement was that this **federation** should be recognized by having one representative on the committee.

* I have no criticism to offer of the policy on immigration that has been followed since **federation**, and I hope that it will not be changed as the honourable member suggests, to give us an open door policy with all the tragedies and bitterness that would result from it.

* What assistance are Opposition members, who are the elected parliamentary representatives of their party, giving to the decent members of the Labour movement in the Waterside Workers Federation, who have been trying for years to throw out the Communists and are being intimidated for dong so?

* It met to determine its attitude to the Bill and how it would react to the requests that were being made by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The second thing that happened was that there was a deputation to members of the Australian Labour Party - indeed, to its Industrial Relations Committee - by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The honorable member for Stirling also said that the penalties imposed on the Federation - this poor, innocent Federation - since 1960 amount to 25,000 and its legal fees in that time total 10,000.

* As he is the leading industrial man, so called, on the Opposition side, he would know of the common boast of the Executive of the Federation when the Commonwealth Industrial Court imposes the maximum fine of 500 on it.

* I just wonder what the decent rank and file members of the Federation think when they look back on those years since 1960 and notice that 35,000 of their money has been deliberately wasted in this way by their leaders.

* I should imagine that 35,000 could be well spent today among and for the benefit of the members of the Federation.

* officials in the Federation why do not he and his colleagues do something about it?

* The unhappy thing is that a minority - and it is a minority - controls this Federation, as I shall endeavour to show.

* We have talked to Waterside Workers Federation officials, to stevedores, to the owners of shipping, and to other people associated with the waterfront.

* Today there is a sanction imposed by the Federation on any gang loading more than 450 bales.

* The Australian Road Federation Ltd, which has done a tremendous amount of work in trying to keep us informed on the important road problems of Australia, placed before members prior to the last election a plan to create a federal ministry of transport patterned partially on the new American ministry to which I will refer presently.

* These suggestions were put to us by the Australian Road Federation which also pointed out to us that America had recently passed through Congress a Department of Transportation Act, consolidating various transportation functions but excluding maritime activities.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation has made a request for the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to make an economic survey of the industry.

* Is it a fact that selection of the men was not made on the basis of seniority of service in their previous employment, but that every effort was exerted to exclude any who had had a long membership and association with the miners **federation**?

* All these things indicate a dangerous weakening of the **federation** as the pioneers of our Commonwealth envisaged it.

* But the growth of this trend and feeling - which, no doubt, is greatly loved by opponents of this Government - presents an enormous and alarming threat, not only to the **federation** as we know it but also to the maintenance of the good government to which the people of Australia are entitled.

* I hope that this Government will  therefore  consider as a matter of urgency the recommendation of the all-party Constitutional Review Committee in respect to section 124 of the Australian Constitution so that, as rapidly as possible, machinery can be provided for greater decentralization of political power by the creation of more self-governing units in the **federation**.

* The situation in which the Australian Commonwealth finds itself to-day was recognized eight years before **federation** by  Sir Henry  Parkes, that great pioneer of **federation**, when he said - 
From the stand-points of defence, economy and development, too many of our people are concentrated in limited areas.

* They give a lead that Australia must follow if it is to be developed as it should develop, if we are to show the world that we are entitled to hold our country, and if we are to preserve this **federation**, and to give the people true self-government.

* In fact, the whole history of sew State efforts since Federation reveals an appalling denial by Australians of democratic rights to Australians.

* I believe that many of the problems facing both the Commonwealth and the States stem either directly or indirectly from our failure, during the 60 years of **federation**, adequately to decentralize politically.

* If a waterside worker moves from the Waterside Workers Federation to the Sydney Waterfront First Aid Service 1 understand he takes with him his service as a waterside worker and is granted a ceredit for that service in calculating his long service leave entitlement with the First Aid Service, but while he is with that Service his service there is not counted in determining continuity of service if he subsequently seeks reregistration with the Waterside Workers Federation.

* I feel that a man who can become a foreman stevedore and resign from the Foreman Stevedores Association and be readily accepted by the Waterside Workers Federation must be efficient as a waterside worker and efficient, just and reliable as a foreman stevedore.

* I understand that it was requested by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Government has decided to allow a man to move from the Waterside Workers Federation to the Sydney waterfront first aid service and still retain his service as a waterside worker for long service leave purposes.

* We have seen campaign after campaign by the Waterside Workers Federation for a non-contributory pension scheme, for permanent hiring, for long service leave, sick leave and annual leave.

* Is it any wonder that the former General Secretary of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation,  Mr Stott,  has criticised the Government for not recognising mainland China and has asked, very logically, how on earth can Australia, if it has not got an embassy in mainland China, expect to compete with the other marketing countries which have embassies in mainland China and which have commercial attaches to push sales of their products.

* Mr Clyde  Cameron, a member of this Parliament;  Mr Fred  Birrell, a member of this Parliament;  Mr Don  Dunstan, Premier of South Australia; and we had also  Mr Charlie  Wells, who is Secretary of the Port Adelaide Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* What are the terms and what is the cost of the means test proposals which the Australian Public Service Federation made to the Government in November?

* Since **federation**, Australia's trade has been geared to the British market.

* But, as the honorable member for Lawson  (Mr. Failes)  pointed out, if the Opposition's amendment is carried there will be grave danger that we will have in this country not **federation**, which is what we stand for, but unification.

* We must remember that this Government was in office for almost every year since **federation**.

* I believe that the Commonwealth, which is the money-raising authority of the **federation**, has a responsibility to ensure that the money it raises from the people is spent as fruitfully and as wisely as possible.

* The Commonwealth is reluctant to take action within States, no doubt because it wants to preserve the spirit of **federation**, but what is our present **federation**?

* The history of the negotiations and manoeuvrings of the Premier of Victoria and the incompetence of the Commonwealth Government provide one of the most discreditable chapters in the history of Australian Federation.

* I understand that the Employers' Federation has stated that serious deterioration in industrial relations has occurred on the waterfront since the introduction of the new permanent employment scheme on 8th January in that it has been an industrial and economic failure.

* What steps has the Government taken to use its good offices in the unhappy relationship that exists between the countries of that conceptual **federation**, namely, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia?

* Units of the Australian Navy, Army and Air Force continue to serve in the British Commonwealth Strategic Reserve - an arrangement in which the Government of the Federation of Malaya concurs.

* The trade agreement with the Federation of Malaya is due for review later this year.

* The Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation has called the Budget a malnutrition Budget.

* It is crystal clear that the Government is pursuing a policy based on the concept that once a citizen loses his productive capacity as a result of sickness, age or war caused injury he is to be placed in the category of the forgotten or, as the Federal  President  of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation more aptly puts it, is to be left to die off.

* I have not received a final report from the industry as to its reaction to the Commonwealth's proposal - it wanted time to confer with the Wheat Growers Federation and with the State organisations - but if it were categorically to refuse to accept the proposal and if the Commonwealth were to abrogate its responsibility completely regarding any stabilisation or marketing scheme, the consequences would be quite terrifying.

* This principle is in grave danger in Australia where certain States are so large and powerful as to destroy ultimately the balance of **federation** unless they are subdivided.

* As no new State has been formed under this power in the 61 years since **federation**, the committee recommended in effect that if the States will not act the Commonwealth shall have power to do so.

* 1 submit that the committee's recommendations are eminently reasonable for the following reasons: First, since **federation** there have been persistent attempts, especially in northern New South Wales and Queensland, to secure from their parliaments the division of these unwieldy areas into new States; secondly, since 1920. and especially since 1948, the New England New State Movement of northern New South Wales has pressed its claims for separate statehood with increasing vigour and supporting facts; thirdly, in 1922 on the motion of  Colonel Bruxner,  M.L.A., the New South Wales Parliament affirmed that the State was too large for effective self-government; fourthly, in 1923 the New South Wales Parliament, on my motion, appointed the Cohen royal commission to inquire into and report upon the desirability and practicability of creating new States - that commission reported adversely, but useful reforms followed; fifthly, in 1926 evidence was given by the movement before the Commonwealth Peden commission which recommended an amendment of the Constitution to make Chapter VI.

* More than 60 years of **federation** have proved that the existing mainland States have failed to achieve a balanced development and a reasonable distribution of population.

* In the words of the father of **federation**.

* Sir Henry  Parkes, uttered 65 years ago - 
This movement is as natural as **federation** and is its natural corollary.

* Division of Food Preservation, at the request of the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, has carried out an investigation into the use of sulphur dioxide as a preservative for comminuted (minced) meat.

* From the beginning of **federation**, this Parliament has accepted the principle, which is different to the principle applied in some of the State legislatures, that, as nearly as possible, voting power in the various constituencies should be equal.

* That was part of the compact under which Tasmania was brought in to the **federation** and I doubt whether any loyal Tasmanian would have agreed to come in without such a compact.

* The section and placitum were proposed in the earliest conventions, and in their original expression they represented attempts to withhold from the Federal Parliament that was to come into being the power to legislate for the people of the Maori race and the people of the aboriginal race, it being envisaged at that time that New Zealand wouldbe part of the **federation**.

* It is not right for the Labour Party, when it is in Opposition, to put all the blame on the Government for late sittings because there have been late sittings, to my knowledge, for the past 20 years and probably since Federation.

* He placed a question on the notice paper recently in which he asked for the number of sitting days each year since Federation.

* I studied the reply very closely and noticed that shortly after Federation there were up to 124 sitting days a year.

* Speaking from memory, I believe that the House sat for more than 100 days on only five occasions in any 12 months, and four of those occasions were very close to the time of Federation.

* After Federation the Parliament had to sit more hours and on more days than is now the case in order to place on the statute book much of the legislation upon which we still act.

* I am sure that all Australians who have had the opportunity of listening to this debate to-night, or who will read reports of it in the newspapers to-morrow will regret deeply that although the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell)  commenced by expressing the Opposition's support of the establishment of the Malaysian Federation, he then proceeded to give reason after reason why the Opposition does not support it.

* If similar conditions are to be forced on the smaller countries, particularly this new Federation of Malaysia, the possibility of their steady social and economic development must be seriously threatened.

* The Australian Government, with due consideration for the stability of the new countries that is so essential to Australia"s security, has wisely decided to support the new **federation**, and it is the extent of this support that we are now considering.

* The reason for Australia's support of the new **federation** are many.

* I repeat that it is within the capacity of Malaya, in conjunction with Singapore and the new **federation**, to provide the economic and administrative effort needed by the rather more backward countries, the Borneo protectorates, for their progress and development.

* What is abundantly clear - it has been explained and accentuated in the statement by the Prime Minister  (Sir Robert Menzies)  concerning Australia's attitude towards and its understanding with the United Kingdom and Malaysia - is that we must leave no doubt in Indonesian minds about what national action we will take should Indonesia's present policies lead it into an attack on the new **federation**, even at the obvious and probable risk of incurring the full blast of hostility which all along has descended on the heads of any nation that expresses opposition to Indonesian demands.

* In view of the report of the United Nations visiting mission, accepted by the Secretary-General, U Thant, as a reasonable appreciation of the wishes of the people concerned, we must expect to have the weight of world opinion with us when we declare for the maintenance and security of the new Malaysia Federation.

* As a matter of fact it is much easier for honorable members to contact their constituents and for constituents to contact their members in these electorates than it ever has been in the history of Federation till now.

* For the first time since Federation the member for the Northern Territory belongs to a Party on the Government side of the chamber, and the Labor Party has never got over the shock of losing the seat.

* I mention this to show the sort of political opportunist with whom we are dealing in a matter of significance, electorally, not only to the people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory but also to all the States of Australia, in which the move for **federation** started.

* This was a basic element without which efforts 1o get the six States to come together as a **federation** would not have been successful.

* This is an important point, lt was the six Stales that formed the **federation**.

* The tolerance provision has been in the Act since Federation.

* Is he aware that  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, has welcomed the idea of such a conference, which was put forward by  Mr. Anderson,  Director of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia?

* A committee was set up under the chairmanship of  Sir Alexander  Fitzgerald to ascertain the total expenditure on capital works in the Post Office since **federation**- since 1901.

* In 1959 the Treasurer or the Government or somebody decided tha.t in future the Post Office would pay interest on its capital expenditure right from **federation**, and a figure of $680m was arrived at.

* I have another letter, from the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation.

* It states: 
The 1967 Budget will go down in the history of Australia as the blackest Budget for pensioners ever introduced by  a  Federal Treasurer-  1 have heard the Budget called many things, but the Pensioners' Federation terms it the blackest Budget'.

* The letter continues: 
The Federation has called on all pensioners to protest by going into mourning for one year, and to wear black armbands with the wording - 'Give us this day our daily bread.'

* As each member of the House, and the Senate, stands for the Lord's prayer, the Federation desires each representative of the people to reflect deeply in their conscience on these words - 'Give us this day our daily bread', and to realise that the consequence of the Black Budget of 1967 is to condemn many thousands of Australia's aged, infirm, and widowed to malnutrition and starvation - subsequent illnesses and possible death.

* Ian Sinclair, to tha WA Country Party State Annual Conference, 25/7/67, the Federation replied by letter, 29/7/67, to three points made by the Minister, which tha Federation considered reflected Government thinking on Social Services and the 1967 Budget provisions.

* The Black Budget of 1967 has proved the correctness of the Federation as regards Government policy on social service pensions.

* The Federation replied to him by stating: 
Should this be the case, it shows the Government is ignoring all that has been said by the academics, social workers, the ACTU, church bodies and the Federation.

* In reply to this the Federation stated: 
The Federation stated in reply: 
In the forthcoming debate on the 1967 Budget the Federation hope to hear the voice of conscience from those members of the Government appalled by the lack of consideration for the weakest and most defenceless members of the community - the pensioners.

* That paper was printed and published for the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and was signed by A. Arnell,  president,  471 Adelaide-street, Brisbane.

* Dr. Evatt  said - 
This organization has been working in the U.S.A. for ten or eleven years, and the American Government has decided that it is to the advantage of the **federation** to find the cost of head works and provide the money free of interest.

* This action has been requested by theindustry itself, following an agreement reached on the matter by the Australian Wool Bureau and the two federal organizations of woolgrowers represented on the bureau, namely, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* In May last the Australian Wool Bureau conferred on the matter with the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the two federal organizations of wool-growers represented on the bureau.

* On 5th July last, the Wool Bureau, the Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council met again, and on this occasion agreement was reached.

* While the Woolgrowers and Graziers Council adopted the proposal unanimously, the **federation** was somewhat divided in its ranks, and its ultimate acceptance of the increase was qualified by a number of reservations.

* What he failed to mention was that only today a situation arose in Sydney in which the Waterside Workers Federation ordered that each shift worked today be cut by 1 hour in an effort to force the employers into paying an amount of $40 so that every waterside worker can have a telephone installed in his own home.

* Some honourable members may stand up and champion the cause of the Waterside Workers Federation but they should remember that a lot of other trade unionists who live in their electorates receive the backlash of the condonation of acts which may not be described as completely responsible.

* The idea of crediting the Waterside Workers' Federation with the total number of lost hours on the waterfront is ridiculous.

* It must be borne in mind that members of the Waterside Workers' Federation have to work with danger and that they are well aware of this.

* These men are so aware of the need for safety within their industry that they even go so far as to impose penalties on members of the Federation who do not obey safety rules.

* Even though there are very few members of the Waterside Workers Federation within my electorate, in years gone by 1 have worked with many waterside workers and I know their worth.

* The electorate of East Sydney, which has been represented in this Parliament since **federation**, is composed of Randwick, Bondi Junction, Woollahra, Waverley, Darlinghurst, Paddington and Surry Hills.

* We on this side of the House, together with the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the Parents and Citizens' Federation of New South Wales and the Premier of New South Wales have on many occasions requested the federal Government to institute a national inquiry into all levels of education - primary, secondary and teacher training - along the lines of the recent inquiry into Australian universities.

* There have been restrictive trade practices laws in the greatest - oldest - **federation** - the United States of America - since the Sherman Act of 1890.

* The Attorney-General says that there has been even older legislation in the Canadian **federation** than in the United States.

* In a **federation** it is more than ever necessary that the people should have statutory rights.

* Yes; it was decided by the Full High Court in Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v. Alexander, (1918) 25 C.L.R.

* Honourable members know that in the history of **federation**, Labor has been in office for but a short period of time.

* And, I may add, this alarm is also shared by the Australian Public Service Federation - a **federation** of the State Public Service associations - which has also asked for legislation by this Parliament.

* And so does the Australian Public Service Federation.

* The Seamen's Union and the Waterside Workers Federation have a definite objective to disrupt the economy of Australia.

* Is he aware that 120 waterside workers walked off the " Canberra Star " in Sydney this week, alleging that the cargo for discharge had been loaded in Durban by forced prison labour, that the federal council of the Waterside Workers Federation congratulated the men on their protest against racial discrimination in South Africa, and that the support of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is being sought for an Australia-wide ban against the handling of cargo from South Africa allegedly loaded by political prisoners?

* Does he recognize this stand by the Waterside Workers Federation as being contrary to the spirit of the recently completed peace agreement entered into with the union and an attempt to have the Government's authority in determining international relationships and policies flouted?

* When introducing the Stevedoring Industry Bill last Thursday night the Minister placed great stress on the number of nominations by the Waterside Workers Federation of applicants for employment with criminal records.

* Were the same facilities available to the Waterside Workers Federation to ascertain which men had criminal records?

* I feel I must correct or re-assure him by pointing out that the extract from my speech was in fact a quotation from a speech made by the Leader of the Australian Country Party last month when he was addressing the annual conference of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation.

* The States do not have that sense of independence that they had when **federation** came into being.

* In today's circumstances the Commonwealth may provide the finance but under Federation the responsibility for the ultimate use of that finance rests with the States.

* It is comprised of four members representing the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and four members representing the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* He developed his argument from the territory of New South Wales; he said that the territory of New South Wales other than the islands does not extend beyond low water mark on the eastern coast, and that although the colonies were competent to make laws with respect to the extra-territorial rights beyond their margins these legislative powers were derived from their plenary powers with respect to the power to make laws for the peace, good government and order of the particular colony or State, and the Chief Justice said that this did not in any way mean that they had any specific right or authority with respect to these waters, that is as distinct from the plenary legislation, and he went on to say that in his opinion, the territorial limits of an Australian colony at Federation did not include any part of the territorial sea or the seabeds adjacent to it.

* Further on in his judgment he said that Federation did not increase those territorial limits, so since Federation the territorial limits of a State are to be found at the low water mark on its coasts.

* The facts of **federation** and our pride in our Australian standard of living imply- that we desire  a  uniform level of social progress throughout the Commonwealth.

* Regarding the criticism that has been made of the Government by the Opposition I refer to what the Senior VicePresident of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation,  Mr Les  Price, has said.

* If honourable members want evidence of that, I can say that I have been at meetings where he has addressed wheat growers on this subject and 90% of the interested wheat growers present - and if they were not interested they would not have been there - supported the Australian Wheat Growers Federation on this matter.

* The one thing that has emerged from this debate - if there is anything to be gained from the debate - is that primary producer organisations will get scant respect if ever Australia has the misfortune to have another Labor government in office, because the Labor Party is opposed to what the Australian Wheat Growers Federation has done and is opposed to primary producer organisations.

* The Government and the Wheat Growers Federation had to consider the position that these people would be placed in if they cut production below a reasonable level.

* In the case of a **federation**, the table includes taxes for commonwealth, state and local government levels while two levels of taxation are included for countries like the United Kingdom which has only two levels of taxation.

* The idea of " territorial representation " which the Minister adumbrated at Murwillumbah last year is the very antithesis of the principle of majority rule; it is the very reverse of one vote one value, and it represents a view which is unknown to our Constitution, which is inimical to true democracy and which is a departure from the practice that has been followed since Federation.

* The Committee agreed that the principle of one vote one value had been fairly and properly applied in the seven redistributions since Federation.

* In the case of Tasmania, its guarantee of at least five seats, irrespective of its population, is an essential part of the contract of **federation** and is written into the Constitution, therefore, in my view, both those arguments are irrelevant to the basic principle of one vote one value.

* In a democratic **federation**, that is the way in which affairs should be conducted.

* It will not matter whether he is a member of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, the Australian Dairy Producers Union or the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation.

* I should think that  Mr. Reece  would be in a particularly good position to appreciate the results of the stoppages and holdups which the Waterside Workers Federation has brought to Australian Industry.

* I should like to say that the attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation to arbitration in the past, its attitude to the Government and its attitude to the interest of the Australian people show it to be not trustworthy.

* I refer the House to a statement made by the Federation's industrial officer,  Mr. Docker.

* Appearing before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on 30th July this year  Mr. Docker  said to  Mr. Justice  Gallagher - 
There is no confidence at all in the Federation that consideration by the Commission of this matter at the present time would in any way achieve wage justice for our members.

* That is the attitude officially stated before the Commission by the advocate for the Federation.

* He says that he believes, and that the Federation believes, that the waterside workers will not achieve wage justice through the Commission.

* Now let us see the private view of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* In October 1964 the Tokyo office of the All-Pacific Asian Dock Workers Corresponding Committee asked its member unions, one of which is the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, to fill in a questionnaire as to the conditions of the dock workers of the Pacific area.

* The reply given by the Federation to this request is interesting.

* It is dated 23rd November 1964 and states - 
That was the official reply by the Federation.

* I am reading it to the House and to the people of Australia in order to let them compare that attitude with the official attitude of the Federation expressed before the Commission.

* On the one hand there is officially a suggestion of wage injustice and on the other, privately, in informing its international organisation, the Federation states that dock workers in Australia are better off than most other workers.

* I should like to place on record that the members of the Hobart Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation were most upset over the recent federally induced nation wide 24 hour stoppages.

* It has been argued by representatives of the Waterside Workers Federation that they have not had wage justice and that they are against automation.

* I would suggest that those figures show that the claims made by the Federation are not in fact substantiated.

* I refer now to a pamphlet put out by the Hobart Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* It was supplied to me by the Vice-President of the Federation,  Mr. V.  S. C. Williams, who is also the Junior Federal Vice-President of the Australian Labour Party.Mr.Williamsputintoprint his views on the effect of automation, and I quote him - 
Mechanisation and automation of industry have been hailed by business people and others as bringing many benefits to the great masses of people: to the consumer cheaper goods; to the workers full employment and an easing of their tasks.

* The Waterside Workers Federation will submit a case which will shatter this theory as a fallacy.

* Personally I am glad that they have remained and personally I am glad that the port of Hobart has shown that automation need not be the disrupting thing that those at the Federal level of the Waterside Workers Federation suggest.

* Mr. Docker, the gentleman to whom I referred earlier - the Federation's advocate - told  Mr. Justice  Gallagher on 30th July this year that even if all its industrial claims were granted, frequent disputes could be expected until the industry was nationalised.

* Contrary to what  Mr. Docker  says the Federation can, if it wishes - and I emphasise the words " if it wishes " - guarantee that there will be no strikes, because by agreement with the Australian National Line there is a 10 per cent, surcharge on the wages paid to waterside workers employed on a permanent basis by the A.N.L.

* To my mind, that gives the lie to what  Mr. Docker  suggested to the Commission as being the official attitude of the Federation.

* I refer to the Minister's concern about inflation and ask him whether he supports the  Chairman  of the Metal Trades Federation who has suggested a curb on wages.

* Apparently, it came in by the translating into very early Federal legislation of a provision that existed in the legislation of New South Wales, which, prior to Federation, in the 1890's, provided that there could be a variation of 25 per cent, from the mean.

* Seldom, if ever, has a new Stale come into being under less promising circumstances than the Federation of Malaysia, born on September 16.

* It will commit Australian armed forces to the defence of the Federation.

* It contains figures prepared by the Western Australian Employers Federation relating to future employment.

* The report states - 
The **federation** estimated that each year about 1,800 of these would go into manufacturing, fewer than 1.200 into building, construction and mining and about 6,000 into commerce, finance and other service industries.

* .- Mr. Deputy Speaker, the honorable member for Fawkner  (Mr. Howson)  and other speakers to-night have referred to an alleged agreement between the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon),  the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation on the settlement of industrial disputes by conciliation and arbitration.

* Surely to goodness those who criticize the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and say that it causes disputes do not expect the industry to remain in the horseandbuggy stage, in which cargo was carried to the ships on trollies and moved by hand.

* Mechanization on the waterfront has not occurred because of disputes caused by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The honorable member has demonstrated in this chamber his generally antagonistic attitude towards the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The advocate of the employers' **federation** once again displayed his spleen and his antagonism towards the trade union movement.

* The reason is that in January of this year the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation had a conference with the Minister for Labour and National Service, at which it was indicated that there would be only a few minor amendments to the legislation.

* The six sovereign States that established this Federal Parliament retain many of the rights that they had prior to **federation**.

* During the initial period of its work the Commission considered compensation for disabilities arising from Federation as a possible basis upon which its recommendations should be made.

* In its Third Report (1936) the Commission finally rejected the principle of compensation for disabilities arising from Federation, and chose in place thereof the principle of financial need, which it expressed in the following terms: 
Special grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of the Federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States'.

* Of course the difficulties of achieving this in a **federation** are quite substantial.

* One of the difficulties in the Australian **federation** has been the preponderance of two States - New South Wales and Victoria.

* No other **federation** has a preponderance of population in only two States as has Australia.

* There has been no such shift in the Australian situation since **federation**.

* One of the unfortunate features about the working of our **federation** at the moment is that it tends in some respects not to be working as efficiently as it ought to be working.

* I have pointed out in this House before that the nominations are forwarded by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Therefore, the Federation has the initial right of recruitment into the stevedoring industry.

* That is a powerful weapon that can be used by the Federation for its own purposes whether they are political or industrial.

* Consequently, there must be the closest cooperation between management, the Authority, the Waterside Workers Federation and my Department.

* There was a hig vote of 37 lo 17 in favour of a statutory marketing authority by delegates of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation at the Australian Wool Industry Conference.

* The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's powers have been increased very greatly - much more than the fathers of the **federation** probably anticipated - but the commission is not equipped to initiate the proceedings of which I speak.

* Such an agreement was foreshadowed at the time of Singapore's separation from the Federation.

* The Federation of Malaya will noi agree to the Commonwealth forces stationed in Malaya being sent to Thailand in fulfilment of the obligations of the three Commonwealth countries (UK, Australia and New Zealand) to SEATO.

* The Minister for Education in New South Wales, who is a member of the Australian Country Party, within the last few months gave to the New South Wales Teachers Federation this statement of the position - 
Despite the strong suggestions by the former Prime Minister that the States would be opposed to these proposals, I know of no Premier and no State Minister for Education who has said so.

* Addressing the New South Wales Teachers Federation Conference on 20th December 1965,  Mr. Cutler,  the State Minister for Education, said that the period of teacher training had to be increased.

* I point out that the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have asked the all-in conference to deal with the problem of mechanisation and its effect on the waterfront.

* He spoke about British agriculture; he said that signing the Treaty of Rome would mean the end of Commonwealth free entry; and again, that to sign the Treaty of Rome would be to accept as the ultimate goal political **federation** in Europe.

* In this sentiment, I include the rank and file members and officials of the Townsville Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, numbering something like 500.

* The members of the Federation have their faults, as we all know.

* I took them back to my electorate with me and had consultations with the  President  and the Vigilance Officer of the Townsville Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Townsville Branch of the Federation has always had good relations with the employers and is always ready to meet them in conference over any dispute.

* This measure makes no allowance for this kind of reasonableness, and all sections of the Federation are lumped together as being of the same character.

* When I was in Townsville earlier this week, I consulted the  President  of the branch of the Federation there.

* Although the owners were clearly in the wrong, the members of the Federation and not the owners were penalised.

* Only last week the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were ordered to load drums of soda weighing 750 lb.

* After investigations, the members of the Waterside Workers Federation were proved right and the company wrong.

* Not the company; yet we see only a token admission that someone other than the Federation is wrong.

* Their choice certainly would not be in the interests of the Federation.

* After sitting down for two hours at the suggestion of the Vigilance Officer and a senior officer of the Federation, the gang was shifted to another hatch.

* Of course, the Federation is blamed for this and the low loading rate which follows.

* I remember in 1956 the Townsville Branch of the Federation was forced to take 200 men to build up the strength to 750.

* Who could blame the Federation for doing what the Tait Committee reportedthat they had on occasions impeded and delayed the filling of quotas and even raising the strength to levels short of quotas when they can see, as in the case of bulk sugar loading, a very definite threat to their wage level?

* I know many who would contribute much less to The nation in hours worked than many of the much maligned members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The number of members of the Federation who have been fined and the comments in the Minister's speech only highlight what should have been done years ago.

* Clause 21 makes provision for the registration of other trade unions on the waterfront in the event of the deregistration of the Federation.

* The free loaders as they call them - most people call them scabs - came on the wharves to work when members of the Federation went on strike.

* Hearing Government members speak, one could be forgiven for thinking that all waterfront stoppages are caused by attempts to further Communist policy by using the Federation.

* It is necessary to go back only five years to recall what the leader of the Party, the Federal  President  and the Federal Executive said about the election of  Mr. Fitzgibbon  as General Secretary of the Federation.

* The Waterside Workers Federation cannot be blamed for any of these matters, although the losses due to them are several times as great as are the losses for which the Federation can be blamed.

* It was referring, not to members of the Federation, but to the management controlled from overseas.

* It has appeared that the Waterside Workers Federation has no more oportunity than has any other union to ascertain the records of people who apply to join it or who, on its nomination, obtain employment.

* Ever since then the Court has had the power, on the initiative of the employers or the Authority, to deregister the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Now a special act is introduced to take that power away from judicial hands in the case of the Federation and to give it to the Government, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and then the Government again.

* That is not a judicial proceeding at all; it is taking the Waterside Workers Federation, alone among Australia's registered organisations of employers or employees, out of the hands of the judicial system and putting it into the hands of the Government.

* For 6 months negotiations have been proceeding between the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the spokesman for the Commonwealth 
Government - the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Anthony).

* Members of the Federation have spent many hours and days travelling between Canberra and various other centres in order to put forward their views on the various proposals.

* Present at that meeting were members of the Victorian section of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and members of the grains divisions of the Victorian Farmers Union.

* 1 have had discussions with members of the Wheatgrowers Federation and the Victorian Farmers Union.

* 1 am very reluctant to oppose the majority decision of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, but  as  I represent Victorian wheal growers whose organisation is the Victorian Farmers Union, which wants  a  one-price scheme, I feel I must give consideration to that request.

* A resolution carried by a large meeting  at  Warracknabeal last Thursday stated: 
That prior to the presentation of any future stabilisation plan by the Government, an early round of talks with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation be initiated by Government.

* I know of no man - and I have searched the records from the days of Federation - who is better equipped than he to serve the people of this country in their need for cheap, good and sufficient housing.

* 1 know of no government led by any Prime Minister since Federation that has given such little attention to the needs of the people in housing and urban development than the present Government led by the present Prime Minister.

* I know that he has spent a lot of time with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and with  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, in relation to this matter.

* Port Adelaide was ruined, men were thrown out of work and all States of Australia, with the exception of New South Wales where members of the Federation did not go on strike, were in a state of siege.

* Some waterside workers will have to be transferred from the waterfront to warehouses but they will still have to be known as members of a branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation so that they will qualify for the long service leave benefit which has now been granted them.

* This Government subscribes to the long established policy, followed by successive governments since **federation**, of protecting the sugar industry, not only against overseas sugar but also against competition from artificial sweeteners.

* The Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, the Federated Clerks Union of Australia, the Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australia, the Australasian Society of Engineers, the Motor Transport Union of Victoria, the Teachers Union of Victoria, the Hospital Employees Federation of Victoria, the Postal Telecommunications Technicians Association, and the Marine Stewards Association, opposed the levy.

* would be forced to support a proposal to form an Australian **federation** of labour which would be free of Communist influence.

* On Sunday last Jim Healy, the Communist general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, officially announced on behalf of the A.C.T.U.

* I assured him that to-night I would bring to the notice of the House and of Australian trade unionists the considered views of a great American union body - the American Federation of LabourCongress of Industrial Organizations.

* In a letter dated 24th October - only last month - the Director of International Publications in the American Federation of LabourCongress of Industrial Organizations said inter alia - 
Kingsford-Smith.

* I am very happy to stand here in this House to-night and be the mouthpiece of a very great movement which does stand for trade unionism in America - the American Federation of Labour-Congress of Industrial Organizations.

* Whilst I appreciate that very weighty arguments have been advanced for further consideration of the Australian Primary Producers Union as a possible member of the conference, I submit that to date the federal organizations of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council have got together more closely through the medium of the conference than at any previous stage in their history, and there appear to be good prospects of these organizations continuing to work together for the benefit of the industry.

* In the Federation of Malaya/Singapore, Thailand and the Republic of Viet Nam.

* That demonstrates how good this legislation and the Federation are.

* I cannot agree that the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation is represented in all states.

* This was a subject which was not contemplated at the time of **federation**.

* Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Victorian Employers' Federation newsletter suggesting that the Postal Department be handed over to an independent board with complete powers of internal management?

* It can be fairly said that at no stage in the history of Federation have relations been more exacerbated than they are today.

* He said that there is a unity ticket in the course of preparation in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We appreciate the move in New South Wales where the Wool and Meat Growers' Federation is prepared to meet the new organization, the Australian Wool Growers' and Graziers' Council.

* It is true that, last night, the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation announced that the Executive itself had decided to call off the 24-hour stoppages.

* Some time previously, before the Arbitration Commission, an advocate for the Waterside Workers Federation had stated that the Executive had no power to call off these strikes, because they had been authorised at mass stop work meetings throughout the Commonwealth, unless its demands were met or, in other words, unless the claims made by the Federation were negotiated.

* The Federation did not concede that it was prepared to agree to negotiations on the claims that were made by the employers until they responded to Federation claims.

* In all of these cases, the Executive of the Waterside Workers Federation or the Federation never bothers too much about either morality or inconsistency.

* I think it can be said that there are four good reasons why the Executive of the Federation approached the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* There is disagreement with the policies which have been followed by the Federation.

* Secondly,  Sir, the  Australian Stevedoring Industry- 
The third reason, without any doubt at all, is that the employers of waterside labour have said to the Federation that they are willing to negotiate with the Federation provided there is a genuine willingness on the part of the Federation to negotiate.

* Of course, this relates to the tactics of the Federation itself.

* I have little doubt that, in order to get the increase, the Federation has decided that it will call off these stoppages, at least for the time being.

* These are the areas which in terms of value have the greatest losses, although the severity of the drought there may be less than in the western areas of the State, lt is a disgrace to this nation that in the 68 years since **federation** the various Commonwealth governments have given to Queensland, the State which has the greatest natural water reserves, only one dam - the Fairbairn dam, which is still not yet constructed.

* Dickson-  Sir James  Robert Dickson (1832-1901), Premier of Queensland 1898-99, a strong advocate of Federation and Member of first House of Representatives 1901.

* I am a lover of **federation**.

* Or would you go along with the **federation**,, which looks after every segment of the Australian countryside, whether, it be a State or a federal territory?

* As far back as the beginning of Federation in Australia, the founding fathers did not accept this proposition when they framed the Constitution.

* Has the Minister heard reports that the Australian Labour Party is sponsoring a candidate for the secretaryship of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* In September this year, when addressing a convention of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation, the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Snedden)  said: 
The countries represented on the council are - the United Kingdom, the United States of America, the Netherlands, France, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia, the Federation of Malaya, Thailand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Indonesia and Australia.

* Those who enjoyed direct and full membership of the conference - I am not taking them in any particular order - were the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Malaya, Ceylon, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Cyprus, while, following practice established in the past, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was represented by the Prime Minister,  Sir Roy  Welensky.

* The European Economic Community is, of course, at present far from being a **federation**.

* The British Government says, and I have no doubt with the utmost good faith, that it is not contemplating a **federation** in Europe, that it looks at its political association in ad hoc terms, with periodical discussions between Prime .

* The next point that I made was that, should the day come when the European Community became a **federation** - I emphasize that word - with Great Britain as a constituent State, then Great Britain would cease to be a sovereign community.

* My point was that in a **federation**, no State retains complete sovereignty; the sovereignty is, in a sense, divided.

* One was that when the **federation** was established, the States preserved their full sovereignty and that that sovereignty was paramount to the rights of the union.

* It seemed to me no more feasible to say that Great Britain's position in the Commonwealth would be unaffected by participation as a constituent State in a European **federation** than it would be to say that Australia could join another great **federation** and still remain an independent sovereign member of the British Commonwealth.

* Now, of course, one answer to all this - and it has been clearly made in London - is that Great Britain has no intention of going into a **federation**.

* Under these circumstances, it may well prove to be the fact that even if **federation** should be achieved in Western Europe, the anomalous position of Great Britain in the Commonwealth which would then emerge, would be regarded as no more anomalous than many other things which have been accepted, and with which we have learned to live.

* I note, with pride, a report in the 'Australian' of 22nd July that the grains division of the Victorian Farmers Union intends to propose to the Australian Wheat Growers Federation such a proposal.

* I would say that at all times they have shown themselves to be the most sectional bloc that has made a public appearance in any phase of Australian life since **federation**.

* It said in 1936, which was a depression year, that the grants did not rest on the penalty imposed on any State by **federation**, but on a State's need for money - a very silly statement, because the States' need for money could arise from the penalty imposed on them by **federation**, and therefore the statement of alleged principles by the commission means exactly nothing.

* But ever since the beginning of **federation**, there has been some malignance in Commonwealth action regarding primary industries.

* If Western Australia had never entered **federation**, it would not now be paying the fancy prices  for  Holden vehicles which sustained  a profit  of 15,000,000 last year for that organization.

* I am not for one moment attacking that tariff; but I think we have to start off on the basis of the fact that **federation** penalized the primary industries.

* The whole tariff policy since **federation** has penalized those States which happened to be agricultural States.

* Therefore, the silly statement of the Commonwealth Grants Commission that it does not make these grants to the States on account of any alleged losses from **federation** but upon their need for money - which is another way of saying the same thing - is something this Parliament should not accept as a principle, because it is not a principle but  a  fallacy.

* I am not complaining of that policy but I feel that Western Australia only began to get a fair share of the proceeds of **federation** when uniform taxation taxed incomes in those areas in which Commonwealth policy had concentrated industries, and the proceeds were spread, by means of grants, equally over the Commonwealth.

* All through that period, which continued until 1940  -  the first 40 years of **federation** - the agricultural States were heavily penalized.

* It would either not be buying the higherpriced goods from the eastern seaboard, but would be buying them in London where it sold its agricultural products, or if it were trying to do what it is doing within the **federation**, it would have a chronic balance of trade problem, as New Zealand has.

* Representatives of the Australian Pensioners Federation today met the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  for 2* hours.

* We had a good hearing," the Federation's national  president Mrs Irene  Ellis, of Melbourne, said.

* I.  Ellis, Honorary Secretary, Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation, for a substantial increase in pensions in order to protect the lives and wellbeing of pensioners and to put value back into the pension?

* One is the way in which we have stood up to the Waterside Workers Federation - that Communist-dominated group which is constantly championed by honorable members opposite.

* Last month the Prime Minister, in his speech on the Budget, went to some pains and indulged in some abuse to explain why he had changed the views which he expressed in 1945 in the House on the national responsibility in education, and which the Teachers' Federation in Victoria took advertisements in the newspapers to publicize once again on the eve of the 
.- I appreciate the thoughtfulness of the honorable member for Grayndler  (Mr. Daly)  in bringing so many honorable members into the chamber to hear my speech, which will be the last to be delivered in thisdebate.

* I think it is necessary to point out to the honorable member that in this country we have **federation**.

* Another telegram was from the secretary of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation who said - 
I repeat for the information of the honorable member for Robertson, who took my friend the honorable member for Lalor to task, that this letter of protest is dated 25th March 1966.

* It states that this request is made with the full support and knowledge of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation Bean Committee.

* The galleries were packed with members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* and the Waterside Workers Federation to ferret out the anomalies - the injustices, if you like - and having ferretted them out to pass legislation to rectify them.

* wanted to display responsibility in the matter and, because it mistrusted the responsibility which would be shown by the **federation**, it virtually took over the conduct of the conferences.

* It is true that at about this time Jim Healy, the general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, died.

* and of the **federation**.

* and the **federation** - said that they would rely on negotiation to clear away the disputes which existed between them.

* and the **federation** asked the Minister to put to Cabinet their request for the substitution of three days' loss of attendance money for the four days provided for in the legislation.

* I think it was brought on by the Communists in the Waterside Workers Federation seeking to reassert themselves.

* I think that  Mrs Irene  Ellis of the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation summed up the position in a letter on 11th September 1968.

* Again I quote the Australian Commonwealth Pensioners' Federation: 
That implies maintenance of the status quo in the whole area, at least until such time as all the people of Papua and New Guinea can vote as one people and determine for themselves, without interference, their own future national status.

* But the indigenous people of the whole island of New Guinea might very well decide - and it is quite likely that they will - to become part of the Melanesian Federation, or to become part of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

* The man who has been in charge of Australia for more than 25 per cent, of the period of our nationhood since **federation** is the man who is principally responsible for this state of affairs.

* The retention of the existing building will do much to emphasise the full extent of our progress since Federation, fewer than 70 years ago.

* Since **federation** they have been represented in this House by Country Party representatives.

* Indeed, in Quick and Garran's work 'The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth', which has been accepted as a work of some authority from the earliest days of Federation, in notes 110 and 111 people' is clearly interpreted as meaning people, not electors.

* After the most prolonged and powerful public debate on education since **federation**, all parents are aware that few Australian schools indeed are good enough by modern and comparable standards; there has never been so widespread a disposition by the people and the parties to take education out of politics: The Liberal response has been to institute a scheme which ignores need and priorities and which leaves both schools systems as far behind acceptable and international standards as ever.

* Australian Commonwealth Pensioners Federation had to say in a letter which was sent to all members of Parliament on 25th March 1968.

* She stated: 
The Federation cannot but take note that pensioners had to 'forgo' a rise in the last Budget in a period of a steep rise in the cost of living, lt is true they had the sympathy of the Federal Treasurer,  Mr McMahon,  but sympathy will not put food in empty stomachs, or prevent consequent malnutrition and possible death.

* Every other **federation** must have regarded us as a laughing stock.

* I said in 1956 - 
The existence of more federal partners than we have at present in the Australian Federation would lend itself to securing constitutional reforms, which those working in the Governments of Australia recognize as imperative, but whose necessity cannot be demonstrated to the public mind over the huge States that now exist.

* But, quite apart from this aspect of facilitating constitutional reforms, an increase in the numbers of federal units in Australia would automatically resolve some of the problems that have been disturbing Australian statesmen since **federation**.

* We should heed the advice of practically every wise man who attended the conventions that led to **federation** in Australia.

* Every one of them said there must be more members of the **federation**.

* Sir Henry  Parkes said that there must be an increasing number of partners if **federation** was really to work.

* He said - 
Surely, after 60 years of **federation**, we have seen all these things, and should be prepared to make certain that the inalienable rights of the people in the rural areas of Australia should be given back to them, instead of saying, " You cannot have anything done in the north of New South Wales or along the south coast because it does not lead through Sydney ".

* China is a **federation**.

* At the time of its **federation**, the United States had a population of 4,000,000, just as we had' a population of 4,000,000 when we adopted the federal system.

* It has been able to do this during all these years, because it got on with the job of developing itself in the early years of **federation**.

* As the House will well know, an authorized stop-work meeting was called by the Waterside Workers Federation to consider the approach that had been made to me by the **federation** about long service leave and penalties in the industrial law.

* The country also loses, and neither I nor the Government will be intimidated by the actions of the Waterside Workers Federation Its decision is increasingly difficult to understand because I have given assurances, in consultations with the Waterside Workers Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that I am looking at some of the anomalies and injustices that have been discussed with me by them.

* Consequently, I am all the more amazed that the 
Waterside Workers Federation should take this unnecessary strike action.

* It is to be regretted that, at a time when we are fighting for overseas markets, the Waterside Workers Federation should, in an undisciplined way like this, stop the movement of our cargoes overseas.

* One of these, the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, in its evidence to the inquiry made the first reference to the setting up of an overall authority, and in doing so it acknowledged  Mr. Stan  Gleeson, who is  chairman  of the Federal Wool Commodity Section of the Australian Primary Producers Union, as the originator of the idea.

* The council and the **federation** at first suggested that the conference should be composed of twenty members from each of the two organizations.

* The committee pointed out - 
To meet the danger it was suggested (by the committee), that representatives of other organizations should be added to the 40, but the **federation** and the council could reach no agreement on this point.

* The report indicates that the executives of the **federation** and the council are fully conscious of this danger and of this defect in the set-up of the Wool Bureau.

* However, it saw some difficulties in this because of the traditional recognition of the council and the **federation**, but it stated, very properly - 
There are three voluntary non-statutory federal associations of wool-growers, the council, the **federation** and the union.

* On 23rd October, a representative of the union went to Melbourne, where both the council and the **federation** were conducting meetings, to seek a joint approach to this problem of forming a conference.

* I believe that the acceptance of this creation of the council and the **federation** means that a grave injustice is being done to a large section of wool-growers.

* There are some 25,000 of these in five States who are sufficiently dissatisfied with the performance of the leaders of the council and the **federation** to pay an annual subscription to another producer organization to further their interests.

* However, the council and the **federation** both consist of loose associations and neither of them has any specialized section to deal only with wool.

* The council and the **federation** have themselves highlighted the obvious fact that they do not fully represent the woolgrowers.

* According to this definition I should think that the rules debar the **federation** from being a constituent member of the' conference.

* The **federation** consists of the following organizations: - The Queensland Selectors Association, the United Farmers and Woolgrowers Association, the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association, the South Australian Wheat and Wool Growers Association, and the Farmers Union of Western Australia.

* The **federation** which claims to be primarily concerned with wool first gained representation on the Wool Bureau and now has gained representation on the Australian Wool Board.

* The **federation** which claims to be primarily concerned with meat gains representation on the Australian Meat Board.

* There is also some peculiar process by which the constituent members of the **federation** are also affiliated with the Australian Wheatgrowers Association.

* Surely he cannot prefer a vaguely organized body such as the **federation** to a specialized body like the A.P.P.U.

* I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to take action, which we know is within his power to take, to inform the council and the **federation** that the Government requires the inclusion of the A.P.P.U.

* The Tasmanian Farmers' Federation and the Australian Labor Party's Tasmanian Rural Committee have both been pressing for an increase in the membership of the Board.

* The Federation has been seeking this increased membership for longer than our Committee but our Committee is only 3 years old.

* 1 know that  Mr Oala  Oala Rarua has some kind of Port Moresby workers association, but when attempts have been made to establish a **federation** of unions it has been found very quickly that there is nothing to federate.

* I pointed out at the time that the members of the Australian Olympic Federation were making commendable efforts  to  raise funds for themselves for this purpose, and I said that if the results of their efforts could be seen the Commonwealth would be in a better position to indicate the assistance that it would contribute.

* Recently, the honorary secretary-treasurer of the Australian Olympic Federation,  Mr. Tanner,  asked me to put to Cabinet a request for assistance of the order of 23,000, pointing out that funds raised in other directions, including grants from the various States of the Commonwealth had totalled 72,000 towards an estimated expenditure of 95,000.

* This will leave only 3,000 for the **federation** to raise, and I am sure that with that added spur it will have no difficulty in making up the balance.

* A further summarized report relative to this matter which has been handed to me indicates that officials of the Waterside Workers Federation and of other relevant unions were informed by members of the crew that the ship had been laid up in Brisbane for approximately six months and that a considerable sum of money had been spent on the survey by the A.U.S.N.

* The officials to whom I have referred have stated - 
At a certain stage, the  president  of the Waterside Workers Federation,  Mr. Ralph  Errington, said to me: " You are a member of the Opposition.

* What happened in Fremantle was this: For many years - Fremantle is unique in this respect - the foremen were members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The union considered that this threatened industrial conditions of the other foremen and pressure was being put on the foremen to leave the Waterside Workers Federation.

* And he is referring to Victoria -  had consisted of people named on an official ticket drawn up by an 'inner recommendation committee' headed by the secretary of the Metal Trades Federation,  Mr Percy  Johnson who was also the secretary of the Trades Union Defence Committee, which worked against the contemplated Federal intervention in Victoria on unity tickets.

* The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia signed the petition, and it has over 4,000 members.

* Then, of course, there is the redoubtable  Mr Johnson  of the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia - the organiser of the Federation of Unions, or whatever it is called down in Melbourne.

* The point about this is that the letter signed by  Mr Malone,  State Secretary of the Australian Builders Labourers Federation, states that the petition is signed by members of various trade unions who are deeply concerned, and so on.

* The  chairman  may be appointed only after consultation between the Minister and the Australian Meat Board Selection Committee, a committee constituted jointly by the Australian Woolgrowers and the Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation on 27th February, 1964, for the purpose of recommending appointees to the Australian Meat Board.

* I should like to know what the approach of the Communist Party of China would be if the same situation occurred there and what would be its attitude to the activities of the Australian Waterside Workers Federation.

* I am sure that if the- honorable member consulted the-  president  of the Master Builders Federation in any of the States of Australia, he- would be told by that gentleman that there was to-day more money available in this country for building than the industry is able to absorb.

* Apart from two lines in 1958, this is the first time that the Australian Labor party has, since Federation, mentioned a Commonwealth interest in education as part of its Federal platform.

* Having been through the platform of the Australian Labor Party for the years since Federation, I know that this is correct.

* This is, of course, all to the good, but it should always be remembered that, in our early days of **federation**, Great Britain was of invaluable assistance to us.

* The Australian Meat Board Selection Committee referred to above is not a statutory authority and was constituted jointly by the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation on 27th February, 1964, for the purpose of this legislation.

* It consists at present of nine members comprising four each from the council and the **federation** and an independent chairman.

* However, I know that both the graziers' organization and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation have agreed to it, so I suggest to those people who are somewhat critical of this portion of the bill that they direct their criticism away from the Minister.

* I believe that in a **federation** such as ours - I confirm what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said - the Commonwealth should be and is the most efficient tax gatherer that we can have.

* If the Philippines, Malaya and Indonesia formed a **federation** which would have the chance of being prosperous and also outside the field of Chinese Communist influence it was, from the point of view of the Indonesian Communist Party, dangerous.

* A veto was applied the moment they attempted to form a **federation** among themselves.

* At that stage Stalin did not desire a large **federation** outside of Russia, even if it were Communist, because it was much better for his control that these countries should stay separate.

* Confrontation does not make sense if ultimately both Malaysia and Indonesia are to be in  a  **federation**, but nevertheless it makes psychological sense in that it appeared to be a great anti-colonial gesture because Indonesia was not consulted over the formation of Malaysia.

* Not only has the Opposition concerned itself with this subject, but the matter has also been brought to the attention of the Government by interested organisations, including the Teachers Federation, parents and friends associations, educationists and many others who believe that a crisis now exists in the Australian educational system at these levels.

* Even the basic requirements are not being met in a disjointed and incoherent education system which has changed little since Federation.

* It proposes to give long service leave, under certain conditions, to members of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia.

* The council has advised the Waterside Workers Federation, accordingly, of its opinion of this measure.

* In this debate, it is interesting to note, Government supporters have attempted to lay at the door of the Waterside Workers Federation every shortcoming, real or imaginary, that exists on our waterfront.

* Listening to honorable members on the Government side, one might be led to believe that everything that is taking place on the waterfront is attributable to the actions of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Waterside Workers Federation does not come into this picture at all.

* These heavy costs are due to a combination of factors in no way connected with the Waterside Workers Federation.

* They are attributable directly to the actions of the shipowners, who have repeatedly snapped their fingers at the Australian Government, and this is borne out by the following paragraph on page 131 of the Tait Committee's report: - 
The Minister has said that the stevedoring industry has an important bearing upon our internal and external economy, and he has taken advantage of the opportunity to voice strong criticism of the Waterside Workers Federation, but he has made no reference at all to the other factors which are playing a much greater part in disrupting our economy.

* And those honorable members on the Government side who have spoken since that time have seized upon this figure in an attempt to discredit the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The honorable member for Moreton made frequent and lengthy reference to the fact that  Mr. Healy  is a Communist, and to the part that he plays in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But the only result of this bill, and of the approach of Liberal and Country Party members to the Waterside Workers Federation, will be that  Mr. Healy's  position in the **federation** will not be weakened in any way.

* The Victorian branch of the red-lining Australian Builder-Labourers Federation was recently able to send its members its fine new monthly magazine called " Unity ", complete with two special feature pictures, the only ones in the publication except for a couple of portraits.

* Much has been said in this chamber and elsewhere of the effects on Australia should the United Kingdom achieve membership of this European **federation**.

* Indeed, the new Federation of Malaysia is perhaps the first step towards the establishment of such a confederation.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation has accepted the stabilisation plan proposed in the Bill.

* I must say that I have confidence in the members of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation, and I have a special knowledge of the representatives from my own State of Queensland.

* The representatives of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation deserve considerable credit for having the Government's proposal amended to the benefit of the growers.

* The last benefit obtained for the wheat industry by the representatives of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation was a lifting of the proposed export quota from 175 million bushels to 200 million bushels.

* This is a logical line of thought and is a matter that has been considered by wheat growers, but it is something which should be considered by the component bodies of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation.

* I have every confidence in the Federation.

* I believe that the Bill gives to the producer the greatest return that can be provided within the limits of the support which the Government is prepared to give following negotiations with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation on behalf of Australian wheat growers.

* Another important change within the Commonwealth is foreshadowed by the proposal to form a new Malaysian **federation**.

* This proposal was originated by the Prime Minister of the Federation of Malaya.

* When I was there, in 1959, the Prime Minister of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, announced that he was strongly against the inclusion of Singapore in the **federation**.

* Now, he and his government are making arrangements so that Singapore and the Borneo territories of North Borneo, Brunei and Sarawak can join the **federation**.

* Now, because of proposals for the formation for the Federation of Malaysia it is quite possible that our form of representation in those areas will change.

* It will be recalled that a distinguished Australian was nominated by us, at the request of the incoming Malayan Government, to be a member of the Malayan Constitutional Commission to advise on the Constitution of the present Federation of Malaya; and that was understandable.

* We are a **federation** of States, which the Malays were seeking to be.

* to play its part in maintaining peace on the waterfront and in urging the Waterside Workers Federation to drop its present approach to these matters.

* I do not suggest that the Waterside Workers Federation should be treated differently from any other union under the normal legislation dealing with trade unions, although we do not agree with the Government's policy in that regard.

* Individual trade unionists in the Waterside Workers Federation should not be placed in an inferior position by legislation passed by this Parliament.

* They should not be placed in a position inferior to that of members of the ironworkers **federation**, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen or any other union, yet that is the situation which prevails under this legislation.

* I agree with the Australian Road Federation that we should set up a federal roads bureau on the pattern of the bureau in the United States of America.

* Writing in the " Commonwealth Automotive Review ", in December, 1961, the secretary of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries said - 
I can remember the waterfront troubles of 1928, when the Bruce-Page Government deregistered the Waterside Workers Federation and set out on a witchhunt against it.

* All of that was caused by the efforts of the Nationalist PartyCountry Party Government of that day to smash the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Those Governments failed in their efforts to smash the Federation.

* Today the Federation is a very strong union, despite the efforts of those Governments.

* I believe, as does the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr. Calwell),  that this Bill will tend to promote any influence that the Communist Party has in the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We also know that prominent Communists are officials of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* We must not complain merely because the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have decided to elect members of the Democratic Labour Party to official positions in the Federation, as they have done in the port of Townsville; to elect members of the Australian Labour Party to official positions, as they have done in the port of Brisbane; or to elect Communists to official positions, as they have done in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne.

* In the main, the Australian Labour Party plays a very prominent role in the administration of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* But he is taking on a fight that could prove very costly to him, because the records show that members of governments who in the past have crossed swords with the Waterside Workers Federation invariably have come off second best.

* Always when an attack has been made on the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation the workers have rallied strongly to those who represent them.

* I adopt the view expressed only last week by  Mr. Arnell, president  of the Brisbane Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* To his credit,  Mr. Arnell  made it clear that the Waterside Workers Federation does not display a great deal of interest in a man's behaviour prior to his becoming a member of the Federation, but once he joins the union his behaviour must be exemplary.

* If he is guilty of any misdemeanour, any criminal act any theft, he no longer retains his position in the Federation.

* The Federation is always the stalking horse for those who wish to cover up their own shortcomings.

* I do not blame the Federation for being industrially militant - I stress that term - in endeavouring to obtain improved conditions for its members.

* This is not being brought about by members of the Waterside Workers Federation but by the shipowners and employers engaged in the waterfront industry.

* We know the campaign that is being organised by the Waterside Workers Federation to promote the nationalisation of stevedoring.

* The Federation has pointed out in an excellent pamphlet that it was good enough to send to me what would accrue if the stevedoring industry were nationalised.

* The Federation states that it would make for streamlining of the labour force and that the operation of the ports would become more and more efficient.

* Very recently  Mr. Fred  Bromley, the member for Norman in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, said - 
These remarks made by  Mr. Bromley  could apply to the conditions imposed by this Government on members of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Secondly, I want to raise tonight a matter relating to the elections for the New South Wales Teachers Federation Council which are now in progress.

* Honorable members will agree with me that the members of the Teachers Federation by and large are not Communists, lt would be monstrous to say that even a significant proportion of them had Communist inclinations.

* Yet the New South Wales Federation has fallen under the domination of Communists led by a man called Sam Lewis.

* This man Lewis is in control of the election machinery of the Federation.

* He uses the resources of the Federation to advance the Communist cause and to arrange for the election to the Council of Communist officers, lt is therefore most important that those people who vote in the elections for the.

* Council should know what is being done and that they should vote for the opponents of Communism, tickets for this purpose having been circulated by the Federation Reform Committee, which is an organisation dedicated to getting the Communists out of control of the Teachers Federation.

* I should have made it clear that I am speaking throughout of the New South Wales Teachers Federation.

* I hope that every person who is voting in the election for the Council of that Federation will realise that the persons recommended by Lewis carry a Communist taint.

* In contrast, the people recommended for the election by the Federation Reform Committee are in point of fact persons who are dedicated to getting the Communists out of the Federation.

* Nowhere is this clearer than in the Teachers Federation, where the man Lewis, who is closely associated with the Communist Party, behaves in the way I have described.

* The New South Wales Teachers Federation has on its staff a Miss Doris Jobling.

* She drove to the lecture in a Teachers Federation vehicle with the registration number DHF-245.

* In other words, the property of the Teachers Federation was being used by a Communist in connection with Communist work.

* It was a Federation vehicle, but the union says that she paid for the petrol and that if the vehicle is used for Communist work that is none of the members' business.

* I hope that everybody opposed to Communism will not behave as some honorable members on the opposite side of the chamber have behaved in trying to shout me down, but instead will co-operate in trying to get the Communists out of the Teachers Federation.

* Do they want the Communists in or out of the Teachers Federation?

* Well, honorable members opposite become very vocal and indignant when anybody suggests any way of getting the Communists out of the Teachers Federation.

* Let me say that the organisation of the Federation has a strong Communist influence and taint and that this is self perpetuating.

* Whereas the Federation Reform Committee is not well organised and cannot get all its information out to the voters, this corrupt Communist team uses its position in the Federation to recommend candidates to the voters, who probably do not know what the members of the Communist team are doing.

* I am saying this because I hope that members of the Teachers Federation who are now voting for their council will realise that a vote for the Lewis candidates is a vote for Communism and that a vote for the Federation Reform Committee candidates is a vote against Communism.

* - of members of the Federation, entitled to vote did so vote.

* I hope that on this occasion all will vote, particularly members of the Federation who are opposed to Communism, and will see that the team sponsored by Lewis, the Communist operative, is thrown out.

* It is idle to look at the responsibilities of governments at the time of **federation** because, at that time, there was no air transport, no significant road transport, and rail transport between the States was not so extensive as it is now.

* .- I take this opportunity to bring before the House a letter that appeared in the Sydney press this morning under the name M. Wallington, federal organizer of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The letter seeks to impugn the integrity of the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  by implying that he does not understand the terms of an agreement that flowed from a recent conference that he had with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation, when an endeavour was made to bring some form of sanity to the waterfront.

* I need not remind honorable members of the scandalous activities of the Waterside Workers Federation in recent months.

* The letter I have mentioned reads - 
I refer to your editorial on Tuesday in which you deal with alleged undertakings given by the Waterside Workers Federation to the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon).

* The Federation at no time gave any assurances to the Government that its officers would prevent members from takin: industrial action, including port stoppages when such were necessary, to defend and improve conditions of work.

* ft would be impossible for Federation officers to give such an undertaking as the members of our organization decide democratically by vote at stop-work meetings what form of action to take.

* The members have endorsed the Federation officers' agreement with the Government, which was that we would do our " utmost to settle disputes by negotiation which, given goodwill on both sides, would render port stoppages unnecessary "; and we have attempted to negotiate with employers on disputes in Melbourne and Sydney to no avail.

* The letter is misleading and is quite unjustifiable propaganda on the part of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Then, a dispute having been created between the union and the employer, surely iiic right tiling io du, as provided in our industrial arbitration laws, is for the union to take its claim to a board of reference, constituted in such manner as to afford the advocate of the Waterside Workers Federation every opportunity to put forward on behalf of the union every argument he can adduce.

* The fact is that the Waterside Workers Federation is militantly led.

* It obviously suits the objectives of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation that this should be the unfortunate position for many of these men.

* These measures should be taken irrespective of whether you believe in unification or **federation**.

* Since  1945,  as a result of uniform taxation, we have moved more swiftly into unification by financial strangulation of all forms of local government than at any time in the  44  years of **federation** prior to that year.

* Has the right honorable gentleman had an opportunity to study the request of the Australian Citrus Growers Federation that action be taken to limit the importation of lemon and orange juices pending a tariff inquiry?

* 1 refer especially to the **federation**'s letters of 12th 
This is a very valuable suggestion.

* It had not occurred to me; but I think if I do as the honorable member has suggested, I shall arrange that the recruitment be conducted not by the Waterside Workers Federation.

* This is a government which has survived for a longer period of time than any other government in the history of the Australian **federation**.

* He said that the Australian Railways Union had adopted goslow tactics and overtime restrictions, and went on to say that the Waterside Workers Federation of Victoria had also refused to work on Sundays.

* I say that the Minister is trying to mislead this House, because of seven senior officers in the Victorian branch of the Waterside Workers Federation there are only two Communists.

* The fact is that as Sunday rail services were cancelled in Victoria and no alternative transport was available for these men, the Waterside Workers Federation entered into an agreement with the shipowners.

* A. Calwell said tonight that the Labour Parly would oppose any Australian commitment to defend Malaya or the Malaysian Federation.

* On 12th March, 1.963, the Leader of the Opposition, in a statement published in the " Sydney Morning Herald ", said that in no circumstances could the Labour Party support a defence commitment to Malaya or the Malaysian **federation**.

* On 19th February last, the Brisbane " Courier-Mail " published a report of the statement by  Mr. J.  R. James, secretary of the Queensland Employers Federation.

* He said - 
This was not a statement by a trade union secretary, but a statement by the secretary of the Queensland Employers Federation.

* The report continued - 
The proposed consultative committee is to be constituted by two great organizations - the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers' Federation.

* Or perhaps he means that we should wholeheartedly support Indonesia's more extreme attempts to wreck the proposed Federation of Malaysia.

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question concerning the refusal of the ' Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to load or unload cargoes to or from South Africa.

* Has he seen a report that a letter has been written by the secretary of a South African trade union, 95 per cent, of the members' of which are coloured, pleading with our Waterside Workers Federation to unload cargoes from South Africa as the present actions of the Federation are causing widespread unemployment and suffering among the coloured workers of that country?

* Has the Minister any information to indicate whether the officials of the Federation have informed its rank and file members of this letter?

* He was liked by members of the Waterside Workers Federation because he was a sincere and honest man.

* I hope that some day there will be a Melanesian **federation**; that all the people of New Guinea, whether they be Micronesians, Melanesians or Polynesians, will unite.

* I think you said it in the course of your speech, and I think you referred to the Waterside Workers Federation as the only organization that has imposed a compulsory political levy over the last  twenty  years.

* The Waterside Workers Federation did impose a compulsory political levy, as a result of which the Hursey case came into the courts.

* The Waterside Workers Federation is composed of decent Australians, and it is as decently run as every other trade union is.

* Here we had a speech by another self-appointed champion of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The Communist-led Waterside Workers Federation could have applied to the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission for long service leave.

* Instead, it has chosen to overlook the needs of its members and adopted the devious tactics of using long service leave as a means of disruption, quite apart from the interests of the members of the **federation**.

* The Government is really legislating to give members of the Waterside Workers Federation a better basis of benefits than the **federation** officials have chosen to pursue.

* In trying to assess this strange attitude of the Labour Party, one can only assume that it has been influenced by the Communist-led Waterside Workers Federation to oppose this bill.

* This union has had ample opportunity to apply to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for these benefits, but it has not done so; and now that the Government has taken the initiative, the **federation** has used its good offices with the Labour Party to block it.

* These are penalties, and they are reasonable penalties when related to the generous benefits extended by the bill and also to the appalling record of the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation in failing to play the game according to the rules of arbitration.

* The record shows with no less clarity, however, that the leaders of one particular union, the Waterside Workers Federation, will ' gladly accept the favorable decisions after giving all sorts of assurances not to break the rules in future but immediately after receiving a favorable judgment will, with a studied air of gay nonchalance and reckless abandon and with complete contempt of law and society, abrogate completely the principles which it guaranteed.

* During the hearing the advocate for the union,  Mr. Docker,  gave the commission an assurance that if the **federation**'s claims were granted in substance, the **federation** would discourage to the utmost of its ability any tendency on the part of branches to conduct unauthorized stop-work meetings.

* Since obtaining the benefit of permission to hold eight authorized stop-work meetings a year, branches of the Waterside Workers Federation in numerous ports have either held meetings in excess of this number or have held unauthorized meetings without notice.

* When shipowners have become aware that unauthorized stop-work meetings were to be held they have, on occasions, sent telegrams to the federal office of the **federation** asking, in effect, that the undertaking given to the commission, to which I have just referred, be honoured.

* Is it unreasonable, then, to expect a fair pattern of behaviour from the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* ls it unreasonable to legislate - if I may use the term employed by the Leader of the Opposition - for a fair go from the leaders of the **federation** in the attempt that all industry is making to boost our export trade, because in this connexion also every stoppage at the wharfs adds to the unit cost and the sale price overseas of our products?

* Is it unreasonable to try to prevent Australia from being priced out of overseas markets by the capricious behaviour of the Communist leaders of the **federation**?

* Finally,  Sir, is  it unreasonable for this Parliament, consisting of Australian citizens dedicated by oath to act in the best interests of the Australian people, to refuse to be held to ransom by the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, who acknowledge a sovereign other than our beloved Queen?

* In the 60-odd years since **federation** only one Australian Prime Minister has had the imagination and courage to take the initiative to accept and to act on the indisputable belief that the progressive harnessing of Australia's water resources for power, irrigation and flood control is a national responsibility, that is, a responsibility of the central government.

* Even before Federation, appeals went to the Privy Council from the various Australian States.

* Since Federation, the position has not been changed.

* Has his attention been drawn to the Medical Journal of Australia which called for a complete ban on television advertising of cigarettes and to the editorial of this Journal which attacked the present code of control exercised by the Federation of Australian Commercial' Television Stations and questioned Government sincerity in employing such restrictions which do not prevent the use of healthy, glamorous models in this advertising?

* I refer to members of the Teachers Federation, who have repeatedly pointed out the crisis that exists in education at all levels in every State of the Commonwealth.

* To-day, I asked whether or not the tactics of this combination of the Australian Railways Union and the Waterside Workers Federation, could be taken with other facts to show a resurgence of Communist efforts to regain control of all the transport unions.

* But the Waterside Workers Federation is also Communistdominated, and it is a curious fact that when the Australian Railways Union, in an absolute thumb-to-nose attitude towards arbitration, indulges in these pin-pricking and wasteful tactics, which are very difficult for the community to bear, it is the Waterside Workers Federation that gives it support.

* That union criticized both the Australian Railways Union and the Waterside Workers Federation, and it decided that its members would not go on strike in sympathy with the other two unions.

* the Waterside Workers Federation said, " Very well, we will not work on Sundays ".

* It may seem curious that unions other than the Waterside Workers Federation did not join with the Australian Railways Union, but when one considers the facts and finds that both of these unions are Communistcontrolled and Communist dominated, the reason becomes apparent.

* He is another man whose name is well known to all honorable members and who is celebrated, if you like to use that term, for his control over the Waterside Workers Federation and his efforts in the past to dislocate the waterfront.

* We know the Waterside Workers Federation, and we know the Communists who dominate it.

* Can he say whether the New South Wales Banana Growers Federation recently decided to cut supplies of bananas by 50 per cent.?

* It is an attitude of kindly and protective interest in the Waterside Workers Federation and its continued existence in its present form and with its present lawless leadership.

* One fact which is clear and which is not denied by the Opposition - at least, I have not heard it denied - is that the dominant power in the Waterside Workers Federation is exercised by people whose attitude and policies are inimical to the interests of this country.

* I refer to the fact that the dominant power in the Federation is exercised by a small clique of Communists.

* It is therefore strange, to say the least, that we should witness from the mouths of Opposition speakers this continued, kindly interest - this desire to see that the Federation, under its present leadership, is not deflected from a course of industrial lawlessness which is probably without parallel in Australia's history for many years.

* It is interesting to compare that view with the view of the leadership of the Waterside Workers Federation which honorable members opposite, whether they like it or not, are supporting through thick and thin in this debate.

* In the earlier part of this year, conferences were held between representatives of waterfront employers and the Waterside Workers Federation.

* On behalf of the Federation,  Mr. Fitzgibbon,  the General Secretary, was present at these conferences.

* The employers proposed a scheme for permanent employment and indicated their willingness to negotiate on this question and to discuss it fully with the Federation.

* Some little time later, after he had gone to his Federal Executive,  Mr. Fitzgibbon  came back to the conference and indicated to the employers' representatives that the Federal Executive of the Waterside Workers Federation would have nothing to do with permanency of employment in their industry.

* So, we see a stronge dichotomy or a strange inconsistency in the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition, whilst he supports the motion of permanency and, in the same breath, supports the militant and lawless leadership of this Federation, he disregards the fact that the very matter he proposes as an essential move for peace in this industry is one that the Federation will have no part of at all.

* It is to make provision to curb the lawlessness of the Waterside Workers Federation under its present leadership, should it continue.

* It does so by providing for a determination of the question of whether the lawlessness of the Federation deserves deregistration by judicial process.

* At the beginning of this year the Waterside Workers Federation announced that it would resort to and continue to resort to direct action - that means strike action - to enforce the wide variety of demands it had made.

* Because the Federation, under its present leadership, believes in taking the law into its own hands and striking for a variety of purposes that are political- 
Yes.

* The Federation believes in rejecting all reasonable efforts for mediation and negotiation.

* The first thing of note that happened after the Minister appointed  Mr. Woodward  to conduct this inquiry was that the Waterside Workers Federation, under its Communist leadership, denounced the inquiry as bogus.

* The Federation denounced the inquiry as bogus; yet we have the Opposition here attempting to denounce the Government for refusing to wait until the inquiry brings in its report on all the questions submitted to it before bringing down legislation such as the Bill now before the House.

* to the declared attitude of the Federation which the Opposition is supporting.

* The Waterside Workers Federation, in the same breath and on the same day as it denounced the Woodward Committee as bogus, announced that it would hold 24- hour stoppages every fortnight until its demands were met.

* - Mr. Speaker, before the suspension of the sitting I was referring to the fact that the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, having decided to boycott the Woodward Australian Stevedoring Indusry Inquiry, and having previously decided not to put any of the Federation's industrial claims before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, resolved to involve the members of the Federation in a series of fortnightly stoppages for the purposes of enforcing all their claims, political, industrial and other.

* The next thing we should remember in considering whether the Government has justification, as I say it has, for introducing this legislation, is that on 13th and 20th August, before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission,  Mr. Docker  who, be it remembered, is an avowed and proud Communist, toldMr.JusticeGallagherthat even if all the demands of the Federation other than the demand for nationalisation of the stevedoring industry were met there would be no real prospect of a cessation of strike action until the stevedoring industry were nationalised.

* So we had the position that the Federation, on 4th August, and a fortnight later on 18th August, held an Australia-wide strike for the purpose of enforcing claims which could have been argued either before  Mr. Woodward  or before the Commission.

* On 2nd August, I think it was, the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr. McMahon)  in a statement, which I am sure had the wholehearted support of every responsible person in this community, said that the Government would not be blackmailed by the conduct of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Then, on 24th August, after there had been a 24-hour stoppage on 18th August, we witnessed a remarkable, but of course quite temporary, change of front on the part of the leadership of the Waterside Workers Federation.

* Previously Docker had said that it would not be feasible or possible to call off these fortnightly stoppages unless there were mass meetings of members of the Federation to pass a resolution calling them off.

* But this must be borne in mind when one considers  Mr. Docker's  statement on that occasion: Onlyadaylater,on25thAugust, the General Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation speaking in Perth, said, according to a newspaper report - 
The decision to end the fortnightly 24-hour national stoppages did not mean the Waterside Workers Federation was backing down .

* So it is quite plain,  Mr. Speaker,  that in calling the stoppages off the leadership of the Waterside Workers Federation was adopting no more than a temporary expedient.

* It is a circular from the Acting Secretary of the Sydney Branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and is addressed "To All Job Delegates and Job Committees ".

* The document states - 
This is at a time when the doors of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the doors of the room in which the Woodward inquiry was being held were open to the Federation so that its representatives might walk in and present their economic demands to either of those two bodies.

* The fifth paragraph in this circular from the Sydney Branch of the Federation states - 
That was a confession, of course, that the Federation was already indulging in deliberate go slow tactics.

* Therefore, let it be quite clear that right up to the end of August the Waterside Workers Federation, although it had backed down temporarily on the question of the fortnightly 24-hour stoppages, reserving to itself the right' - if we can call it a right, and of course it is not - to resume them as and when it sees fit, was determined to persist in other forms of unlawful industrial action.

* The country has been subjected by the dominant leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation, who are Communists, to a deliberate persistent campaign of unlawfulness.

* Sir, the  attitude of the leadership of the Waterside Workers Federation and the attitude in this House of the Opposition, during this debate, may well be summed up by quoting a couple of lines from an old French song.

* The attitude which it espouses in support of the leaders of the Federation is not only embodied in the two lines from the song which I have just quoted, but those two lines also expose that attitude as being completely unjusti fiable.

* Support for and of New Guinea is not merely a problem of **federation** and the effect it may have on CommonwealthState financial relations, even though it cannot be denied that the Australian people are making a very substantial sacrifice in financial terms in following this Government's policies.

* This month, when addressing a convention of the Federation of Cooperative Housing Societies in Victoria,  Mr. Warren  McDonald,  Chairman  of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation, called for an immediate housing survey by the Commonwealth.

* Mr. Warren  McDonald said - 
As with so many other matters we, with our federal system, should apply lessons that have been learnt in the world's greatest **federation**.

* The 
On the question of Malaysia the Leader of the Opposition made a strong statement supporting the establishment of the **federation**, but the conference issued some vague statement to the effect that the areas of 
Borneo ruled by the British should be decolonized in accordance with the United Nations principles and charter.

* It made no mention of support for the Malaysian **federation**.

* In accordance with the recommendation of the three gentlemen who compiled the report, an Australian wool industry conference is to be set up with a membership of 25 representatives from the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and 25 from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, a total of 50 members.

* There is a tightlyknit combination of two of the most powerful federations, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council.

* We do not want a continuation of this rotten row between the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* Can the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council or the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation quibble about that?

* I suggest that he could call into his office, or himself go to see, representatives of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Primary Producers Union or the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, and he could then use his own judgment in ensuring that the proposed board is democratically elected.

* It is obvious that powers are conferred on  a  Federal legislature to enable it to legislate on particular matters which the founding fathers thought should be uniform throughout the whole **federation**.

* Every 5 years it is usual for the Commonwealth Government to negotiate with the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and the State governments which are interested in the wheat industry.

* For a number of years the Federation has engaged in negotiations with the Commonwealth Government.

* The Federation, the Commonwealth Government and the State governments which are interested in this matter then reach an agreement.

* Once we interfere with this machinery under which the Wheatgrowers Federation, which has been set up by organisations in Australia to do a job, negotiates with the Commonwealth Government and the State governments concerned, then we will be on the road downward, not upward.

* Apparently the Wheatgrowers Federation, the Commonwealth Government and a majority of the State governments have agreed to the proposals.

* If J understand the position correctly, the Victorian Government is standing out against the proposals of the Wheatgrowers Federation, of the other State governments and of the Commonwealth Government.

* When we look at the overall situation we ask ourselves, as the Wheatgrowers Federation has asked: 'Why should not the price of $1.70 per bushel, which is the price for wheat that is consumed in Australia, be applied to wheat that is exported?'

* In my book, they are reasonable and 1 expect that the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation is of the same opinion.

* Producers in each industry must form a strong organisation or **federation** to represent them in Canberra when their problems are being discussed.

* It is important that the confidence of Malaysians, of Malays and Chinese, be maintained in Kuala Lumpur and in the Federation of Malaysia.

* I interviewed a member of the Canadian farmers' **federation** in Ottawa.

* But,  Mr. Speaker,  may I remind the members of the Labour Party that they, together with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, invited the  president  of the All China Federation of Trade Unions,  Mr. Liu  Ning-yi, to Australia almost immediately after he had led a hate-America campaign in which he had called the  President  of the United States of America a bloodstained hangman and the ringleader of bandits.

* Represented at the meeting were the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, the Australian Council of Employers Federations, the Australian Metal Industries Association, the Australian Automobile Chamber of Commerce, the Master Builders Federation of Australia and the Electrical Contractors Association of Australia.

* Furthermore, the New South Wales Teachers Federation claims that the Department of Technical Education in New South Wales has  not  enough staff or equipment to implement this adult training scheme.

* Mr. Leslie,  the Assistant General Secretary of the Federation, said that the Executive of the Federation had passed a resolution opposing the scheme.

* He said that the Federation favours a vigorous apprenticeship system and he described the Minister's proposals as rather piecemeal.

* Mr. Leslie  said that the Teachers Federation had proof that technical colleges in New South Wales could not handle increased numbers of students.

* I desire to know whether he is aware that a day or so ago the Commonwealth Industrial Court imposed a savage fine of 500 upon the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, because some of its members had exercised their right to withhold their labour following failure to resolve an industrial dispute.

* Is it a fact that the matter upon which the  **federation** was fined was heard and determined by three judges, two of whom had been active Liberal members of this Parliament in recent years?

* Does the Minister consider it conducive- 
It is true that the United States and Canada have not yet ratified the convention - nor has Australia - but well over half the population of the United States of America enjoys equal pay and all the most highly industrialized  State3  in the **federation** have applied the principle of equal pay.

* Following the Commission's action, the Waterside Workers' Federation made representations to us to apply this new general standard to the stevedoring industry and to widen considerably the application of the long service leave scheme.

* While this is not the occasion for a discussion about the national conferences, I must take this opportunity of congratulating all concerned in them - the  Chairman, Mr. Woodward,  the Federation, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the employers and, of course, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and my own Department - for the very remarkable atmosphere that they have engendered in, and the tremendous amount of constructive thought they have brought to, the conferences.

* Now, if I may return to the immediate purpose of this speech, during the course of the conferences the Waterside Workers Federation, supported by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, asked that the Government consider its earlier request for improvements in the long service leave scheme.

* If we had grafted on to it the amendments necessary to give effect to the Government's proposals and decisions in relation to the Federation's request PartIIIa would have become even more complicated.

* I should like him to tell us why he became a party to this Country Party gerrymander and the incorporation in the Bill of provisions that have never been included in electoral legislation since Federation and which, as the Minister for the Interior has said, are there to give the Government territorial representation.

* He opposes the establishment of the Australian Wool Industry Conference, which has been requested by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* The establishment of this marketing committee was clearly essential if the **federation** were to reach agreement on the overall plan.

* The Australian Primary Producers Union has been unjustly ignored by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* When you compare the composition or spread of the Australian Primary Producers Union with the spread of the graziers council or the **federation** you find that it is true that the council is representative in more States, but is not particularly strong in Western Australia and the **federation**, the Tasmanian Farmers Federation affiliated with the Australian Primary Producers Union in Tasmania is much stronger numerically than the graziers association in that State.

* Yes; the **federation** has  43,000  members spread over four States.

* Perhaps it is ironic, but the **federation** should have had a soft spot for the Australian Primary Producers Union in this regard, because there was a time when it had to fight the graziers organization for recognition, the graziers being the only opponent in the field.

* But having got in and achieved recognition the **federation** seemed to be prepared to slam- the door behind it and forget that it once had this particular struggle.

* They could perhaps have been abandoned and the old rivalries between the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation could have broken out once more.

* I say that it would be no more of a miracle than the marriage that occurred between the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council and Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation in the middle of this year.

* If the Australian Wool-growers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation are really sincere in their efforts to serve the industry as a whole, they will not allow this position to prevail.

* It has been said that the conference could be made a statutory body and that the Government could just say that there shall be 25 members of the graziers council, 25 members of the **federation** and a number of members of the union on the conference.

* However, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Government must work to see that prejudice is not allowed to prevail and to see that the position is put right in the not too far distant future.

* Today, in an attempt to take this matter a stage further and get some clear understanding as to where we were going in relation to this head-on collision, I put to the Minister a reasonable type of question, concluding with an inquiry as to how long he intended to keep us guessing before he or his Department took some action towards bringing the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers to the conference table to try to stop the conditions that are tying up industry on the waterfront.

* If I took the Minister's reply literally, it would have me guessing as to whether he is actually preparing legislation to take away from the Waterside Workers Federation all the rights at present held by the Federation with relation to the recruitment of labour, because that is what the employers have asked for.

* We all know of the huge penalties that have been imposed on the Waterside Workers Federation to date.

* This discrimination is against the spirit of **federation**, and is totally unacceptable to us.

* This conference, supposedly a nonstatutory organization to consist of 25 members appointed by the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and 25 members nominated by the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation, will apart from an independent  chairman,  be wholly constituted by wool-growers.

* Together, the organizations recognized by the Government, the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation account for some  66,000  wool-growers.

* The Opposition amendment would provide an opportunity for any organization, including the Australian Primary Producers Union, the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, farmers and settlers' associations and the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association, which has more than  1,000  members who are wool-growers as defined in the amendment, to have a say in the management of the wool industry.

* .- Mr. Speaker, on 6th April last, there were before the Commonwealth Industrial Court proceedings in which the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia was charged with, and in fact subsequently convicted of, contempt of court.

* The court had made an order that the **federation** obey the terms of the award, which bans all restrictions oi work.

* At an earlier stage, there had been a stoppage of work and the court had enjoined the **federation** to obey the award.

* Mr. Docker,  was the advoctate for the Waterside Workers Federation.

* The importance of it is that it indicates the attitude of the Waterside Workers Federation, as expressed through its advocate  before the  court, for the Industrial Court as a court, for the act to which the **federation** is subject and for the award.

* 1 think that the simplest thing for me to do is to read the relevant part of this transcript, which is as follows: - 

 Mr. Docker: I do not propose to address at any length but simply wish to say the offence with which we are charged was a one day stoppage on the Melbourne waterfront which involved the holding of a meeting of the members of the Melbourne branch of the Federation which was considered by them necessary.

* Like me, the Minister believes and has said that the majority of the members of the Waterside Workers Federation are good, honest, fair dinkum blokes.

* What the Minister has done - and I wholeheartedly support him - has been to attack the Communist controllers of the Water side Workers Federation for the manner in which they deliberately, cynically and dishonestly manipulate the legitimate industrial objectives of the ordinary wharfie for political purposes.

* Some of the men whose names were submitted were actually facing criminal charges when they were nominated by the Federation.

* Can anyone honestly suggest that it is not the deliberate policy of the Communist controllers of the Waterside Workers Federation to recruit men who have been consistently in the habit of getting what they want through violence?

* Why else is it that the names of men submitted by officials of the Federation recently contained such a high proportion of names of criminals.

* Stevedoring Industry Authority by the officials of the Waterside Workers Federation?

* Let me make one thing absolutely clear, lt is not the ordinary fellow working on the waterfront who has charge of the names submitted to the Authority; it is the officials of the Federation.

* I have been told by the rank and file members of the Federation that they have the right to support and sponsor members.

* Although the Estimates cover the expenditure of more than 2,000,000,000, the first nine speeches from the Opposition side were devoted to a matter which finds no place in the Estimates and which, indeed, having regard to the nature of our **federation**, would not normally be regarded as a matter of Commonwealth administration.

* No one can deny that in our **federation** the division of responsibilities has placed the matter of flood mitigation within the jurisdiction of the State governments.

* This person recently visited Australia at the invitation of a group of unions in Victoria and has now been sponsored by the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society of Australia as a delegate to the World Federation of Trade Unions, which I believe is a Communist dominated organisation.

* Finally, I remind the House that over the last seventeen years more social service advancements have been made and more legislation on the subject has been introduced in this House than occurred in the period from **federation** in 1901 until 1949.

* Indonesia would continue attempts to break Sarawak and Sabah away from the Malaysian Federation.

* Representatives of 40 countries, including Australia, were present at the conference as well as observers from the International Air Transport Association, the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations and the International Law Association.

* Some honorable members have added that it is desirable also that the members of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and similar organizations be represented because these people provide a large part of the second and third grade meat that is exported to America for hamburgers, sausages and so on.

* I am not against the Australian Primary Producers Union being represented, but I must point out quite frankly and I hope honestly that the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation are the oldest and have been the most effective organizations in this industry.

* The Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council might be classified as the right wing of the industry and I would classify the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation as the mildly pink or left wing of the industry.

* The Australian Wheatgrowers Federation was responsible for Australia having the finest wheat marketing board bar none.

* It also took members from the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* I know hundreds of people who are members of the Australian Primary Producers Union and also of the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation.

* The Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, which is a federal organization and which has done good work for the dairy farmers, is also entitled to some consideration because its members produce meat.

* I think the representatives on the Australian Wheat Board were appointed on the nomination of the Austraiian Wheatgrowers Federation because the **federation** did not have any rivals.

* A strong tradition of federalism and regionalism persists in Tasmania and this gives it a striking sense of separate identity and the will to insist on its rights within the Federation.

* I hope, like all of us do, that one day we will reach the parliament of man and the **federation** of the' world, but this cannot be done by force or fraud and it will not be done by tearing up the original charter of the United Nations: 
A matter of deep concern in connexion with our secondary industries is the alarming shortage of skilled tradesmen.

* One such statement reported in the press was made by  Mr. P.  J. Self, the secretary of the New South Wales Employers Federation.

* As is commonly known, the Waterside Workers Federation and Seamen's Union in Melbourne rushed to give support to the Railways Union.

* First the **federation** banned Sunday work, allegedly because of lack of transport, and the Seamen's Union placed a ban on manning of tugs on Sundays in support of the **federation**'s action.

* When the Waterside Workers Federation realized that the excuse of lack of transport would not wash, the **federation** switched, with typical Communist inconsistency, to a plan of its own that the waterside workers should have Sundays off.

* This of course was in defiance of provisions of an award recently made by  Mr. Justice  Ashburner of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which gave many new benefits to waterside workers, and despite the fact that waterside workers worked cheerfully and profitably on Sundays elsewhere- 
There has always been a close collaboration between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union and it was to be expected that the seamen would support the waterside workers over this Sunday work dispute and, conversely, that the waterside workers would aim to help the seamen in their dispute.

* So we find  Mr. Healy  of the Waterside Workers Federation-
