* 1 am gravely disturbed at the very many cases which occur in Australia where people seeking citizenship find their applications rejected largely on the basis of some sort of **secret** report which often comes from countries outside; from such great democracies' - I ask Hansard to put inverted commas around 'democracies' - as Spain and Portugal.

* Those of us who have read the documents that have been circulating in this chamber and in the Senate in the last 24 hours have no doubt in our minds that **secret** meetings are taking place and that there is at least one Minister in this House who is using his position in this place and who in fact is being used by people outside the Parliament.

* As we all know, the ideal behind the establishment of the Commission is for there to be as many public inquiries as possible on matters of vital concern to the Australian public - and to remove from the public administration of government and politics the suggestion that has all too often been present that there are lurks and perks and all sorts of underhand **secret** dealings and disguised forms of subsidy which were referred to in the Coombs task force report.

* It is no **secret** that getting through the loopholes, or tax avoidance as it is commonly called, is a game which is practised by skilled legal practitioners acting on behalf of their wealthy clients.

* Then it becomes a matter for the Minister to form his own judgment, in **secret**, in his own mind, without giving any reasons - merely saying: 'I agree that the relationship is not good and therefore this man will not get the contract which on terms of quality, ability, supply and price he should get.'

* It is not a **secret** that there are a number of licence holders in country areas who would be quite prepared to hand their licences back.

* We have made no **secret** of our view that the level of interest rates in this country is still too high, and we are prepared to follow policies which will make it possible for those rates to fall.

* Certainly the amendments which the Government has made to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act relating to **secret** postal ballots and the regulations requiring prior notification of ballots to be conducted have as their central theme the giving to all members of registered organisations of a full and adequate opportunity to have their say in who shall represent them as their leaders.

* Nonetheless, the very fact that such a roundabout procedure is available and that the availability of it was always known- we had the peculiar position of the Department and Ministers always writing to councils who raised this question and saying: 'Well, you can always get around it'- leads me to say that it seems to me that if there is this roundabout method of achieving this end and if no **secret** is being made of it, it might as well be made a direct method instead of a roundabout method.

* I do not think it is any **secret** to the honourable member for Mackellar or anyone else in this House, because I have said it ofter enough before.

* As the honourable member for Isaacs pointed out, by way of **secret** commissions and by way of discounts and rebates this legislation can be circumvented.

* A paper prepared by the officers of the Department of Labour and National Service - I wish the Minister would pay more attention to what the officers tell him and less to what people in Cabinet, who know absolutely nothing about industrial relations, try to impose upon him - pointed out the problems of conducting a ballot on a national scale, the delays of settling a strike which necessitated the holding of another **secret** ballot and the conflict that would arise in imposing strike penalties if unionists voted in favour of a strike.

* Mainly because of the compulsory **secret** strike ballot that was then ordered by the Bruce Government, that strike ended up being the longest strike in the history of the industry, and it resulted in the Prime Minister who ordered the imprisonment of the strike leader losing his blue ribbon conservative seat to the man whom he gaoled.

In this sense, electronic surveillance is a rather super-powerful general search warrant and, in the same way as a general search warrant, is exploratory, unselective and indiscriminate in what it records.

These people desperately want to see their member: The beef producers, in the grip of a mammoth disaster; the wool growers, who are the pawns in a power struggle in the Cabinet and the Caucus; the producers of minerals, who are confounded by the attitudes of a Minister who will not even spell out the rules of the game and is more interested in off again, on again, **secret** midnight negotiations for a huge loan, for what purpose nobody has yet been willing to tell us or even give a hint; and the primary producers in desperately serious trouble because they have been sacrificed by the Government on the altar of political expediency.

* Senior Labor members admitted frankly they considered  Mr Menzies'  legislation providing for **secret** ballots for the election of trade union officials, and on strike action, had been rushed down for electioneering purposes.

* That Australia joins with and supports the United States of America, France, Britain, the Netherlands and a significant and substantial committee of Polish dissidents in condemning the puppet trial in Prague of the Czech proponents of Charter 77, Vaclav Havel, Jiri Lederer, Ota Ornest and Frantisek Pavlicek and the further arrest of Pavel Kohout and the further **secret** police interrogation of former Czech Foreign Minister, Jiri Haiek and calls on the free world to support the campaign of those fighting for the restoration of human rights in Czechoslovakia.

* The meeting was **secret**, but a record of conversation taken by the Australian side at the time quotes Whitlam as opening his comments on Timor by saying that, in his opinion, the territory should become part of Indonesia.

* As far as **secret** ballots specifically are concerned, I have taken note of all that the honourable gentleman has suggested.

* If that information is submitted in a **secret** way to a security organisation and if the note which is submitted goes in the person's file, whilst the information may be evaluated as being of no consequence, the collection of such items can be of substantial significance.

* I make no **secret** of the fact that, whatever the honourable gentleman's qualities as a member of Parliament, his qualities as a host would be even greater.

* Furthermore, although the Act does not contain penalties for nonobservance of the Tribunal's decision by the companies involved, no company has publicly flouted the Tribunal's decision by going ahead with increases greater than those found by the Tribunal to be justified, and this despite the fact that a number of companies have made no **secret** of their dissatisfaction with the Tribunal's decision.

* The commitment on employment and industrial relations was that office bearers of all trade unions and all employer organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act would be elected under Electoral Office supervision by **secret** ballot.

* I am concerned that such reports have already been issued because I believe that  Mr Justice  Hope went into these matters with a great deal of care and a greaf deal of concern for the civil liberties of Australians, as one would expect, and I would believe that was one of the reasons the Leader of the Opposition, in his time, in government appointed  Mr Justice  Hope to examine Australia's security intelligence services- not just ASIO but the Australian **Secret** Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Division.

* Surely it is natural that a young child or a woman would wish to keep this matter **secret**.

* Will he also cease the **secret**, covert disbanding of units, for example many Royal Australian Air Force units, and the cancelling of procurement orders, for example the assembly of light observation helicopters, the number of which will be cut back?

* I wonder whether the Government is trying to conceal its expenditure in this important area, either with the intention of doing good by stealth or, God forbid, concealing some dark **secret**.

* It ought to be noted that before the then Treasurer admitted that the  President  of the ACTU and  Chairman  of ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd had been briefed on **secret** Budget matters he had said that he had not briefed anyone, that the Prime Minister had not briefed anyone and that the  Deputy  Prime Minister had not briefed anyone.

* Of course that it his right, but it only reinforces the feeling that is abroad in the community that there is something **secret** or hidden going on and that there is something that a little bit of light should be shone on so we can all know more about it.

* But 1 can say that when the right honourable member for Melbourne was the Leader of the Opposition he made no **secret** of the fact that socialisation was the most important plank of the Labor Party's platform.

* Has his attention been drawn to **secret** instructions the Australian Mutual Provident Society is issuing to members of its staff asking them to write to their members of Parliament?

* If so, will he for the sake of unity in the nation and in this once great Party - if I might coin a phrase - either call a general election, resign the Prime Ministership and test his standing in the Party at a **secret** ballot, or at the very least recall from the Cabinet in exile the honourable member for Wannon and Killen the magnificent?

* I also ask: In the light of the report of the **secret** telegram between  Mr Woolcott  and  Mr Renouf,  will the Minister again state that this meeting was arranged without his knowledge?

* The **secret** of the Japanese, American and Swedish performances is not that the people work betterthey probably do in the other countries; people work badly here- but is chiefly because of the throughput.

* If account is also taken of the National Employment and Training scheme, the **secret** donations made to companies to maintain employmentand let the Minister table a complete list of such donations- structural adjustment programs and other artificial mechanisms such as reductions in vehicle sales tax, the real level of unemployment would have increased by far more than 4000 during the period under report.

* The **secret** bribes handed out to Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd and Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia Ltd alone have maintained almost 2000 employees at work, all of whom coincidentally live in Australian Labor Party electorates.

* He can no longer pretend that **secret** ballots are the key to industrial peace.

* The air controllers' strike began, continued and ended with **secret** ballots.

* What was so **secret** about the accommodation proposed for Army personnel at Townsville?

* Where are these **secret** documents about which he has such reservations?

* Are they stamped 'top **secret**' in the Minister's filing cabinet?

* I refer to tax indexation and the encouragement of **secret** ballots for union officials.

* Another book 'My **Secret** Life' was written back in the 1880s, or some such time, during the Victorian days.

* I do hot think anyone who has read such publications as "The Naked Lunch' or 'My **Secret** Life' would seriously suggest that they should be openly on sale on the bookstalls for all and sundry, including children, to buy.

* We have almost reached the stage in this Parliament where the members of the Government are **secret**.

* I do suggest that the real power of this legislation when it is eventually put into proper form - it is not in proper form now - will be along those lines, in order to make us understand in a sort of research sense, much as the British have done, just how this **secret** system that exercises this enormous power in our community does work.

* Trying to find a way whereby you can put over, behind or under this **secret** system of restrictive trade practices a scheme whereby the agreements and the practices can be examined, understood and controlled is surely the point, in order to see that the people responsible for them are made accountable.

* There can be little public confidence in recommendations arising from a **secret**- they are all **secret** and I am wondering what they have to hide- inquiry.

* All the evidence we have of these types of **secret** agencies, both overseas and in this country, does not give us confidence in trusting such organisations.

* I again refer honourable members to the activities of the Central Intelligence Agency and other related **secret** agencies in the United States.

* I have not bothered to consider the KGB in this debate because I believed that the Committee was debating the role of a **secret** agency or a security agency in a democratic society.

* I believe that the Government should have enough courage to act in the present circumstances and to make **secret** ballots compulsory in all union affairs, under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Electoral Office.

* Do honourable members opposite object to a compulsory **secret** ballot?

* shall be by **secret** postal ballot.

* The Bill says that for the election of officeholders the rules must provide that all financial members are eligible to vote and that the vote shall be by **secret** postal ballot.

* Nowhere does it say what a **secret** postal ballot will be.

* For instance, it leaves open the possibility that there could be a **secret** postal ballot in the way absentee voting is now required in the rules of all registered organisations.

* That would be a **secret** postal ballot but it would not mean that all the members eligible to vote would receive a ballot paper.

* The actions of the Minister for Social Security in attempting to cover up **secret** negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* -Did the Prime Minister, on 18 February or thereabouts, write to a senior Sydney businessman with Middle East government connections saying that not only is it no **secret** that he regretted the need for the Government decision on the Palestine Liberation Organisation visas but also if the PLO wishes to send representatives to Australia it should now make applications through Australian diplomatic posts?

* The Leader of the Australian Country Party in hinting that the Prime Minister and the Commission would have a **secret** tete-a-tete - that the information between the two would come across secretly - quoted from the Crawford report which says that all directions to the Commission and advice by the Commission to the Government should be through the Prime Minister or the Minister designated by him.

* In addition, it is no **secret** that the Government has received and is considering representations for the wider application of the principles underlying the dairy reconstruction scheme, in order to assist other rural industries that are in difficulties.

* There ought to be a comprehensive inquiry into the present patchwork scheme with its many inequalities and inequities and the present departmental inquiries ought not be kept **secret** but ought to be made available to the public to peruse and to discuss.

* Those things should not be kept a **secret** but should be made public.

* To act in the manner he chose,  Sir Garfield  Barwick had to ditch the convention that the Chief Justice of the High Court must not give **secret** advice to the Governor-General on a matter calling for an interpretation of the Constitution which could involve political partisanship.

* Neither has seen the need to form **secret** caves or to aid the media in undermining the position of a Cabinet colleague.

* It is no **secret**- indeed it has been discussed in the Press ad nauseam- that the Treasury wanted the Government to adopt a restrictive Budget, one which would have had a substantial domestic surplus as a means of controlling inflation.

* It is also no **secret** that the Government rejected that Treasury Budget strategy.

* There is a provision under the rules of the AMWU and of aU unions which are registered under the Act for a **secret** postal ballot.

* I know of no case where a registered union has ever refused a member the right to have a vote recorded by **secret** postal ballot.

* The honourable member for Balaclava who made, as he usually does on matters such as this, a very thoughtful contribution, I think was a little astray when he said that he feared that there would be victimisation of the 250 members who might petition for a **secret** ballot or for an officially controlled ballot.

* I have asked him for the minutes of the meeting held on 23 September - the telephone hook-up meeting - but those minutes so far have been kept **secret**.

* Provided an agreement has been approved by a **secret** ballot of the unionists affected by it, no union should be justified in striking against any of its agreed provisions.

* The results of these polls are published nationwide and purport to be the results of a representative **secret** poll of citizens.

* But the polls are not **secret**.

* Now that the coffers are overflowing with **secret** funds they' voted against the proposition in this Parliament the other day and repudiated their intention.

* He said that he was not suggesting anything sinister but he did suggest that there may be too many **secret** decisions and **secret** discussions about by-law policy.

* The committee's report was never made public and, quite ridiculously, 14 years later is still classified as a **secret** document.

* I ask the Minister for Defence  (Mr Fairbairn)  to tell me whether it still needs to be classified as a **secret** document.

* The Government aims to shuttle off into some side track out of sight and out of mind and to establish a committee which will hear evidence in **secret** and which will give its findings to the Government to be amputated on an extensive scale.

* -Actually they are not, but I will let the honourable member into the **secret** a little later.

* As far as he is concerned, his reports can be **secret** and remain **secret**.

* We were told in special briefing programs how envelopes would be provided for members of the public who wanted to keep their information **secret**.

* Nobody made any effort to advertise the fact that envelopes could be obtained if information was desired to be kept **secret**.

* The genisis of that prognosis goes back to 1952 when a **secret** move was made by a man named Krygier- the first non-American CIA agent ever appointed to Australia.

* That same barrister, after World War II, held a commission in a **secret** Army intelligence unit and was recommended for appointment into the British Intelligence.

* I understand this part of the honourable member's question to be referring to the number of employee organisations which, by their rules, require their members to vote in **secret** ballots for elections to office.

* I strongly support the points made by other speakers relating to gross negligence, **secret** payments and the Niemeyer statement.

* Regrettably, a couple have not, in particular two that have been referred to tonight- payments that remain **secret** and the concept of gross negligence being the only one acceptable to the Government when claiming recompense.

* Every committee of the Parliament has imposed upon it the duty of being **secret** and confidential at certain times.

* The Standing Orders make some provision for this but again where matters are **secret** those honourable members not members of the Committee have to leave.

* In directing my question  to the Prime Minister I refer him to the comment of the Trade Practices Commissioner in his last annual report thatthere is more restraint placed on competition in Australia by restrictive agreements than in almost any other developed country that you care to think of.I ask: Are equally obnoxious restrictions imposed by current legislation on the prompt investigation of some 13,000 restrictive agreements on the **secret** registry?

* Will the Government take action to ensure that the **secret** registry is subject to public scrutiny, and will it apply the principle of onus of proof to participating parties as prevails in comparable legislation overseas?

* We make no **secret** of that.

* Let us see what this **secret** document says.

* This Commonwealth Government **secret** report states that the best single form of adjustment is for farmers to leave, for properties to get bigger, for companies to replace family enterprise and the encouragement of farmers to sell their properties and to move to the cities.

* This is the **secret** formula for reconstruction with the added ingredients of higher interest rates to prevent - and I quote from the report - 'any rise in land values and to discourage too many farmers in trouble from staying on their farms'.

* This is the report of the **secret** commission on rural reconstruction.

* **Secret** 
It is interesting to recall the Minister's public statements at the time he was preparing for the **secret** talks in Bali.

* Coming from someone who had just returned from **secret** talks with officials of a foreign government- talks which he had arranged privately with the Ambassador of that government, talks which he had apparently gone to some lengths to keep **secret** from the Australian Government and its officials- the honourable gentleman then declared: 
With this deception all the falsity of the Government's position has been exposed- all its hypocrisy, its manifest double standards, all the Minister's posturing and preening over the past 2 years.

* It is what he was doing and saying in **secret** that matters- what he was doing and saying in defiance of his publicly professed attitudes and his false and sanctimonious statements to this House and outside.

* It was raised by a form of **secret** tax- the insidious bite of the tax slug into earnings as they increased simply by inflation.

* It is a move violently opposed by our opponents, who make no **secret** whatever of their scheme to abolish State governments and make Canberra the great centralised source of all power.

* I want to make the point that the result of the review is not **secret** or confidential.

* The Director-General is required to 'keep **secret** all matters which come to his knowledge or into his possession by virtue of his office except insofar as any such matter may in accordance with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1956 ... be communicated to another person'.

* According to the reporter a **secret** gathering of the organisation was held on the 11th August in an Adventist's church hall in Melbourne.

* Soviet courts which sit in judgment on what may be termed political or religious cases seem to be subject to **secret** directives.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of any personal association between the recent visit to Australia by the Yugoslavian Prime Minister and the Yugoslavian **secret** police?

* Does the Prime Minister accept that information collected by **secret** police and by governments overseas, particularly in communist countries, does not always accord with practices that we in Australia see as necessary and just?

* I have had access on occasions even to **secret** documents.

* Within five days of the expulsion of Watling and Imlach, they being the Secretary and the Minute Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, there was a **secret** visit to Hobart- last Thursday- by  Mr Pat  Clancy who is the  President  of the Socialist Party of Australia which is the Moscow-line Communist Party.

* That is not a **secret** in this Parliament.

* It is not a **secret** in the Australian community.

* The intention of the amendment apparently is to ensure that the register does not record, or at least does not make available to unauthorised persons, information on **secret** or sacred matters.

* It could be done by the simple location and nomination of sites without additional information and might often be done without referring to the most sacred or dangerous sites, and certainly without including any **secret** or sacred information.

* According to information we have received in fact another paper has been prepared and presented to the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser),  who is, of course, very keen to impose quite significant changes on the present method of health care finance, and **secret** decisions have already been made by the Prime Minister, by  Mr John  Stone from Treasury and by  Dr Sax,  formerly of the Department of Health.

* I am sure that members of the Labor Party would be the first to agree that the discussions of their caucus are far from **secret**, No doubt if the Labor Party gol into office there would be a miracle overnight and there would never bc any leaks from a Labor Cabinet.

* The greater the power, the authority and the activity of **secret** intelligence agencies with respect to its own citizens, the weaker that democracy is.

* There is almost certainly an inverse correlation between the strength of **secret** intelligence agencies and the strength of the democracy.

* Taking the full extent of the continuum, on one end is the totalitarian state where **secret** police are an essential instrument of coercion and control, and at the other end is an ideal democratic state which is fully confident about its internal situation and which needs no protection against its own citizens.

* Therefore, those who wish to preserve an open and democratic society need to be peculiarly aware of, and concerned about, the **secret** arm of government.

* It may be that paradoxically it is necessary that we have a **secret** arm of government to preserve an open and democratic society, but that should never render us complacent about the supervision, accountability and responsibility of that organisation.

* If one examines the betrayal of the Weimar democracy, one of the agents of that betrayal was its own **secret** police which owed a higher allegiance, or at least another allegiance in that deteriorating situation in Weimar Germany in the late 1 920s.

* The role of the American **secret** agencies in the Mccarthyite perversions of the 1950s was a threat to the very democracy that the **secret** agencies were designed to protect.

* We have had the same perversions in this country by the **secret** arm as the United States of America has suffered and as other democracies have suffered.

* We need to ensure that, as in other democratic societies, the **secret** agencies of government do not contaminate the democratic process.

* Therefore, for these reasons, the Opposition will not simply bow down to the kind of vacuous rhetoric- reasons of state, defence of the realm, national interest- which has been used down the centuries to prevent and inhibit inquiry into the **secret** actions and agents of government.

* It is an extremely difficult and complex task to ensure effective supervision and accountability of a **secret** agency.

* There is a danger here, what I might call the Nixon phenomenon; that is, there is always a danger in that kind of relationship that the **secret** arm of government may be perverted for the political domestic ends of the executive concerned, as was clearly done in the case of  President  Nixon.

* It is exemplified by the Weimar phenomenon, or, in South Australia, the Salisbury phenomenon where the **secret** service believes it has a loyalty to some higher concept- to the state, to the Crown, or in the case of ASIO, to the Central Intelligence Agency; it has some loyalty over and above, higher and more important than its loyalty or responsibility to the elected executive.

* There are too many historic cases of **secret** services becoming simply the instruments of popular prejudice manipulated by demagogues.

* -There are similarities between these **secret** arms of government and the role played by ASIO.

* We are not members of the Maffia or some such oathbound **secret** society in which only the leading gangster can know the **secret** codes.

* With that in mind one can understand why the Government needed to keep **secret** as far as possible the measures contained in this legislation.

* The mining industry was critical of the practice of the Commission to list large tracts of land to protect the specific location of **secret** Aboriginal sites.

* We believe that the Act should be amended to allow for the establishment of a confidential register on which **secret** Aboriginal sites could be listed.

* I challenge it to state unequivocally whether abolition of the means test is or is not one of the casualties of the rather massive public expenditure cuts which it is proposing as part of its economic administration of this country in which major welfare fields, such as education, welfare housing, urban and regional development, welfare services, hospitals and community health services will all be cut back substantially according to a **secret** document circulating among a small number of senior members of the Liberal Party.

* He said that there should be a procedure for **secret** ballots on national strikes.

* He said that there should be a procedure whereby **secret** ballots are held on national strikes.

* The air traffic controllers organisation held a **secret** ballot of its members through Australia.

* The next point is that you do not have a **secret** ballot about whether people will go on strike.

* The members themselves decided that action in a **secret** ballot.

* ACTU-Solo about the oil deal, yet evidence in fact before the Commission suggested that the former Minister for Minerals and Energyhad shown ACTU-Solo how to do the deal on the **secret** terms; 
I am not aware if there were any **secret** service people accompanying the Yugoslavian Prime Minister or, if there were, how many accompanied him.

* I made no **secret** in my Budget Speech of the fact that the prospects for a fall in unemployment in this country were not bright, particularly if further progress was not achieved in restoring a proper balance between real wages and profits.

* There is no **secret** that the Opposition Leader feels uncomfortable talking on economic matters.

* According to the estimated prejudice to national security which might result from unauthorised disclosure, national security information should be given one of the four national security classifications: TOP **SECRET**, **SECRET**, CONFIDENTIAL and RESTRICTED which are defined hereunder: 
The Leader of the Opposition asks me whether the notarised statement disclosed any breach of Federal law.

* I can answer him only by saying that if those facts were shown to be true and if certain other, perhaps more incidental, facts were proved and added there could be some breach of, I think, the **Secret** Commissions Act.

* He received massive support for his promise to give unionists the right to elect their own office holders in **secret** ballots.

* It was support that was not deserved because every union's rules already provide for **secret** ballots.

* Successive Australian governments have looked at the possibility of making **secret** ballots mandatory before strike action is taken.

* I remind the House that section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act enables the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to ensure that a **secret** ballot is called if it thinks that the calling of a **secret** ballot will help in the resolution of a dispute.

* How many **secret** ballots for union elections have been conducted under the Government's new **secret** ballot legislation?

* It would be done in **secret** because he would be acting on the advice of officers.

* Does the Government's action constitute an improper use of a **secret** intelligence organisation funded by taxpayers.

* It is no **secret** that the members of the Wool Corporation have identified quite clearly with the political objectives of the Country Party.

* It is no **secret** that there have been discussions between the Wool Corporation and the leaders of the Country Party to devise this method of embarrassing the Government.

* In my view that one has no right to be labelled 'Top **Secret**'.

* That is why it is top **secret**.

* I am alarmed to find that there is evidence of a **secret** alliance between the Australian Mutual Provident Society and the Country Party, and that **secret** meetings have been held between representatives of the AMP Society and the Country Party.

* I understand the honourable member's question as referring to the number of organisations of employees which have applied to have elections officially conducted under section 170 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act since the Government's **secret** postal ballot legislation came into operation on 9 August 1976.

* Where the rules of an organisation do not provide for **secret** postal ballots, elections are to be conducted by the 
Returning Officer appointed under the rules of the organisation and in the manner prescribed in the **Secret** Postal Ballot Regulations to the Act.

* Where the rules of the organisation do provide for **secret** postal ballots, elections are conducted by the Returning Officer appointed under the rules of the organisation and in the manner provided in the rules of the organisation.

* Again, the Attorney agreed to the provision in clause 94, that a copy of the annual report which is provided to the Attorney-General by the Director-General shall also be provided to the Leader of the Opposition with the corresponding duty on the Leader of the Opposition to treat it as **secret**.

* You are no better a person because your politics are **secret**.

* If there is evidence, why does he have to keep it **secret**?

* That is not a **secret**.

* It could not be a **secret**.

* The pamphlet was presumably offering high rewards to an extreme right wing Croat **secret** society for the assassination of the people who appeared on the pamphlet, a copy of which he released to the 'Age'.

* The article in the 'Age' states: 
You referred to a pamphlet which contained a picture of a number of members of the Yugoslav **secret** agents, and stated that rewards had been offered for the killing of these persons.

* No **secret** was made then of where the target was for section 45D and there has been no **secret** in practice in the 18 months since as to what the purpose of the Government was in first introducing section 45D.

* I thought most of these things were regarded as being reasonably **secret**.

* The best example I can give of that is that files are kept on persons having a top **secret** clearance.

* The use of the formula by the Government to raise funds overseas has all the earmarks of a deliberate conspiracy to evade the Constitution for **secret** and disturbing political ends.

* Confidentiality usually applies to actual negotiations, not to the borrowing intention itself, and that was kept **secret**.

* If it were not for the persistence of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in these matters much of what is now known around Australia would have been kept quiet, would have been kept **secret**.

* The Prime Minister answered that to the best of his knowledge there had been no **secret** sounding out of the Australian Government.

* As it turned out the Prime Minister was the last to hear; a legion of public servants knew about this **secret** sounding out before the head of the Government.

* Federal Government's failure to offer funds- the funds it offered have been rejected by the Statebut of the State's **secret** deals with major industrialists, and as a result of the State not revealing the basic price and the basic returns which it is getting on that land.

* I will give honourable members the **secret** to it.

* 1 ) Is it possible for corporations or individuals to claim bribes, or other **secret** commissions given to a Government official in Australia or abroad, as a deduction from assessable income under the Income Tax Assessment Act.

* They are rudimentary and, most obnoxious of all, they are **secret**.

* The reason for this is that the Government, after further consideration and some submissions, formed the view that if the amendment were not made it might be possible for a problem to arise in relation to exclusive dealing conduct which, it is the clear intention and purpose of the Government, and we have made no **secret** of it, should be dealt with entirely under section 47.

* It is no **secret** that the Government's policy intention has been that exclusive dealing should be dealt with exclusively by section 47, and from as early as the deliberations of the Swanson Committee the view has been that section 45 conduct should be separated as far as possible from section 47 conduct.

* Those who genuinely support the policies of political parties will be able to contribute funds as much as they like, but not in **secret**.

* His  blood pressure rises at the thought of the **secret**, furtive meetings in the night- the knock at the door at 2 a.m., not by the Minister for Services and Property but by some rich and powerful friend of his from outside this Parliament; some representative perhaps of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation or United Fruit or one of the other international conspirators who will knock on his door, not to take something out of the fridge but perhaps to leave something under the bed or some other appropriate place.

* It will be putting proposals to the National Labour Consultative Council with a view to ensuring that the intention of the **secret** postal ballot legislation is in fact being achieved.

* We clearly have in Australia a unique situation of universal negative price control by manufacturers and producers to the detriment of consumers, allegedly policed by the wretchedly imperfect Act of a reluctant Government, with **secret** processes of investigation, faced with the hopeless task of unlimited years of inquiry on an ever increasing register of price restrictive agreements.

* The honourable member for Kooyong has always recognised- he even restated it todaythat the basis of these discussions that take place at the top level between Foreign Ministers, Ministers and the Prime Minister and senior representatives of the Indonesian Government and Portuguese Government, the views that are expressed and a lot of the things that make the diplomatic worlds turn round, must remain **secret** and must remain confidential.

* Some of the amendments introduce the much-heralded requirement for union officials to be elected by **secret** postal ballot.

* Another important aspect of this legislation is the proposed requirement for the election of union officials and, supposedly, officials of em- ployer organisations, to be by **secret** postal ballots.

* Clearly what the Government hopes to achieve by providing for **secret** postal ballots is more moderate union leadership- and employer organisations are irrelevant to that consideration.

* Indeed, if the Government legislates later this year to allow a collegiate system of voting for officials to operate- the Minister's speech seems to indicate that that is a possibility- employer organisations would be little affected by the **secret** postal ballot provisions as they have mainly relied on the collegiate system in the past and would presumably retain that system.

* The attitude of the Opposition to this proposal for **secret** postal ballots is that it is unnecessary and somewhat provocative.

* The Conciliation and Arbitration Act currently provides, and has provided since 1951, that union rules must make provision for election of officials by **secret** ballot with provision for absentee voting.

* Of course absentee voting is by postal ballot so the legislation currently requires all unions which hold **secret** ballots by the use of polling booths also to make provision for **secret** postal voting for those who want to vote absentee.

* The Government's proposal that all union elections be by **secret** ballot would not overcome apathy.

* The Government's original proposal, as outlined on many occasions, was that all elections for union officials would be by **secret** postal ballot of all eligible members conducted by the Australian Electoral Office.

* However, the Government appears to have made 2 concessions: One is to allow those unions whose rules provide for a form of voting that is likely to achieve a higher participation rate than a **secret** postal ballot to retain that form of voting.

* The Government has made the further concession to the Australian Council of Trade Unions that the unions could run their own ballots as long at they remained **secret** postal ballots.

* Nor do I know of my own knowledge whether in fact he has been the head of the Soviet **secret** police under whatever name it might have gone - the CHEKA or all the other names and initials which that infamous organisation has been described by over the years.

* Nor indeed do I know whether he is still associated with that **secret** police organisation, an organisation which I would have thought some of those objecting on the other side would regard as most insidious, invidious and dangerous to ordinary citizens.

* Therefore the matter that is asked of me is one to which I cannot give a decision at this time but I do believe that the Government would need to look very carefully indeed at an application by anybody to come into this country if that person had been the head of an organisation such as the Soviet **secret** police or was still working for it or associated with it.

* 64 of 1976, the relevant sections of which were proclaimed on 9 August 1976, the Government introduced an amendment to require all elections by a direct voting system for offices with policy or management functions to be by **secret** postal ballot.

* Provision was made for the Industrial Registrar to exempt an organisation from that requirement upon being satisfied that the rules as they stood at the time of the amendment provided for the conduct of an election by a **secret** ballot other than a **secret** postal ballot, and the conduct of the election in accordance with those rules would be likely to result in a fuller participation by members of the organisation than would result from a postal ballot and that it would afford to members an adequate opportunity of voting without intimidation.

* But it had to be kept **secret**.

* Where, in the opinion of the Committee, any evidence proposed to be given before, or the whole or a part of a document produced or proposed to be produced in evidence to, the Committee relates to a **secret** or confidential matter, the Committee may, and at the request of the witness giving the evidence or producing the document shall: 
We have conservative governments making **secret** deals with major foreign developers, like Mount Isa Mines, Aurukun Associates, the Iwasaki-Sangyo company and others.

* But here we have a **secret** land deal involving traditional Aboriginal land.

* We feel that it is good that these decisions should be based not just on findings made in **secret** by members of the Public Service but that they should be made openly by members of the Parliament who are after all here to represent the people of Australia.

* As everybody who is familiar with this problem knows, the system of **secret** contract rates in Queensland should be condemned throughout Australia.

* As I say, they are **secret** contract rates 
The Opposition opposes the proposal in this Bill to amend the membership of the Corporation.

* Who the new members with special qualifications are to be is still a **secret**.

* In effect ministerial directions under proposed sections 20a (1) and 20a (2) can be operative and effective for up to 1 1 months and kept **secret** for that time from the public, industry or parliamentary scrutiny.

* It is absurd for the Wool Corporation to say that its schedule of prices is **secret** to the world.

* I think it is incredible that 1 5 or 1 6 weeks after a **secret** interdepartmental committee inquired into the provision of aviation services in the Northern Territory and looked specifically at the problems of Connair and SAATAS a major operator- the largest operator- is now going out of business.

* The fact is that a **secret** IDC inquiry was held and now the major operator is going out of business.

* Is the Treasurer aware that the businessman named by him in an earlier answer is the person whose revelations about conversations with ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd directors led to the exposure of the **secret** oil deal about which the royal commission claimed the former Minister for Minerals and Energy had been deceived?

* The great cry recently was the need to hobble the activities of progressive unionists by insisting on **secret** ballots before workers went on strike.

* Section 45 of that Act reads: 
the Commission constituted by not less than 3 members nominated by the  President  (at least one of whom is a presidential member of the Commission) thinks that the views of the members, or of a section or class of the members, of the organization or of a branch of the organization upon a matter ought to be ascertained with a view to assisting the prevention or settlement of the dispute, the Commission so constituted may order that that matter be submitted to a vote of those members, or of the members of that section or class taken by **secret** ballot (with or without provision for absent voting) in accordance with directions given by the Commission.

* What the Government has done is lo provide, in the conciliation and arbitration legislation, provisions for **secret** ballots or for members of unions to require an election for offices of unions.

* -I ask the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs a question about the rejection of applications for citizenship on the basis of **secret** reports.

* Is it a fact that some hundreds, possibly thousands, of people have had their applications for citizenship rejected because of some **secret** report about which they know nothing and about which members of Parliament like myself who make representations are told nothing?

* All I know is that this proposal was kept reasonably **secret**.

* He was halfway down the passage when one of the members of the staff of the House chased after him and told him that the Government had declared the paper **secret**.

* If the honourable member Oxley has such a tremendous **secret** weapon let us hear about it.

* Let the Government have the **secret** weapon and save the economy.

* There is no **secret** weapon and we are not likely to see it.

* I make no **secret** of that.

* I do not think it is any **secret** that the committee would be looking at a project that would cost about $ 100m spread over 10 years.

* -This is a **secret**.

* On 27 June 1973 the Prime Minister appointed a **secret** committee to report on possible ways of increasing imports.

* His  letter of that date - marked 'Personal and **Secret**' - to  Mr Rattigan,  the  Chairman  of the Tariff Board, said, in part: 
Now I move from 27 June to 15 July.

* The **secret** committee reported to the Prime Minister.

* But to quote the **secret** committee on tariffs which, it will be recalled, recommended the 25 per cent tariff cut, 'there are limits to the extent to which imports can be substituted for domestic supply'.

* I think it would be wrong to have a public inquiry and then to reach a postinquiry situation where something happens that appears to be in **secret** - and this can easily occur if we do not watch the situation.

* It is not some **secret** or semi-**secret** or official or departmental organisation which owing to the conditions sets out to do certain things.

* On the one hand, publicly, he pretends to support Aboriginal welfare programs which are of the same nature as those which the Aboriginal movement presents and on the other, privately, he enters into sleazy, **secret** deals with the Queensland Government, allowing the Government of that State to maintain raciallybased policies on Aboriginal welfare.

* The **secret** deals into which he entered and the ground he constantly gave away under pressure from the Queensland Government incited the Queensland Government to act outrageously.

* He indicated that there had been an arrangement- a **secret**, shoddy deal- between the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Queensland Government to ensure that the expectations of the Aboriginal people in this matter would not be met.

* A letter of 19 January from the Premier's office in Brisbane to the Prime Minister says in one part: 
On the face of it, perhaps these are reasonable requirements in terms of fiscal responsibility but in association with the evidence I have produced of the way in which **secret** and sleazy deals have been entered into between the Minister and the Queensland Government, fiscal responsibility and fiscal controls had nothing to do with it.

* at the moment, that one of the best methods of preventing any crime is to look at where the money from such crime is going, who is interested in it, and to look at the **secret** commissions.

* Has the Government approved the sale of Australian crude oil by Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd to ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd, of which the  President  of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Hawke,  is  chairman  and managing director, for a **secret** price which is over $lm in excess of the Government's approved price?

* On 21st August when asking the Prime Minister a question regarding the photographing of pensioner deputations by this Government's **secret** police, I prefaced my question by reference to the Soviet Union's invasion of Czechoslovakia exactly 2 years previously.

* Secondly, and more importantly, we have the attempt to scare dissenters and to use **secret** police.

* How can anybody defend the use of **secret** police against deputations of pensioners at Budget time?

* The Fraser Government and the Foreign Minister were actively engaged in **secret** betrayal.

* This kind of weapon, this kind of instrument, can be fashioned by a very skilled man in **secret** with apparatus which perhaps would require a space no bigger than this chamber.

* Let us consider the possibilities of blackmail when this kind of weapon is available- a weapon which can be made in **secret** in a small plant by a skilled person.

* It is because they can close off large areas and keep **secret** from the world what is happening behind the fences.

* **Secret** service - call the officers what you like.

* Exactly how the IAEA inspectors go about their job when they arrive, however, is a matter of **secret** negotiations with each country.

* Whether it is open collusion or **secret** collusion, it exists.

* We believe that the  Chairman  of the Commission should be as independent as possible, because when I deal with the reserve price scheme I will indicate that I fail to see how we can have a virtually **secret** reserve price scheme when some of the members of the Commission could - I say 'could' in fairness - be leading wool buyers or leading brokers.

* In its present form, no-one can decipher how the Wool Commission will be expected to formulate and operate these so-called **secret** day to day or more frequent reserve prices.

* Another thing I want to know - and the lack of information on this is a serious deficiency in the Bill - is this: Is this reserve price to be a **secret**?

* ls the Minister so naive to believe that a reserve price can be kept **secret**?

* I admit that there is nothing in this Bill to say that a reserve price will be **secret** but on the other hand there is nothing in the Bill to say that it should be made public.

* Six days ago I drew his attention to reports from the Los Angeles spy trial that the Central Intelligence Agency was engaged in deception against Australia and that **secret** material involving Australia had been passed to the Soviet Union.

* I do not think it is any **secret** to members who represent marginal seats with large pockets of unemployment that our system of handling unemployed persons is in need of some major reform.

* Despite the preelection promises made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education a deliberate **secret** instruction was given to the Karmel Committee - 'government schools will not be pre-determined'.

* In addition - we make no **secret** about this; we put it forward, and we put it forward clearly - where there are obvious areas of need we would seek to have additional funds expended.

* As I have said, the matter is no great **secret**.

* To my knowledge it was not presented to Cabinet, it was not presented properly to the industry, and in fact it was a **secret** document.

* I hope that it is not kept **secret** as the previous document was.

* I would like to say also that I am most grateful- not quite to the same extent as I am grateful to the Minister in whose case I am almost grateful- to the Melbourne 'Age' for first covering this issue of a so-called **secret** deal that took place between officials of the Australian Mutual Provident Society and members of the National Country Party of Australia over the proposals of the Government on this allimportant subject.

* Under the heading 'Help us beat bill, insurers ask CP', the article in part states: 

 Senator Wheeldon said yesterday the documents revealed that there was 'a **secret** alliance between the AMP Society and the Country Party and that **secret** meetings had taken place'.

* A spokesman for the AMP said documents covering correspondence between the society and the Country Party were 'not **secret**'.

* As one of the members who organised this so-called **secret** deal, I want to make a brief comment.

* There were no **secret** divisions and no **secret** discussions as has been pointed out by a member of the AMP Society.

* Why the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation  (Senator Wheeldon)  should select the National Country Party and say that it engaged in a **secret** deal of handing over money I would not know.

* This matter has been raised by  Senator Wheeldon,  the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation in another place, and by the Minister for Services and Property, who have made the suggestion that we are making **secret** and sinister deals with the companies.

* There are no **secret** deals.

* In view of the firm and categorical denial of any difference by the Prime Minister on 9 April and supported in another place by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee),  there is clear evidence for everyone to see that the Prime Minister -has deceived this Parliament and tried to suppress and keep **secret** the Government's real feelings and attitudes.

* -I refer the Minister for National Development to the question I asked him yesterday concerning his **secret** lunch with representatives of oil companies organised by the Liberal Party in Western Australia.

* How many **secret** postal ballots of the type referred to in sub-section 133AA( 1 ) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act have been conducted since 9 June 1976.

* I am advised that the new procedures are being carried out in conformity with the legislation which, as honourable gentlemen will recall, requires unions to conduct **secret** postal ballots.

* The information I have is that in 1 974 only 20 unions availed themselves of the provision that was then in the Act, but not as a mandatory requirement, which allowed the Electoral Office to conduct **secret** postal ballots on their behalf.

* That shows quite clearly that the rank and file members of the trade union movement are moving towards the Electoral Office conducting **secret** postal ballots; that they are in favour of the system and obviously believe it gives them a fairer go in determining who should run their union affairs.

* If one-fifth of those members, who may not even be financial members, then require a ballot that could occur, but again it would not have to be a **secret** ballot in accordance with the provisions of the amendment that the Minister is in fact introducing.

* Clause 13 provides that elections for the specified offices in organisations, that is employer or employee associations registered under the Acts, shall be by **secret** postal ballot.

* It was taken on a **secret** ballot which nobody bothered to count.

* It is said in our platform, which is not a **secret** document but is something- (Quorum formed).

* Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with the British in conducting **secret** atomic 'trigger' tests at Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at Maralinga?

* The ballots conducted under the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union rules are **secret** ballots.

* But they are **secret** ballots because the ballot papers are distributed on the night of the star meeting.

* There may be a good reason for spending the money on a new airstrip but it is a **secret** to the Aborigines.

* I want to state the following in regard to that matter: Some time ago a man went to see the 'Advertiser' with a request for payment in return for a story about film in his possession of a **secret** rocket firing at Womera.

* This was the lead runner of the film of a **secret** rocket firing.

* Police inquiries revealed that up until the Kotz case no record was ever kept of who took out film of a particular **secret** rocket firing for inspection and there was no enforced return of film which had been taken out.

* The answer given by the Minister for Supply to my question regarding the prosecution of a man in connection with the disappearance of **secret** rocket firings film from Woomera clearly indicates that the Government in general and the Minister in particular are concerned only with covering up serious breaches in Australia's security arrangements.

* In his reply to my question, the Minister on the one hand admitted in part that in fact film with images of a **secret** rocket firing film at Woomera was recovered by the Commonwealth Police from the home of a man charged in Adelaide Magistrates Court.

* The report is not a **secret** document.

* It hurried off into a **secret** session.

* Obviously he was here in **secret**.

* If any research is done on hazards and safeguards, will reports of this research be made available to the public or will they be' kept **secret**?

* It is no **secret** that the Queensland Government wants to regain control of what were once State territorial waters.

* They are not game to do so because they know that in the past we have had devaluation by stealth, a **secret** committee looking at the basket of currencies each day, moving the Australian dollar progressively downwards.

* However, my quick glossing through the appendices confirms a view which I established when I went through the **secret**, and therefore restricted, reports of the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security in this country.

* It is no **secret**.

* ( 1) Australian **Secret** Intelligence Service (ASIS).

* It might be said that the register itself could be kept **secret**.

* It is absolutely fundamental to Aboriginal society that some things should be kept **secret** especially from other Aboriginals who are not permitted to know about them.

* In the light of the trenchant criticism of Australia's **secret** agencies contained in the published part of the Hope report, what has the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation done in the last 12 months to warrant the considerable increase in its budgetary allocation.

* Six years later the matter was still concealed within the Department- too sensitive an issue, too **secret** a matter to be passed on to the Government and the Minister.

* No **secret** has been made of the fact that improvements such as parallel runways involving extensions into Botany Bay have been under examination.

* Was this correspondence marked **secret**.

* 5 ) If so, does this disclosure constitute a breach of the **secret** classification.

* I think that a tendency exists in Australia to classify too much material as top **secret** when it would not matter if everybody knew all about that material.

* No longer does defence rely on having some sort of **secret** weapon.

* What will happen to future relations with all sections of the health care industry in Australia when the relations between the Government and the industry are being poisoned and increasingly confused by **secret** negotiations, rebuttals, promises or assurances supposedly made on behalf of the Minister?

* After the **secret** negotiations, which were taking place the day after the socalled be all and end all of the health problems of this country had been re-printed for presentation to Parliament on 19 March, a letter dated 20 March was sent, setting up this meeting.

* As soon as these **secret** negotiations became public the Minister denied them.

* Prior to the suspension of the sitting, we were debating the actions of the Minister for Social Security in attempting to cover up **secret** negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* The next question that must be asked is: How many other Ministers at present are presenting one face to the Australian public while they are engaged in **secret** negotiations and private double dealing behind the scenes?

* That is the **secret**, that is what the Opposition proposes to do.

* The disabilities go further because, just as with the current Trade Practices Act, the Government has got into a position where the Commissioner for Trade Practices and the tribunal itself are nothing more than a **secret** setup.

* He chanced upon the marvellous idea that he would ask one of the most dangerous communists this country has ever seen, Ted Roach, none other, who was then the Assistant Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, to confer with him in **secret**.

* We make no **secret** of that effect.

* I commend to him the revelations in the Melbourne 'Sun' today as to the sparring for position between the Liberal and the Country parties to speak on this subject and the way a **secret** deal was made between their shadow Ministers last Friday as to who was to propose the matter for discussion.

* Provision for the holding of **secret** ballots is another proposed amendment to the Act.

* I think it is obvious that the scheme of **secret** ballots must have some aura that attracts public attention.

* I would say that anyone who has any practical knowledge of this matter would realise that the operation of **secret** ballots is a little farcical because it is practically impossible to carry them out.

* There is provision in this Bill to give to the Commission power to order the holding of **secret** ballots.

* One thing which intrigues me is the assumption that if a **secret** ballot is held the men will automatically reject strike action.

* I refer to a **secret** ballot which was carried out among railway men in Queensland a few years ago when the men overwhelmingly decided in favour of strike action.

* What intrigues me is that if a **secret** ballot is carried out and the men decide to go out on strike or to take other industrial action, after a while some negotiations will take place, but what action will be taken to get the men back to work?

* Will a **secret** ballot be held to get them back to work or will a show of hands be relied on?

* That is one point that certainly is not covered in this Bill, mainly because in the argument of the Government it is assumed that every time a **secret** ballot is held the men will reject any suggestion of industrial action.

* One thing which I did notice in that part of the Bill dealing with **secret** ballots is the list of penalties which may be imposed if a person does not abide by the provisions of the Bill.

* In the light of the action taken against public servants for minor breaches of official secrets legislation, what action will the Government take in relation to this unprecedented disclosure of the staff of an entire **secret** organisation?

* Is it true that, during the moratorium on nuclear weapons testing between 1958 and 1961, Australia co-operated with the British in conducting **secret** atomic 'Trigger' tests at Maralinga and that waste and debris from these tests were buried at Maralinga?

* It should be provided only after there has been an open inquiry, not a **secret** interdepartmental inquiry or an inquiry within one department such as was the case with the hearing aids, the result of which as yet has not been released to the public in spite of all the cries of open government which we hear from this Government.

* It is headed: 'Chemist Chief Hits at Government Decision', and reads as follows: 
The United States, in fact, has at least 28 **secret** bases in Australia and its territories - all planted during Australian Government evasions and protestations of 'joint control'.

* The Australian' disclosed that there are at least 28 **secret** bases.

* At the time it was to be **secret**.

* It is a top **secret**.

* There is no need to keep this information the close **secret** that it has been for so long.

* How can we have trust in the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and this Government when it is established that there were **secret** assurances from the Prime Minister to the Queensland Premier not to apply the authority of some of those Acts I cited a few seconds ago.

* But the fact is that none of these things was done because there were **secret** deals between the Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier.

* Eighteen months ago the Prime Minister gave a **secret** assurance to the Queensland Premier that there would be no land acquisitions for the purposes of establishing land rights for Aboriginals in Queensland.

* I repeat that 1 8 months ago the Prime Minister gave a **secret** assurance to the Queensland Premier that, despite what the Government was claiming it wanted to achieve for the Aboriginal people, it would not allow the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission to make independent land acquisitions for Aboriginal people.

* But in this most **secret** of all secretive governments anywhere we will never understand what goes on behind the closed doors of this Government because it is not prepared to tell the Australian people really what its concerns are.

* Other provisions cover the application of the **Secret** Commissions Act and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the Territory.

* -There was no **secret** about that.

* Independent committees and commissions always recommend action- things to be done that involve expenditure and social reforms that incur responsibility; whereas departmental sections report to department secretaries and to Ministers in private and their reports are **secret**.

* Mr Hodgson,  the Federal Secretary of the TWU, made no **secret** of his intimidatory intentions.

* One is not sure whether this radio monitoring station was meant to be **secret** or whether it is not **secret**.

* One minute we hear of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  having a confidential and classified briefing because it is **secret**.

* Now the  Deputy  Prime Minister says that of course everybody knew about it, that it was never **secret**.

* But apparently it is not **secret**.

* Regulation 146AD, which applies to elections conducted under the **secret** postal ballots regulations, prescribes that the Returning Officer shall, within 2 1 days before the opening of nominations, publish in a newspaper certain particulars concerning the lodging of nominations.

* In practice, in the case of an organisation conducting an election in accordance with the **secret** postal ballot regulations, and requesting the conduct of that election under section 1 70 (i), the requirements of the Regulations would apply without conflict.

* There was nothing **secret** about this.

* We have seen the opposition to proposals for compulsory **secret** ballots so that sane sensible people could gain control of our industrial unions.

* So the question immediately arises: What other **secret** promises were made in private discussion between the Leader of the Opposition and the various Chinese representatives at different levels?

* Unless this can be explained in clear and concise terms, the Leader of the 
Opposition has forsaken his right ever to claim to be the Prime Minister of this country, because Australia just could not run the risk of having as its Prime Minister a person who has in all likelihood **secret** agreements of one kind or another or who has given promises which Chou En-lai expects him to put into effect.

* That is no **secret**.

* The matter was no great **secret** at the time.

* There is nothing **secret** about this matter.

* Only a relatively small area requires **secret** penetration, or espionage.

* Although it is true that these post reports are probably less important in the **secret** area than other methods of intelligence such as electronic intercepts, code breaking, clandestine agents and satellite observations, nevertheless they have a part to play.

* In matters such as this more good is achieved by the people responsible coming out into the open and putting the facts on the table in front of the people concerned than by leaving them to be dealt with by departmental memos, exchanges between governments, **secret** documents and **secret** reports.

* Since December 1975 we have seen a plethora of **secret** inquiries into transport, particularly aviation.

* One of the edicts that went out in this great **secret** document was that there should be an attempt to stimulate the trafficking of drugs and to do everything possible to disseminate drugs in a number of countries.

* The actions of the Minister for Social Security in attempting to cover-up **secret** negotiations aimed at amending the Government's proposed health scheme.

* That the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  was not directly a party to any such discussions, **secret** or otherwise, is just a bonus for those who see the raising of this matter as a desperate clutching at straws.

* Perhaps we can reverse the subject matter of this debate and, instead of talking about cover-ups and **secret** negotiations in relation to possible Government amendments, talk about cover-ups and **secret** negotiations between the Opposition and interested parties leading to the Opposition's draft health scheme.

* One was that the election had to take place before the next federal Budget was brought down and another was that it had to take place before the **secret** report on the construction industry became public.

* So I believe it is extremely significant that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street)  have so far refused to comment on this **secret** report.

* In that debate - I think this is of particular importance - he admitted, and no evidence can be better than personal admission, having given a **secret** briefing to certain journalists involving matters which were highly classified.

* I have made no **secret** of my views, and it should come as no surprise that I really believe what I have said.

* That is a procedure that gets around the **secret** ballot and the proper provisions of the registration of organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* That is the one union which the Minister, on his own admission tonight has recorded in Hansard, has indicated does not have a **secret** postal ballot.

* Members of that union have to apply for an absent vote if they want to get a **secret** vote.

* The way around this problem is for the Government to accept this amendment to make sure that people can vote under an Electoral Office controlled **secret** postal ballot.

* The amendment does not compel them to vote; they do not have to vote, but if they want a **secret** postal ballot at least the amendment will give them the opportunity.

* Under the proposals put forward by the Minister even if there is a court controlled ballot, a Registrar controlled ballot or an Electoral Office controlled ballot, under the amendments that the Minister is introducing there is no provision for **secret** postal ballots.

* Where we had plain provisions for an Electoral Office **secret** postal ballot in the Act, under this new legislation there will firstly be a ballot under the rules of the organisation concerned.

* If 250 men or a committee of management ask for a **secret** officially conducted ballot under the provisions of the Bill, that ballot must still, as far as practicable and possible, be in accordance with the rules of the union.

* For the AMWU that is not a **secret** ballot; it is not a postal ballot; it is the very travesty of a **secret** postal ballot.

* Had that Act been proclaimed and had the restrictions not occurred, under normal circumstances we as individuals- I make no **secret** of the fact that I was involved- who have taken steps to protect the interests of a citizen, whether he is an Italian citizen - 
My question is directed to the Minister for Health and concerns the use of the herbicide 2,4,5-T. Is it a fact that an important research study recommending the banning or restriction of the use of 2,4,5-T in Australia is being deliberately kept **secret**?

* The **secret** of success is that these countries have access to the tourist market.

* It is no **secret** that my family and I are practising members of the Catholic Church.

* For example, he would abolish **secret** postal ballots.

* The Leader of the Opposition - 
-Does the Minister for Minerals and Energy recall seeing a telex that came into his Department in Canberra on 24 June 1975 which referred to a **secret** deal between the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd and the other company?

* Since the Minister's Department was warned of the real possibility of a **secret** deal before the Minister wrote to  Mr Souter  how can the Minister say that he knew of no second contract?

* The apologists for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation believe- very sincerely in some cases- that somewhere there is a collection of files marked 'TOP **SECRET**' or 'UMBRA' which contain the nation's secrets and if these precious documents were exposed the security of the nation would be imperilled.

* We cannot criticise it for its failures because they are **secret**.

* We cannot even praise it for its achievements, if any, because the achievements are **secret** too.

* Unfortunately, I am not allowed to read his full report because much of it remains **secret**.

* I cannot examine the material which led  His  Honour to reach his judgment because much of that is **secret** too.

* 2/1975 headed World Oil: Recent Developments' and marked TOP **SECRET** UMBRA.

* At JIO headquarters I could imagine the antipodean equivalents of Biggies and Bulldog Drummond reading the  Economist,  laboriously typing their summaries and routinely marking them 'TOP **SECRET** UMBRA'.

* **Secret** intelligence is the continuation of open intelligence by other means.

* Only a relatively small area requires **secret** penetration, or espionage.

* Things that seem absolutely essential to keep **secret** become matters of absolute irrelevance.

* In other words, material about the atomic bomb which 20 years ago was regarded as terribly **secret** is now available for open scrutiny.

* There is no **secret** about it any more.

* He tried to tell us that it really was not **secret** at all.

* So, there is no great **secret** about this.

* There is no **secret** about it.

* What he was saying is this: 'Is it not true that there are papers properly classified as **secret** or top **secret** - papers which deal with defence matters, foreign policy matters and matters of sensitivity of that kind?

* In spite of what the honourable member said about rights, and I know what he feels about that matter, I put it to the House that no individual has a right to examine a **secret** and confidential document which is the property of a government.

* As far as I could understand the interjection - because the chamber is rather noisy and it was competing with others - it was that the present Prime Minister trusts his Ministers and therefore does not care to find out - he, the responsible head of a government - whether his Ministers are allowing **secret** documents to be seen by those who have not been cleared by Security.

* During question time the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  implied that copies of a **secret** advising to me from the Department of Foreign Affairs for an interview I gave the former Indonesian Ambassador on 7 November 1975 which had been given to the former  Senator Willesee  and me and which has been published in the  Canberra Times  had not been returned by the former  Senator Willesee  or by me.

* But I want to assure honourable members- this will be known by the Department of Foreign Affairs- that I never retained any **secret** documents or any Foreign Affairs documents.

* the dealings in land currently under investigation in Victoria and other transactions in land carried on in **secret** by people holding high office lead to the unjust profiteering which public intervention in the urban land market through adequately supported Land Commissions can prevent.

* To the best of my knowledge there has been no **secret** sounding out of the Australian Government, and I believe I would have known as soon as anyone.

* The Government sees a major solution to this problem being through a **secret** postal ballot.

* What it therefore proposes is that all organisations, whether of employers or workers, will be required to have elections conducted by **secret** postal ballot, and that these arrangements should have the opportunity of a 2-year trial.

* It's no **secret** that Anthony Abrahams had a few qualms - he had studied the subject pretty carefully.

* The inference was that the South African **secret** police bad followed him, reported to the Government, from there to the South African Rugby Union Board and from there to the Australian team manager who thought- 
It is no **secret** that this disastrously retrograde decision has been accepted by the Liberal Party at the instigation of a handful of powerful people, among its members.

* It is no **secret** that the ideal of decentralisation has been sold out in the interests of wealthy landholders and land developers.

* The Melbourne  Age  reports: 
It is no **secret** that the Government has for some time been reviewing the principal environmental protection legislation in order to spell out properly the role of the States in supervising the protection of the environment in Australia, to ensure that overlapping and possible duplication of effort is avoided so that expense incurred by companies and people involved is kept to a minimum and io make the Act generally more efficient.

* There is nothing **secret** about it whatsoever.

* Australia has long passed the stage of sophistication when all that a government needed to do was point to a defence installation, whisper 'Top **Secret**' and watch the votes pour in.

* It is perhaps a means of obtaining donations to the campaign fund by foolish, naive employers who think that by having **secret** ballots on strikes we will stop strikes.

* I want people to think that all of a sudden I have a **secret** weapon that will put an end to all strikes.

* On the employers side,  Mr McPhee  said that the Chamber of Manufactures had never asked for **secret** ballots to be introduced, although it would consider any proposals that the Government would make.

* It dealt with the union opposition to **secret** ballots for strikes and the way that union officials see the position.

* Once the first ballot of the rank and file decided in favour of the strike, what right would the union officials have, according to the Government's own argument and reasoning, to order them back to work once they  had decided by **secret** ballot that they would not go to work.

* The article con- ,tinues 
The legislators in NSW, who ,are expected to be followed by their counterparts in Queensland and Victoria, are suspected of basing their belief in the effectiveness of the **secret** ballot on one or more of a number of assumptions (hat' are not proven: That compulsory ballots would lead to fewer strikes, that the union rank, and file is less militant than the leadership, and that union officials often try to lead their members up the garden path of politics or planned disruption.

* I am sure that the right honourable member for Melbourne would say that one of the elements of successful and sound government is that you must be trusted and therefore you must be in a position where confidential or **secret** information can be given to you and the giver can be absolutely certain that that information will not be divulged.

* I believe that if this were done the capacity of the committee to examine satisfactorily the evidence that could be given to it - evidence that was confidential and **secret** - could no longer continue and as a result the efficiency of the committee would suffer.

* The central issue is the relative priority to be given to the power of two institutions: First, the democratic Parliament, the method of operation of which is open and subject to intensive scrutiny by the Press and by the public; and secondly, a bureaucratic **secret** organisation the method of operation of which is unknown and is not subject to any scrutiny at all.

* Once we say that it is **secret** censorship is applied to it and people say: 'Well, that is the end of it.

* All over the world there are **secret** service organisations- the Central Intelligence Agency, the KGB, UBDA and other organisations- which all say exactly the same thing.

* The Government was able to evidence to the  President  of the ACTU its genuine good faith in these particular matters because, as a result of talks that have already taken place and before these other matters were envisaged, there were modifications, as this House would know, to certain aspects of the proposed **secret** ballot legislation following suggestions put to us by the trade union movement.

* It is the Government's view that those modifications will better enable the Government's objective of **secret** ballots in unions to be achieved and therefore it seemed sensible h&gt; adopt the proposals and modifications put to us.

* We think that it provides an opportunity for the Government to be excessively **secret** about what is happening in the Alligator Rivers Region.

* Although many of its operations must be **secret**, it is nevertheless answerable to Ministers, and through them to the Parliament and the people.

* Presumably it will be after the redistribution that we will be let into the **secret** of how the Government is going about it.

* It does not have to be a **secret** that I have stood on the other side of this House for years and have contended that the war service homes legislation is actuarially sound, that it is of high principle and it is of such merit that we ought to extend it, as we are extending it, in its application to members of the forces.

* What are the criteria used for classifying documents as confidential, **secret** and top **secret**, and at what level in each Department is the classification so made.

* It is not a **secret**.

* The ex-Prime Minister was deposed after a revolt or a coup - call it what you like- in the **secret** confines of the Liberal Party and after being deposed he came into this House and made a short announcement.

* I challenge the right of the Liberal Party to have made this change in the Prime Ministership of Australia- The Liberal Party has the right to change its leader - I do not take that away from it - but, as a party of 46 in a House of 125 members and as a part of a coalition government of 66 members, the Liberals do not have the right to transfer a mandate gained by one leader to any other leader after a revolt within the ranks of their party - a revolt carried on the casting vote of the person being overthrown and then only after the supreme cowardice of all members of the Liberal Party had been shown in a **secret** ballot.

* A **secret** ballot was necessary to do that.

* The ex-Prime Minister is reported in Saturday's 'Sydney Morning Herald' as having said:  1 can't be expected to know what goes on in the mind of  Mr Bate  - if he has one.. 

 Mr Finnane continues that he does not like the reference to Hitler's **secret** police, and that he is disappointed in these statements.

* I do not think any reasonable person would have understood that interjection in a time of debate to imply that he had carried out his work in the way that Hitler's **secret** police had done.

* I think it was fair to point out what had happened during the proceedings; it was fair to point out, as it had been pointed out in debate, that the proceedings were **secret** and that certain undertakings had been broken.

* We propose to introduce legislation which will provide for **secret** postal ballots in all organisations, and of course this already is the case in a number of unions and employer bodies.

* If it is a **secret** reserve price, can it be kept **secret**?

* If anything is **secret** there should be some penalty for divulging it.

* Is this again in the realms of being **secret** one day and not **secret** the next?

* It was stated, after the Crawford report, that the reserve price would be a **secret** report and not a report posted up.

* It is important to know the answer to this question because if it is a **secret** reserve price I can see complications arising.

* Meantime, last December the Deputy Prime Minister convened representatives of the departments of the Interior, Shipping and Transport and Trade and Industry on a working party which he insisted should meet in **secret** and exclude Liberal ministries from its work.

* The Deputy Prime Minister only referred to it obliquely last night thus: 
Except for extracts which I incorporated in a speech last Wednesday, the report remains **secret**.

* 2122  (Hansard,  28 September 1978, page 1587) how many officers (a) in the Attorney-General 's Department and (b) in the Attorney-General's office are authorised to affix the word **Secret**' to documents, correspondence and other papers.

* Part of the Government's campaign against the insurance companies has involved allegations of a **secret** alliance between the Australian Mutual Provident Society and my Party with claims that the Society has contributed financially to my Party's funds.

* The Government has a lot to say about alleged **secret** alliances.

* Why does it not come out into the open and tell us about its **secret** moves on the private sector?

* These are so-called **secret** cables.

* They sound so much more sinister if they are described as **secret**.

* They are no more **secret** than any other cables which go to any overseas post.

* When will the media be given access to the official records relating to the **secret** history of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War.

* It should be no **secret** at all that the Government considers it important to maintain and expand our existing export performance for reasons of employment and balance of payments.

* It is no **secret** also that there are a number of Ministers in this House and in the other place who have failed to produce even one parliamentary statement on the affairs of their portfolios.

* If so, will he confer with his colleague the Attorney-General to see whether any breach of the **Secret** Commissions Act has taken place?

* If after that he is satisfied that the requirements of the Act relating to amalgamations have been met, in other words that no objections that he has received have been sustained, he gives permission for the scheme as submitted to him to be put to the members of the organisation for **secret** ballots, separate ballots to be held in each case unless the organisation to be absorbed represents less than 5 per cent of the membership of the absorbing organisation.

* It wants it to be done in **secret**.

* It wants to do it in the dark, in **secret**, as the Coombs Task Force report disclosed it had done it for many years.

* When that day comes I believe that growers, consumers and the smaller investors will be recognised at last as the people who should have a say in our industry- whether it is sugar or anything else- and not a few people with knighthoods who sit on the boards of management keeping **secret** their transactions among each other, the industries that they administer, including the financial institutions, and their deals with multinational firms with which they trade.

* Firstly, it is vital, in my view, for the Government to institute a procedure for **secret** ballots, at least in proposed national strikes.

* We should start with the **secret** ballot for a national strike.

* I know that union elections may come around every two or three years, but one day should be set aside on which people could go to some appropriate place and cast their votes in a **secret** ballot.

* In a sense that fundamental argument is based on a total fallacy, I believe; and that is that there is a **secret** or collection of secrets that can be put in an envelope somewhere and passed from hand to hand and that the handing over of that envelope can really fundamentally change the entire strategic position of and the entire safety of a nation.

* It may not have been by coincidence that on Sunday, 11th February, 1973, an article written by a respected gallery journalist,  Mr Fred  Brenchley of the 'National Times' said that the support element to stay in Singapore would include personnel manning a **secret** intelligence unit.

* If a **secret** is to be held, who possesses it must remain **secret**.

* Why is there this suspicion about **secret** ballots?

* Very serious considerations ought to be given to the introduction of compulsory **secret** voting in union affairs.

* The  President  of the Communist Party of Australia,  Mr Mundey,  says the call for **secret** ballots is part of the current popular game of union-bashing.

* particulars containing information asto any **secret** process of manufacture oras to the presence, absence or situation of any mineral or other deposits or as to any other similar matter, being information the publication of which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, would substantially damage the legitimate business interests of any person.

* The purpose of the amendments is that for the first time the register of restrictive agreements will be open to the public for general examination, with the justifiable exception of **secret** processes of manufacture or other matters which could be detrimental to the parties associated with the agreement.

* It wants to go about restructuring Australian industry in this brutal, albeit **secret**, way.

* There is nothing in it that ought to be **secret**.

* I do not think there is anything in the responses of ASCO that ought to be **secret**.

* I still think that if Opposition members were given a free vote or there were a **secret** vote there are people who would vote differently from what they were dragooned to do the other day.

* Originally it had been proposed that the register of agreements would be open for inspection by persons with sufficient economic interest, but the Snedden legislation provided that the register would be completely **secret**.

* The insistence of the previous Government on a **secret** register was just further evidence of its intention to do as little as possible really to eliminate restrictive trade agreements.

* Mr Whitlam is the only Party official who would know all the details of **secret** donations offers at election time.

* With allegations that there was a plan for the ALP to accept $US500,000 in a **secret** campaign gift from Arab sources,  Mr Whitlam  faced an angry but disbelieving Caucus meeting in Parliament House.

* If the allegations that have emerged sensationally after the **secret** meeting of Federal ALP officers in Melbourne last Sunday week are correct, Labor will have suffered a relapse into the malady of which it manifested such distressing symptoms during the loans affair, a proclivity to make an incredibly stupid and wrong decision, and an inability to avoid being found out.

* He seems to have some sort of penchant about talking on the question of **secret** postal ballots.

* More than once he mentioned the need for **secret** postal ballots.

* Essentially it is a **secret** ballot although that word is not used.

* I do not want necessarily to mention names but if there is no **secret** about the matter I will give it consideration and perhaps write the honourable gentleman a suitable letter telling him who was in the know.

* Its deliberations and reports were kept **secret**.

* Again there were **secret** hearings and a **secret** report was presented, to which the Committee and the Minister had access but with which the Parliament and the public are not to be trusted.

* But they were pretty **secret** amendments.

* A strange way, in any case, to go on because the object of an amendment, I would have thought, would be to have it circulated in sufficient time for it to be able to be examined, to bc able to be analysed, for discussion to be able to take place on it on the Government side to see whether it was acceptable or not instead of it being kept **secret** and sprung only at the last minute.

* But not only was it **secret** but there was an indication from the honourable member that he did have these amendments.

* They have never made any **secret** of the fact even though they themselves had to use national service during the last World War.

* It is provided that the Committee and its Subcommittee shall sit in camera and their proceedings shall be in **secret** unless the Minister at the request of the Committee otherwise directs.

* What is so **secret** about it?

* But what is so **secret** about the situation in China, Tibet, Peru or anywhere else?

* Merely by implementing the **secret** ballot provisions we are not going to rid ourselves of our mutual union problems.

* I believe it is especially important that they become involved with the election of union office bearers through **secret** ballots.

* The rights of the public to enter Parliament House with the minimum of inconvenience, to criticise Parliament, parliamentarians, governments and Oppositions, to demonstrate without undue inconvenience to other members of the public and to exercise their hard won right of a free and **secret** vote are too precious to allow them to be lost by the inaction of Parliament itself.

* I move on to the matter of **secret** postal ballots.

* The Bill before the House provides for certain exemptions from the **secret** postal ballot procedure.

* The ballot would still have to be **secret**, but there are certain ways in which a union can have an election by other than a postal ballot.

* In relation to introducing **secret** ballots for the election of union officials,  Sir John  Egerton says that it is no good having a **secret** ballot because  Mr 
The indictment is based on four sets of documents which should be read in conjunction to establish the Prime Minister's record of duplicity.

* There were the 13 March letters leaked by the Prime Minister's Department against the Prime Minister's own alleged principle of keeping communications between governments **secret**.

* The cable shows the Prime Minister's partisan leanings and his personal and **secret** support of the communist North.

* He chose by **secret**, deceitful and surreptitious means to hide the real intentions of his Government.

* It is understood that the move has caused some concern in departmental circles because access to **secret** documents would be granted to persons about whom the security service knows little.

* Who gets all these **secret** documents?

* -The dispute was determined by the members of the air traffic controllers organisation by way of **secret** postal ballot.

* They decided by way of **secret** ballot, at all airports in Australia, that they would go on strike.

* I did this because when I tried to make the point that provision exists for the holding of **secret** ballots in respect of industrial disputes the honourable member for Hume denied that such legislation exists.

* We now know from the publication of a **secret** telex message from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation representatives in Washington to the Director-General that  Mr Richard  Stallings who was in charge of the construction of a facility in Australia and was the first head of that facility, was not an employee of the Defence Department but of the Central Intelligence Agency.

* TOP **SECRET** 
Apart from specified exceptions made in writing by an authorised officer, are top **secret**, **secret** and confidential documents automatically downgraded at regular periodical intervals until declassified altogether, as in the United States of America.

* The Labor Party makes no **secret** of its immigration policy, or any of its other policies for that matter.

* Responding to the Minister, under the legislation as it now stands there must be a compulsory **secret** ballot and a postal ballot that is conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office.

* Not all, because the rules in relation to amalgamations as provided for in the Act, at present as opposed to the Bill, require that there be **secret** postal ballots.

* That is not necessarily in conformity with the rules of an organisation because while some unions very rightly and very properly have **secret** postal ballots for the election of officials and on other matters, there are other unions which do not.

* **Secret** postal ballots?

* I have been advised that a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, for example, who wants a **secret** ballot has to apply for it.

* For a **secret** ballot.

* If that is not so - if one does not apply for a **secret** ballot - one votes in the evening on a star night and a ballot is then conducted in a room.

* That is not a **secret** ballot.

* Some Government supporters seem quite deliberately determined to try to demonstrate that under the present provisions all unions conduct **secret** postal ballots.

* The Minister has in his Bill a provision which says that in relation to amalgamations ballots will be conducted - even official ballots - in accordance with the rules of the union, the organisation, and that is quite different to the provision in the present Act, which says that there shall be a **secret** postal ballot.

* I do not know why the Minister and the Government are always frightened of **secret** postal ballots in union affairs.

* Getting back to the point again, if the Minister wishes to do so, not every union has in its rules a necessity for **secret** postal ballots.

* I believe that if members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union now had a free, **secret** postal ballot to find out whether they wanted to stay in that amalgamated union under the control of  Mr Halfpenny  they would vote themselves out and go back to their old situation pretty quickly.

* The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has been directed to resume contacts with the Bureau of State Securityknown as BOSS- which is the South African **secret** police organisation.

* Yet its policy was in reality a **secret** policy- secretly ignoring its public position.

* Regrettably, it appears that the United States of America is a strong, if **secret**, supporter of Indonesia's brutal and illegal annexation of East Timor.

* -The only solution we have got from the Opposition to all of the problems that we are now debating is that there ought to be compulsory **secret** strike ballots.

* Anyone would think that this was a novel or revolutionary idea that has just been dreamed up and that would have been put into the statute book years ago if the Opposition could have thought about it and presumably, if it had been accepted by the Opposition when it was in government for 23 years, it would have used that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to force a **secret** ballot.

* For the 23 years that the Opposition was in government it did not once as a government invoke the provision of the Act that gave it the right to order a **secret** ballot in respect of strikes.

* The Act says that where an organisation is a party to an industrial dispute and where the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission thinks that the settlement of the dispute would be encouraged or assisted by ascertaining the views or attitude of the members of the organisation in relation to the matter, the Commission may order that a vote of those members for the purpose of ascertaining their views or attitude in relation to that matter be taken by **secret** ballot in accordance with the directions given by the Commission.

* The Act then goes on to say that where the Commission orders the holding of a **secret** ballot, it may order and direct the organisation concerned to make arrangements for the conduct of the ballot by a person approved by the Industrial Registrar.

* So what does the Opposition mean when it talks about **secret** ballots?

* The only occasion on which a **secret** ballot has ever been held under this legislation was in 1929 during the famous or the infamous, depending how one looks at it, timber workers' strike.

* When the **secret** ballot was held more than two-thirds of the membership voted in favour of the strike continuing and, having done that, it was then found that they had to stick by the decision.

* There is no **secret** about that.

* It is no **secret** that the dried fruits industry has more or less disappeared in many ways over the years.

* It is no **secret** to the House that the beef industry, for instance, is in terrible trouble and, in spite of the optimistic tone that the Minister for Overseas Trade  (Mr Anthony)  took at question time today, frankly it looks to me as though the announcement from the United States of America today will produce a lesser export component to the American market than on previous occasions.

* Clause 13 proposes 2 things: It indicates that the election shall be by **secret** postal ballot and that where certain other conditions are specified, exceptions will apply in respect of those ballots.

* It means that the Governor-General may act in contravention of advice received by him from the principal law officers of the Crown and may rely instead on **secret** advice improperly given by a single judge.

* I, too, have had representations made to me by people who have suffered and will suffer greatly as a consequence of this **secret** decision taken by the Government and its instrumentality to extend the period of availability from 5 to 6 weeks to 1 1 months.

* As a consequence of the **secret** decision to extend the time within which these loans can be made available, many people are facing great hardship.

* Firstly, this is the provision which says that the elections shall be by **secret** postal ballot.

* I would also like to mention the point I made in my second reading speech in relation to **secret** ballot legislation.

* So the number of court controlled ballots would have been much higher than they in fact were if the Government had not been beating the air so much about the need for **secret** postal ballots.

* There is no reason why the rosters and disciplines of the Morris Hospital wards could not provide the flexibility in working hours which would attract married nurses, lt is an open **secret** that some  chronically sick aged people are certified for admission into the Glenside Psychiatric Hospital simply because no alternative accommodation can be found.

* In order that the Ministry should reflect the will of the Parliament it should be provided that if one-third of the members petition the  Speaker  for a **secret** ballot such a ballot should be taken of the members of the House of Representatives, the question being whether the House accepts or rejects the Prime Minister's nominees each being voted for separately.

* On the question of the **secret** meetings and the amendments, this gem appeared in this morning's 'Canberra Times' about the new proposal being put to the people: 
I have in my hand a document headed 'Department of Labour, and National Service, National Service Statistics, Defaulters Summary of Offences as at 31.12.70'.

* I do not know whether this document is **secret**.,  I  do not think I have ever seen a **secret** document.

* It is hard to judge whether it is **secret**; but it seems to me to be a document which raises some very significant questions about failure to register for national service which I would like the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Snedden)  to answer in due course.

* As I said, this is probably not a **secret** document.

* I also find it unbelievable that Ministers of State would be party to a proposal that will place them in an inferior position to public servants, **secret** agents, call them what you like.

* Members of the **secret** police is what I call them.

* They are just as much a branch or just as much an example of the **secret** police as anything that Hitler ever had.

* As it is worded, it would provide an excellent charter for the **secret** police of any state, including Pinochet's police in Chile and the KGB.

* He said that he made no **secret** of the fact that he would settle for a much larger deficit.

* Between 9 August 1976, when the Government's **secret** postal ballot legislation came into operation, and 17 June 1977, elections for 2,417 offices were conducted pursuant to 198 applications made under section 170 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for officially conducted elections.

* The number may include some offices which are not required by sub-section 133AA(1) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to be conducted by **secret** postal ballot.

* Information concerning **secret** postal ballots which were conducted by the organisations themselves is unavailable.

* Furthermore, the Commission had the power to seek a **secret** ballot of union members to ascertain their views as to certain existing or threatened industrial action in which they were involved.

* What 1 am putting to you is that because of the arbitrary way in which the Government has closed down debate - and this is no **secret** to any member of the House - this matter has been buried in the Notice Paper and will not be resurrected between now and the next election, whenever that happens to be.

* The first stage was implemented last year when the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act providing for **secret** postal ballots for elections of office-bearers in organisations was introduced.

* At present section 45 enables the Commission to order a **secret** ballot where a work ban exists or is threatened and where it believes that such a ballot will assist in settling the dispute.

* We recognise the major problems of providing for mandatory **secret** ballots on strike action.

* Furthermore, it will, in considering any of these matters, be empowered to order a **secret** ballot of the members of the organisations where it considers that such a ballot will assist in relation to its decision in these matters.

* Honourable members opposite do have a tendency to talk in terms of system, groups, controls and **secret** police.

* The sum of $114,500 in **secret** commissions was allegedly taken by Murdoch.

* It received from the syndicate's mortgages an income of $221,200 per year on its investment plus 14 per cent in interest, and on the **secret** commission section of the investment it received $27,538 in interest payments from the buyers.

* This will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage, and shall be held by **secret** vote or by equivalent free voting procedures.

* Consequently, the provisions relating to accounts and those relating to **secret** ballots are just and fair and it is right and proper that they should be included in the legislation.

* By unlawful means, by contemptuous evasion of the financial agreement, the Loan Council and the States, they embarked upon a **secret** fund raising venture.

* The fact is that for a period of 7 months, the period between Treasurer Crean and Treasurer Hayden, this nation has been subject to the thoroughly illegal and reprehensible actions of a **secret** cabal of 4 Ministers and their stooges.

* In the time available to me I will discuss only clause 19 which concerns the **secret** ballot.

* I am in support of the **secret** ballot, whereas the spokesman on industrial affairs for the Australian Labor Parry, the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  has stated that if and when his Party gets into office, the **secret** ballot provision would be one of the first things that it would repeal.

* No **secret** ballot was held before the decision to bring ships in the port of Darwin to a standstill.

* The point about the whole matter is that this man got on to the waterfront prior to the introduction of **secret** ballots, but the Labor Party would do away with **secret** ballots as soon as possible because it wants this sort of person on the waterfront.

* If **secret** ballots had been held - and I repeat that the Labor Party objects strenuously to **secret** ballots - these circumstances would not have arisen and the port of Darwin would be the prince of ports.

* Let me also make the point- although it has now been taken to a point of order- that it was not a **secret** lunch.

* It brings to life the **secret** world which surrounds us every day.

* -The Opposition parties did set it up and I congratulate them on at least taking that faltering step but they need not have kept it such a **secret**.

* Having regard to the Minister's announced consideration of forcing unions to conduct **secret** ballots before taking strike action I ask: Firstly, is the Minister also considering requiring Australian companies to conduct **secret** ballots among their shareholders prior to increasing the price of their products or restricting the supply of those products?

* Secondly, will the cost of **secret** ballots be met by the Commonwealth Government?

* Why should he be allowed to go from company to company after he has been convicted of fraud, or if from his income tax returns it is established that he has been receiving **secret** commissions or acting improperly in dealings within the company structure?

* Had the case been followed up and the source of that income discovered a number of savage situations in Sydney could have been corrected and people who were mulcted of thousands of dollars could have been protected from the practice of **secret** commissions and backhanders.

* One expects the Government to have a crack at the Americans, the Brits and so on, but who would have thought that it would have alienated Aborigines, and who would have thought that it would have alienated those refugees who sought refuge after the last World War in Australia where they could find a home safe from the knock on the door in the night, the **secret** police and the footsteps in the corridor?

* Or is it all so top **secret** that the Minister cannot answer that either?

* I will look at that in more detail and at other matters, such as sanctions and **secret** ballot proposals, when we get down to considering the clauses - all 69 of them.

* The Department raised the possibility that APC and ACTUSolo might have a **secret** deal and a separate contract and it is  surely no  coincidence that the Department made specific reference to bulk storage facilities which were in fact the pretext on which the second contract was concluded.

* Secondly, I ask for some general information in relation to the cost of the proposed **secret** postal ballots.

* It would be totally ridiculous to expect that union to undergo a **secret** postal ballot when it is able, by the present process, without fear and intimidation to conduct elections at which it gets a polling rate in excess of 95 per cent.

* It seems to me that the cost of the **secret** postal ballots will eventually become prohibitive on the trade unions and that, in essence, we will reach the situation where the unions themselves will ask for the Commonwealth to take over the cost by providing a court controlled ballot system in practically every case.

* I believe that the cost of **secret** ballot by post in some of the larger unions would be probably $150,000 to $200,000 per election.

* I believe that the cost of **secret** postal ballots will become prohibitive for unions and that eventually, rather than by coercion, by cooperation we will have reached a position in which the unions will have asked the Court to take control of their elections.

* Mr Chairman, I hope you will accept that these remarks are made in conjunction with the matter of **secret** postal ballots because they relate very keenly to that matter.

* The Minister said: 
That the committee and its sub-committees shall sit in public unless the committee resolves that its own proceedings or a sub-committee's proceedings shall be **secret**, whereupon they shall sit in camera.

* The amendment which I have moved gives the Committee discretion, and not the Minister, as to when it should meet in **secret** and when it should have public hearings.

* We believe that members on both sides of the House are capable of making a decision as to when the Committee should meet in public and when it should meet in **secret**.

* It has been said that there are many occasions when we have people giving evidence before the Committee when the Committee should meet in **secret**, and we all agree with that.

* I have pointed out that there has been no attempt on my part to cover up **secret** negotiations.

* I have been quite open, but what about the **secret** document from which I have quoted?

* Paragraph 27 states: 
The final point in the Bill to which 1 should like to draw attention is the provision for **secret** ballots.

* There has been a provision in the Act for **secret** ballots for many years, but it has been used only once since 1928.

* The present Bill removes some of the restrictions on the use of the **secret** ballot, extending it to bans and limitations on work, and I expect we will see **secret** ballots used more frequently in the future.

* But one must always remember that if a union, by a **secret** ballot, votes for a strike, the settlement of that strike will be made more difficult, because presumably there will have to be another ballot before the settlement can be approved.

* Demarcation disputes can be reduced by judicious amalgamations, and the present Bill makes sensible rules for such amalgamations, namely, **secret** court controlled ballots; circulation of the cases for and against amalgamation; at least half of the eligible members must vote; and, at least half of those voting must be in favour of the amalgamation.

* It then sought successfully to purchase the English and German language newspapers in Namibia at a cost of some $2m using **secret** government political funds.

* Having purchased the papers and embarked upon this campaign of political conditioning in the community, the Government of South Africa also undertook a fairly generous spending campaign in support of the DTA spending, according to some accounts, at least a half a million dollars a month, again from **secret** government sources.

* 1 ) When will the review of the **Secret** Commissions Act and related legislation which was commenced in May 1976 be completed.

* Have consultations taken place with the Department of Industry and Commerce as pan of the review as that Department administers the **Secret** Commissions Act.

* Did the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Department ask the Attorney-General 's Department to conduct the review of the **Secret** Commissions Act.

* The affair arises from an appalling attempt to keep **secret** one of the worst scandals of Australia's history- a scandal compounded with stupefying incompetence and brazen deceit.

* Doeshe propose some sort of fiddling **secret** inquiry where the critical findings will be suppressed and the real issues kept from the public gaze?

* It is no **secret** that yesterday the two of them were huddled together in the lobbies working out what the honourable member was going to say tonight.

* There is no **secret** about it.

* It said: 
1 ) Has the **secret** review of overseas cargo shipping legislation which he announced on 17 March 1977 been completed as anticipated.

* I wish to bring the attention of the Parliament this morning to the appointment of a **secret** inquiry into government transport undertakings, which was announced by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon)  on 13 June, a few days after the winter recess began.

* I now have before me the **secret** terms of reference, of which we learned something later from the  Australian Financial Review  on 29 June.

* First, it was going to keep it a **secret**.

* Then it was going to take it to Caucus, and how could you keep that **secret**?

* Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn to the fact that much of the evidence will be taken in **secret** to the degree that the names of many of the witnesses will not even be published?

* I will quote just briefly from Richard Hall's recent book  The **Secret** State.

* On page 185 he says: 
TOP **SECRET** 
Office of Current Intelligence Note No.

* 2/ 1975 JIO AUSTRALIA WORLD OIL: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT Not to be released to any other government except Britain and  NZ only  Joint Intelligence Organization Department of Defence, Canberra, ACT TOP **SECRET** TOP **SECRET** UMBRA 
-Indeed, yes.

* I suspect that the Department of Defence shares this view and might be inclined to put every desk calendar under a top **secret** classification.

* Arising from the evidence taken during the present inquiry, however, the Committee would emphasise that these courses of action do not provide for the amendment of evidence by a process of **secret** substitution.

* Did he request his Ministers to discover the **secret** documents not published by the McMahon and previous Governments; if so, what is the list of the documents so discovered.

* It is no **secret** that the Australian Government is actively supporting a proposal for the Chrysler motor company and 2 Japanese companies for the joint manufacture of a 4-cylinder engine at the Chrysler engine plant at Lonsdale in South Australia.

* The Director-General of ASIO,  Mr Peter  Barbour, had been shunted off to New York as Consul-General and the head of the Australian **Secret** Intelligence Service,  Mr T.  W. Robinson, had been sacked.

* It is the biggest and most powerful **secret** service that has ever existed.

* to condemn the conduct of the Yugoslav Government, to the pursuit of undisclosed and **secret** policy objectives with the Yugoslav Government.

* I refer to his suggestion that we require and should introduce **secret** ballots.

* We hope to hear more on this issue of a **secret** ballot  1  wish to say a few words about the Budget, which is the subject under discussion at the moment.

* They were not of a confidential or **secret**, but rather a public, nature.

* Its importance is that it was classified as **secret**.

* Incidentally, it was classified as **secret** after it had been substantially made publicly available within and outside his Department.

* The Fairhurst scheme was adopted after prolonged examination and then rejected in **secret** without any proper examination or consultation.

* I call upon all union members to exercise their rights under the **secret** ballot legislation which we have implemented.

* It reeks of **secret** deals, patronage and partisanship.

* That may not be correct, but this Parliament has not been let in on the **secret**.

* I make no **secret** of the fact that I am unhappy with some aspects of the Budget, particularly those aspects relating to the pensioners of Australia.

* Why does the Minister not have the courage and the decency to get up in this Parliament and tell us what is Government policy, or was he trying to keep it **secret** in the hope that it would never be found out?

* When a Minister goes on in this sort of arrogant manner- 
They will not have a **secret** ballot on it.

* There is no suggestion that members of the Government Parties would have a **secret** ballot on anything except to elect one of their own leaders in what I would call a bodgie ballot.

* For too long decisions affecting all aspects of aviation in this country have been carried out in **secret**.

* We simply want to know the **secret** information'.

* I find it incredible that the honourable member for Reid, the honourable member for Wills and other honourable members opposite should say: 'Tell us everything about every defence establishment and every **secret** that we have with our allies'.

* This will end the **secret** donations system by which outside organisations can supposedly exert financial pressure on governments.

* The fear the public has is that these **secret** donors exert a behind-the-scenes influence on Opposition pontics and policies, and on governments.

* In the 'Australian' of even date is an article headed '13 million health cards' with the sub-heading 'Details kept **secret** - promise by Hayden' which refers to 13 million health insurance cards which will be required for the universal health insurance program to be introduced next year The article specifically states: 
In all this farrago of invention and intrigue what possible reason could there be for impounding diaries kept by my official bodyguards?

* I have never made any **secret** about my movements as Prime Minister or as Leader of the Opposition in Australia or overseas.

* -Since August 1976 all elections for management positions in federally registered organisations have had to be by **secret** postal ballot.

* It is also open to an organisation, at its own expense, to have elections conducted under exactly the same set of regulations applying to **secret** postal ballots.

* The **secret** postal ballot legislation is undoubtedly contributing to the achievement of that objective.

* We are told by honourable members opposite that if **secret** ballots were held strikes could not occur.

* Members of the air traffic controllers union,' a union that is not affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions or the Australian Labor Party, voted by way of **secret** ballot against the recommendations of their own executive to go on strike.

* I have already detailed to the House the extraordinary behaviour that took place at that meeting and the allegations that the civil servants declared that it was a **secret** meeting, that if anybody suggested that the meeting had been held it would be denied that a meeting had been held and that all documents which had been circulated and which committed the Minister to a certain course of action were asked to be returned.

* Following his return, the next thing we heard about was this **secret** meeting held in Melbourne - a meeting that never was, apparently, as it was supposed never to have occurred and its occurrence was to be denied.

* It is no **secret** that there have been discussions between the Wool Corporation and the leaders of the Country Party to devise this  mehod  of embarrassing the Government.

* We have made no **secret** of the fact that, given current economic circumstances and pending the resumption of higher levels of private capital inflow, it is entirely appropriate that this Government should borrow significant amounts on official account.

* As a second proposition I say to the House that not only is there no **secret**- and there has not been any **secret** for the past 18 months- that it is part of our policy to borrow significant amounts overseas, but it is an indication of the international credit worthiness of Australia, and it is something which is wholly consistent with the economic circumstances of Australia at the present time.

* Naturally the Government believes that there should be no **secret** about the need to do this in circumstances that require it.

* The committee of inquiry conducts its hearing in **secret**.

* The honourable member did get close to the Bill on one or two occasions and he mentioned the conducting of **secret** ballots.

* I would say that the **secret** ballot would have a tremendous value under certain conditions.

* Certainly, there would not be many occasions when a **secret** ballot would be held to resolve a dispute.

* In this case **secret** ballots are available under certain rules and conditions set down in the Act.

* I believe that it is only right and just that the people concerned should be given the opportunity to take a **secret** ballot if they thought that it was desirable.

* I think that one could hardly say it is a **secret**.

* So if we have been conducting this in a **secret** way, nearly a thousand people are privy to the **secret**.

* It is no **secret** that on this day, Thursday, with the expectation that the Address-in-Reply debate may well conclude on Tuesday next, we have no details of the Bills which are to be brought forward for debate on Wednesday.

* Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs prepared to release the hitherto **secret** 
-As I said the other day, the honourable member for Shortland is a very slow learner.

* I make no **secret** of the fact that I did ring the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services - 
If one looks at the abridged version of the Hope report, which is the only form in which it is available- quite understandably, the report itself is still on the **secret** list-one sees that intelligence is really the assessing of information or the processing of information and there should not e clandestine operations.

* I have made no **secret** in the past, I made no **secret** yesterday in answer to a question, and I make no **secret** again in answering the honourable member for Sturt, of my belief that there are features of the present taxation system that work to the disadvantage of single income families.

* Yet, when we heard from him that his Government in 1969 spoke often about the need for Federal government involvement and spoke often of some rather **secret** plans that were involved in helping the States, we did not hear of any action.

* Yet, the honourable member for Gippsland did not mention that his study which took many years to carry out was a **secret** study; it was not to be made public.

* I point out that he went so far as to threaten to put the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr Whitlam),  the then Leader of the Opposition, in jail for talking about a so-called **secret** plan when it is obvious that if we want to honour the concept of open government and if we want to inform the public what is to be done with their funds, we should inform the public constantly through public reports tabled in this Parliament and described elsewhere just where its money is going.

* Yet the Government prides itself on the manner in which it kept **secret** the contents of the Budget.

* That amendment does provide adequate protection for the rank and file members to receive ballot papers and information regarding the amalgamation proposals and to vote by **secret** postal ballot if they choose to do so.

* Me asked whether the price would remain **secret**, lt is generally intended that this price will not be made public; but it will be very hard to keep it **secret** all the time.

* It will be difficult to keep it **secret** if the Commission goes in and acts as a bidder.

* In view of the fact that later today the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, will introduce legislation dealing with the election of trade union officials, has he considered the urgent need to introduce legislation to enable contributor members of so-called non-profit voluntary health insurance organisations, such as the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia and the Hospitals Contribution Fund to elect their office bearers, let alone do so by **secret** ballots?

* The so-called **secret** ballot amendments passed by this Parliament were not intended by the Government benches actually to provide union democracy.

* The **secret** ballot has existed in almost all major unions since the 1940s.

* Even before the earlier amendment all unions that registered with the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission were subject to **secret** ballots which were overseen by the Commonwealth Electoral Office.

* Reputable companies which might shrink from **secret** contributions might well contribute if the process were open and respectable.

* The United States has made no **secret** of the fact that it seeks a total turnaround of the order of $13 billion per annum.

* The proposals as enacted have enabled **secret** ballot legislation to be introduced more quickly and to be accepted widely by the great bulk of the trade union movement.

* Omit sub-sections (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of proposed section  158L,  substitute the following subsections: "(2) A ballot referred to in the last preceding subsection shall be a **secret** ballot by postal voting and the Industrial Registrar shall - 
If that amendment is agreed to it will delete from the present Bill the provisions which allow ballots to be held merely in accordance with union rules, whether or not there is an opportunity for a **secret** ballot to be held, and re-insert the provisions contained in the existing Act, which would make it mandatory for the Registrar of the Commonwealth Electoral Office to undertake all ballots and ensure that a **secret** postal ballot was made available to all members of a union, an organisation, involved in amalgamation.

* For this reason the charges of the Leader of the Opposition that this Government has revealed a national **secret** are ludicrous.

* We need not delude ourselves that the activities of 121st Signals Squadron were **secret** to anyone - anyone except the Australian people and the Government in its position of  Her  Majesty's Opposition until the elections of December last.

* Obviously, if the presence of the squadron was no **secret** the acknowledgement of its role and location creates no new dificulties 
The Leader of the Opposition talked about the purpose of the facility being made known to Australians.

* Obviously they were not considered important enough to be briefed on a facility which the Leader of the Opposition now claims was held in great **secret**.

* Further, I am unaware of any evidence indicating the receipt by persons in Australia of bribes or **secret** commissions from the Lockheed Corporation.

* However, in May last to ensure such a situation will not arise in Australia and as a part of a general review of such legislation, I asked my Department to review the **Secret** Commissions Act 1 905.

* If so, is it the attitude of the Government that no country's diplomatic representation in Australia should be involved with **secret** or intelligence activities, or is it only those from the Communist world to which this applies.

* We must put an early end to inflation's **secret** tax rip-off.

* It might control the growth of unlegislated income tax, but it would not eliminate the **secret** tax rip-off generated by inflation.

* We must admit that **secret** police forces exist in many nations of the world.

* It is my view that capitalism, based on exploitation of the masses and motivated by personal greed, cannot survive without a **secret** police force and that is why we have these **secret** organisations.

* The gravity of this matter goes to another area of activity - 3 Australian citizens arrested, tried and executed, and done in **secret**.

* Surely this is the distinguishing characteristic of the servile state where the processes of law and justice are conducted in **secret** without any regard to security matters in the strict sense.

* I have suggested the fact that these people were tried in **secret**.

* The Prime Minister went on to say that the Agreement gives the United States sole control over the **secret** radio base for 25 years.

* And many of these manoeuvres involved brutal decisions and **secret** tricks not at all unlike the techniques of James Bond.

* However, these tricks and shifts passed over, when the war was over, from the main **secret** intelligence body, the OSS, into the running of the CIA, which was set up after the war.

* -Section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act does have provision for **secret** ballots for the settlement of industrial disputes.

* But **secret** ballots in those situations may be ordered by a presidential member of the Arbitration Commission or by a Full Bench.

* Previous to 195 1, any member of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, as it then was, had the power to order a **secret** ballot; but that was limited in 195 1 by a Liberal-Country Party government.

* The same provision was re-enacted in 1972, thereby limiting the right to order a **secret** ballot to a presidential member or a Full Bench.

* The honourable member has come in again today to say: 'Let us have a **secret** ballot'.

* My suggestion is that, if the Liberals are so keen in advocating their **secret** ballots to settle disputes, perhaps the new compromise, a further compromise, which seems to be in favour with the Opposition these days, might be for the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister to use their influence to have this strike settled by a **secret** ballot and order, or agree to, the holding of a **secret** ballot of the senators on the Appropriation Bill.

* There is one other matter that should be mentioned in relation to the Minister's allegations concerning our policy on **secret** ballots.

* Certainly in that case we are able to exercise discretion, but a lot more things can happen in terms of detrimentally affecting the Navy's performance and the work of the Dockyard than things which have direct relationship to classified and **secret** equipment.

* The words 'shall be a **secret** ballot by postal voting' are the.

* What is it that is wrong with a **secret** ballot by postal votes that causes the Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  to delete those words from the Bill and use the word 'ballot'.

* The word 'ballot' can mean something different from a **secret** ballot by postal voting.

* Nowhere have we been told why there should be a change from a **secret** ballot by postal vote to some other kind of ballot.

* I would have thought that if the honourable gentleman's concern for the protection of rights of the rank and file is as genuine as he has stated it to be on a number of occasions before this House he would retain the protection of a **secret** ballot by postal voting.

* We have read in the Press that millions of copies are being printed somewhere in some **secret** printery.

* It is top **secret**.

* Let it come clean on the mysterious cuts in government spending which it determines in **secret** and refuses to disclose.

* Is this the way the Government builds confidence in the economy- not just by cuts in government expenditure but by **secret**, perhaps arbitrary cuts?

* His  exhortation, like most of what the Government parties want to keep **secret**, duly appeared in the Press.

* **Secret** National Group.'

* The **secret** national group referred to is known as the Peace with Freedom group.

* The article says that the Minister for Housing  (Mr Kevin Cairns)  has been associated with that group in a number of **secret** and clandestine meetings over a number of years, lt associates a Minister of the Government with an organisation which has been opposed to the present Government in the sense that it has laid down certain proposals at certain meetings that have been held from time to time and  which had for their purpose the limiting of the number of members of Parliament on the Government side who would be returned to this chamber, thus determining the majority the Government would have.

* The communication from the British Government apparently informing Australia of the position of China has been not classified but made top **secret**.

* It is obvious that this decision is not **secret** as far as the Chinese Government is concerned.

* Why have the inquiries into the Adelaide to Crystal Brook Railway line been conducted in **secret**.

* This matter refers to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation - the Commonwealth **secret** service - which is administered by his Department.

* What did he do that was so **secret**?

* What was so **secret** about it?

* There was no **secret** about it, but it was never told to the Australian nation, to the Australian people.

* **Secret** documents?

* It is no **secret** that the Chief Justice of Australia, who, as Attorney-General, propounded it, and  Mr Justice  Bowen, who introduced the first Bill into the House, have since expressed/their opposition to it.

* This is not a **secret** society.

* One honourable member made some brief remarks about the proposal that **secret** ballots should be introduced for the election of office bearers in trade unions.

* It is very enlightening, I would suggest, and very instructive to see what is said by those who are opposed to that principle of **secret** ballots for the election of union office bearers.

* He, like some other people on the other side of the House and in the trade union movement, says: 'We already have **secret** ballots'.

* Such people point to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and say that an organisation cannot be registered unless provision is made in its rules for the election of its office bearers by **secret** ballot.

* Of course the office bearers of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union are elected by a **secret** ballot.

* What sort of **secret** ballot is it?

* We want **secret** ballots conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Office to ensure that the individual member of a trade union has a free and unqualified opportunity to express his view on who should govern him in that power structure known as his trade union.

* No doubt  Mr Halfpenny  and his colleagues would point again to the rules of their organisation which say that not only is the election of office bearers to be conducted by a **secret** ballot but also there is an enforcement provision; there is- to use that dreadful expression- a penal clause in the rules of that union to guarantee that the election is conducted properly.

* As to the incidence of the tax, I think it is an open **secret** that my recommendation was not the basis of the final decision.

* Members of the Labor Party kept it a close **secret** I remind the Minister that the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young),  who is the member concerned and a leading supporter of the Labor Party- he has just come into the chambera man I suppose whose views have to be listened to a little because he is a former  President  of the Australian Labor Party, had this to say: 
In the second reading debate a great deal of nonsense was spoken about some of the provisions of the Bill.

* It was suggested that because in certain circumstances an election concerning an amalgamation could be held by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer it therefore had to be a **secret** postal ballot.

* That is far removed from a **secret** postal ballot, which is probably the fairest, most **secret** and most reasonable form of ballot available in Australia for any purposes.

* Therefore, we propose to move amendments to the proposed sub-sections which take out all the safeguards in relation to ballots and to insert provisions for a **secret** postal ballot.

* I move: 
A ballot referred to in the last preceding sub-section shall be a **secret** ballot by postal voting and the Industrial Registrar shall- 
I am convinced that one of the most urgent matters facing this Government is the introduction of compulsory **secret** ballots under the supervision of the Commonwealth Electoral Office for the election of all union executives, and the conduct of a compulsory **secret** ballot of all workers engaged in an industry before a major strike is called on.

* Compulsory **secret** ballots in union elections would put the control of the unions back into the hands of the rank and file where it ought to be.

* What is more democratic than a compulsory **secret** ballot?

* Can those honourable members opposite who are interjecting tell me why it is that the extreme left and the Communists so bitterly oppose **secret** ballots?

* **Secret** ballots would replace the disruptive dictators who are in control of many unions with men of sound commonsense and moderate views who would be prepared to sit down and discuss matters with management in a sensible manner to the benefit of all concerned.

* Secondly, it must legislate for compulsory **secret** ballots in all union elections and provide for a **secret** ballot for all persons employed in an industry before a strike is called,.

* Australia was one of the first countries to introduce universal franchise, votes for women, **secret** ballot and full preferential voting.

* He was saying that militant union officials had to be stopped from dictating to their members and accordingly they must be elected by **secret** postal vote.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony),  for instance, was reported in the Melbourne  Sun  of 24 November last year as saying that the coalition would do what left wing and communist officials feared most; that is, they would introduce **secret** postal ballots for union elections.

* On obtaining government the Liberal Party and the National Country Party eventually did move to provide that union elections must be by **secret** postal ballot.

* It is with some regret that I write to you personally to strongly protest what I can only describe as a ' sell-out ' by the Fraser Government to the Santamaria/National Civic Council group relative to the **secret** ballot legislation now before the Federal House.

* Why should these things need to be **secret** when, for the most part, they are concerned with companies that like to claim that they are public companies?

* Believe me, it is no **secret** that this is a plan of international design.

* Mr Speaker,  I seek leave to make a short statement in which I will divulge for the first time the full text of the so far **secret** terms of settlements of the recent Trans-Australia Airlines dispute.

* The Committee found no evidence that members of the Labor Party walked out of the House when the quorum was called but it is no **secret** that many members of the Opposition do not consider that it is their duty to come to the House to help to maintain a quorum.

* They are questioned by the **secret** police about the anti-communist activities of some Yugoslavs living in Perth.

* The **secret** of their success is possibly not entirely that they have accepted the truth of the principle of comparative advantage and, with its acceptance, have concentrated on doing some but not all things and doing those same things very well- selling internationally and at the same time buying from overseas goods better produced elsewhere.

* The **secret** of our relative failure might be that we have not been willing to accept that we should be prepared to purchase many of our needs from those who can provide them cheaper.

* One of the questions asked by  Senator Wriedt  was whether there would be disclosure of **secret** information.

* Senator Wriedt  made the point that the reference to the upgrading of facilities no longer being carried out in **secret** was a direct consequence of the display by the Government last year when the Minister for Defence criticised the United States Government for not advising the Australian Government of intended changes in the North West Cape base.

* If this system were instituted, upgrading of these facilities could no longer be carried out in **secret** and the implications of the various changes would be publicly known and discussed.

* there is no doubt in our minds that details of the techniques employed, and of the data being analysed and tested in the stations, must be kept highly **secret** if the two installations are to continue to serve their objectives.

* There is no **secret** about the socialist ideology to concentrate all power in Canberra, to get rid of the second House - the Senate - and to make one man all powerful.

* The basic problem is that I am not convinced and I think it would be fair to say that the Public Accounts Committee is not convinced, that the provisions as they currently stand would guarantee under all circumstances that acts of grace payments made by Ministers on the advice of officials should always remain in the category of **secret** dealings.

* Faced with a rising deficit the Government has resorted to **secret**, drastic cuts in expenditure which it has not the courage to specify publicly.

* A report, which so far has been kept **secret** by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, reveals that between 1968 and January of this year the count was up to 35,000 parts per 100 millilitres.

* The existing provisions relating to the deregistration of organisations, the **secret** ballot under court orders, the cancellation and suspension of awards and the enforcement of sanctions inserted in awards are therefore retained.

* Does the Minister support the virtual ending of petrol discounting which followed his **secret** agreement with the oil companies?

* The Government decided to leak **secret** information to the head of the trade union movement in return for co-operation from that gentleman.

* It is clear beyond any doubt that the Treasurer colluded with the  President  of the Australian Labor Party in giving him **secret** information which was available to no other person and has never been available to any other person in Australian history.

* This particular publication is titled  The **Secret** Repair Policies of Car Manufacturers.

* So I can understand why this has been termed a **secret** repair policy.

* But the cost to the consumer of this **secret** policy- I will continue to call it a **secret** policy- is tremendous.

* We believe strongly that it is far too important to leave matters of this sort to a small occupational group which conducts its affairs in **secret** through a system of committees.

* It is in the hands of a hidden, **secret** bureaucracy which is not accountable to anyone or anything except its own selfinterest.

* It will incorporate many improved and **secret** devices.

* If honourable members wish to know the **secret** of survival we will be quite happy to tell them.

* Does this clause really mean that if the Director-General so decides he can give **secret** information gathered by ASIO on the highest personages in the government of this country to.

* Clause 19 deals with sections 45 and 46 of the Principal Act, and the important matter with which at deals is **secret** ballots.

* I pose the question: How will **secret** ballots on strikes limit the duration of strikes?

* The strike cannot be called off until another **secret** ballot is held, so its effect would be to continue the strike instead of limiting it.

* The most direct overseas evidence unequivocally rejects such proposals for **secret** ballots on strikes.

* Compulsory Strike Ballots 
A number of witnesses have suggested to us that a **secret** ballot should be required before a strike can lawfully take place.

* A law forbidding strike action before the holding of a **secret** ballot could not be enforced in the case of small-scale unofficial stoppages, which make up the overwhelming majority of the total number of strikes.

* Two instances of ballots held in recent years in this country where the vote went against strike action are sometimes quoted in support of the case for compulsory **secret** ballots.

* I suggest that those words used in the report of the British Royal Commission headed by Lord Donovan, handed down in 1968, are appropriate to the proposal of this Government for the question of strike action to be decided by **secret** ballot.

* It is the country that introduced the **secret** ballot.

* The purpose was to disguise a **secret** Israeli purchase of much needed uranium for its French built nuclear reactor.

* The Government's model safeguard agreement is **secret** and confidential except to this Government and foreign governments.

* They will no longer be able to rely on the **secret** tax increase of inflation.

* In the first statement, the Prime Minister is saying that without tax indexation there is a **secret** increase through inflation.

* If inflation represented a **secret** tax increase, what does the petrol price increase represent?

* communications between officers and between officers and third parties relating to the formulation of policy  (0  material which, by statute, is required to be kept **secret**, e.g.

* Documents that are given one of the usual security ratings as 'Confidential ', '**Secret**', or 'Top **Secret**' would normally be included under one of the categories in paragraph 19 above.

* In relation to oral evidence, the same considerations apply as to the contents of a classified document and as to information which, while not contained in a document, is of a Confidential, **Secret** or Top **Secret** nature.

* The ritual stamping of documents with such ratings as confidential, **secret**, and top **secret** also needs reconsideration.

* The gravest danger we face is that such a body will be used under **secret** political control.

* It is vital that the Organisation should be independent from **secret** political control because this is the key to the rights of the individual.

* He was a distinguished judge, but I think it is no **secret** that he was very little involved with the day to day operations of the Organisation.

* For reasons I have already advanced to the House I am very strongly opposed to those controls being ministerial under the aegis of the Government because this brings out the opportunity for **secret** political directives being given to ASIO and ASIO being exploited for improper political motives.

* I would like an assurance from the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  that this independence so clearly laid down by this House will not be abridged by **secret** terms and conditions of appointment because the independence of the Director-General of ASIO isperhaps paradoxically- the key to our individual rights and liberty.

* Information of this kind in the Department is not **secret**.

* But it is an open **secret** that it was the Americans who forced the resignation of  Mr Schweitzer.

* It was to be a very **secret** matter indeed and it was to be on the basis of the latest technology for triggering nuclear devices by using a small nuclear reaction, not a full explosion.

* The **secret** agreement between Australia and Great Britain is not to be disclosed at all - and that is a serious matter.

* As I suggested the other day, the important point is that, both in the case of Weimar Germany and in the case of democratic Austria in the 1930s, the government was betrayed by its **secret** police.

* In both of those cases forces within the **secret** agencies owed their loyalty either to an old regime or to bodies outside the democratic government.

* The whole of our purpose in this debate is not to destroy the authority of democratic governments but to prevent those sorts of things from happening- to make sure that the **secret** agencies which we necessarily have to employ but which we regret employing are, in fact, responsible to the democratic government.

* I know that the Government's **secret** strategy is to pull on a dispute with the maritime unions.

* The salient factor is that we are carrying on a policy, of which we have made no **secret** since we were committed in that part of the world; that is, to give every possible assistance to these people who are resisting Communist aggression.

* The Federal Government should have the courage to introduce legislation to compel all trade union elections to be conducted by a compulsory **secret** ballot under the supervision of the Commonwealth Electoral Office.

* It should be mandatory for all those called upon to engage in strike action to be allowed to vote in a **secret** ballot before being forced to go on strike.

* A compulsory **secret** ballot in all union elections would eliminate almost completely the extreme left wing and the Communist dictatorship which have seized power.

* Boyce was employed by TRW, an aerospace firm which has links with **secret** American facilities in Australia.

* Boyce was in charge of the top **secret** code room at TRW where he was apparently in a position to monitor and decode CIA messages to and from its facilities in Australia.

* What the ACTU policy means and spells out- the ACTU is not keeping it **secret**- is that in addition to national wage case increases, the union movement must have complete freedom to negotiate whatever it can over and above those increases.

* It appears to me that what is being said in this debate is that it is better for persons to use financial influence on candidates and members in **secret** than it would be to have funds and sources of funds disclosed in order that, where there is a suggestion of influence or a suggestion of some decision made which may benefit a large contributor, there is an open situation where everyone will know exactly what has happened.

* In the United States of America, whose Constitution enshrines the domocratic rights of the individual to an extent which is almost beyond belief in a modern society and which is the cause of some problems in that country, the rights of the individual are totally protected and there is no question that the Supreme Court of the United States would upset any attempt to take away from any individual his rights of **secret** ballot and his rights to participate properly in an election.

* Much of the present political problems which are besetting the United States Congress and the presidency arise from the non-disclosure of political campaign contributions- from keeping such campaign contributions **secret**.

* In the United States it is thought that if a person makes a large contribution to a political campaign fund and seeks to hide that contribution- to keep it **secret**- there must be some ulterior motive behind it.

* -They may well have been justly made, but the fact of the matter is that if a political party is reputed to be getting **secret** contributions from a source and in return is publicly offering that source contributions from public funds in the form of subsidies, suspicion must exist.

* I believe that it will have a very good influence on this Parliament and will ensure not only that no political party can be accused of **secret** deals and **secret** funds but also it will ensure that no person can be misled into believing that by making **secret** contributions to a political party he can buy influence.

* The blanket terms of reference provide a privileged opportunity for selected clients and competitors of the publicly owned enterprises- the Australian Shipping Commission, Trans-Australia Airlines and the Australian National Railways- to conduct a **secret** witch hunt into the affairs, accounts and operations of the enterprises.

* Here we have 3 men who represent enterprises in competition with, as clients of, and suppliers to, publicly owned transport enterprises, inquiring in **secret**, bringing up a **secret** report and operating on a **secret** blanket reference.

* The sinister aspects of the inquiry are that it is **secret** and its terms of reference are **secret**.

* The committee's report will be **secret**.

* Their first responsibilities are to the shareholders of the companies they represent, not to the Government Minister- and certainly not to an inquiry held in **secret**.

* (An incident having occurred in the gallery) 
The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1976 does 3 main things: It introduces the principle that union elections shall be held by **secret** postal voting; that legal representation shall be given to the Minister by right in all proceedings in which the Minister is involved; and that the Minister shall have the right of reference and the right of appeal against all matters coming before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, even matters in which the Minister or the Government is not a party.

* Is there any provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which requires trade unions to have **secret** ballots in respect of industrial disputes?

* Is there any limitation on the type of dispute which may be settled by recourse to a **secret** ballot?

* Recommendation 18 suggests that an amendment should be made 'to provide for the establishment of a confidential register on which **secret** Aboriginal sites are to be listed '.

* He said he disclosed what was being kept **secret**, at the North West Cape base.

* This muck-racking expedition has been going on for some time- almost 12 months- on the basis that there have been kickbacks and **secret** commissions.

* The people in Queensland might have been entitled, at that stage, to believe that their Premier had some evidence that 2 Ministers were involved and that those 2 Ministers had **secret** bank accounts.

* Let us remember that, above all, when we hear comments such as some of those made by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory  (Mr Enderby)  about bringing laws into operation in the middle of the night in some sort of **secret** way.
