### Sample sentences:

* I want to raise the aspect of nuclear non-proliferation and the question of export of uranium, whether Australia can monitor what happens to those exports and whether adequate safeguards exist.
* In this respect the Government's policy introduces a requirement additional to those recommended by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry in its first report.
* a requirement for Australia's prior consent to any re-transfers, to ensure that uranium supplied by Australia cannot be re-exported unless we are satisfied that the ultimate destination is acceptable and that adequate controls would apply to the transferred material; 
all of these safeguards and controls are to cover nuclear material derived from Australian uranium so long as it remains in a form relevant from the point of view of safeguards; that is, until it has been consumed or diluted to the point where there is no practical possibility of it being useful for the purpose of making a nuclear weapon.
* The uranium industry is a large potential industry.
* A month ago statements on uranium were presented to this Parliament by six Ministers.
