## Contexts in which the word "women" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* 1 would also like to refer to the splendid work that is being done by the men and **women** of the whole district in supporting this great complex in the city of Dubbo.

* This type of thing needs to be looked at in this country, just as we need to give far greater emphasis to child care centres for the children of those **women** who have to work, not because they want to work but simply because of economic circumstances.

* Also, 50 per cent more **women** need to have hysterectomies when they are treated by doctors paid on a fee for service basis than when they are treated by doctors paid a salary.

* I want the Committee to remember that of the widows pensions that the Government pays over half are paid not to de jure widows but to notional widows- that is, to separated and divorced **women**- it is the availability of this pension which makes this amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Fraser)  so much desired, because what is happening is that only a small subvention from the husband or the ex-husband will be capable of keeping a woman in domestic circumstances rather than sending her out to work, as the pension will be available also.

* For example, these ordinances include: An ordinance providing for the interpretation of Territory ordinances and statutory instruments: a juries ordinance providing for all aspects of jury service and, in particular, for **women** to serve on juries; an ordinance making comprehensive provision with respect to maintenance of wives, husbands and children; a new Wills Ordinance; ordinances enabling married persons to sue each other in tort; a number of amendments to the Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance; an ordinance facilitating the transfer of marketable securities; a new Family Provision Ordinance - to ensure that the family of a deceased person receive adequate provision out of his estate; an ordinance enabling a person between the ages of 18 and 21 years to borrow on the security of a mortgage of his home; amendments to the Administration and Probate Ordinance; and amendments to the Real Property Ordinance.

* Provision must be made to train the **women** who have not lived in a home before so they will know how to act as a wife and housekeeper and how to look after the home.

* The female parole board has as its  chairman  the permanent member of the male board and three other **women** who at present are the Convener of the Female Prisoners' Council, an ex-governor of a female prison and a children's court magistrate.

* Even that quaint organisation known as the National Council of Women will receive $5,500.

* One of the problems which did confront the industry was equal pay for **women**.

* Notwithstanding the unemployment problem, over 4.7 million men and **women** are employed in the Australian work force at present.

* As I have just mentioned, the standard rate will also apply to widow pensioners without children in future, which means that these **women** will receive increases of $4.25 a week.

* If we assume a growth factor of 25 per cent annually in inspection charges - a fair figure taking into account the growth of exports, the widening recruitment of inspectors, rising wage rates and the inflationary spiral about which this Government seems to care little in that it is spending money in the public sector and not caring 2 hoots about where it is going; of course it is making the private sector pull its horns in and has no concern for the individual men and **women** in this community and is concerned only that the public sector should keep on spending - we find that in the remaining 9 months of 1973-74 the cost of inspection services would be $14.3m.

* I turn now to the single people - that is, men aged 65 and over, **women** aged 60 and over, and single people medically qualified for an invalid pension.

* They joined the work force- many of them were **women**- during the first 18 months or so of the term of this Government.

* The invalid pension paid to men under 65 years of age or **women** under 60 years of age is not taxable.

* The other factor of course is the increasing proportion of **women** offering for work.

* Any real wage overhang was clearly far greater for **women** than for men but their employment performance has been markedly better than for men.

* Some of them have the gall to cry poverty when they come here, yet they sit on goldmines in thenStates while men and **women** walk the streets out of work.

* I refer in particular to the servicemen and **women** of Australia.

* What is in fact occurring is that in some instances in the work force senior **women** or senior men doing jobs which can be done by juniors are being dismissed in order that they may be replaced by trainees who are subsidised at $59 a week or, under the National Employment and Training scheme, at a different figure.

* To be more explicit, using the latest average weekly earnings data, which is for the September quarter 1970, the standard rate of age and invalid pension is over $4 a week below the Melbourne poverty level; all Class A widows, **women** who are supporting youngsters, receive pension rates below this mark.

* As the honourable member for Moreton said, surely there is honour among the men and **women** who serve in this Parliament.

* This Budget provides for $75m to be spent on giving children throughout Australia an equal opportunity of pre-school and child care and so that the **women** of Australia who want to go to work will have somewhere decent to leave their children where they can be looked after by professional people.

* That is fine, but at least give the credit to the men and **women** who did the job.

* Nurses are On the whole a bunch of very attractive **women**.

* We have been warned on countless occasions about the yellow hordes pressing down unrelentingly to Australia to gather up our **women** and children.

* Meanwhile, the hopes of the Timorese **women** in Australia, some of whom are living in difficult circumstances, that they will ever be reunited with their husbands, are beginning to fade.

* Whilst people may be offended when their personal and civil liberties are put under challenge and threat, we must remember that on balance because the people make up the nation it is essential that the nation is secured to enable men and **women** to live in a free society.

* In my view married **women** teachers should be given special treatment to encourage them to remain in the profession.

* I understand that if the Parliament decided to sit during the meal hours from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. this would mean greatly increased overtime and great difficulties in connection with staff, because a number of the waitresses are married **women**.

* I can tell honourable members that the people in my electorate, especially the **women**, are very much aware of the family allowances contained in this latest Budget.

* This bid for a new national anthem has been supported in writing to the national  chairman  of Lions by professional musicians, music teachers associations, brass band associations, many local government bodies, the Country Women's Association, the Methodist Church, the Catholic Church through its spokesman and the Anglican Church through Bishop Reed of Adelaide.

* Some 31,500 **women** will receive this benefit.

* We need to know much more about unemployment of **women**.

* To the cost to the community of hospitalisation we can add the cost of paying widows' pensions to a great many **women** much earlier than they would have received them had their husbands not died of heart disease or lung cancer attributable in a very large measure to smoking.

* I can cite other instances where bush fires have surrounded a home - this is not drawing a long bow; it has happened - and **women** have endeavoured to keep the fires back and have suffered very seriously In health as a result of having to do so.

* I was recently at a factory that manufactures a very well known brand of singlets for men, **women** and children.

* From those in need of special assistance to the ordinary working men and **women**, this is a Budget that puts people first.

* This will require the Corporation to make about 10 000 loans annually to exservicemen and **women**, involving advances totalling in excess of $ 100m.

* Unlike the great dreamers we do not propose to try to carry mankind on some great wave of discovery to a new world of enlightenment based on socialism to an environment in which men and **women** lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves according to their inclinations and in their own way.

* In Hobart, the capital city, the Australian Labor Government will wholly build and operate a new **women**'s hospital.

* It is simply a reflection of my belief that State governments are able to appoint men and **women** to sit on State Benches who are closer to the people in those States, and it is right that people in South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia should be tried literally by their peers within the States.

* While the **women** are being trained they are being paid.

* Two young **women** said to me as I was coming through the door-: You ought to be leaving them'.

* Between them 200,000 working **women** have 271,000 preschool children in Australia and only 19,000 of these 271,000 children are in pre-schools.

* This scheme is aimed to reach the migrant **women**, on a one-for-one basis, in the homes.

* I believe that the technical education colleges of this country could play a greater part than they are at present in trying to turn out young men and **women** who will take their places in both management and the work force, each understanding the problems of the other, and making a worthwhile contribution to the economic development of our country.

* I pay tribute to those many excellent people who take time off from their many and varied duties in life to mould and chisel into shape the character of our young boys and young **women**.

* I envisage that in a garden setting would be laid the remains of many outstanding men and **women** who have, since 1 788, played such a major role in the foundation and the later development of this nation.

* He has met with legislators, judges, lawyers, police officers, civil rights and race relations workers, and legal aid bodies and has had discussions with officers of the State Department, the Department of Justice, Depanment of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Contracts Compliance Program, the Women's Bureau of the U.S. Depanment of Labor, the Library of Congress, and a number of other agencies, and has had discussions with officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, and several other courts, civil and criminal.

* Likewise in the veterans' area very real benefits are extended to those who have served our nation well in past years, either our own servicemen and **women** or those that served with us.

* Surely this must be the greatest fraud ever inflicted on the working men and **women** of Australia.

* men and the **women** who pay the bills.

* Maybe this has a lot to do with Women's Lib and so on.

* There is also a higher proportion of young married **women** not staying in the schools.

* When did the Opposition argue positively for the training of men and **women** to realise their skill potential so that they can find work satisfaction and contribute more to the community, or for management skill which is an integral part of an efficiency drive?

* The scheme is part of a comprehensive range of repatriation benefits for Australian ex-service men and **women** and their dependants.

* Women and girls have received special attention, from being raped to the insertion of Coke bottles and live eels in the genital organs.

* All the **women**, except one- the shop steward- were reinstated, and it was because of the failure to reinstate the female shop steward that the dispute flared up again.

* One would assume that he will further delay in this Parliament votes for men and **women** of 18.

* I am' always a little wary of special groups being catered for, whether they be **women**, experts or any other type of person.

* What a line from the professed champion of the ordinary men and **women** of Australia.

* Since I have been Minister I have received many letters of complaint about the Liverpool Women's Clinic, as well as some letters of support.

* Increasing support has been given in recent times under the Community Health Program for **women**'s refuges (59 funded in 1977-7S), detoxification units and other health hostel/halfway house projects offering shortterm rehabilitative and /or support services.

* Heaven knows how many married **women** want to take work but cannot find it.

* I felt deeply incensed at what I saw of fine men and **women** who had served the nation in peace and war reduced to the level of ne'er-do-wells and wastrels by the soulless mathematics of the 100 per cent taxation of the means test.

* In future those with a taxable income less than $1,041 will be exempt from income tax and, as the Treasurer pointed out in his Budget Speech, the proposal will exempt from tax liability altogether about 600,000 taxpayers - among them part time employees, including married **women** and students working in vacations.

* I think they realise that from grass roots government come men and **women** who are prepared to right and work for people.

* Special, provision has been made for single **women** with or without close relatives in Australia to be nominated by a relative in Australia or by a friend or by an organisation approved by the 2 Governments.

* These functions included a wide range of community services and State functions and a lot of control over many forms of social legislation including, for example, workers compensation, gambling, censorship, consumer protection, the rights of **women**, the rights of minors, daylight saving and control of firearms.

* We discovered in many areas that the access to alcohol had produced a total drinking situation and that in some communities almost 100 per cent of the people drank much more than was good for them or for the community and in others the **women** were excluded either of their own volition or because of a community decision.

* As we debate the estimates for the Department of Defence we know that Australian men and **women** at this time are serving in a very commendable manner in areas not only within Australia but also outside Australia.

* These are in fact age pensions which are payable to exservicemen who have served in a theatre of war, who have suffered from tuberculosis or who have reached the age of 60, or 55 in the case of **women**.

* I pay a tribute to the men and **women** of the Postmaster-General's Department who work by day and night on behalf of this nation and its people.

* Everyone knows that at each of those levels of government there are many dedicated, hard working men and **women** who give a lifetime of service to the respective levels of responsibility.

* I am almost moved to tears when I remember how two or three years ago the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  who lately has been promoted, was concerned that under the Liberal Party Government in 1971 and 1972 a lot of married **women** were going to work.

* They carried bogus posters too, because some of the posters indicated that they were from organisations such as the Queensland Housewives' Association and the Country Women's Association.

* Unemployment is concentrated very heavily among the young, **women**, migrant workers and, particularly, workers in the building and construction industry.

* It will fail in its current efforts to create greater divisions in Australian society between the different sections of the Australian work force, between men and **women** who work, between nationalities and between the old and the young.

* The Consultative Council of Public Participation has a membership of representatives of community interests such as local government advisers, cultural groups, trade unions, **women**'s groups and new interests.

* The men and **women** employed by the Commonwealth Railways, a small enterprise by railway standards, belong to 14 different unions.

* The States of South Australia and Tasmania and also **women** are under-represented because of this Government's action in appointing  Sir Henry  Bland and  Mr Short.

* This Government believes, though it has never made its intentions clear, that by putting men and **women** out of work and holding down incomes and living standards, the economy can be restored to prosperity.

* These **women**, who have enjoyed the extra comforts which their hours of work have provided, are now in a situation in which they are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet.

* It also conceals the fact that there are thousands of married **women**, older people and school leavers who have not registered because they have no hope of a job.

* Students who are really young men and **women** are required to attend a school as a kind of child minding centre, with no teachers to instruct them.

* In urban areas the **women** now outnumber men by 100 to 97, so the urban boys have what I might term a much less competitive time.

* If industries in Tasmania are not assisted, unfortunately men and **women** will be put out of work and will find it necessary to leave their homes.

* It is not the sort of welfare initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of welfare initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and **women** who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that nature because of some sort of crisis that has occurred in their life.

* They are made up of the average person who has a lot of commonsense- the type of men and **women** that we all know, who live in our streets, travel on public transport and who can make a fair judgment of a situation.

* A large number of ex-servicemen and **women** belong to these organisations.

* It is providing buildings and equipment for the training of young men and **women** undertaking trade and certificate courses in technical colleges, trade colleges and agricultural colleges, and taking part in rural training schemes.

* The abolition of the means test on incomes of persons over 75 years of age will not at any time in the future, if the Labor Government remains in office, be applied to **women** aged between 60 and 64 years.

* A 25 per cent tariff cut is equivalent to an increase in wages that ranges, depending on what basis of calculation one uses, between 6 per cent and 13 per cent; yet between December 1972 and September 1974 there has been an increase in wages averaging about 60 per cent- 56 per cent for men and 73 per cent for **women**.

* It will be seen that the Government is dedicated to a belief that education is a means for individual self development and that we on this side of the House are committed to furthering equality for **women** in education, employment and public life.

* Our net reproduction rate- this comes under the heading, if you like, of fertility of **women**- in 1961 was 1.63 per cent; in 1971 it was 1.39 per cent; in 1973 1.18 per cent; and in 1974 1.12 per cent.

* It is typical of the attitude of the Government to ex-servicemen and **women**.

* They were trying to escort three old **women** who were about their business of obtaining essential foods necessary for their survival.

* This has led to the situation where decent and responsible Australian men and **women** have been forced to go on strike to try to get some sort of wage parity.

* The proposed amendment to the Act seeks to make some protection, and I believe it is very good protection, available to those people because if that protection does not exist we have the sort of situation which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and those he repre sents - those who employ - want, that is, a situation where they have a completely subservient work force in their factories and men and **women** who are disinclined to take any action or to complain about any action taken against them for fear that their elected representatives and they in turn would be dismissed.

* I well remember the occasion on which he provided an answer to a question on the costing of the introduction of oral contraceptives into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in which he made the assumption that half of all the **women** who were not taking oral contraceptives at the time would immediately start to take them because their cost would drop from $1.30 a week to $1 a week.

* I refer to the growth of the concept of regionalism and its ready acceptance by the men and **women** who give their services willingly and selflessly as aldermen and councillors of the 900 odd municipal and shire councils.

* It has gone up slightly since although the figure is still better in respect of **women** than it is for men.

* Additional assistance could be given through State governments to those local authorities or other reputable bodies such as the Country Women's Association and chuch organisations which sometimes provide hostel facilities.

* There is so much mounting evidence which one can amass empirically in our society to show that tremendous social costs are being built up because of the pressures which have been developed in our society to force **women** into the work place.

* He spoke of growth centres, social security, **women**, health, migrants, farmers, defence, urban and regional development.

* Can honourable members imagine the environmental impact of that sort of situation on the **women** and children in the Yarrabah community- with guard dogs, police in uniform, gaol-like conditions and visiting magistrates?

* Indeed I suggest that we might think in terms of allowing the family allowance at some time in the future, when finances permit, to be paid during the period when **women** are expecting a child so as to assist them with preliminary expenses.

* In the course of such public scrutiny, the legislation should be considered by the trade union movement, insurance companies, members of the legal profession, the States and the other multitude of groups which have been in contact with us in the last few days including the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Guide Dogs for the Blind organisation and medical associations.

* The thing which shocked them most- I do not put it as being right or wrongwas that **women** should have the same kind of vote as men, because the idea that the woman and man are equal is absolutely foreign to the Aboriginal concept.

* I repeat that the advice the previous Government received and acted upon- that the garment and textile industry be treated in isolation and be reduced in size or even destroyed, without regard to the effect that would have on employment for **women** and without regard to the effect it would have on other industries- was quite stupid in the real sense of the word.

* In this period female earnings also rose at a rate faster than male earnings, reflecting the implementation of equal pay for **women**.

* The position is that there has been concern expressed in certain quarters that Aboriginal **women** wean their babies too late.

* Is it any wonder that the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  and the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury)  are trying to find work for married **women** while single girls walk the streets looking for jobs?

* I had previously pointed out how belated and dilatory was the Government's approach to this question of social services not only for migrants but also for Australian bom men and **women** who choose to live overseas and who thereupon lose the social benefits which they had earned by working and, therefore inevitably, by paying taxes in Australia.

* Are we doing anything to ensure that more **women** obtain the great advantages of education rather than having the great drop-out rates when they are in their teens?

* On top of this, a quarter of a million dollars is spent because, as I read the report in the  Women's Weekly,  Tamie said that the Lodge was a disgrace, it just had to be renovated.

* May I therefore support the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in his tributes to those many hundreds of men and **women**- up to about 1,000-who work in this building.

* In the case to which I referred there were two daughters looking after the **women**.

* But it has been suggested in some hope that it would reduce the incidence of married **women** in the work force by attracting such taxpayers back to the home.

* Rapists were significantly less likely than normals to have seen representations of fully nude **women**, of normal intercourse, of mouth genital contact or of sado-masochistic activity.

* Do they think **women**'s groups, conservationists, the young people or interests like economic nationalism will matter to a person like the Leader of the Opposition?

* The change also provides for the alignment of certain additional duties applying to adult and non-adult garments and **women**'s and men's knitted tops.

* What is the sense in turning out people through an educational system who are the best dressed men and **women** in the world but have nowhere to go and do not know how to get there.

* My wife reports to me, when she does the shopping in the city in which we live, the City of Broadmeadows: 'I see groups of **women** standing outside the butcher's shop, looking in the window for the cheapest meat to buy'.

* Our teaching service is subsisting where it can by the employment of working wives - **women** who have raised their children and who are unable to cope financially.

* The result is chaos because the previous Government allowed a situation to develop in which there were no training facilities available for young men and young **women** who wished to enter the skilled trades in the building industry.

* We can talk as much as we like about the defence needs of the country and about how we need new customs officers and all the fancy things in which we as the Federal Parliament get involved, but people do not believe that the country is being run effectively when they cannot get funds for priority needs such as kerbing and guttering, sewerage and drainage and when **women** are pushing prams through dustbowls in summer and quagmires in winter.

* In young **women** it is alleged that there can be difficulties with childbirth and that there can be malformations and other side effects.

* She, like many other **women** throughout Australia, because of her unselfish work must have a place in heaven where we know she will rest in peace.

* After all, more than 50 per cent of the voters are **women**.

* The Service pension is given to returned men and **women** who are aged 60 or 55 years respectively.

* This Bill provides for higher war compensation payments by way of increases in the rates of war pension for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen and **women** and those who, because of the severity of their war-caused disabilities, receive payments equal to the TPI rate, namely, the war blinded, those temporarily totally incapacitated, those receiving the special rate of war pension for tuberculosis, and those double amputees who receive additional amounts under the first six items of the Fifth Schedule.

* Thirdly, there are **women** who seek to re-enter the work force.

* It is only just and reasonable therefore that the country should accept the responsibility of ensuring that these servicemen and **women** should bc paid at a level commensurate with their skills and the responsibilities they bear.

* We recognise that in any development of adult apprenticeships there will be a need to safeguard the existing entry of young men and **women** into trades.

* Women who have just discovered that equal pay does not yet mean equal opportunity, or even equal rights to employment when employers are forced to retrench, may question the value of equalities which are not enforced.

* It is a move in favour of the independence of **women**.

* In that area the number of birth defects in children is greatly increased, the percentage of mental retardation in children born in the area is greatly increased, and pregnant **women** are miscarrying at a rate  50  per cent higher than normal.

* It relates to that time when in 1800 Young, the second but last of the original Pitcairners, died and Adams was left as leader of a community of himself, 10 **women** and 20 children, the products of the preceding years of cohabitation on both Tahiti and Pitcairn Island.

* Women are being forced to work part time.

* We ought to strive harder than ever before to achieve what no generation has yet achieved: A community composed of men and **women** for whom human values are more important than material advantage; a community for whom the interrelationship of man with man has become the most important concern; a community in which tolerance and understanding reign and prejudice is abandoned.

* It must get back to a clear, firm understanding that there is nothing wrong with this nation that cannot be solved, provided there is a will to solve it; and provided, beyond that, that there are men and **women** prepared to work to make it so.

* But it has been our experience in the past and it is a fact today that many of the migrants make up the work force, in some instances **women**, and we have to look to what will affect manufacturing industry in the future.

* I summarise the legislation once again by saying that the Government has a commitment to exservicemen and **women**.

* We now have a highly skilled community in which enormous talents are lying around unused in the spare time of the young men and the young **women** of Australia.

* Australia can rightly claim to have led the world in electoral reforms, being the first country to adopt preferential voting and one of the first to grant the franchise to **women**.

* But I am glad that at last something has been done because had this industry not received some form of protection, despite what the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  says - and I must give him full respect because he is at least consistent and always strongly opposes virtually any form of protection for Australian industry - the jobs of approximately 700 people, mostly **women**, employed in one industry in my electorate would have been in jeopardy and another industry in my electorate employing a large number of people could have been in serious straits.

* So on the question of child care honourable members opposite ought to appreciate greatly what the present Government is doing for the **women**, children and families of this country.

* -The $115m made available for the purpose of the defence service homes scheme has been expended due to the fact that the Government has greatly improved the scheme, increasing the amount of loan from $9,000 to $15,000 since it has been in office and greatly extending eligibility for the scheme in respect to members of the permanent forces, single men, single **women** and a limited range of national servicemen.

* Approximately 50 000 married **women** are included in the unemployment figures.

* We want a change of policy to our alternative Budget strategy- the lowering of indirect taxes, the stimulation of spending where there are unemployed men and **women** and other resources, a more realistic wages policy.

* I believe it is appropriate at this stage for men and **women** of goodwill not to keep turning back the clock and saying that the present circumstances are due to the policies of the last administration.

* The telegrams go on in that tone, and they are from organisations such as the Country Women's Association of Darwin, the Arts Council of the Northern Territory, citizen groups and different action groups of the city.

* Due to certain Press speculation by individuals, who I believe have a desire to paint this Government as a non-compassionate one, thousands of ill and old men and **women** were subjected to stress and anguish.

* In conception the measure is but one aspect of the Commonwealth's repatriation policy encompassing a wide range of concessions for returned exservicemen and **women** of the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars and the operations in Korea, Malaya and South Vietnam.

* The achievement of this program of reform, upon which we embarked last December, would not have been possible without the counsel and co-operation of the men and **women** who comprise the Australian Public Service.

* Experience has shown that the definition of 'aged person' in the principal Act- namely, men aged 65 and over and **women** aged 60 and over- is somewhat arbitrary and that people in younger age groups often suffer from handicaps or disabilities which result in their also needing accommodation of the type provided under the Aged Persons Homes Act.

* It has particular regard for the needs of **women**, of country students, of migrants, and of handicapped persons.

* I want to ensure that members of the Legislative Assembly are given a decent salary, as good a salary as is possible, in order to attract to it the best possible men and **women** in the Northern Territory.

* They are being revealed in the frightful social upheaval that is going on across the country, with hundreds of thousands of men and **women**, young girls and boys, not being able to get a job and facing a bleak future.

* There are provisions in the other portion of the Bill relating to instant cover for pregnant **women**.

* It is most appropriate in International Women's Year to honor her as a great Australian.

* The scope of service of AAFCANS will be modified to take account of the generally greater accessibility that servicemen and **women** now have to goods and services from commercial sources.

* With the exception of the retraining scheme for married **women** wishing to re-enter the work force, eligibility is restricted to those who have failed in their present occupations.

* With some of the changes in modern society there seems to be a growing view that **women** have an obligation to work as much as men.

* If the spirit of arbitration is to prevail- arbitration, a principle that has protected Australian working men and **women** through the generations, through the decadesthen it ought to be accepted in this case as it is in others.

* In that foray into another country some 12,000 cattle were rustled, a sugar factory was gutted, peasant homes were wrecked, children were speared to death on poles and **women** were raped.

* I refer to the wholesale murder of men, **women** and children which has been perpetrated and which is still being perpetrated by the Cambodian communist regime for the purpose of terrorising the Cambodian people.

* I believe in fair play even if the point of view of the person whom I defend is against my own, and in fairness I should say that despite a welter of publicity in Tasmania approximately 18 months ago about an alleged Rhodesian military recruitment operation in southern Tasmania, I am not satisfiedindeed no proper evidence which would satisfy me has been produced- that any effort has been made to recruit men or **women** in this country to serve in Rhodesia in the present confrontation.

* This is because of the ILO Convention requirement that 'in no case, shall the employer be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.'

* We are interested in the fact that these people wishing to come to Australia are men and **women**.

* Of course, we can easily isolate three groups- men over 55, married **women** and young people.

* The inclusion of non-elected nominated members in the House is a new concept in Papua New Guinea but there is a widespread feeling in Papua New Guinea of the need to provide a means for the representations of special groups, for example, **women**, or persons having a special expertise, in the legislature.

* Of those 10,000 people a very big proportion is migrant **women** many of whom have trouble with the English language.

* It is true to say that in the past fair and reasonable men and **women** have expressed doubts as to the nature and conduct of the war in Vietnam.

* It is an academic approach which ignores the fact that a major increase in cheap imports following sudden appreciation could cause the bankruptcy of small manufacturing industries which employ thousands of men and **women** throughout Australia.

* I refer to local voluntary and service bodies such as Apex, Lions, Rotary, the Country Women's Association and many other such organisations which contribute manifestly to the welfare of the citizens within their sphere of influence.

* It made a very serious error when it cut tariffs across the board by 25 per cent without any consideration of whether the industries affected were decentralised industries or under competition and without considering the nature of the work force or whether there were **women** in it.

* The honourable gentleman referred to the Women and Politics Conference.

* The position of **women** has been recognised in the new scheme and has been given special attention in 2 areas.

* Next year there will be thousands of highly qualified, well educated young men and **women** who will not be able to get jobs or who will have to settle for a job far below their level of competence.

* Prior to that, having had interviews with and requests from the Country Women's Association, the Broken Hill Police and many other people in the area, I had taken the matter up with the Minister on several occasions.

* When we have this talk about the need to introduce market rents, paradoxically in order to get the people who are not so poor out of public housing accommodation, I am reminded of the fact that the people in this group- the homeless men and **women** of this country- as a matter of policy are not housed, as far as I know, by any of the State housing authorities.

* Let us not think that the men and **women** who sit on the Hill are not engaged in recreation.

* This is a tremendous advantage because hitherto men and **women** have lost' seniority in transferring from one service to another.

* It would appear that such **women** suffer from discrimination which often is not earned.

* There was no consideration of whether an affected industry was a decentralised industry, whether it employed **women**, what was the skill of the people in the work force, whether they would be absorbed elsewhere, whether the industry was already in competition with imported goods and what its level of profitability was, and whether there had been a Tariff Board inquiry into the industry shortly before.

* It is of no good for them to get a first, second or third degree at a university and then come out well-dressed men or **women** with nowhere to go.

* No-one can deny that all the cranks, odd bods, drug addicts, homosexuals, abortionists,  pornographers, Women's Liberation supporters and all the demonstrators in the world were brought together in one unified force to get the Labor Party into power.

* When the **women** of this country wake up to what the Government has in mind as far as this is concerned I think that they will vent a quality of vengeance upon you,  Mr Minister,  that will be thoroughly warranted.

* That assistance will be provided not only for the construction people but also for the citizens- the family men and **women** and their children.

* There are a number of related social problems which could tear this nation apart, particularly the widening gap between the information rich and the information poor in which the unskilled become an intellectual proletariat; the problem we have to face where shorter working hours are offered with correspondingly lower pay which means, in effect, increased hardship for the poor; and growing competition for jobs which will disadvantage young people, **women** and migrants.

* It will erode Aboriginal societies through the sexual unions of white men and Aboriginal **women** which mining will bring to that region.

* We have school teachers unable to continue their classes, ministers unable to speak to their congregations, people in hospital and **women** expecting babies who are unable!

* The people of whom I am talking are people in the aged group - that is, **women** over 60 years and men over 65 years - people in the invalid group who have the requisite medical qualification or disqualification, and widows, who include of course deserted wives.

* We should forget about the **women** who are pregnant and cannot go to the polling booth.

* That seems to me to be somewhat of a downgrading of **women**.

* Recently I addressed a meeting at Wamboota, which was listed as a discussion with the Wamboota Women's Charity Club.

* The pool will be every bit as much a pan of the training of the young men and **women** who are in camp there as is any other facility there.

* The experience is that with technological development and with **women** going into industry, the chances of young people obtaining employment are becoming fewer and fewer.

* This feeling is compounded by the knowledge that we are an exceedingly wealthy nation and yet the ordinary men and **women**, much more the very large under-privileged sections -  1  million of them - are convinced that they are not getting a fair share.

* It was agreed that the Commonwealth pay money to the States, to be allocated through the child welfare departments to provide some assistance to **women** with children born Outside marriage.

* It shows that, despite advantages that this country has, something like 1 in 10 of its men, **women** and children - old people, married people on low incomes and children - is suffering from what might be called some degree of poverty.

* That is the whole basis of Judeo-Christian society and the upward progress of men and **women** so that when they reach adulthood- whether it be 18 years of age or 2 1 years of age- they are allowed to do what they want to do as long as they do not break the law.

* Women who were rejected may have had pre-menstrual pain when they were young.

* It is the equivalent of about 17 million **women**'s frocks costing $50 each.

* These are the Australians of tomorrow, the young men and **women** who should be getting their training in various apprenticeships or skilled trades.

* The resolution urged national servicemen to lay down their arms in mutiny against the heinous barbarism perpetrated in our name upon innocent aged men, **women** and children.

* Would any honourable member on the Government side regard cosmetics for **women** as not being a benefit to those in the community who use them?

* is very difficult to restrain one's emotions when one's fellow men and pregnant **women** are being stabbed and massacred, as was reluctantly shown by newspapers in the early stages of the Vietnam war.

* On the contrary, these unfortunate men, **women** and children are fleeing southwards.

* It has been directed against **women**, children and persons with no involvement in the Middle East who happen to be at airports or in aircraft.

* A few isolated cases occurred in which young men and **women** did behave and did dress and did arrange to smell in such a way as would cause people not to employ them.

* Special attention will be given to the needs of migrant **women** - the married woman and the housewife - for whom, if they are to become full members of the community and if they are t participate in the social life, a knowledge of English is essential.

* He stated the iniquities of imprisoning  5  **women** in Melbourne who had committed an offence and who had been tried by the court, and when he came along and, as he claims, did exactly the same thing endeavouring to occupy, take over or bc unlawfully on government property he was ignored and was not given the coverage that he though!

* The same is true for single **women** who are 60 years and over or medically qualified for an invalid pension.

* He would be thinking of the large number of men and **women** who are standing crowded in the waiting area.

* I hope that there are a number of **women** amongst them.

* The Government sees this measure as being of such importance to the Australian community that we shall welcome any views which any person or organisation including representatives of the insurance industry, **women**'s organisations, trade unions and, of course, the Opposition Parties in this Parliament wishes to place before us, and I foreshadow now that the Government will propose amendments to the Bill during its passage through the Parliament.

* But we should not suppose that a group of people- a body of men and **women**- able to accept these highly specialised responsibilities will arise spontaneously.

* The AMA knows that if **women** demanding abortions have to pay for them out of their own pockets there will be some slackening of demand for the operation and the doctors performing it will suffer cuts in income.

* Firstly, it does not satisfy reformers such as the Divorce Law Reform Association, certain groups within the Women's Electoral Lobby and the other groups which are seeking divorce law reform, even though the Bill does remove fault as the basis for dissolving a marriage and even though it embraces the concept of equal responsibilty by the parties to a marriage in respect of the children of the marriage and also embraces the concept of their own independent individual responsibility for themselves after dissolution.

* The whole concept of categorising **women** in that fashion was inhumane and insulting, in our view, but it was a graphic demonstration of the repressive interpretation of 'real' as seen by honourable members on the Government side.

* I would agree with that in war time, but in peacetime we should take the opportunity to give our servicemen and **women** every comfort and facility.

* When the Leader of the Opposition spoke on the Budget on 24th August and forecast an unemployed work force of some 100,000 men and **women** early in the new year, the Prime Minister, speaking 14 days later, pooh poohed this forecast and said that it was just another one of the flights of imagination of the Leader of the Opposition.

* When I use the expression 'those who are living in genteel poverty' I am thinking about widows, widowers and unmarried elderly **women** who live in their own homes, who do not pay rent but who pay rates.

* Because I mentioned a figure of 120,000 unemployed by the New Year which could involve between 300,000 and 400,000 men, **women** and children, he put up the false argument that this figure is excessive because most of the unemployed people would be school leavers.

* Why does it not allow that money to work for the community instead of sitting over there on the Government benches in a stupid fashion and saying- 
It would appear as though the House has adopted a very bi-partisan approach to this legislation which may affect many 'veterans', the term now used to describe those ex-servicemen and **women** who are covered by repatriation legislation.

* As the Minister has pointed out, some 74 men, **women** and children were on their way in a large-scale mobile party moving from Warburton to Wiluna for the purpose of a rain making and man making ceremony.

* During its 2 1 months of operation the Council has succeeded in obtaining community participation which has led to the establishment of a homeless persons shelter, an emergency shelter for **women** and children, various self help groups and projects throughout the area.

* There are a number of recommendations which commend themselves, some of which are the recommendations for increased funding of research to universities; a rational transfer of credits between institutions; return to full triennium funding; better labour statistics and facilities for manpower planning; the need for a special effort to increase numbers of Aborigines in skilled trades; the endorsement of migrant education; wide access of skilled trades to **women**; special efforts to improve numeracy and literacy skills; greater flexibility in staffing of universities; special attention to the needs of the handicapped and arrangements to be negotiated with the civil services, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, industry and other universities for exchange and secondment of staff.

* The Opposition was going to take the taxes out of the pockets of the working men and **women** of Australia and pay those funds to companies.

* Instead of so much money being spent on material things we should be spending it on training people, on giving them the experience, on trying to find men and **women** with experience who can give the Aborigines the lead and help them enter the future life that they are going to have.

* The synthetics have made wool socks acceptable to **women** who objected to the darning and men who did not like the holes.

* It would do today's young men and **women** nothing but good to come under Army discipline.

* But now, in 1971, a situation has developed which touches on a key community in New South Wales - a fine community of men, **women** and children who are involved in the cannery.

* No-one on this side of the House denies the need for trade unions in Australia, nor does anyone on this side of the House deny the right of working men and **women** to organise themselves into trade unions.

* Of this we can be certain: As Labor pursues its policies and impulses without thought of the consequences and the effects on the lives of individual men and **women** and on the productive development of this country, while Labor is in office we will be compelled to live under the continued threat of worse to come.

* Sixty per cent of the workforce in the tourist and travel industry are **women**.

* -A Darwin trust fund has been set up consisting of the Administrator of the Northern Territory,  His  Honour J. N. Nelson; Harold Brennan, the Mayor of Darwin; Paul Everingham, the  Deputy  Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly;  Mr McDonell,  who is an executive member of that body;  Dr Stack,  representing the **women** of Darwin; Bishop O 'Loughlin of the Roman Catholic Church;  Mr Trower  of the Red Cross; Reverend Bence of the United Churches of Darwin;  Mr Robertson  of the welfare organisation;  Mr Alec  Fong Lim representing the business sector; and Bernard Valadian representing the Aboriginal community.

* For example, there is copious reference to the role of **women**- a role to which certain elements of the Labor movement have given lip service and against which others have worked quite strongly.

* Turning to unemployment, we find that the unemployment rate may reach 6 per cent of the work force with the brunt of the burden falling most severely upon the poor, the young, the **women** and the rural sector.

* This brought widespread demonstrations by the **women** of Great Britain.

* We provided for voting by **women** before almost anyone else in the world.

* It might have been poor consolation for the thousands of men and **women** thrown out of work, but in the long term it would have made some amends to the nation.

* Service pensions are available to cxservicemen and ex-service **women** if they have suffered from tuberculosis or have served in a theatre of war and are 60 years of age, if a man, and 55 years of age, if a woman, or are permanently unemployable.

* - Mr Deputy Speaker, for us, it is fortunate that we live in a community which cherishes its freedom of action, a country peopled by men and **women** who want to do their own thing in their own way and in their own time.

* Perhaps this is an opportune time to say that in considering these clauses which deal with price discrimination, mergers and certain other practices which are dealt with in the Trade Practices Bill - it of course really could be called the Anti Restrictive Trade Practices Bill - the Government recognises, and I certainly recognise, that the vast majority of businesses in Australia are conducted by extremely well meaning, responsible, civic minded men and **women** who are wholly devoted to their duties and to the weight of the task which they shoulder in trying to administer their businesses so that they can fit in with changing circumstances in Australia.

* The secretary that the honourable member sacked without any reason was recognised amongst members of the Public Service in Queensland and by mem bers of the Parliament as one of the most reputable of **women**.

* I think we should remember that these halls provide more than just living quarters for young men and young **women** who attend these universities.

* Women are often left at home by themselves all day.

* At the present time they find it most difficult to cut through the heap of red tape in order to receive benefits that would allow them to live in some decency but, more importantly, as equal men and **women** in an equal society.

* The public servants whom the honourable member for Fraser represents are in the main men and **women** who do the more basic chores in the PubUc Service or who do the middling chores the chores which are very well paid, sometimes at between $10,000 and $20,000 a year-but they do work that brings them into touch with the reality, the statistics at least, of some of the people facing the desperate situation in Australia which is never seen by the constituents of people in this chamber who come from the wealthiest residential districts in our metropolitan areas.

* Surely it is reasonable and acceptable to honourable members who sit on the Opposition side that costs be contained and that there be no penalty rates at weekends or on holidays so that **women**, young people, university students and students from colleges of advanced education - 
Because the problem is so serious I have in the last couple of weeks received a great mass of representation from organisations in the Illawarra area.

* For example I have before me a letter on the subject from the  President  of the South Bulli Miners Lodge, a letter from the Secretary of the Stanwell Park Country Women's Association pleading for assistance for these people, a letter from the Appin Miners' Federation signed by its  President,  a letter from the  President  of the Stanwell Park Parents and Citizens Association and a letter from the Secretary of the Bulli Miners Lodge.

* It seems to me - it has even been suggested by some of the Government supporters - that the only reason why no corrective action has been taken is the fear that a small percentage of single pensioners may marry younger **women** in order to obtain the married couple rate of pension in lieu of the single rate.

* Through its initiative the Government will solve a serious community problem which relates to the needs of today's community and which is reflected in the rising proportion of married **women** in the work force.

* As a large percentage of **women** use a specialist rather than a general practitioner, will the same arrangement apply to a specialist?

* We also advertised extensively, as a supplement, through the  Australian Women's Weekly.

* Both funds provided to the States to meet their obligations for educating our children and funds provided to colleges and universities to ensure increasing facilities for our young men and **women**, tike the allocations for social welfare, make allocations a few years ago seem like petty cash.

* I suppose the work force has doubled in the last 20 years, particularly in view of the entry of so many **women**, including mothers.

* I also read that executivetype men and **women** from 40 to 60 years of age have been retrenched.

* Some of them have been thrown up in papers that have been produced by the Women's Electoral Lobby, for instance.

* We deny this fundamental entitlement to the Aboriginal, whom our forefathers dispossessed without compensation, in doing so often abusing the Aboriginal **women**, murdering the men and corrupting and cruelly destroying the Aboriginal's culture and self respect.

* I received a letter this morning from one of these aged **women** in Adelaide who pointed out that old ladies have been found dead in their flats.

* As it happens, about 60 per cent of all the families registered under the category earning less than $4.50 were families led by **women**.

* It has been extremely carefully calculated that as a result of the policy followed by the New South Wales Liberal and Country Party Government approximately 65,000 men, **women** and children have been retained in New South Wales country areas who otherwise would have had to find job opportunities and housing facilities in metropolitan areas.

* The Government believes that education should aim to make good citizens, loyal citizens and able citizens - to make men and **women** who appreciate the need in our society of high moral values, respect for each other, respect for the rights of others and for the dignity of the individual.

* Many people say that they do not believe married **women** should stay at home.

* I refer to married **women**, the young, the ethnic groups and the unskilled, who could be easily placed in such an industry.

* The 1945 Act sets out the then Government's policy for re-establishing discharged men and **women**, and re-settling civilian war workers.

* I am referring not only to social service pensioners but also to those men and **women** who have served their country in two world wars and in other wars in which we subsequently have been involved and who receive this same measly increase of 50c a week.

* As most honourable members would know, the art of karate is now being taught in Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and I might say, is a rapidly growing sport attracting some of the nation's finest young men and **women** to its ranks.

* For example, the survey found that 30 per cent of **women** bringing up children by themselves were found to be in poverty and another 14 per cent were only marginally above the poverty line.

* Population is the basis on which boundaries should be decided because men, **women** and children of all ages and all nations present as many problems as those eligible to vote.

* It is important, I believe, for -honourable members to realise, that by their statements and by their conduct they should give no comfort to that relatively small number of men, and maybe **women**, in Australia who are promoting the flag,, the leader and the anniversary of this puppet state created by our enemies in the last war.

* Not only that, these men and youths assist in the development of still younger people - the children - in the sport of surfing, in the recreation of the surf and the beach, and also in the development of a spirit of service to other men and **women**.

* It will rob young men and **women** of their earnings and of the opportunity to establish homes of their own where reasonable standards of living and adequate opportunities can be provided for their children.

* As long as we can preserve the right of free men and free **women** .to discuss in a free, responsible and rational way matters of policy and matters which concern the safety of the state then the state is in effect assured of a safe position.

* There can be no doubt that since coming to office this Government has sought consistently to remove all forms of discrimination from our laws, whether it be discrimination against **women**, Aborigines, migrants or in the various other forms that it appears in our statutes.

* Some of the things that I want to deal with tonight in the limited time available to me relate once again to the tardiness of this Government in doing something for an industry in this country that employs directly and indirectly something like 5000 men and **women**.

* He now brings to the world his message of peace and goodwill for all men and **women** of all creeds and all nations.

* He just took the normal, Tory reaction to a situation where the working hours of working men and **women** were being reduced.

* I am surprised that he referred to unemployment, however, because when his Government was in office it deliberately followed policies, which I have already mentioned, which led to the creation of unemployment that reached the staggering total of 130,000 men and **women**.

* The second respect is the impact that high interest rates have had on the ordinary men and **women** in the Australian community in pushing up the costs of everything they want to do and in denying them the opportunity to build homes and to do many of those things which as Australians we have come to expect as a result of years of sound and wise economic management by governments from this side of the House.

* Those people- men, **women** and elderly people- in the community who are injured on the roads or at work are denied by this scheme compensation to which they are presently entitled.

* The argument is that couples have deferred the birth of their first child for several years, perhaps in response to economic circumstances or to changed attitudes towards **women** working.

* We have provided a new house to the **women**'s refuge when we found the existing accommodation to be inadequate.

* Many men and **women** spoke very eloquently about their desire for Commonwealth action.

* She would make certain he remembered young children and the **women** of this country whenever major decisions were being made.

* This Parliament is the better for men and **women** who hold strong views and express them here without hope or expectation.

* did not want the issue of equal pay for men and **women** or the abolition of interstate differentials decided at or even during the national wage cases which are going to commence on 6th August; they wanted those issues decided separately and later than that 
Yes.

* Why are not single **women** who have served in our Forces - nurses and the like who are still single and who still have need of a home because they have depend.dants such as mothers and fathers - eligible for a war service home loan?

* did not want the issue of equal pay for men and **women** or the abolition of interstate differentials decided at or even during the national wage cases which are going to commence on 6th August; they wanted those issues decided separately and later than that.

* The Committee was asked to have special regard when reviewing the existing pay structure to the national requirement to attract and retain men and **women** with appropriate qualities, skills and experience.

* I should emphasise that the capital fund has not been a 'hand out' operation but has provided loans on reasonable terms to Aboriginal men and **women** who have sought to improve their economic circumstances by their own effort.

* The report went on to state that rural voters, **women** voters, future trends amongst white collar voters, declining solidarity of blue collar working support and middle aged voters were the weakest cohorts for Labor.

* They do not like the fact that he slugged the average working men and **women** of Australia 45c out of every additional dollar they earned when their income got to $10,000 a year, and 55c in the dollar for every additional dollar they earned over $16,000.

* So far as the Convention on the Political Rights of Women is concerned, the position remains as set out in the Prime Minister's reply of 29 May 1969.

* There has also been a considerable increase in the provision for the employment training school for **women** from the expenditure last year of $138,784 to the appropriation of $225,000 this financial year.

* I seem to remember that the last time the estimates for this Department were discussed I referred to the electorate of my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Sydney  (Mr Cope),  where there is a situation of fragmentation with large numbers of widows and large numbers of man-less **women** who are either deserted or the wives of service personnel.

* Immediately industrial action is taken by the working men or **women** of Australia they are looked down on.

* When they arrive here things may happen in the hearts of young men or young **women** and it may well be that they enter into a sincere and enduring relationship.

* As a result of self-interest and the need for self-defence men and **women** became increasingly capable of cooperating in substantial groupings.

* I notice it in speaking to married **women** who stop at home.

* Defence gets his feet back on to the ground, I can see him, dressed in a general's uniform and with his aide-de-camp, perhaps a batman and a member of the **women**'s army, all suitably attired, following him in single file down the passageway and into the House.

* There is no concern for the special needs of **women** and children.

* During his absence the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs,  Mr Howard,  will act as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting me in Public Service matters and **women**'s affairs.

* -May I say at the outset that the Government condemns unreservedly the senseless and brutal killings of innocent men, **women** and children recently in Zaire.

* The second thing I say to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is this: Approximately three months ago the Women's Electoral Lobby in Hobart organised what turned out to be a most useful seminar on legal aid.

* In addition to the categories I have already mentioned, from 1 July 1979 the following groups will also be eligible to apply for the free issue of the National Flag: Community service groups including ex-service, Apex, Lions, Rotary, senior citizens' and the Country Women's Association; benevolent and welfare organisations including Red Cross and Legacy; homes for handicapped persons.

* In fact, 87 per cent of the men, and 89 per cent of the **women**, were under the age of 35.

* 'The men and **women** workers were also exposed to certain diseases transmissable from animals to humans.

* The other question which I raise concerns the older servicemen and **women**.

* Women and young girls have special attention, being raped by the insertion of coca bottles and live eels in the genital organs.

* Many of these 80,000 people are associated with decentralised industries and many of them are **women** in the work force who find it difficult to get alternative types of work.

* Let me illustrate the real effect that this action has had on the Australian textile industry which employs 80 per cent **women** the majority of whom are married.

* One redeeming feature for the people who reside in the area that I have lost from my electorate is the fact that they will now be represented by a great gladiator, a real fighter for the men and **women** and children of the west, in the person of the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Corbett).

* It is the scripture of my party that men and **women** do their best and achieve their full potential when the reward of their efforts is their own.

* To the men and **women** in the Commonwealth departments of Australia I pay my thanks and appreciation, for without their help and advice I could never have coped with the amount of work that went through my office.

* The people I am talking about are all pensioners, **women** more than 60 years of age and men more than 65 years of age.- All pensioners will be affected.

* We still have men and **women** working on the factory floor who are there for reasons only of lack of education.

* This country was one of the first in the world to give votes to **women**.

* It would be a great betrayal of the memory of those men and **women** it commemorates if it were not to be adequately financed and staffed to cope with expanding needs and demands.

* He made the point strongly that marihuana was potentially dangerous, saying, I think, that it caused cancer, affected **women**'s ovaries and did all kinds of other things that might possibly attract headlines.

* That Act was designed to implement policies for reestablishing discharged servicemen and service **women** and for resettling workers displaced as a result of an economy changing from a war-time footing to a peace-time consumer economy.

* As we prepare for the Christmas season, the season of goodwill, we must all fervently hope that reason and sense will prevail, that tensions will ease, that men and **women** of goodwill will be able to comprehend the dangers in the present situation and that compromise and solutions will be found to their many problems.

* As most dependent spouses are widows rather than widowers, this is decidedly an improvement in the rights of **women**.

* The honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  spoke of unemployment benefits and of the request by numerous Aboriginal communities that either they not receive those benefits or that the money which is paid into the community in that manner be used to provide job opportunities for the men and the **women**.

* Many of these **women** have raised a family and cared for a home for years.

* At what age should retirement benefit be available for men and **women**?

* The basis was laid on which in the future a greater number of young Aboriginal men and **women** would be able to take employment for which they were trained.

* I have also been advised that a few staff are away in the Departments of Veterans' Affairs, Education, Health, the Capital Territory Health Commission, Postal and Telecommunications, Productivity- except for the Patents Office, my colleague will be pleased to knowAdministrative Services, Home Affairs- except for the office of Women's Affairs, my colleague will also be pleased to know- the Taxation Office and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

* What would be thought if the next Government were to check the call boxes at Government House and Admiralty House to discover which men or which **women** had gone there last year?

* My own Department, in co-operation with other departments, is examining what are the most effective ways of improving work opportunities, especially for young **women**, in country areas.

* .The honourable gentleman would be aware that the increase in the number of married **women** in the work force has been 3 times as great as increases in other sections of the work force.

* As a direct consequence of the operations of the Barrier Industrial Council, there is an embargo on the right of married **women** to enter the work force, with some few exceptions.

* There is considerable scope for increased involvement of married **women** in the work force.

* The other is to bring about greater wage justice and social benefits by the introduction of tax indexation and family allowances in the desire that there will be greater wage restraint on the part of the ordinary men and **women** of this country.

* He made Federal  Hansard  history by appointing **women** as reporters in what had been for 70 years an exclusively male preserve.

* What does  Mrs Joan  Adamson,  President  of the Women's Action Alliance, have to say on this subject?

* All through March the letters of protest poured in: People's hair was falling out, pregnant **women** lost their babies, virgins became pregnant, fractures would not heal, bones became brittle, etc., etc.

* The goal of that group has been, and remains, to establish a party which will attract 'the broadest range of men and **women**' and whose structure will offer 'the maximum opportunity for participation at all levels and throughout the State'.

* There he was saying that the revenues were not going to be used for the purpose of relieving the plight of **women** in refuges, to relieve the plight of the unemployed, the homeless or the young people seeking job opportunities in this area.

* The Opposition naturally supports the grant of $454,930 for Roberts Hall at Monash and $47,241 for the Women's Hall of Residence within the University of Tasmania.

* I do not think that we should underestimate the unsettling effect on the wool industry that the inability of **women** at the moment to decide how long their skirts should be has had.

* Not only is the Film Development Corporation doing much to help viable films on a commercial basis but the Government also is helping through the Experimental Film Fund and the training scheme to provide talented young men and **women** in this field with training opportunities.

* Professor Zubrzycki, Head of the Department of Sociology at the Australian National University, who is the  chairman  of the Committee; Miss Green,  Chairman  of the Australian Council of Social Service;  Mr Hawke, President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions;  Sir Arthur  Lee,  President  of the Returned Services League,  Mr Lippmann, Chairman  of the Migrant Welfare Committee of the Australian Council of Social Service; Air Marshal  Sir John  McCauley,  President  of the Good Neighbour Council of New South Wales;  Mr McRae, President  of the National Youth Council;  Mr Nicholas,  Executive Officer of the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council;  Mrs Reader,  representing the National Council of Women; and  Dr Alan  Richardson, Reader in Psychology at the University of Western Australia.

* That man of God, the honourable member for Lyne, did not raise his voice when napalm was raining from the heavens on **women** and little children.

* The third Bill introduced a completely new benefit known as the supporting mother's benefit to assist unmarried mothers and married **women** who are no longer living with their husbands to adequately care for their children.

* As it is becoming fashionable nowadays, I would like to present the case for a pressure group, even if this group, for a change, is the vast majority, the silent majority of our country - the you, the you and the me; the hundreds of thousands of normal, ordinary, decent men, **women** and youngsters whose only crime' is that for too long they have been taking it on the chin.

* Thus small business men and **women** who are listening to this parliamentary debate might wonder why it is that the Government has not provided an answer to the increasing problems of those small enterprises still in operation.

* Australia was one of the first countries to introduce universal franchise, votes for **women**, secret ballot and full preferential voting.

* I understand that the other divisions are the young liberals and the **women**'s division.

* They discriminate against **women** as against men.

* These men and **women** are much more highly trained than were their predecessors, those who were employed at the time of Federation.

* It waits until record numbers of Australian men and **women** have lost their jobs and retrenchments are unavoidable and then starts to get off its tail.

* His  wartime experience gave him a deep and continuing concern for ex-service men and **women** and over many years he was a powerful and effective advocate in the Parliament on their behalf.

* There must be an end to the situation when many migrant workers are forever condemned to the most menial jobs, where migrant **women** become virtual prisoners in their own homes as a direct result of their language difficulties.

* I think it would be well for the nation- particularly ex-servicemen and exservice **women**- to note what the Leader of the Opposition said in that speech.

* Special measures can be taken to assist married **women** to re-enter the work force if they want to, and to make sure that people with disabilities are enabled to make a contribution to the working life of the community.

* Similary we have extremely comprehensive data on over 1,100,000 age and invalid pensioners, on over 126,000 widow pensioners and **women** receiving supporting mother's benefit and on some 396,000 cases in which unemployment, sickness benefits and special benefits were granted last year.

* On the other hand, the most popular example of a abortion stance which ignores the humanity of the unborn is that promoted by the so-called **women**'s movement.

* We are one of the last developed nations to have a large part of our environment left virtually in its natural state and it is up to all men and **women**, not just the socialists, to preserve as much of it as is economically and socially possible.

* Despite the promiscuity which goes on today in the community, a lot of **women** suffer great embarrassment at bearing an illegitimate child, and that could have been brought about by the legal humble-bumble the young couple had to go through.

* In the case of the Blythe Star fatality in Tasmania a few years ago, those **women** received their just entitlements under the then compensation Act, but under limited liability provisions they would have been deprived of many of the benefits.

* In all the recent criticism of this motion regarding **women**'s rights and doctors' responsibilities not one critic has yet put in a plea for the foetus.

* Homes for the aged must be used exclusively for the aged - for men aged more than 65 years and **women** more than 60 years.

* It has been- I hope it will continue to be- manned by men, and indeed by **women**, of great accomplishment.

* It involves licensing **women** who are chosen for their suitability for looking after children.

* It does not explain that this means that it is the **women** especially who have been forced to carry the burden of this so-called economy measure.

* The men and **women** with money and the big companies who practise these devices pass their share of taxation on to the person who can least afford to pay it.

* Of course, the people who pay are the taxpayers, the ordinary hard-working men and **women** of this country.

* Charlie Adermann was a gentle man who was respected by men and **women** of all political persuasions, not simply because of his ability but because of his integrity, his fairmindedness, his decency and the principles for which at all times he stood and for which he was prepared to fight in this House and in the country at large.

* Essentially, the decision meant that those **women** in the work force who were eligible for equal pay would receive it on a stage basis over a period of 3 or 4 years, if my recollection is right.

* The result is thousands of men and **women** sitting in skyscraper offices exchanging pieces of paper at an ever increasing rate and hoping to God that the nation's productivity is adequate to keep them in a style to which they are accustomed now.

* It states that the national attitude must be changed so that **women** are encouraged to educate and retrain themselves for occupations outside the home.

* Sylvia Phyllis Hale, 30, who authorises pamphlets for the Women's Liberation 'Front' is the wife of Roger Barnes.

* Will he also table the papers in the Duff case so that the Parliament may be in a position to judge the merits of what constitutes lawful desertion in the Government's view so far as hundreds of married **women** are concerned?

* I think that this entitlement, which was invoked by the Labor Government under the Medibank arrangements in 1973-74, has been a help to **women** over the years.

* It is a selfless, sometimes thankless task of many hundreds or thousands of **women** who serve in an honorary capacity.

* The members of the Labor Party Women's Committee there set up everything.

* I emphasise, as I did earlier in answer to the honourable member for La Trobe, that the purpose of this scheme is not to encourage additional **women** into the work force but simply to have an impact on a problem which is before us, which is immediate and which requires attention.

* More than 250 men and **women** are in fact performing consular functions in Australia.

* He was the  President  and  Chairman  of Welfare of all branches of 'Shiralee' the association for divorced, separated and deserted men and **women**.

* It is so tragic that the Games at Munich should have been chosen for this act because of all the functions at which the nations of the world gather together, the Olympic Games are a function at which men and **women** of all the different creeds, nationalities and colours gather together in the hope that there will be greater peace.

* I think immediately of married **women** who, for obvious reasons, cannot move to an exchange which the Department thinks would suit them.

* The opportunity exists for thousand of jobs for men and **women**, not just in construction but in the manufacture of building materials.

* In the case of pregnant **women**, when this Bill becomes law they will have to wait for a period of 2 months before their benefits commence.

* They expect a whole range of services for groups in the community which have special needs such as the old, the sick, the young, **women** and Aborigines.

* The Labor Party might learn a great deal from recent events in Northern Ireland, where quietly and with genuine love and understanding the **women** of Northern Ireland have begun to tear up the attitudes of man against man in that country.

* I am deeply indebted to the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham)  for the manner in which he has approached the question of tubercular exservicemen and **women**, and I intend to follow his lead.

* Women such as my wife and the wives of other members of Parliament will be affected when they go to the supermarkets.

* I understand from representations recently made to me by the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (ACSPA), which operates this Centre, that financial support has not been forthcoming in adequate amounts from Union sources to cover the on-going operations of the Centre after the initial grant of $40,000, made by the Commonwealth last year through the International Women 's Year (IWY) Appropriation, has been exhausted.

* IWY grants were not designed to pay for the ongoing operations of a facility, such as the Working Women's Centre, beyond those costs incurred in its establishment.

* I understand the Centre has endeavoured to have Unions take up these, and other issues of concern to working **women**, and has also attempted to make working **women** more aware of such issues and to raise them with their Unions.

* Many **women**'s organisations have, for some years, been concerned with these and other related matters of concern to working **women**.

* Women's Trade Union Commission in Sydney, and the Queensland Women's Trade Union Committee, both of which also received Commonwealth funds made available through the IWY Appropriation, last year.

* More recently, a Working Women's Centre was established in Footscray in Melbourne with Commonwealth funds provided under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* There are also Working Women's Centres or Groups in Canberra, Newcastle, Adelaide and Perth.

* Further, within my own Department, the Women's Bureau, established first in 1963 as the Women's Section, is concerned with undertaking research into, and providing policy advice on these, and a wide range of other matters, relating to **women** in employment.

* I added that the Women's Bureau of my Department would be associated with this examination.

* I saw what the Communists are doing to innocent men, **women** and children in that country, and as a Christian I was proud of what the Australians are doing to protect the South Vietnamese people from Communist attacks.

* I know many men who displayed exceptional courage during World War II, but I know many more men and **women** who displayed even greater courage during the depression years; for their type of courage was both physical and moral, and the odds against them were consistently present.

* The information before me indicates that the number of men, **women** and children fleeing from the invading forces now exceeds 250,000.

* The centre will promote community involvement in education and, if adequately funded, might later be available for adult retraining programs - for example, refreSher courses for married **women** interested in returning to teaching and preliminary courses for persons wishing to become teachers.

* This present instance is blackmail of a State and tens of thousands of ordinary workers, housewives, **women** and children, people in hospitals, people in convalescent homes, by the power unions which will not accept the arbitrator's verdict, the umpire's verdict.

* I have no wish to refute the false and slightly intemporate comments of the Minister in other areas except to state that the allegations that either I am opposed or my Party is opposed to proper opportunities for **women** are quite unfounded.

* No matter what fashionable ideas people may have, **women** are still the only ones able to have children.

* It has even provided a 55-years option for **women** which is far in advance of what the Pubhe Service is suggesting.

* In International Women's Year the Opposition wants to discriminate against the widows.

* These are men and **women** who want to work.

* For a start, married **women** have given up the ghost.

* But at this particular time there are many **women** within the Australian community who, no matter how happy their home is and so on, have independent assets and believe that they have an independent status.

* Young Women 's Christian Association of Australia 
It is interesting to follow the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  and to hear an attitude for which I suppose the polite word is 'oldfashioned'.

* The honourable member did not mention the fact that his Government introduced a 25 per cent tariff cut which did more than any single thing to destroy employment in the textile industry, particularly the employment of **women** who, in many areas of Australia, do not have alternative employment opportunities available to them.

* My colleague the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  and other members of the medical profession, as well as honourable members, will agree that some years ago the medical profession recommended that doctors refrain from X-raying pregnant **women** because of the effects that radiation might have on the unborn child.

* By March, notwithstanding the big inflow of migrants and the entry of more and more married **women** into the work-force, the labour situation had become very tight, with job vacancies well above the number of registered applicants for work.

* Inside, they had seen about SO men and **women** and about 15 children around a TV screen on which they could see a girl dancing.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Postmaster-General's Department since 2 December 1972?

* Perhaps worst of all, his open support of the very small lawless group on the Gazelle Peninsula was quite insane and stupid if one realises how near this policy came to creating very serious trouble, possibly even the massacre of **women** and children.

* There has been the social impact of injury to the dignity of men, **women** and children.

* Many work long hours and are dedicated men and **women**.

* Indeed, the Liberal and Country Parties during their previous administration introduced many individual training schemes- for married **women**, Aborigines and other specially disadvantaged people in the community.

* Those with 2 dependants or more - 
In addressing itself to the provision of educational facilities and services it will examine amongst other things the overall pattern of institutions and courses including their objectives, the magnitude of the provision including the desirable balance between sectors, the relationship of educational provision to community and individual needs and preferences, the accessibility of education and training including reentry and transferability, the problems of special groups, for example, the handicapped, ethnic groups, Aboriginals and **women**, the responsibility of State and Commonwealth authorities in relation to the nature and location of institutions, preparation for employment including skilled and semi-skilled groups, the provision of recurrent education and the means of evaluating the quality and efficiency of the system.

* It is designed to put fear into the hearts of men and **women** who do not fully understand the facts.

* I believe it is nonsense that at this stage in a country such as Australia, in a community which in the past has always established fairly advanced attitudes on what representation means - votes for **women** and so on - we are being more conservative than most other countries.

* The evening courses, which are used more by migrant **women** otherwise engaged during the day and by migrant workers who have completed a normal working day, provide instruction only for 120 hours as it has been found that interest in the evening courses tends to wane more quickly.

* But it has been a good administration and the public servants are, in the main, men and **women** dedicated to the job that they are doing.

* The Minister is on record as having recently referred to **women** in the work force as being insignificant.

* There is a general reluctance tor **women** to seek the care provided by facilities on missions and settlements.

* He will remember that two days ago, first the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security and then the Prime Minister himself, said that the Minister would be having some discussions with the National Labour Consultative Council before the Minister for Social Security made her statement on proposals that special benefit or unemployment benefit payments should not be made to persons who have been refused work by employers because of electricity restrictions, and other proposals that unemployment benefit should not be paid to young men and **women** who leave school this year before schools resume next year.

* Many thousands of young people, married **women**, and men approaching retiring age have simply dropped out of the labour force.

* These figures are testimony to the 
Yesterday the Minister for the Interior opposed my motion to suspend Standing Orders so that we could debate the vote for 18-year-olds - a right given to men and **women** in most comparable countries.

* It will result in a substantial reduction not just in wages but also in the living standards of families, of men and **women** and of their children.

* The Convention stipulates that maternity benefits (cash and medical) are to be provided either by means of compulsory social insurance or by means of public funds and that in no case shall the employer be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.

* .10 in the Women and Work series published by the Women 's Bureau of my Department, a copy of which is available in the Parliamentary Library and which sets out in detail how Australian law and practice fall short of the standards contained in Convention No.

* Is it a fact that this decision was arrived at despite the fact that evidence shows that declining markets in Australia for Australian man-made **women** fabrics is caused mainly by competition from knitted products rather than imported woven products?

* Is he aware that because of the growing proportion of the work force who are **women** - 40 per cent within this decade - 60 per cent of whom are married, a trend will emerge where the average home will be supported by 2 pay packets?

* Are **women** precluded from employment in the Services in any activities other than those directly involving combat or sea-going duties; if so, what employment categories are closed to them.

* This is no more than it should be when one remembers that the TPI rate is paid only to men or **women** who are totally and permanently incapacitated as the result of a condition which has been accepted as having resulted from a war injury or a condition due to war service.

* Within 5 months this very capable body, this dedicated body of men and **women**, produced this report.

* What are the specific statistical bases for the Government's planned immigration policy in the light of (a) the inadequacy of current Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force surveys in terms of identifying (i) the extent of unemployment at State levels by age, (ii) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, and (iii) the incidence of unemployment among specific ethnic groups and (b) the inadequacy of current Commonwealth Employment Service registration figures in terms of identifying (i) the incidence of unemployment by level of skill and semi-skill in specific industries, (ii) the nonregistration of married **women** with working husbands, and (iii) the arbitrary accreditation in Australia of qualifications gained overseas by job applicants.

* The honourable member for Denison supported me in the call to have an inquiry into the **women**'s centres in Hobart.

* There is no equal pay for **women**.

* This particular demonstration, probably the first on campus by conservative students, was very mild and many witnesses, including many **women**, testified to this at the hearing.

* The recent hearing was told of much damage done to University and Guild property by the **women**.

* For example, a large section of stonework in the adjacent car park had to be repaired and resurfaced after a huge **women**'s slogan had been painted there that night.

* No charges were laid and no inquiry was held into this damage, albeit extensive, to which the **women** admitted.

* Three of those charged wrote articles for the magazine to which both the **women** and the University authorities took exception.

* 1 ) What was the cost of compiling the directory of support services available to **women** in Australia.

* 105 in which I asked how many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Department of the Media since 2 December 1972, is it a fact that the answer to question No.

* 97 to which the Minister referred me does not indicate how many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Department of the Media.

* Does the Minister know how many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department.

* This is a society where machines have more importance and are given greater significance than men and **women** who operate them, where material possessions are the very criteria of success, where job satisfaction and purpose of life have come to be regarded as almost irrelevant and certainly ignored by previous governments, and where peace of mind and harmonious living are matters which have been replaced by disharmony, discord and division.

* The sustenance payment made to men and **women** who lost their jobs as a result of the Government's tariff policy was often delayed for three or four months and this caused considerable hardship.

* Do not honourable members opposite realise that special arrangements exist for rosters on the basis that men and **women** who work at Redfern get special entitlements?

* This is a very important piece of progress, not only for ex-servicemen in general, ut also for **women** in particular.

* That in one State of Australia 40 per cent of pregnancies of **women** aged between 15 and 19 years resulted in abortion, providing a ratio of one abortion for every 1 .5 births, again is a matter of shame.

* For example, there are still no **women**.

* As well, the Department contributes generally to the implementation of Recommendation 43- special problems of migrant **women**.

* This brings me to the most important achievement to which I think  Mr Bridgman  can lay claim- the introduction of **women** into the parliamentary reporting staff.

* I tried very hard to persuade  Mr Campbell,  who was the Principal Parliamentary Reporter when the honourable member for Mackellar and I first came to the Parliament, to do exactly that but he said that he just could not do it; it was not the place for **women**.

* As well, there were difficulties about ladies' toilets which apparently presented some enormous problem that made it impossible to employ **women** in this job.

* Women have introduced into this Parliament an element of refinement which we needed badly.

* It seems that we have not got into the habit of allowing **women** to be elected to the Parliament as members but it is very nice indeed that we do have **women** taking the shorthand.

* I have compared the reporting of the lady reporters with the reporting of men- I have made a note of this because it has been my aim in life to overcome the discrimination against **women** which has been characteristic of the human race down through the centuries- and I am bound to say that the **women** reporters in this House are on the whole better than the men.

* I was one who at a very early age recognised the value of **women**.

* I was the first Minister to appoint **women** to the Federal judiciary; the first Minister to appoint a woman as an arbitration commissioner I appointed two of them- and the first to insist upon the appointment of a female first assistant secretary.

* So I have something in common with  Mr Bridgman  in my love for **women**.

* Ms Elizabeth Reid, my Adviser on Women's Affairs, was informed on the day itself in Washington at approximately 3.45 p.m. (local time) by the Australian Ambassador-designate at a meeting with  Mrs Nixon  at the White House.

* Those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, or who have served in a theatre of war and are over 60 years of age in the case of men or 55 years of age in the case of **women**, or permanently unemployable, qualify for a service pension if they satisfy the existing means test.

* As we become more sensitive to the creative nature of men - and **women** - we can expect more support for these particular areas of instruction in the technical colleges.

* Women are more economically independent, therefore they no longer have to tolerate the situations to which the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  referred.

* I had also put a question on notice about the training scheme for married **women**.

* The honourable gentleman and members of the Opposition Party have always shown a sense of hostility towards men and **women** on the land.

* Based on average weekly earnings of about $200 a week, working men and **women** in Australia are now $ 10 a week worse off in real terms than they would have been two years ago.

* The proposal is for the construction of new permanent living, working and recreational facilities to accommodate: The Army Apprentices School at present located in sub-standard accommodation at Balcombe, Victoria; the School of Military Survey presently located in temporary accommodation at Bonegilla, Victoria; and recruit training for the Women's Royal Australian Army Corp, presently in temporary accommodation at George's Heights, Sydney, New South Wales.

* I do not believe that it is the wish of ordinary men and **women** that special power given in relation to narcotics should be broadened to deal with matters involving SP bookmaking, drunken driving - 
I draw the attention of the House to a recent rescue operation that has now become known as the mission to Entebbe.

* I have not the slightest doubt that, but for them, innocent men and **women** would have been slaughtered in the cause of political fanaticism.

* They will have to be men or **women** with a great breadth of experience and understanding.

* For example, I refer to the increase in the number of **women** in the work force.

* Population-based incidence data, from Queensland, giving the incidence rate per unit area of skin, shows significant excess melanomas on the generally or occasionally exposed sites of the face, leg, neck and arm in **women** and of the face, ear, neck and back in men.

* It will be of great benefit to the city of Launceston and to the men and **women** who in future will sail our ships and be involved in the College.

* I understand that Tasmania has proposed that the Commonwealth cost-share the operating costs of the new Queen Alexandra Women's Hospital in Hobart, which will operate from 1 January 1980.

* It may reach the stage where one would think that the rape of the Sabine **women** was a veritable Sunday school picnic compared with what the coalition Government has done to the States.

* I believe that what I say would be supported by men and **women** everywhere who believe in human rights.

* Can we and the Australian nation ignore reports of mass executions including 2,000 at Lamaknan; 27 **women** both Chinese and Timorese on the wharf at Dili; 59 men on that same wharf in front of a crowd of 500 which was ordered to count; the murders at the Catholic Church of San Antonio in Dili; the execution of Chinese community leaders in the shop Toko Lay; the murder of a group of Timorese who dared to display an Australian flag from the third floor of a Dili building; the mass murders in the Taibesse area; the slaughter of 500 Chinese at Villaverde; reports of looting of Catholic churches; rounding up truckloads of young girls who were then subjected to mass rape; the desecration of the grave of Father Martins in Maliana; and last but not least, the vile and brutal murder on Thursday 16 October 1975 of five Australian newsmen, three of them shot in cold blood by an officer whose real name or war name was Lieutenant Markos.

* If the figures concerning wage and salary earners were related to the fact that the great percentage of them are married, it would be realised that 300,000 to 400,000 men, **women** and children will be on the dole within the new few months, yet the Government refuses to do anything about it.

* No Government supporter, certainly not the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who is now lounging back in his seat and wearing a pale pink tie, has suggested increasing the amount of weekly payment to those men, **women** and children who will be out of work and idle as a result of the Government's inattention, inactivity and almost stupidity.

* Married **women** now constitute a much bigger section of the work force than ever before.

* But some evidence seems to indicate that younger workers, older workers and **women** tend to prefer shorter hours to additional incomes.

* Coupled with the number of trained married **women** already avail1 able in the labour force, many employers are hesitant to employ on such high wages young people with little work experience.

* It asserts secondly, and I believe quite rightly, that a firm commitment was made by this nation to ali men and **women** who went to serve in the nation's defence.

* I know of cases in which decent **women** whose marriages have broken up have approached a legal officer and he has said: Go away and get a bit more money and we will start.'

* It is a matter of considerable pride when one sees in Australia men and **women** who came here straight after World War II with nothing but the clothes in which they arrived and who have now settled into our community and have become some of our leading citizens.

* How many **women** were there at the (a) second division level, (b) class 1 1 level, (c) class 6 level, and (d) fourth division level, in his Department as at 1 January 1978.

* Firstly, it says that **women** will not be able to choose their own doctor for confinements.

* Can he also say whether the Clinic extensively uses the drug HCG, Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, a hormone taken from pregnant **women** which specialists in obstetrics and gynaecology describe as useless.

* It must be realised that, as far as the female unemployed are concerned, these amounts of money that will be provided under the Bills that we are discussing will do very little, if anything, towards relieving any unemployment that the girls and **women** find themselves in today.

* One of the reasons for the disharmony is that the men and **women** of the work force are not catching up with prices.

* I leave aside some of the contentious recommendations and ask the Prime Minister: What action does the Government propose to take on some of the recommendations which would be deemed to be worthwhile and non-contentious, such as those concerning child abuse, discrimination against **women**, migrants, the handicapped, adoption and a national family policy?

* Who claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack on Israel last month, murdering **women** and children?

* For anybody to suggest that the passage of this legislation will not have some long term impact on the general community attitude towards marriage and on the general community attitude towards relationships between men and **women** within marriage is, I think, to fail to understand the real impact of social legislation in our society.

* He advanced a very thoughtful examination of the changing relationship between men and **women**, not only in marriage but also in society.

* It is impossible to examine a divorce law in our present society without taking some note of the changing roles of men and **women** inside marriage.

* I have believed for a long time that the changes that have occurred in the status of **women** in our society have been a considerable advance.

* There is no doubt that a generation ago many **women** faced overwhelming social pressure to conform to the traditional pattern of an exclusive mother and wife role within marriage.

* The time has now arrived when it is possible for **women** in our society to exercise more and more an effective choice as to the type of role they should adopt without in any way feeling that their role is any less or that they are under any social pressure to conform to a traditional role.

* I support any legislation- I think this is relevant to the Family Law Bill- which makes it possible for men and **women** in our society to exercise a complete choice as to the type of role they should adopt.

* The other half of the population includes  a  group of Aboriginal migrants, refugees from a countryside in depression, a large number of pensioners,  a  whole series of high rise developments which contain a majority of deserted wives and Service wives, **women** without husbands, and children without fathers.

* Even the comradeship of work is denied them because the man works here, the **women** works there, and by the time they meet it is to get some rest for the next day's grind.

* They will be available to men and **women** for the acquisition or erection of homes and for extensions to existing homes.

* If the honourable gentleman in his new wish to find approval from the **women** of this country asks them what they regard as being the very critical issue he will find that they regard inflation as one of the greatest problems we have to face - one which the Government is facing but with very little or no help from the Opposition.

* Instructions have been given for the drafting of formal amendments to the Married Women's Property Act 1901 of New South Wales as it applies in the Australian Capital Territory.

* If honourable members look at the Bill they will see that it covers everything from rubber coated garments, men's suits and clothing, **women**'s dresses, underwear, boys and girls' clothing and babies napkins.

* These , young men and **women**, totally preoccupied with working, building a home and establishing a family, have not the opportunity to organise themselves into yet another pressure group to petition, demonstrate or lobby.

* married, (b) single and (c) all **women** in (i) each State and Territory and (ii) the Commonwealth who (A) applied for training in the employment training scheme to assist married and single **women**, (B) were accepted, (C) were rejected, (D) commenced training, (E) completed training and (F) were placed in employment by the end of February 1972 or at the latest date for which figures are readily available.

* single and (c) all **women** in (f) each State and Territory and (ii) the Commonwealth had had partial or full (A) professional training (B) commercial/clerical training, (C) craft or trade training and  CD)  training of any other kind, specifying details.

* What were the numbers and percentages of the single adult **women** accepted for training in 
each State and Territory and (b) the Commonwealth who were (i) single **women** over 21 years of age, (IQ widows, (iii) divorcees, 'iv) single mothers,  (v)  deserted wives, (vi) **women** with husbands in mental institutions, (vii) **women** with husbands in penal institutions and (viii) others, specifying categories and numbers involved.

* single and (c) all **women** accepted for training in the- Commonwealth had (i) no dependent children, (ii) one child, (iii) two, (iv) three, (v) four and (vi) five or more dependent children at the time of being accepted.

* What number and percentage of **women** in the Commonwealth referred to in part (6) were in receipt of Commonwealth pensions.

* married, (b) single and (c) all **women** accepted for training in the Commonwealth who were (i) less than 30, (ii) less than 40, (iii) less than SO, (iv) less than 60 and (v) over 60 years of age, and what was the average age.

* What numbers and percentages of (a) married, (b) single and (c) all **women** accepted for training in (i) each State and Territory and (ii) the Commonwealth were living in (A) metropolitan and (B) non-metropolitan areas.

* What numbers and percentages of (a) married, (b) single and (c) all **women** accepted have been given training for (i) up to 3 months, (ii) up to 6 months, (iii) up to 12 months and (Iv) up to 2 years in (A) correspondence courses, (B) parttime, (C) full-time courses of study of educational or training institutions or  CD)  on-the-job training programmes with approved employers.

* What numbers and percentages of (a) married, (b) single and (c) all **women** accepted have been granted (i) the weekly maintenance allowance, (ii) the allowance for dependent children, (iii) payment for fees, fares, postage, essential books, equipment and other associated costs, (iv) the full-time allowance of $4 per week and (v) the $5 per week living-away-from-home allowance.

* What sum has been paid by the Commonwealth to employers as reimbursement for onthejob training **women**.

* What are the categories of employment for which **women** have been trained under the scheme, and what numbers and percentages of **women** have been trained for each category.

* I hope that the vigorous attempt to throw up a smokescreen about revaluation does not mean abandoning good men and **women** for political expediency.

* It will be receiving its share under the Community Health Program of the $lm additional money that was set aside for the funding of **women**'s refuges in that State.

* I acknowledge that the Brownies and the Girl Guides are doing a tremendous job in building up morale among young **women** in this community and I would not like to see the direction of their policy in the hands of the Deputy Prime Minister because he has already lost more soldiers, sailors and airmen as well as equipment in this short time than it would have been possible to imagine  1  months ago.

* Women had to sell their children, the new born babies, in the street by the pound.

* At .this time when so many married **women** are working and are being persuaded to work - and in many cases are compelled to work - a provision such as this would be of great assistance.

* The Tariff Board is trying to destroy the employment of men and **women** in my electorate.

* I make reference to one specific area, namely, migrant **women** in the work force.

* People, men and **women**, young and not so young, in the honourable gentleman's electorate have had their opportunities in life very much augmented because of the growth of Canberra.

* They involve the electoral officer for the Division of Lilley in 1972; they involve a woman in that electoral office- and there are so few **women** in that electoral office that the woman referred to can almost be identified as one person; and they certainly involve me.

* I will not go through the whole letter, but this part is worth recording: 
-The wizardry of the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  in economics is well known to the mounting number of Australians unemployed, to small business men and business **women** ravaged by accelerating inflation and mounting bankruptcies, to the great rural sector whose desperate plight is well known, to those who are on fixed incomes, the superannuitants of Australia, to those many people who are today being destroyed and will remain destroyed until they die, if this Government remains in office.

* He gave hope to a generation of Australian men and **women**.

* I do not think that in any school, even in the schools in my electorate, of which I am very proud, I have ever met a body of more dedicated men and **women** who want to help the children of whom they are given charge.

* The town of Cootamundra has a population including **women** and children of about 6,500 people.

* We see 700 or 800 people bedecked in the most glamorous gowns, with hairdos costing $10, $15 or $20 - for the **women** that is - and thousands of dollars spent on alcohol during the evening, lt is an extravaganza.

* Praise must be given to our researchersdedicated men and **women**.

* Whilst it is fair to say that the Budget is good for pensioners, ex-service men and **women**, Aboriginals, wage earners and business, above all it is especially good for Tasmania.

* In fact, for the first 8 months of the present financial year, notwithstanding that a great number of men and **women** have been unemployed in this country, there has been a greater inflow of iron and steel than there was in the comparable 8 month period in 1971.

* Of the couples whose grants were approved during 1977-78, the men were most commonly in the 26-30 years age group, and the **women** in the 21-25 years age group.

* The necessary statistical information required to make a precise assessment of the cost of the introduction of 6 weeks maternity leave on full pay for all female wage and salary earners is not available, one of the main deficiencies being a lack of data on the number of **women** who leave the labour force in any one year because of pregnancy.

* 1 received today a copy of a letter sent on 27 May by one of the Aboriginal **women** to whom I was introduced at Nowa Nowa to a friend in my electorate.

* But we are here not to determine the fate of individual men or **women**; we are here to set the laws of this land.

* I wonder whether the **women**'s liberation group might think of doing something along these lines.

* As I said during the earlier part of my speech, I think that the crunch will come in the next triennium, when we see just what this financial assistance has done for these tertiary institutions and how they will respond to the stimulus that they are given, because respond they must in the submissions that they make for the next triennium and in the variety of courses and the variety of facilities which they will make available and which will allow young men and **women** to cope with the needs of modern day life.

* Many of us can think back to the experience of sevicemen who returned to tertiary education after the Second World War and can recall how infinitely greater was the advantage that those men and **women** took of their university places at the more mature age at which they were able to take them up.

* Such assistance to the nonEnglish speaking migrant is extremely vital, particularly as it applies to migrant **women** who are isolated in their homes.

* Our athletes, our sportsmen and **women**, performed most creditably in the recent Commonwealth Games.

* The bumble Petition of the undersigned members of the Country Women's Association in Tasmania respectfully sheweth: 
The 1975 Budget recognised the need to maintain government spending to provide the Australian community with the basic amenities of a civilised and industrialised society- adequate health and educational facilities, sewerage and housing opportunities.

* It also recognised the national government's responsibilities on behalf of the Australian people to support the disadvantaged within our society, the aged, infirm, the **women**, Aborigines, the poor and the dispossessed.

* The Commonwealth can help the States provide proper career opportunities for the men and **women** in their law enforcement services; it can help the States provide the highly extensive, and expensive, communications and computer techniques and equipment needed by modern law enforcement services as the Federal Administration already does in the United States.

* Almost 42 per cent of applications for widow's pension from **women** who claim tobe deserted wives are not approved.

* It is significant that until men and **women** are suffering the Government does not bother about unemployment relief.

* In March of that same year a group of **women** met to establish the then Brisbane Creche and kindergarten Association which, over the years, has grown to its present size.

* Despite the fact that on the box containing the article it was stated quite clearly 'this article is not- ( 1 ) to be sold to a person under the age of 18 years; (2) to be demonstrated in public; (3) to be sold through the post as a mail order item or to a person who has not first had an opportunity to inspect it fully,' two of these were sold by **women** members of the staff at the store- one to an 1 1-year old boy and another to a 12-year old boy.

* I think it would be a most unfortunate day for this Parliament if we ever passed legislation which put a thrust into the law to break down the traditional role that **women** have played in our community.

* Did the Opposition want to put fear into the men and **women** in our defence forces so that they would believe that their salaries, their allowances and other expenditure would not be made available to them?

* The provision of finances by governments to assist in providing international competition and technical expertise is simply the provision of a fair go for Australian sportsmen and sports **women**.

* That was done because of authoritative advice received by the Federal Department of Health that duogynon could have serious side effects if administered to pregnant **women**.

* There is no necessity for **women** to be paid the same amount as men doing the same work.

* I share the view that was expressed by other speakers, that the Minister has made a wise decision in choosing to name the new seat Tangney, because it will honour the first **women**'s representative in this Parliament.

* Mr Knowles,  and the many public spirited men and **women** who have formed terminating building societies, can rest assured that the Commonwealth Government will continue to ensure that they' have access to funds through the home builders account.

* The organisations designated as accredited welfare organisations are the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Campaigners for Christ and the Australian Forces Overseas Fund.

* The Government which he supported, under its scale of priorities, had millions of dollars to spend on killing innocent **women** and children and young Australians in a political war but it did not have any funds at all for national sewerage programs, for housing programs, for cities, for highways or for regional groupings.

* There are many very able men and **women** in the Northern Territory who can assist vitally in the build up of the Territory to statehood.

* This Government will have to give an indication to the working men and **women** in Australia what lies in front of them by way of taxation, what lies in front of them as regards improved working conditions, higher pay, better health, educational and other services.

* I checked the statistics for my area and surprisingly for the Government I found they represented people- men and **women**, young and not so young, able, capable and willing to work and unable to find it.

* As the Department holds almost one million sets of personal case records pertaining to ex-servicemen and **women** who served in the 1939-45 war it would not be practicable to search for the required information.

* It is providing employment for approximately 6,600 men and **women**, very highly skilled people, who cannot be replaced overnight.

* Although some honourable members might not agree with what I am saying, I believe that on that day we should pay tribute to the men and **women** of our fighting forces to whom we owe our freedom.

* The Employment Training Scheme for Aborigines; The Country Apprenticeship Scheme; The Permanent Forces PostDischarge Training Scheme; The Employment Training Scheme for Married Women PreviouslyRestricted from Employment by Domestic Responsibilities; The Employment Training Scheme for Persons Displaced by Technological Change; The Rural Reconstruction Employment Training Scheme; The National Service Vocational Training Scheme, administered in conjunction with the Departments of Education and Science and Primary Industry for the Repatriation Department; The Disabled Members and War Widows' Training Scheme, administered in conjunction with the Repatriation Department 
In relation to the matters that have been raised in this debate, I hope that every one of us has a deep belief in the sanctity of life.

* Then again, the rights of **women** are involved.

* I hope that none of us would readily say that the rights of **women** should not be taken into account.

* One hears stories that **women** more or less rush in to a surgery, hop up on the table and that is the end of it.

* I think those of us who know of **women** or young girls who might have wanted to lose a child will understand the trauma of those occasions.

* We know they are not just simple occasions and that **women** do not do the sort of thing that some people imagine to be done on the spur of the moment.

* This place does not have a woman member but that does not mean that we do not discuss matters relating to **women**.

* We must take into account the effect of this motion on **women**.

* Yet different lines will be drawn by different men and **women** of principle.

* As an honest and conscientious legislator I have to say that although I embrace the Menhennitt ruling, although I am against abortion, and although I understand the sanctity of the foetus, the rights of **women** and the social implications of abortion, I cannot in conscience support the motion.

* The Government received representations that an exception from the 10-year rule should also be made for short term endowment policies that are taken out independently of superannuation funds by people who are within 10 years of the common retiring ages of 65 years for men and 60 years for **women**.

* We will look at retirement benefits as reported to us by the commission appointed to fulfil this task and we will increase the role of **women**.

* Lack of proper training is the only thing that compels  42,860  Australian men and **women** to remain unemployed.

* The emphasis behind the Bill seems to suggest that most **women** in the community wish to be in the work force.

* It is because in a consumer society such as this, faced in particular with a very high inflation rate, the need for more **women** to enter the work force to try to make ends meet is growing year by year.

* In addition to that we must take into account the fact that **women** have a much higher standard of education than they were given previously, which is excellent.

* When **women** are educated they have every right to fulfil their expectations during their lifetimes.

* Despite these factors married **women** comprise only 22 per cent of the total work force at present and 70.8 per cent of those are of child-bearing age, which I take to be between 15 and 44 years.

* Thus the majority of **women** in the child-bearing category still remain at home and receive little assistance in bringing up young children.

* There is still a real need which has not been covered adequately in my opinion in this legislation to establish again at local government level sufficient facilities so that all **women** and all single parents, including men, are given the opportunity to put their children into adequate day care centres even if only for a short time so that the mother or the father may, for instance, go to the dentist.

* Why have these **women** and men thrown in the towel?

* They are people with the hopes, aspirations, satisfactions, fears and uncertainties of men and **women** everywhere.

* All this is done while the Government espouses, as the Governor-General stated in his Speech, its fundamental belief that a better society can be realised only by giving the men and **women** of Australia a greater measure of 'choice, power and freedom'.

* That was what Whitlam was arguing all through those agonising days in October and November after the 'men in black', and their much-bedizened **women**, went into their huddle at the Lakeside Hotel and answered, for themselves, Lenin's great question for any seekers of power.

* The increasing number of twoincome families makes it imperative that we decide whether **women** with family responsibilities should be able, if they so wish, to remain within the home to bring up their children.

* These policies must ensure that the standard of living of a family with children and a single income does not compare unfavourably with that of twoincome families and of single men and **women**.

* Fair social security and tax systems will enable those **women** who feel forced to work to stay at home.

* But such systems should not force those **women** who want to work to stay at home.

* They are more and more trying to lobby for such things as child minding centres for **women** workers and so on.

* But when it was up to Australia Post's own graphic arts department, with pictures chosen from the Library of the  Australian Women's Weekly,  that was the standard that we achieved.

* 1 would ask that the Prime Minister should use another form of communication by himself to the 6 State Premiers asking them to expedite the legislation which all of them have promised to give votes and adult rights to men and **women** at.

* The only prison where age does not seem to have a significant criterion is  Bukit  Duri **women**'s prison in Jakarta where the releases included a young woman of 30 who would have been a teenager at the time of her arrest.

* For the information of honourable members I present a report by the National Women's Advisory Council entitled 'Migrant Women Speak'.

* The report sets out a series of recommendations based on the views of migrant **women** themselves.

* I hope that the report will promote a discussion of the needs of migrant **women**, and I know it will be a valuable resource for the Government concerning our implementation of the Galbally report and our efforts to assist migrant **women**.

* But I am concerned about the **women** whose long term mental health is at risk because of an unwanted or traumatic pregnancy, whose pregnancy arises as a result of rape or incest, whose foetus is doomed to tragic abnormality.

* 'We were mostly the old, **women** and children.

* The same weakness appears to lie in the assertion by certain **women**'s groups that it is, in their words, the basic right of every woman to control her own body.

* At the end of the day these arguments of the quality of life for both parents and children and the rights of **women** have to be weighed on the scales against the principle of the right of human beings to be born, provided the safety of the mother's life is not at issue.

* If we as a community believe that our society would be a better and more humane society with fewer abortions, and regardless of how we as individuals vote on the motion before us today, we must as a community take increased steps to lessen the number of situations arising where abortions are contemplated by the **women** concerned.

* Women not only now receive equal pay for equal work but also, for the first time ever, in September of next year will reach the point where the minimum wage, which was previously confined to men, will be applied to them as well.

* -Next weekend in the Kings Hall I will have the pleasure of opening the Women and Politics conference which will be proceeding during the following week in Canberra.

* This will be the second of 3 very large conferences being conducted by Australia in the course of International Women's Year.

* This week at the University of Queensland there is one on Women and Health.

* In a couple of months there will be another conference- the third one- Women, the Media and the Arts.

* This conference in Canberra- Women and Politics- will be attended by over 600 **women**.

* They will be drawn from all over Australia and they will include **women** from political parties, **women**'s organisations and groups as well as many individual **women** who have indicated no particular party or group affiliation.

* Information concerning the conference was sent to over 7000 individuals and groups, including **women**'s organisations, political parties, trade unions and members of Parliament.

* There are **women** in this Parliament belonging to the Australian Labor Party and to the Liberal Party but not, of course, to the National Country Party.

* Many individuals, including trade unionists, politicians, local government personnel, journalists, academics, ministerial staff and **women** workers have been approached or nominated by their organisations to read papers, to lead discussions or to participate in any other way in the program.

* A range of organisations has been approached, including the Women's Electoral Lobby, the League of Women Voters, the Right to Life Association and the National Council of Women.

* I ask: How many young men and **women** say that they regretted their time in the Services?

* I am sure that if such a universal scheme were implemented we would have no shortage of keen and partly trained men and **women** to meet the requirements of our armed forces as well as having many others left over who could make an impact on the world, especially the South East Asian region.

* There are pregnant **women** and unemployed persons involved.

* Washing machines, tiled bathrooms, electric ranges and all the other amenities which **women** did not enjoy previously are now provided in homes.

* For example, prior to the period 1973-74 the British Committee brought down reports on public expenditure and economic management, the relationships of expenditure to needs, the revision of the form of Supply estimates, public money in the private sector, youth employment services, employment of **women**, employment services and training, diplomatic staff and overseas accommodation, various aspects of defence expenditure, the British Council and further and higher education.

* The proposal involves construction of an officers mess and sleeping quarters, a senior non-commissioned officers mess and sleeping quarters, Women's Royal Australian Air Force sleeping quarters, airmen's sleeping quarters, and airmen's mess and recreation centre, a barracks group comprising workshop, stores, offices and garages, a gate control building, and associated engineering services, roads and footpaths, car parking and sporting facilities.

* He reminded me of all the campaigns in history and of all the occasions on which people have opposed every attempt to change any social situation- from putting the Plimsoll line on ships to the 40-hour week, to giving people the vote at 21, to giving **women** the vote at all and to the roads of ruin of which politics are always so full.

* In addition, the Minister is negotiating with the States to appoint an inquiry into teacher training because what happens in the final years at school is very important to the capacity of young men and **women** to take a useful and productive place within the Australian community.

* The men and **women** who will seek election at that time time for the purpose of trying to help in the development of the Northern Territory will want to know the answer to this practical question: Where will responsibilities lie.

* This provision relating to a very small number of national servicemen is in my opinion an insult to nearly 1 million ex-service men and **women** who enlisted for service anywhere.

* Those who qualify for special benefits, and will receive the increased rate as soon as this Bill is passed, include some **women** caring for invalid parents or near relatives, some migrants not residentially qualified for normal pensions, and certain unmarried mothers.

* With men, **women** and children, and about 40,000 unnaturalised migrants, I have problems.

* I ask: Has the Government decided to take any special steps to deal with this situation which is so discouraging to these young men and **women** and so burdensome to their parents on whom they are still dependent?

* We on this side of the Committee are concerned at the great problem that the payment of death duties causes to small families, particularly to **women** who unfortunately through a sudden death find themselves widowed and left to shoulder the burden of rearing a young family.

* Lastly there was the Prime Minister - Women and Children Last Whitlam.

* He started off by addressing the ' men and **women** of Australia'.

* The change from the extended biological family we had in the past to the more fragile nuclear family, the increase in the breadth of education for **women** in our society and the changing rate of opportunities for **women** have all made marriage a more stressful situation.

* I understand that in fact under sections 4, 8 and 9 of the Victorian Maintenance Act of 1965 **women** are liable already to maintain themselves, their children and their husbands under certain conditions.

* Many lawyers with whom I have discussed the Family Law Bill are of the opinion that it is completely fair to **women** and amply protects their interests and those of the children 
It has been claimed that if it had not been for the Aborigines during the early days when the white man was hugging the coast of Australia the white man never would have left the coast.

* Many of them took Aboriginal **women** as their wives or companions.

* 1506 on equal pay for Service men and **women** appearing on page 1700 again is credited as having been asked by  Mr Les  Johnson.

* Thousands more are not registered: Women, juniors, executives, salesmen, typists, clerks have yet to register.

* We do know that throughout Australia young men and **women** have already begun leaving schools and universities and are now coming onto the labour market Those young people will have their careers cut off before they begin.

* There were 2 1 ,000 of those young **women**.

* I have no intention of quoting at great length but I want to draw the attention of the House to 2 parts of the book which refer to a former member of the Women's Australian Auxiliary Air Force.

* He put it that the former Government had been very concerned to assist **women** in employment in respect of their training and child care.

* This Bill represents a significant step towards the removal of a very grave aspect of discrimination against **women** in employment.

* Mir RIORDAN- I will come to the question of domestic working **women**.

* It was hoped during their period of office in this Parliament of some 23 years, a full generation, the friends of the honourable member may have shown some concern for domestic work ing **women** and may have taken some economic steps which would have avoided the necessity for so many of our **women** to be in employment today.

* The ILO Convention is designed to overcome discrimination against married **women** in employment who have families, and this legislation certainly does that.

* We should have regard to the fact that **women** workers are playing an increasingly significant role in the Australian economy.

* The result is that one-third of all married **women** are now included in the national labour force.

* Married **women** now represent a far greater proportion of the female work force.

* In 1933 only 5.4 per cent of **women** workers in Australia were married.

* I say without hesitation, for my own part that these young **women** need protection, sympathy and encouragement and they deserve to be assisted back into employment after the period of their confinement.

* We also must recognise and take account of the fact that there are more than half a million married **women** in employment whose ages are between 25 and 44 years.

* As the average marrying age has decreased from 25.5 years in 1948 to 21.4 in 1971, it can be seen from an examination of available statistics that the great majority of married **women** return to employment to supplement the family income.

* If married **women** were forced to abandon employment for whatever reason the capacity of Australian industry and commerce would be shattered.

* The Australian economy at the present time is dependent on large numbers of married **women** being in active employment.

* The results showed that 91,500 **women** with children under 6 years of age said that they would work if suitable child minding facilities were available.

* The concept of this Bill is to provide fair greater equality of opportunity for **women**.

* It will allow young **women** to have their children and return to employment either to pursue a career or to provide funds for the purchase of a house or some other necessity of life.

* I for one would have been much more impressed with the criticism of the cost of this legislation if some attempt had been made at least to acknowledge that the cost to Australian industry of training new employees when married **women** leave employoment is enormous and is an enormous strain on government expenditure in the Commonwealth Public Service.

* Women workers returning to employment after absence on maternity leave need virtually no additional training in order to recommence employment.

* They are backed by officers in both departments who are dedicated to their jobs, and I pay tribute to the men and **women** in those 2 departments.

* The newsletter quotes an estimate made by the Royal College of Physicians that there is an annual death toll in Great Britain of 27,500 men and **women**, aged 35-65, from the 'burning of tobacco', which figure is considerably less than the overall figure given by the Chief Medical Officer of Health,  Sir George  Godber, of 100,000 deaths annually.

* There had been too much neglect, too much moralising, stigmatisation and discrimination against these **women**, and too much of that was to the disadvantage of the innocent infants who were their offspring.

* There would be few honest men in this Parliament who could not enumerate great numbers of incidents where **women** in this category had come into their offices and detailed not only the harrowing circumstances under which they tried to make ends meet and raise their children but also the problems of maintaining equipoise with their personality, maintaining their self-respect, maintaining their sanity in the light of the discrimination that existed in the past.

* Frankly, all of these people are under threat because of statements which have been made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  who for some reason seems to feel that these **women** will be strengthened and their moral fibre will be enhanced if in some way the benefit is attenuated or perhaps even destroyed.

* The Labor Government provided free medical and hospital treatment for malignant cancer suffered by all ex-servicemen and **women**.

* For the first time repatriation benefits were extended to servicemen and **women** in the peace-time services.

* As the honourable gentleman probably knows we have long standing arrangements with various organisations such as the Young Women's Christian Association, the Salvation Army and the Travellers' Aid Society, to cater for the initial accommodation of single girls coming to Australia, to counsel them, look after them and ease their early settlement problems.

* What have the Japanese people, who perpetrated such dreadful atrocities on Australian servicemen and **women** and on the natives of New Guinea, done since World War II to deserve the sort of preferential treatment which they are now receiving from Australia with the seeming support of Australian capitalistic monopolies.

* The purpose of the Employment Training Scheme for Women Previously Restricted from Employment by Domestic Responsibilities is to assist married **women** who wish to re-enter the workforce by providing them with the necessary vocational skills.

* Adult single **women** who have previously been unable to accept employment because of domestic responsibility are also assisted under the scheme.

* Statistics as at 31st March 1972 apply to all **women**.

* Statistics under (F) apply to those **women** who had responded to post-training questionnaires as at 30th March 1972: percentages shown refer to the percentage of respondents to those questionnaires who indicated that they had obtained employment.

* I think that the Opposition is drawing a long bow about the appointment of 2 **women** to the Commission.

* All we are simply saying is that we believe it is necessary and desirable- bearing in mind the social impact, the educational impact and the concern for children in society- that at least two of the 9 people be **women**.

* The Government regrets that the Labor Party should be opposed to the Government specifying that at least two out of 9 people on the Commission ought to be **women**.

* I think that the general promotion - and I would agree with my friend here - has been concentrated primarily on the big retail stores, on television and on the sophisticated **women**'s magazines.

* In this respect, I refer to a letter which I have received from a **women**'s organisation in the Goulburn Valley and which reads in part: 
What was the original justification for paying age pensions to **women** at 60 and men at 65.

* As there was a 5 per cent or greater informal vote at the last election, I ask the Ministers responsible for this matter to start now to teach not only Aborigines but also  young men  and **women** down to the age of 18, or as the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  suggested, down to the age of 14 years.

* I shall draw the attention of the Minister for Primary Industry to the question and ask him for a more detailed answer in relation to the actual number of men and **women** employed.

* It has no high school and parents must send their youngsters to Mount Isa to be boarded in the Country Women's Association hostel or with friends.

* She may be one of the heroic band of **women** and men who are prepared to put up with it, to bear it with cheerfulness to the outside world, but with inner deep, personal distress, Something may happen and she says: 'I can stand this no longer'.

* Did the  Deputy  Prime Minister express Government policy at the opening of the Labor Women's Federal Conference when he said, firstly, that life insurance has little or no logic in an affluent society and, secondly, that tax concessions for life insurance premiums had no logic?

* Some of the articles to which I have referred show the disability suffered by these **women** who are forced to work in industry.

* 1 refer the Minister for Labour and National Service to a reported joint study by the Australian Clothing Manufacturers Council and his Department of proposals for Commonwealth incentives to attract more married **women** into the clothing industry.

* The figures supplied by the Parliamentary Library show that 105,000 married **women** were employed in Queensland at 30 June 1971.

* We do face 2 problems: One is that of the unskilled worker and the other, to a lesser extent, is the problem of special categories of people, particularly young **women**, in country areas.

* We have changed the whole philosophy and righly so because we have enabled people who were previously discriminated against, men and **women** who have served their country well, to come within the provisions of the defence service homes scheme.

* That this House, viewing with grave concern the recent report of the correspondent of  Paris Match,  Denis Reichle, that at least 70,000 East Timorese have been killed by Indonesian occupying forces, and his further report that 30,000 Indonesian troops are continuing actions which involve further deaths of great numbers of men, **women** and children; and bearing in mind that the United Nations does not acknowledge Indonesian possession of East Timor and that the question is not an internal one for Indonesia, requests the Government: 
Scheme, the National Employment and Training Program, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth.

* It is a program that warrants full support and, to the extent that is necessary to help young men and **women** in that particular category, it is one that is being expanded.

* We are talking about people, about men **women** and children, about families living in rural towns and directly concerned with the profitability or otherwise, with the economic viability or otherwise, of this great industry which has sustained Australia for so many years.

* Included in the agreement was that the phasing-in of equal pay for **women** employed under the Commonwealth Hostels Award who were eligible for equal pay should be in accordance with the phasing-in arrangements set out in the Commission's Equal Pay decision of June '1969.

* Of course, they have a very great requirement for iron because they all suffer from iron deficiency - anaemia - and the **women** all have a baby every year, which means that they have an increased iron requirement, too.

* I demonstrated last night that the increase in incomes in Australia, particularly in wages, and for **women** still more than men, had been very much greater than the increase in prices.

* It is essential that we do all we can for those Service men and **women** and their backups in defence science and all the other ancillary departments which are necessary to keep our forces in the field.

* The rights of **women** are involved.

* Family men and **women** realise that this Budget disadvantages them greatly.

* I understand that since I received these figures 1000 men and **women** involved in only 4 industries have been sacked in the Bankstown area in the last fortnight.

* How many were (a) persons threatened with redundancy, (b) **women** returning to the workforce, (c) Aborigines, (d) students who had already begun a course and (e) blue collar workers.

* That means that millions of dollars of the most modern machinery and many men and **women** are idle.

* Government action must be taken to restore this efficient machinery and the men and **women** who operate it to full production.

* The honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  very rightly pointed out that the textile industry is one that can be decentralised and which provides labour opportunities, particularly for **women**, in country areas.

* The Commonwealth Practical Training Scheme was established by the Australian Government in March 1970 to enable Papua New Guinean men and **women** to develop their skills and so advance more rapidly to positions of greater responsibility.

* He advocated the bombing of **women** and children in the People's Republic of China, which was figthing for a new way of life.

* I should like to add the sympathy of the Government to the men, **women** and families in his electorate, particularly in such large cities as Lismore and Murwillumbah, who have now been stricken as were so many people further north a month and two months ago.

* Living in the town, the Aborigines feel there are unwarranted intrusions in that Europeans have interrupted ceremonies, entered their camps at night and even their dwellings, and molested **women** at times.

* The subsistence activities and the exchanges which arise from them are the basis of the **women**'s society, which is able to mitigate to some extent men's control of ritual life.

* Without the bush resources economy, as 
John Avery has called it, the position of **women** in the community would deteriorate, and the assimilation of local Aborigines to the position of wage labourers would be advanced at the cost of a breakdown of community life.

* In fact, when one examines the policies of the Government, it is obvious that its policies are as shallow as the shallow men and **women** who formulate them.

* My good friend  Senator James  McClelland summed up the wishful strategy of the Government's economic thinking when he said of the GovernorGeneral's Speech: 
That this House notes with regret the decision of the Mount Lyell Railway and Mining Co. Ltd to reduce production of copper concentrate at its Queenstown mines, and to close down the 'Crown' mines, the 'Lower West' mine and the 'Royal Tharsis' mine, and to retrench in 3 stages during December- January next 400 of the total work force of 1050 men and **women**.

* What percentage of (a) married **women** and (b) married **women** with children under the age of 5 are in the Australian workforce.

* Under the RED scheme there is a bias towards the unskilled, and little help is given to **women** or to white collar workers.

* Very few **women** have got jobs under that scheme.

* More **women** would have got jobs if the scheme had been administered directly as was the case in the past.

* How many class periods in government secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory during the year 1970 were conducted (a) by teachers without appropriate qualifications in the relevant subject, (b) with classes combined, (c) by casual teachers,(d) by part-time teachers, (e) by married **women** teachers and (f) by full-time permanent staff, showingthe answer in a tabulated form classifying forms 1 to 6 and by each major subject inthose forms.

* Quite recently, drinking has increased among Aboriginal **women** - probably, it is the first time that this has occurred in the Northern Territory on any large scale - and this has been correlated with the breakdown in tribal life and discipline.

* The unqualified acceptance by the Government of all the recommendations made by the Committee in relation to other ranks pay is a demonstration both of confidence in the Committee and the Government's determinnation to provide financial and other conditions of service sufficient to attract and retain men and **women** with the needed qualities, skills and experience for the Australian Forces.

* I present the following paper: 
West Germany **women** displaced from the clothing industry remain unemployed despite government assistance.

* I refer to the responsibility which government has towards the homeless men and **women** of our community.

* If it is not to be withdrawn from sale, will he see that the top of the container is clearly marked in red, as was recommended by  Dr McBride,  indicating that the drug is dangerous to pregnant **women**?

* How many were **women** returning to the workforce.

* Is it a fact that there was a substantial disparity between that sentence and the sentences passed recently on two American **women** for their part in the illegal importation of drugs into Australia?

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  spoke appropriately, graciously and warmly about all those men and **women**- hundreds of them- who work in this place.

* This arena, well or ill conducted as the members may be, would be a shell but for the men and **women** in their hundreds who work here less conspicuously throughout the year.

* I must make reference again to **women** of some 45 years of age who, if their children turn 16 years of age, are expected to work until they reach 50 years of age.

* I have discussed this matter with **women** who send their children to the kindergarten at Erskineville, to the Golden Fleece kindergarten at Chippendale, to the James Cahill kindergarten and to the Pyrmont-Ultimo kindergarten.

* As late as last Saturday I spoke to certain **women**, some with three or four children each.

* As I said to **women** last Saturday: 'All you have to do is to take your child into a kindergarten and sit in'.

* The cost of compiling a draft manuscript for a proposed booklet on support services available to **women** was almost entirely related to staff salaries and office expenses and involved, as well as staff time within the Department of Social Security, information contributions from officers of other Government departments and voluntary agencies.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Act 1 974 is administered by the Department of Social Security and makes available financial assistance to eligible organisations to provide temporary accommodation, meals and personal services for homeless men and **women**.

* I ask you,  Sir, why  she does not receive equal remuneration for her work of equal value to that of the male reporters, particularly since any **women** members of this House receive pay equal to that of male members.

* The young men and **women** who are here today will, I am sure, be able to contribute a tremendous amount to the growing friendship between our 2 great countries.

* It will give this country a reorganised CMF, which is not only attractive to the young men and **women** who wish to serve in it, but with the Regular Army will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future.

* Each financial year we must seek to replace those leaving our Defence Force with high quality young men and **women** to maintain it at the level set by the Government.

* There are men and **women** employed in these industries who have given a lifetime of service.

* I believe that we must always remember that laws are made for men and **women** and not men and **women** for the law and that governments are the servants of the people, not their masters.

* Has the Government received the report from the interdepartmental committee inquiring into the condition of accommodation for servicemen and **women** which was to further examine the ready availability of private rental housing to meet the needs of married servicemen and the viability of a new housing allowance concession scheme as a replacement for the existing scheme; if so (a) when was the report received, (b) what were the findings and recommendations of the committee and (c) which of the recommendations have been (i) accepted and (ii) rejected; if not, when is it expected to be received and what has been the cause of the delay.

* At least men and **women** should retain their employment in the industry.

* Has his attention been drawn to a report by Professor Berndt, a Western Australian anthropologist, of the social behaviour of Aboriginal men and **women** since a liquor store opened on a mining lease at East Alligator River crossing late in 1969 despite objections by the adjoining mission and the Aborigines, and of his claim that the mission would soon be forced to close unless immediate action was taken.

* Average minimum weekly award rates for men have increased by 53 per cent; for **women** by no less than 75 per cent.

* It requires new institutions, new scales and priorities, new social attitudes, new political guidelines, new efforts at co-operation, new men and **women** in positions of authority.

* They are men and **women** of experience.

* Of any such Australians how many are **women**.

* In addition to giving further consideration to increasing Australia's financial contribution to the United Nations for the relief of the 5 to 6 million East Pakistani refugees in India, will he appeal to all Pakistani and Indian doctors; now in Australia, to show some patriotic interest in the sufferings of their fellow countrymen, **women** and children and return immediately to East Pakistan or India where their medical skills are much more urgently needed than they are in Australia.

* We have tended to cut back on the material services but we have maintained and not cut back our priorities for welfare services and projects concerned with physically handicapped people, hostels for young people, **women**'s refuges and programs of this type.

* As a general training centre for unemployed and apparently unemployable men and **women** in Gippsland; 
I ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the recently published Jackson committee report.

* Does the Prime Minister remember Samuel Johnson being asked about **women**'s preaching and his answer:  'Sir, a  woman's preaching is like a dog walking on his hind legs.

* Statistics are collected for persons under 2 1 years and for **women**.

* At the end of May 1976 these were as follows: 
In addition to these immediate measures, the Government believes it of the utmost importance that a review be undertaken of the whole area of protective security in Australia by a person who has an appreciation of intelligence and security operations, and a concern for the liberties of individual men and **women** of Australia.

* I am happy to be able to advise the House that the 
When this kind of legislation was first passed in this House in  1918  the servicemen and a handful of **women** had been serving, generally speaking, at least  10,000  miles away from Australia.

* The only people who are watching television at 5 o'clock in the morning are policemen, the **women** they are locking up, and milkmen.

* Mr Brandon  put the question: 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which reports a study of 4S07 men and **women** by researchers at the University of Michigan, indicating that blood cholesterol and fat levels were significantly higher in those who were markedly overweight, that there was no significant association between blood fat levels and consumption of fats and that weight control was more important than a low cholesterol diet in reducing blood cholesterol levels.

* The work which she has done for the **women** of Western Australia and of Australia generally is very much to her credit.

* I urged young men and **women** to continue to assert their right to apply for benefits to which they were entitled by law.

* The Government's attempts to improve the status of **women** in our society are nothing but a joke.

* The establishment of a National Women's Advisory Council is pure tokenism while there is not a single policy initiative of the past two and a quarter years to suggest the Government even acknowledges the role of **women** in the work force.

* Clearly the Government takes as little interest in the status of Australian **women**- and the discrimination they still endure- as it does in the affairs of our migrant communities.

* The majority of migrantslike the majority of our **women**- are among the losers of our society under the administration of this Government and this Prime Minister.

* It is a long list of losers, from the unemployed, to the poor, to our migrants, to our **women**, to our teenagers leaving school, to our wage earners on low incomes, to single income families on middle incomes, to young couples trying to buy a home, to small businessmen going broke, to small farmers going bankrupt-all the way down to our Aboriginal people who, as ever, remain at the bottom of this Government 's priorities.

* We are battling to keep the industry going in Australia and are scratching all the time to keep **women** concerned in employment', he said.

* Honourable members will have heard me point out in this House and outside that government spending devoted to areas where there are unemployed men, **women** and other resources is not inflationary.

* I say this because there are a number of people, particularly pregnant **women** in Australia, who are extremely concerned about the effects of radiation upon their unborn children.

* The first one is that the Commission right at the outset said that it will wait before making any recommendations to the Government - and the Government has accepted this - after it has received the many reports and evaluation statements about homeless men and **women**, national superannuation plans and so on.

* Would he agree that these observations are a gratuitous insult to thousands of dedicated decent Australian **women** whose sole aim is to serve the community and to provide an opportunity for these children to be cared for whilst one of the parents may be working?

* Does he believe that the army of unemployed men and **women** will be consoled by the fact that they have been thrown out of work as a result of the incompetence and economic mismanagement of his Government rather than as a deliberate act of policy?

* It could be 2 **women** or 2 men living together.

* In order to concentrate specifically on the effects of various substances on pregnant **women**, I am asking the National Health and Medical Research Council to advise on the feasibility and the desirability of conducting a prospective study extending over possibly 3 years.

* -Is the Minister for Home Affairs aware of statements made earlier this week about the standing of Australian sports men and **women** in world ratings?

* Somebody said that perhaps we are doing this in an attempt to make some reconciliation with **women**.

* I believe that, if **women** can get money in their hands to use as they see fit and also know that they are receiving it tax free, it will give the advantage that is intended.

* Is it a fact that the funds made available for **women**'s refuges in this financial year have been barely adequate for the maintenance of those refuges approved and supported by the Labor Government and that this has inhibited their development?

* The Corporation will provide opportunities for **women** employees which will set an example to the whole insurance industry.

* In terms of employment in the AGIC **women** will have the same rights and opportunities as men.

* In addition, the Government will encourage the AGIC to extend to **women** the same opportunity to take out policies as men now enjoy.

* We also note that there are more **women** in the work force.

* I do not think this is bad at all, except in cases where **women** are forced to work when they would rather stay at home.

* In 1954 some 22.8 per cent of the work force were **women**; in 1977 the figure was 35.6 per cent.

* Of course we have had to provide jobs for those **women**.

* The cost of employing **women**, to my mind, was rightly increased.

* It is interesting to see that it had virtually no effect on the employment of **women**.

* We need to welcome the role of **women** in the work force but we should not necessarily have them there by force.

* We ought to examine the incentives we could give to **women** to stay at home.

* Perhaps we could examine the possibility of a tax reduction for private people in domestic employment, not just for **women** but for men as well, as a means of expanding employment.

* 1 saw  no other way in which **women** could get employment in those towns.

* May I add that I believe that this is the greatest innovation since falsies gave an uplift to **women** in the late 1 920s.

* However, it may be desirable to defer any amendments to this Ordinance, and any substantive amendments to the Married Women 's Property Legislation of the ACT, pending the receipt of the reports referred to above.

* We deliberately have made, and shall make, local government a vehicle for our legislation dealing with aged persons homes and hostels, sheltered employment, handicapped children, meals on wheels, home care and nursing, nursing homes, homeless men and **women**.

* You will know that cuts in the expenditure of the 1976-77 Budget affect the little people- pensioners, **women**, children, Aborigines, migrants, the sick and the infirm.

* So there are considerably more who require this type of service when one considers invalids and the group of **women** who would be included in this between the age of 60 and 65.

* I ask the Minister: Will those firms be included in the assistance which are prepared to provide child care centres within their establishments for the benefit of employees, particularly **women** who are responsible for the sole support of their families?

* In 1969-70 the Commonwealth granted $6,000 to South Australia for the purchase of land for a health hostel for Aboriginal **women** at Port Augusta.

* The number of **women** who would be having curettes, the number who would be having cauterisations of their cervixes, the number of children who would be having tonsils out, would double and treble if Medibank was paying for them as public patients on a fee for service basis.

* It seeks to avoid discrimination against any section of the community, particularly **women**.

* He has achieved success who: Has lived well, laughed often, and loved much, Who has gained the respect of intelligent men, the trust of **women**, and the love of little children, Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task, Who has left the world better than he found it, Who has never lacked appreciation for earth's beauty nor failed to express it, Who has always looked for the best in others and given them the best he had, Whose life was an inspiration, his memory a benediction.

* We shall be lesser men and **women** and of lesser use to the community as a whole if they become law.

* The **women** of Swan particularly were severe on the policies of the previous Government.

* They could not see, for instance, why so much money had to be wasted on what some of them described to me as a circus- that dreadful event known as International Women's Year.

* I am not criticising any **women**, any **women**'s organisations, the Women's Electoral Lobby or anybody else.

* I am reporting to you faithfully only what the people of Swan, particularly the **women**, had to say about this matter.

* Data are published showing the actual numbers registered for employment at the end of each month according to age (adults/juniors), sex, broad occupational groups and for married **women**.

* A meeting of 20 **women** under the organisational control of  Mrs J.

* Was the omission, during the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcast of the Anzac Day parade in Sydney on 25 April 1977, to name clearly the group of men and **women** representing Australian soldiers, who were isolated and cared for by Timorese citizens in World War II an accidental omission or a result of a direction to comply with the present Government 's decision to ignore the Timorese.

* 1 can understand that human life must be sacred but I do not concede that one should be concerned more for the life of a criminal than for the lives of men, **women** and children who are citizens of this country.

* The proposal is for the construction of new permanent living, working and recreational facilities to accommodate the Army Apprentices School at present located in sub-standard accommodation at Balcombe, Victoria; the School of Military Survey presently located in temporary accommodation at Bonegilla, Victoria; and recruit training for the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps, presently in temporary accommodation at George's Heights, Sydney, New South Wales.

* Of those referred to in parts (1) and (2), how many were (a) single and (b) married **women**.

* At 21 November 1382 migrant **women** had been enrolled in the scheme and these should all have been matched with tutors by the end of this calendar year.

* The primary objective of the scheme is to secure language improvement in the informal situation of the migrant **women**'s home.

* Equally important however is the extent to which the scheme will encourage the integration of migrant **women** through the development of personal relationships between tutors and pupils and the assistance given generally to migrant **women** m adapting to life in a new community.

* The number of migrant **women** in need of home tutoring cannot readily be assessed.

* They would comprise all migrant **women** who would prefer to have tutoring in the informal situation of their home as a first step to receiving instruction in the formal situation of classes established in the community.

* She followed her husband into this Parliament and was one of the few **women** to have graced this chamber.

* Which States replied to the Commonwealth letter of 18th July 1968 seeking some information which would assist in enabling a reply to be sent to a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations for information in regard to the implementation of the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women (Hansard, 29th May 1969, page 2556 and 19th March 1970, page 719), and when did they do so.

* Apart from the technical training competency gained from the courses, they must also aid in the social development of young men and **women**.

* There are still disabilities imposed upon people in education arising, for instance, from sex: There are more chances for young men than there are for young **women**.

* Departments represented on the Task Group are Environment, Housing and Community Development (Chair), Aboriginal Affairs, Education, Employment and Industrial Relations, Finance, Health, Home Affairs (Office of Women's Affairs), Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Social Security.

* I think that male travellers - 1 think if the **women** are honest they will agree - much prefer to be.

* These courses deal with changing factors likely to affect the union movement, techniques of case presentation in arbitration and bargaining, economic policies affecting union objectives, and **women** in the union movement.

* The estimate was based on an assessment of (i) information provided in confidence by the pharmaceutical industry on the number of **women** using oral contraceptives, (ii) statistics on the population of females in the 18 to 45 years age group, and (iii) Departmental experience related to the listing of new items as benefits and the removal of restrictions on existing benefits.

* This will mean that in future a de facto wife who is living with a man on a bona fide domestic basis will qualify for wife's pension or attract additional unemployment or sickness benefit without any regard to a qualifying period on the same basis as **women** who are legally married.

* It is the local governments, which in the majority of instances, as we know, comprise men and **women** working in the honorary capacity of aldermen and councillors, which must bear the brunt of disapproval and not the State and Federal governments, which in my opinion should share the blame if there is any blame to be directed.

* What recommendations have been made on matters specifically relating to **women**.

* When considering this proposal, will the Treasurer bear in mind that the imposition of such a tax would discourage people from saving for their old age and would cause many retired men and **women** hardship and a further falling off in their standard of living?

* There is no official information available on the percentage of the total wage and salary bill earned by **women**.

* We appreciate that many public servants work long hours and are dedicated men and **women**.

* He is also the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs and Minister assisting the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations.

* Invalid pensions paid to men under 65 years of age or **women** under 60 are not taxable.

* I think I should make it clear that yesterday in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Maribyrnong I mentioned that the funding of **women**'s refuges under the community health program was at a rate of 100 per cent.

* What I did not say was that for 1976-77, under the block funding arrangements that we have entered into with the States, **women**'s refuges have been funded under the same arrangements as are other projects under that program.

* There are about 20 **women**'s refuges throughout the Commonwealth.

* As I said yesterday, the Minister for Social Security and I have had discussions about the funding of **women**'s refuges in the future.

* I think it is essential to understand that there is difference between a **women**'s refuge and **women**'s health centre.

* It is a place which was set up by the former Government under the terms of the community health program to provide some refuge to **women** who had been deserted or bashed by their husbands and who had to seek refuge for a short period.

* On one occasion the ministerial direction prohibited the Director from granting loans to personnel of the Citizen Military Forces and of certain **women**'s auxiliary services.

* The Australian contribution was allocated for a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) project in Zambia which was designed to assist **women** and children under the care of a number of liberation movements, including the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the South-West African People's Organisation (SWAPO), the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the African National Congress (ANC).

* We did great things for young **women** by abolishing discrimination in the Australian Public Service.

* I want to pay tribute to the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's Christian Association in the Australian Capital Territory.

* When the frightened men and **women** of Australia are submitted to the will of the people of Australia they will be the ones, the members of the Australian Labor Party, who will be swept to utter oblivion.

* I ask the Prime Minister: Is unemployment a serious national problem and is this situation causing hardship and distress to thousands of Australian **women** and men who wish to work?

* I think that  Mr Petersen  is probably trying to get another couple of million dollars from the Federal Government and he is really taking it from the mouths of starving **women** and children.

* Women, as well as men, must undergo a proper test to be eligible for unemployment benefit, but I do not want to go into the detail of the answer at this stage.

* So we are talking about the shifting of 2500 or 2600 men and **women** and their families from the industry in Whyalla to another area where we hope that they can find jobs.

* The way to do that is to control the mass media, by abolishing the free Press, by setting up government newspapers and radio stations, by censorship and even by gaoling and deporting newspaper men and **women** as has happened in India.

* The Government is bleeding the heart of the news industry by taking some of its most senior and experienced men and **women**.

* Separate estimates were obtained for (a) males, (b) married **women**, (c) all females and (d) all persons.

* The estimates for May 1972 for married **women** and for all females were so small as to be of this kind.

* It is true that during the election campaign the Government promised to establish a permanent **women**'s advisory body.

* I am very happy to announce to honourable members that the Government has decided to honour that election promise and to establish a National Women's Advisory Council.

* Honourable members will be aware that in September of last year the report of the **women**'s advisory body working party was presented to the Parliament and was available for honourable members to look at.

* That resulted from an initiative taken by the Prime Minister in 1 976 to call together **women**'s organisations and representatives of **women**'s organisations from all over Australia.

* Of course, the new Council will give **women** a permanent voice in government.

* It will enable them to give advice to me as the Minister for Home Affairs in relation to all matters of concern to **women**.

* This body will consist of 12 **women** who will be drawn from all walks of life.

* They will represent all **women**- I repeat, 'all **women**'.

* At this point I pay a tribute to the **women** who work in my Office of Women's Affairs.

* As I say, it will enable **women** to have a firm, strong and permanent voice with government in this country.

* The powers of the Council shall be: to report and make recommendations to Government on request or on its own initiative in relation to matters of concern to **women**; to set up, subject to Ministerial approval, subcommittees, working parties or task forces as necessary, drawing on its own resources when appropriate and on other resources which may be made available; and at the request of the Minister responsible, to encourage research into areas of importance to **women**.

* **women**.

* In furtherance of this function the Council may: establish and maintain effective communication with **women** and **women**'s organisations and other interested groups and individuals; explore means of overcoming language and other communication barriers; raise awareness within the community of the situation of **women** and of their varied and changing roles and aspirations; encourage and assist effective liaison with the communications media in ensuring that the individuality and achievements of **women** are given due recognition; actively promote a policy of equality of opportunity for all **women**; review and report to the Minister on legislation specifically relating to its powers and functions; convene forums, seminars and conferences throughout Australia; report annually through the Minister to Parliament and the public, and regularly produce publications and other material in several major languages to disseminate information; establish and maintain cooperation with other advisory bodies and relevant machinery at State and Commonwealth levels and internationally, with a view to guarding against unnecessary duplication; and in collaboration with Departments and agencies and through the Depanment of Foreign Affairs establish and maintain liaison with international and regional agencies in relation to implementation of the World Plan of Action for the UN Decade for Women.

* He went on to say that in his view married **women** whose husbands are working have no right to be classed as unemployed.

* I think that the Women's Electoral Lobby might have a view on that.

* In Darwin, throughout Australia and elsewhere, the men and **women** who got together to help, whether it was a child in Hobart breaking into his piggy bank so that he could give or an age pensioner on the devastated streets of Darwin consoling the shocked and dressing the wounds of the injured, took human nobility to its highest level.

* Specifically I would like to thank the men and **women** of the Darwin Bureau of Meteorology who stayed at their posts as the cyclone intensified, plotting its course with a growing degree of certainty while their families bravely faced the horror at home; the men and **women** of the Postmaster-General's Department who kept the communication lines open as much as possible and then worked without rest to reopen them; the men and **women** of the radio and television stations who broadcast continuously advice on cyclone warnings and preparations and then, when the storm abated, immediately set about to restore broadcasting.

* I would like to thank the men and **women** of the Northern Territory Police Force as well as the civil defence workers who went out during the cyclone and again afterwards consoling the shocked, getting medical attention to the injured and comforting the bereaved; the men and **women** of the Darwin medical, paramedical and nursing professions and ambulance service who displayed at all times the highest dedication to duty, great compassion and efficiency in bringing kindly assistance to the injured and the sick; the men and **women** who worked at getting the public utilities such as water and electricity operating whenever possible, cleared the roads to allow the entry of rescue vehicles, checked homes for the trapped, the injured and the dead, organised themselves into working parties, helped in the distribution of food and necessary supplies, such as medicine, and helped to organise evacuation; members of the religious profession who gave spiritual comfort; the airport and airline personnel who cleared the airport and rigged emergency flare paths.

* The men and **women** of the defence servicesthe Navy, the Army and the Air Forcewho whether on duty or off duty responded bravely to the crisis and displayed outstanding heroism in bringing practical assistance to their fellow Darwin citizens.

* Here I must pause and single out for special mention the Royal Australian Air Force aircrews and maintenance staff who kept their planes flying continuously; the RAAF medical teams who did not falter in their duties; the Navy disaster force which hurriedly assembled for duty, brought needed supplies and swung immediately into action bringing urgently needed assistance and undertaking unpleasant tasks often during times of supplementary volunteered duty; the Army which currently is undertaking a similar task as that of the Navy in the same spirit of commitment; the journalists who reported objectively the situation that Darwin faced; the churches which organised relief efforts through their own social welfare agencies; the people who organised funds for those financially wanting to help the people of Darwin; the personnel of Qantas Airways Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia Airlines, Connair Pty Ltd and SAATAS Pty Ltd, as well as members of the general aviation industry who collected together to make the great evacuation program a success; the men and **women** of the Royal Air Force, the United States Air Force and the Indonesian Air Force who contributed magnificently; the people down the track from Darwin who gave food and shelter to road evacuees; the personnel of the Commonwealth and 
In conclusion, I would ask the Minister in the operation of this legislation to give the fullest consideration and approval wherever possible to involve members of the Darwin community in every aspect of the reconstruction, to consider their suggestions for reconstruction and to bear in mind suggestions of specific interest groups, such as **women**, so that the city we do build will be a permanent tribute to every Australian and the spirit that has swept Australia since Christmas Day.

* Does he agree with the Minister for Primary Industry that Australian soldiers should shoot **women** and children if ordered to do so and obey such orders without question?

* And that at least 2 of the 9 Commissioners be **women**.

* Mr Speaker, there can be no doubt that the program of the Opposition is the complete antithesis of that which would best serve the interests of the ordinary men and **women** in Australia .

* Researchers see the first indication of increasing delinquency, crime, marital breakdowns, addiction to alcohol and sedatives in the heavily urban eastern shore communities where some **women** spend their afternoons weeping in frustration at being isolated and alone.

* So there can be no mistake about the Government's attitude as far as that body of men or **women** is concerned, I refer to the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Mr Peacock)  on or about 1 3 April 1 976.

* There have been many instances where young **women** migrating to Australia have deliberately concealed the existence of children in the belief that this would reflect favourably on their applications.

* When Budget consideration is being given to repatriation benefits, will the Minister for Repatriation stress strongly that repatriation hospital, medical and pharmaceutical benefits be extended to all ex-servicemen and **women** of the First World War and the Boer War irrespective of any connection between the disability and war service?

* as I have said to him outside the House, that when that matter is being considered I think it would be appropriate that the present anomaly which applies to **women** members of the House of Representatives and the Senate should be corrected.

* The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I presume his question relates to **women** who have been in full-time employment, have been absent on maternity leave and at the conclusion of their entitlement to maternity, sick, recreation and other leave wish to return to part-time, rather than full-time, employment.

* and (2) It is a fact that the World President of the Associated Country Women of the World was informed by letter of 5 April 1973 by the then responsible Minister that to permit a Delegation from Rhodesia to attend its 14th Triennial Conference would be contrary to the spirit and objects of the relevant U.N. Security Council Resolutions concerning Rhodesia.

* This policy is contrary to the egalitarian trend of industrial relations in this country, is discriminatory in the context in which I have mentioned before in this House and, finally, is totally naive because it ignores the whole concept of flow-on throughout the genera] community, about which concept, of course, the honourable gentleman who asked the question is vitally concerned because, as he indicated, such a flow-on would have disastrous effects on the rural community, the export industries and on those groups in the community least able to protect themselves, namely, the pensioners, the superannuitants, those on fixed incomes and, of course, the men and **women** on the land.

* What does the Minister intend to do with the Australian Union of Students Friendly Society, which has different rates for people under 31 years of age and those over 31 years of age; and with the Hospital Contribution Fund of Australia, whose Selectaplan discriminates against pregnant **women**, who are not covered by this plan.

* As the Minister Assisting the Treasurer  (Mr Eric Robinson)  pointed out in his second reading speech, this Bill goes a stage further and greatly improves the position of **women** in the Public Service.

* Shouldn't we all, twenty-year-olds to sixtyyearolds, men and **women**, be conscripted, if anyone is?

* It has been borne by very many gallant men and **women**, and I will not lightly stand in this Parliament and see that name expunged from the statute without wringing an explanation from the Minister responsible.

* Briefly this was that vehicles carrying 74 men, **women** and children, had been intercepted by a body of police at Skull Creek.

* Men outnumbered **women** by just under 2 to 1 in universities; in the colleges of advanced education 37 per cent of enrolments were male; in technical and further education there were nearly 3 men for every 1 woman.

* The Labor lawyers spent their time considering strategies for change ... it should not be forgotten that a gathering of Labor lawyers is really a parade ground for political aspirants to show off their plumage ... the Labor lawyers event degenerated into a back-biting faction fight, Left versus Right, **women** versus the men .

* In the light of the gratifying and intelligent response of 18, 19 and 20 year old men and **women** to the opportunity to exercise their right to vote - for the first time in Australia - in Saturday's elections in Western Australia., can he say when the Government expects to make a decision on giving these people votes in Federal elections?

* Estimates range from 100,000 to 250,000 men, **women** and children dying while seeking refuge.

* Hundreds of thousands of people- including **women** and children- are dying and drowning at sea.

* We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to affirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and **women** and of nations large and small.

* The States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act 1968 provides for Commonwealth grants to the States in respect of approved benefits provided by them for deserted wives and certain other **women** with children.

* My final remark is that if men and **women** in this Parliament and parliaments of the free world can allow a dossier like that to be put to us day after day and remain quiet after a man like Martin says that there is a human being today in another country with whom we do have some relationships orchestrating slaughter, they are not fulfilling their function.

* In 1976, for instance, there were 26,000 hysterectomies, but statistics showed that only one in every 200 of these **women** had the possibility of getting cancer of the womb.

* The Government will go ahead with construction of an Australian Capital Territory remand centre to provide a modern alternative to the present unhappy arrangement bequeathed to us by the previous Government of holding ACT male prisoners in the Goulburn Gaol and of sending **women** prisoners to the Silverwater complex in Sydney.

* Every newspaper editor in this country is on trial, because one must remember the great occasions in the past when men and **women** fought for great rights.

* the extent of relevant existing programs in medical schools and their adequacy to provide comprehensive medical training in contraceptive techniques in the physical, psychological and sexual problems experienced by **women** in adapting to marriage and before, during and after menstruation and in matters relating to pregnancy, fertility control, spontaneous and induced abortions and childbirth and to encourage acceptance by the medical profession of its responsibilities in the field of contraceptive counselling; 
the social, economic, psychological and medical pressures on **women** in determining whether to proceed with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies, having regard to: 
the social status of **women** in the community; the social, psychological and medical results of termination of, or and failure to terminate such pregnancies; 
Is any review contemplated of the Married Women's Property Act 1 898 (N.S.W.)

* After 66 years, during which the mothers of Australia have been receiving the benefit at the rate of $30-odd a week for the purpose of meeting confinement expenses, this Government has contrived a way of depriving the **women** of Australia of that benefit.

* Family planning services, in real terms, are to be cut back, as are the community health programs which are so important to **women** as they support **women**'s health centres and refuges.

* One of the singular contributions to that gathering of distress has been the conflict between and among races- the fact that men and **women** of different races have had difficulty in living with each other, abiding with each other, respecting each other.

* As any man in the money market knows, taxes, both Federal and State, will pay handsome rewards to the men and **women** of Australia.

* Because a number of days were to elapse, as a holding operation the DirectorGeneral of Health sent telegrams to doctors throughout Australia asking them to refrain from prescribing the drug to **women** of child-bearing age pending consideration by the Drug Evaluation Committee.

* However, preliminary analyses indicate the following: 82 per cent of persons approved for training were not employed at the time of making their application; 19 per cent of persons approved for training were redundant from their previous employment; about 50 per cent of persons approved for training were **women** (including widows) returning to the workforce; about 9 per cent of persons in training at 1 December 1974 were Aborigines.

* for adult males, a weekly training allowance of $50.90; for **women**, and trainees who are minors, the award rate of pay for their previous occupation with a maximum training allowance of $50.90 a week; if a trainee receives, in the period during which the allowance is payable, income from employment other than vacation employment, or from investments other than savings bank deposits, the amount of the training allowance payable each week will be reduced by the weekly equivalent of that income net of taxation; 
The capacity and structure of the Army will determine the quality and quantity of men and material an aggressor would have to deliver and sustain in Australia in a conventional military operation.

* I have not mentioned the most important part of our defence forces- the men and **women** of the Services.

* You might just as well talk about the 'experiment' that was made in properly feeding pregnant Aboriginal **women** with protein and vitamin supplements by the Presbyterian authorities in Queensland and miracle, miracle, miracle.

* Its sole purpose and consequence is to give the vote to 18 year old, 19 year old and 20 year old men and **women** in elections for either House of this Parliament.

* Be that as it may, however, there are now 2 States in which 18, 19 and 20-year old men and **women** have the vote for the State Parliament.

* The Commonwealth has promoted suffrage for 18, 19 and 20-year old men and **women** in this year's election for the House of Assembly of Papua New Guinea.

* Of course it has been available in the Netherlands and in a very great number of other countries in eastern Europe and Latin America for many years past but in all the countries with which Australia compares itself the vote now is available at 18 and it should be possible for this Parliament to express its view promptly on this subject in time for 18, 19 and 20-year old men and **women** to have the suffrage at this year's national elections.

* Special classes are being provided where necessary to meet the needs of migrant **women** and other special groups of migrants.

* 5310 (Hansard, 30th May 1972) which enabled him to estimate that an additional 824,000 Australian **women** would use oral contraceptives if they were available free as pharmaceutical benefits.

* In view of the increase in the incidents of murder and rape in this country and in particular the terrible crime committed at Collarenebri last Wednesday - this area  beseaches  you and the Federal Government to introduce penalties suitable for this type of crime and we remind you of the very unprotected position of **women** in isolated country areas.

* In the letter  Mr Healey  states that a grant has been made to the community aid service of the municipality of Blacktown to help the operation of its community cottage, which is a refuge for **women** in crisis situations, the grant being $10,585.

* Both men and **women** councillors of the Cherbourg Reserve have enabled me to become far better informed on their problems and they have earned my respect in so doing.

* Hume proposes, would only serve to make safe abortions, which are lawful medical procedures, unavailable to **women** who would most need them- **women** on low incomes, **women** who have been the victims of rape, **women** with large families and other **women** to whom an unwanted pregnancy threatens physical and mental health.

* In mentioning those basic objections to the Lusher motion, as it is called, I express the views of some 130 **women**'s organisations around Australia, representing probably many hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of **women** in this country.

* Its submission states: 
Thus every year thousands of **women** who have no intention of seeking to end a pregnancy would be faced with the embarrassment of having to produce a certificate to that effect before being able to obtain benefits.

* Those are the views of the conservative Australian Medical Association, warning honourable members that, if we give effect to the motion before us, we will be breaking new ground which will have horrifying prospects, including the prospect of causing great embarrassment to the **women** of today and the **women** who will follow in the future.

* The AMA concluded: 
I, probably like every other honourable member, have no enthusiasm for terminating pregnancy, yet it is apparent that many **women** consider that they have the right to elect to do so.

* Despite the threat of penalty, as well as the availability of adequate facilities and, often, the lack of medical competence, **women** have exercised what they regard as their personal prerogative in this matter, often at great expense and unnecessary exposure to injury and even risk of life.

* Regardless of the outcome of any legislation, these **women** will continue to adopt that course of action.

* After years of devoted study of abortion law versus choice morality, Callahan found it necessary, reluctantly, to choose permissive abortion as the only type of abortion law which recognises **women**'s rights over their own bodies, but not absolute rights because due regard must be given to the foetus and to society, and which upholds the dignity of the law by not allowing it to fall into disrepute, as laws prohibiting abortion do.

* The Parliament should also realise that people are being put out there and most of the **women** have to work.

* So there is a big concern among the ordinary men and **women** and the children of our community to see that we retain some control over our own resources.

* That is the inherent fairness of that system and that is why Australia, which when its electoral systems were being set up was naturally interested in trying to achieve the fairest system- by the way, Australia was one of the first countries to give the vote to **women** and also to provide for secret ballots- adopted the system of full preferential voting.

* But if the people endow this Australian Parliament with that jurisdiction next Saturday, then early next year we can expect to introduce laws which will apply equal pay for men and **women** who are employees everywhere in Australia.

* We will introduce a program to bring in equal pay for all men and **women**.

* The stage is being reached where it is the normal thing for married **women** to work.

* All the **women**'s magazines tell us what has happened in the Liberal Party.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for hospital improvements at the Boddington Women's Hospital submitted by the Boddington Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social Welfare Commission to his Department.

* If he has no evidence for these outrageous and damaging accusations, let him keep silent or apologise to the men and **women** whose integrity he has impugned.

* It is notable that in today's Melbourne  Herald,  Mr Eric  Risstrom, the Secretary of the Australian Taxpayers Association, has called the farmers' tax 'a reviver' for what it will do for incentive and equity for men and **women** on the land.

* In the early 1970s wages, especially those for **women**, increased sharply, partly as the result of the introduction of equal pay.

* 45, Underground Work (Women) Convention, 1935 and No.

* The training of Aboriginal men and **women** is the responsibility of the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Administration within the Department of the Interior.

* It is forcing **women** to work at -the expense of their families.

* I have a constitutent whose wife gave birth to twins in the Royal Hospital for Women at Paddington.

* It was pointed out to him by the Royal Hospital for 
Women that under the National Health Act a qualified hospital benefit is not deemed to include a newly born child for the first 10 days.

* When  Mr McCristal  wrote to the Royal Hospital for Women he was told that it had been making representations.

* The hospital wrote and said: 
On reaching the age of 65 years (60 years for **women**) an invalid pensioner who does not possess the necessary residence qualification for age pension continues to receive invalid pension until such time as he becomes qualified by residence to receive age pension.

* Has his attention been drawn to a statement by  Mrs R.  W. Askin, wife of the Premier of New South Wales, when opening a Liberal Women's public affairs seminar on 25th August 1971, that the world drug problem was a Communist plot.

* What progress has his Department made with the proposed directory of support services for **women**  (Hansard,  8 September 1976, page 789; 6 October 1976, page 1613 and 24 May 1 977, page 1 774).

* In the area of the protection of civil rights against a large and, as some would see it, an increasingly powerful bureaucracy this Government has done more than any in the history of Australia to protect the rights of average Australian men and **women** against bureaucratic decisions of one kind or another.

* The estimated additional cost involved in paying age pension free of means test to **women** over 60 years and men over 65 years of age after the rates proposed in the Social Services Bill (No.

* Will it get the 112,000 acknowledged unemployed men and **women** promptly back to work?

* Is it a fact that one effect of the Commonwealth's submissions to the Arbitration Commission on the subject of equal pay has been to produce the result that nursing aides qualify for equal pay because the work is done by both men and **women**, but that qualified nursing sisters do not qualify for the male wage because their work is regarded as an exclusively female occupation.

* Women in Transport Study (Question No.

* Nothing is more justified than giving those men and **women** who served this country in its dire need the best deal that Australia can give them.

* This surely means that the already complex procedures of divorce would be made even more complex and, more importantly, more unfair especially so far as **women** are concerned.

* The Attorney-General mentioned that all the **women**'s groups are its strongest supporters.

* It concerns me very much that the **women**'s organisations in this country, or many of them, are either silent or very strong supporters of the legislation.

* It concerns me because in my view if this legislation is carried in its present form it will culminate in discrimination against **women**.

* I think that these **women**'s organisations should be drawing attention to this fact.

* It stated: 
Women's Electoral Lobby supports those who support the Family Law Bill.

* I take it that if I do not support the Bill the Women's Electoral Lobby will actively campaign against me.

* I believe that **women**'s organisations should be drawing attention to the discrimination against **women** which will be involved if this Bill is passed.

* It is all very well for professional **women** or **women** with a vocation; they have a degree of independence which gives them some immunity from the damage caused by this legislation.

* But most **women** in the community are not professional **women**.

* In my view these organisations represent only professional **women**; they do not represent the majority of **women** in the community.

* The effect of clause 48, in my view, would be especially damaging to young married couples and in particular to young married **women**.

* It would put them in the situation of **women** in some other countries where the husband partner can make a unilateral declaration of divorce with the old: 'I divorce you.

* In my view in this area **women** are grossly disadvantaged, especially compared with the situation under the existing legislation.

* In the main these are men and **women** who have served their country well over a lifetime and just when their need is greatest they have been forgotten by, their Government.

* Based on population projections by the Commonwealth Statistician it is estimated that in Australia at April 1973 there were 454,800 men aged 65 years and over and 888,700 **women** aged 60 years and over who were qualified by residence for an age pension.

* We need now to look at the proposals of the Minister for Social Security as they relate to the members of the community who today are between the ages of 65 and 75, in the case of men, and between 60 and 75 in the case of **women**.

* That the resolution of the House of Representatives of 3 June 1976 referring the construction of sleeping accommodation for 80 Women's Royal Australian Army Corps personnel at Puckapunyal, Victoria, to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, be rescinded.

* Many thousands of young people, married **women** and men and people approaching retiring age have simply dropped out of the labour force- a stark acknowledgement of the hopeless task of finding employment.

* What assurances can he give to the hundreds of thousands of men, **women** and young people living on the dole that their future is not in permanent jeopardy?

* What (a) number and (b) percentage of **women** with children under 5 years of age are engaged in the work force.

* -When this Government came to power it was quite obvious that urgent steps had to be taken to ascertain those areas of administration and legislation concerning **women** where the Australian Government had previously been passive, inert, negligent or insensitive.

* I would like to take this opportunity to pay a tribute to her diligence, dedication and dignity in that position, the skill that she has brought to bear in serving not only **women** but all Australians both at home and abroad, in private and in the media.

* One of the objectives that the Government has had- and to this objective Miss Reid has contributed mightily and nobly- is to build into the administrative structure machinery for ensuring that any aspects concerning **women** are observed and properly solved and acknowledged.

* There is already a **women**'s affairs section in my Department, but it is proposed to upgrade its status.

* I should like to remind honourable gentlemen of some of the things that the Government has been able to do in respect of **women**'s rights.

* We ratified the 1953 United Nations Convention on the Political Rights of Women.

* We sought the extension of the adult minimum wage to **women** in the 1973 national wage case.

* The report of the committee appointed in July 1974 which inquired into the effects of social change on the educational needs of **women** and girls is about to be published.

* A sub-committee to undertake a continuing review of developments affecting the employment of **women** in the Public Service was established by the Joint Council of the Australian Public Service at its fiftieth meeting.

* At least 1 1 **women**'s refuges throughout the country are receiving Australian Government funding.

* Whereas in South Australia in 1971, of the **women** who were aborted 43 per cent had never used any form of contraception and a further 34 per cent were not doing so on the occasion when they became pregnant, 74 per cent of the **women** who were aged under 20 had never used any form of contraception and a further 16 per cent were not doing so on the occasion when they became pregnant.

* Whereas one in every 10 Australian children is born outside marriage, among **women** under the age of 21 one birth in every 3 occurs outside marriage and among Women aged under 21 years 2 out of every 3 children are born less than 9 months after marriage.

* These changes include a growing number of families where both parents work, and of single parent families, as well as a frequently increasing sense of isolation affecting **women** looking after children at home.

* It will permit those intentions to be translated even further into action and it will be yet another example, and a major one at that, of the recognition by this Government of the rights of **women** in Australian society.

* It is with conviction that we are taking steps to introduce this legislation during International Women's Year.

* Itself incapable of managing the economy of the country in such a way as to prevent inflation and to maintain the rate of economic expansion needed to absorb over 70,000 migrant workers, over 200,000 school leavers and thousands of married **women** between the ages of 35 and 44 who are desirous of entering the work force.

* By any standards men and **women** are as mature at 18 years now as they were at 21 only a generation ago.

* They practice a knowledge of the performing and plastic arts at a much younger age than men and **women** did a generation ago.

* At 18 years of age young Australian men and **women** may - or soon will be able to - enter into contracts, dispose of property, take and defend legal action, drink, drive a motor vehicle, marry without parental consent, and under the previous Government could be called up for military service.

* The number of officers (including those of the Women's Services) who sought permission to resign their commissions and the number of applications approved in each of the 5 years from 1965-66 to 1969-70 and during the first 2 months of 1970-71 is as follows: 
The scheme is part of a comprehensive range of repatriation benefits for Australian ex-servicemen and **women** and their dependants.

* 1 ) Is it planned to transfer the Manpower and Programs Policy Division, Manpower and Industry Studies Division, Management Services Division and the Women's Bureau and Employment Discrimination Section of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs to Canberra.

* Four, viz, **women**'s health centres at Leichhardt, Liverpool, Bankstown and Mayfield (Newcastle).

* In addition to these projects, the Rape Crisis Centre (Surry Hills), the Pregnancy Help Centre (Strathfield) and the Central Coast Women's Health Services Co-ordinator (Gosford) also receive financial assistance under the Community Health Program, but the latter projects are not classified as **women**'s health centres.

* I therefore support what  Mr Speaker  said this week in his address to the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne.

* The Bill will withdraw the tax exemption for social service and repatriation pensions, but not war pensions, paid to men aged 65 years or more and **women** aged 60 or more.

* Pensions paid to **women** less than 60 years of age by reason of their being wives of men aged 65 years or more will also become taxable.

* I was advised today (3 December 1974) by the Premier of Tasmania that his Government intends to amend the Public Service Act to remove the present provision which discriminates against the appointment of married **women** to the Public Service.

* As a past Secretary of the Barrier Industrial Council, firstly, I think that the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  misled the House when he spoke about the number of married **women** who are employed at Broken Hill.

* It is a body of very highly skilled and dedicated men and **women**.

* One of the results of this is that there is practically no wool content in most of the fashion goods which are currently available in the shops for either men or **women**.

* What information did the Commonwealth Statistician obtain in the May quarter of 1972 on the number and percentage of unemployed among (a) males, (b) married **women**, (c) all females and (d) all persons who arrived in Australia in 1971 and 1972.

* By bringing this important issue before the public it was hoped by the proposers that the Commonwealth and the States would take action to see that unwanted conceptions were discouraged and single and married **women** were not forced by social and financial pressure to have abortions they do not desire.

* Has his attention been drawn to an article in the publication Army Journal, September 1973, entitled 'An open letter to female officers of the Australian Army', by Captain Gregson, Women's Royal Australian Army Corps.

* What was the cost of all the expenditure items incurred by the Australian Government in holding the Women 's Conference that began in Canberra on 31 August 1975, including items such as fares, travelling expenses, consultants fees, and advertising.

* If we imported from Hong Kong every item of clothing for men, **women**, girls and boys, we would represent less than one per cent of the total export market of Hong Kong.

* What matters remain outstanding that would prevent an amendment to the operation of the Defence Service Homes Scheme to extend eligibility to members of the Citizen Military Forces and Women's Forces who served in Australia during the 1939-45 war.

* The most vulnerable persons in a difficult labour market are the immigrants, especially the young and the **women**, because of their dependence on the manufacturing sector, their low levels of skill and their language difficulties.

* They are well dressed and they walk up there with **women** and children.

* There has been a record increase in the work force, especially in the number of married **women** in employment.

* Unemployed persons; redundant workers; persons threatened with redundancy; **women** returning to the workforce; widow pensioners; ex-national servicemen; former regular servicemen; defence and war widows; Aboriginals.

* Members of the Joint Council Sub-committee on Women, including representatives of the Commonwealth Council of Public Service Organisations and the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union, were informed of the results of the A.C.T.

* to (3) The right honourable member will be aware that information on the employment of **women** in the Australian Public Service is presented in a number of regular statistical items, for instance 'Intake of Permanent Staff' and 'Staff Statistics', contained in Annual Reports of the Public Service Board.

* I am advised by the Board that it intends, as part of its monitoring of equality of opportunity for men and **women** in the Service, to add to its list of regular statistical bulletins one on the employment of **women**.

* This bulletin, the first of which is expected to be released shortly, will contain a variety of information, including details of Second Division offices occupied by **women**.

* The Public Service Board has in recent times made available a substantial amount of information on the employment of **women** to, for example, the Joint Council sub-committee on **women**.

* I am sure the 
What was inadequate about the service of the Postmaster-General's Department that required a quantity of Legal Aid Office advertisements, i.e.,  Women's Weekly  lift-out items, to be delivered to my office at Parramatta by Kwikasair Pty Ltd. 
Is it a fact that during a period of 4 years these and other sportsmen and **women** develop personal and financial ties which make departure at the end of that period most difficult; if so, will he review the terms upon which sporting visas are issued.

* It is also extraordinary in many ways that the area of greatest success for the Liberal Party and its allies has been in securing the votes of **women**.

* While **women** comprise more than half the voting population of Australia- here we are- an all male Federal House.

* The Liberal Party has been successful in persuading the **women** of Australia that they ought to vote for the Party which has never expressed any interest at all for the status of or the possibility of greater options for **women** in Australian society and to reject the Party which does invite **women** to consider that there may be options they may take other than the traditional role.

* It is obvious from the election results that most **women** are quite prepared to accept the Liberal Party position in relation to them.

* I think this state of affairs is bad, not just for the **women** of Australia but also for the future implications of Australian society.

* They found that 8 per cent of males and 15 per cent of females ingest aspirin daily and that regular aspirin-takers among **women** consume 24 powders or tablets each day.

* The information contained in the Women and Work Newsletter, Vol.

* A total of 3, 1 78 employees took advantage of these courses, including 1,138 **women** employees.

* The Opposition also intends to extend the eligibility for war service home loans to all those ex-servicemen and **women** who served in the defence forces in World War II irrespective of whether they served in a theatre of war.

* We on this side of the House believe strongly, and I believe honourable members on the other side of the House believe, that the overwhelming majority of these men and **women** served their country well and it was not their fault that they did not serve outside Australia.

* I shall not read the passage from Hansard but I am willing to provide the Hansard reference and those interested enough to check the debates- I am sure the Minister will be one of them- will be able to see that the Prime Minister believes that these men and **women** should be included under the legislation.

* On the admission of the Government of Kampuchea there is the imminent death by starvation of at least two million men, **women** and children.

* to (3) The numbers of ex-servicemen and **women** receiving repatriation assistance are recorded in each State but are not related to electoral divisions.

* How many appeals to (a) an Entitlement Appeal Tribunal and (b) an Assessment Appeal Tribunal were received from ex-servicemen and **women** residing within a 50-mile radius of Newcastle during 1969-70.

* During his absence the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Howard)  will act as Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister assisting me in respect of Public Service matters and **women**'s affairs.

* Eighty-five per cent of the **women** have stopped menstruating, because they are malnourished and exhausted and, like everybody, they have not recovered from the trauma of the terror.

* I raise a matter of discrimination against **women** on the basis that they are **women**.

* I raised this matter with the Prime Minister's special adviser on **women**, Miss Reid.

* I regret that so far the Government has not been able to do anything about it, particularly as it has taken some steps forward in other matters of discrimination against **women**.

* There is, of course, a new world wide consciousness of the rights and opportunities of **women**.

* The nub of the matter that I wish to raise is that **women** who did the same war work as men, in the same place, wearing even the same clothes, do not get the same housing benefits even if their work was in a war zone, such as Papua New Guinea.

* The May 1973 amendment to the Defence Service Homes Act provided that in the future **women** will be eligible for home loans in the same way as men.

* In other words, if men are entitled to receive a housing loan assistance grant, **women** will be entitled to receive that grant also.

* During World War II the majority of men in the Australian Imperial Forces, and the other Services, enlisted in such a way that they indicated their preparedness to undertake service overseas, whereas most **women** - similar to members of the Citizen Military Forces - were engaged for home service only.

* This fact, in itself, automatically disqualified those **women** from eligibility for home loan assistance.

* I am told - and this is very interesting - that the first **women** who enlisted in fact did enlist on the same terms as men but when, later, they requested the same sorts of facilities and repatriation assistance as men, these were not granted to them.

* Shortly after some hundreds of **women** had been enlisted on the same terms as men, the method of enlistment for **women** was changed.

* In other words, they were in the same position, except for the form of enlistment, as **women** who served in the Forces at home.

* I understand also that many **women** who served in a war zone, such as Papua where obviously they were serving under extremely arduous conditions, did not receive the benefits which men alongside whom they were serving did in fact receive.

* The **women** acted as flight mechanics, transport drivers and cooks doing precisely the same sort of work as men and, often, as I say, in Papua New Guinea working under the same dangers.

* In future men and **women** will be entitled to the same benefits, so what I am talking about really is the present effects of what are now historical circumstances.

* The Second World War is now nearly 3 decades past, and most **women** who served in that War have established themselves in civilian life, but there are some ex-servicewomen, some of them fairly elderly, who are in very straitened circumstances and who cannot help noticing that, with all that is happening to the young **women** today, they, the older **women** who served their country in the same circumstances as did many men, are' not getting the benefits to which the men alongside whom they served are entitled.

* I realise that extending the benefits does involve some complications because there are also men who enlisted for service only in Australia who have to be considered, but the point remains that **women** doing the same work, wearing the same clothes, getting less pay, suffering the same hardships, sometimes working in areas where war was raging, do not today get the benefits to which men are entitled.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent lo all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that  tks  concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is  ev',i  and ought to be condemned.

* A very strong interest in team sports exists among boys between 12 and 14 years of age but not for young men of older age levels or girls and young **women** of any age.

* Society has in the past placed our **women** on a pedestal.

* Of course, we also know that there were men and **women** of Rhodesia who served in the Services in the defence of those things that we held dear in those times.

* and (2) The delay in the payment of revised salaries following this Government's decision to grant equal pay to **women** in the Defence Force stems from the need to provide legal authority for the payments.

* It also includes children who go back to' school because they can't find a job, married **women** who give up looking for work, and men who are retired early but who would like to continue working.

* It is apparent from comments made by the Leader of the Opposition during question time yesterday that he is seeking to renege on a promise in respect of **women** and the unemployment benefit made by him at a Labor Party function last weekend.

* I believe also that it is clear from a reading of the honourable gentleman's speech that he believes that changes should be made to conditions applying to the registration of **women** for the unemployment benefit.

* Why else would the honourable gentleman have complained that **women** are not entitled to benefits, to quote his words, 'if their husbands have any sort of job '?

* Why else would the honourable gentleman have described his commitments as, again to quote his words, 'the basic goals of a Labor government for **women**'?

* Some indication of the expenses involved can be drawn from the fact that if all married **women** under the age of 60 years not at present in the work force applied for and received the proposed benefit, the Commonwealth would have to pay out some $3,300m.

* A very significant amount of money would go to **women** whose husbands were in the upper income bracket.

* I am advised also that the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to make child care services available even to **women** who are not working could involve an additional cost of the order of $200m.

* Many **women** argue this way: Whilst they are involved, why should men make decisions involving the lives of many **women** in this private and sensitive area?

* I apologise for the fact that, we have not got more **women** in this Parliament who probably could assist us in making these difficult and sensitive decisions that are going to affect many thousands of young people.

* I am conscious of the filth of rape, incest and all the other atrocities committed against young **women** but that does not outweigh the right to live, the right to be born and take a chance in this complicated world.

When and how did he become aware that the Queensland Government had decided in July 1976 not to pass on any Federal funds for **women** 's refuges.

* That is particularly the case because so many married **women** feel they still have a lot to contribute and would like to be involved in working.

* They are that there has been a substantial increase in the number of young **women** finding it difficult to get jobs because those increasing numbers of jobs are being filled by married **women**.

* However, I believe that there are problems which we need to face in respect of unemployed **women**.

* The problems have emerged largely from the desire of so many **women** to participate in the work force.

* I would be the first to concede that perhaps in years past there has been an undue bias in that direction and what ideally speaking we ought to achieve is a situation where, with proper regard to the interests of children, **women** are in a position to exercise a choice as to whether they should fulfil a full-time wife and mother role or only a parttime one.

* The proposition that is inherent in the amendmentI think it needs to be recognised- is that in the process of redressing the balance we might have gone a bit too far and we may be effectively closing off, not only in this legislation but in other legislation that affects the relationship in marriage between men and **women**, the option of the full time wife and mother role.

* It should be remembered that about 190,000 ex-servicemen and **women** receive their pension under this rate at percentages ranging from 10 to 100.

Contraceptives are provided free by the Welfare Division of the Northern Territory Administration to Aboriginal **women** where contraceptives are required on medical advice or where a woman wishes to plan her family and would otherwise be unable  to  do so for economic reasons.

* The nation should grieve that after 21 years of Liberal-Country Party government pleas such as those that have been made in this chamber today are now required to be made for the men and **women** who have served this country so well on rural holdings, maintaining the economic life of this country, in this instance 1 think that the saying too little too late should be repeated.

* However, within this general increasing percentage of non-smokers, discontinuing smokers in the older age groups are offset by large numbers 'of schoolchildren smokers and **women** smokers who are acquiring the habit.

* This category includes some **women** caring for invalid parents or other relatives, some migrants not residentially qualified for normal pensions and certain unmarried mothers.

* The people who are hurt by the shakeout that this Government has caused are the men and **women** who have turned to the stock exchange because of their past faith in the future of this country.

* We believe that country people should not be discriminated against any more than their city cousins, whether they be isolated children seeking an education, country **women** who have to travel long distances to seek medical help, farmers seeking to improve their productivity and thus contributing to national growth, or rural city and town businessmen and wage earners providing necessary goods and services and some offset against the -growth of the major metropolises of Australia.

* That is not to say that it is not a problem for Australian men and **women** but at least it puts it in the perspective which the Opposition does not provide.

* I have not talked about the most important part of our defence force- the men and **women** of our services.

* But really, even the very matter to which he referred - the arrest of the **women** in Victoria - originally came under the Victorian Police Offences Act 1915.

* Thousands of ex-servicemen and **women**, the disabled, the handicapped, and later the crippled children, knew and recognised her concern for them.

* Many of the young Aboriginal men and **women** - particularly the young men who normally would have been employed in the pastoral industry - are now coming to the large cities of Queensland and the capital city of Brisbane seeking work.

* Probably the most conspicuous outward manifestation of this phenomena has been the emancipation of **women** which, on the part of the younger generation particularly, has led to a complete reassessment of their role in society as partners in marriage, as parents of the family and as individual people.

* I am not prepared to vote to perpetuate the undignified role of the professional snooper for the necessity to establish fault and I am not prepared to vote to see the many thousands of unhappily married men and **women** throughout Australia condemned to the protracted anguish and inhumanity inherent in the present law.

* In fact she is one of the most outstanding **women** I have ever met.

* As far as the Government is concerned, **women** in the work force are second rate workers and represent cheap labour.

* The State insists that by thus guaranteeing the general public against books not too rugged for grown men and **women** in order to shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general welfare.

* Maybe expenses don 't worry  Tammie  Fraser, but they certainly worry me and thousands of other **women** like me.

* Two representatives of each **women**'s health centre in Australia.

* I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service a question further to my question last Tuesday on the control by the unions of employment of **women** in Broken Hill.

* Currently, there are 62 **women**'s refuges approved for Commonwealth financial assistance.

* These are located as follows: 
-What the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  just said is completely untrue; but let me tell him that if I had just had a party with 20 **women** and I was seeking a eunuch to stand guard over them I would not ask the honourable member for Hindmarsh to fulfil that role.

* That is the face of the one who is cunningly and crudely convincing nations that nationalism is outlived, that religion is the affair of old **women**, and that the family is old-fashioned.

* The object of the United World Colleges, which I can remember his speaking to me about when I was Minister for Education more than 10 years ago, is to bring young men and **women** from many different countries together, to create an understanding between them, to create an understanding of their different countries, of their different histories and of their different cultures and hoping by that means to inspire, possibly, potential future leaders of countries and thereby to avoid some of the fears and some of the hatred and suspicion which can so often lead to war and to the disaster of war which Lord Mountbatten knew and understood better than most.

* Then, of course, there is the issue of **women**'s rights.

* I wonder what those involved in the financially pinched working **women**'s centre in Melbourne would say about the following: 
The Government is firmly committed to furthering equality of opportunity for **women** in education, employment, and in public life.

* Let us look at wage indexation and the Arbitration Court in relation to what this Government has done; the castration of the Regional Employment Development scheme and the National Employment and Training scheme; the promise of anti-union legislation; the nastiness shown towards the Aboriginal community; the haranguing of social service recipients and tertiary education students; the disregard for the status of **women**, community health and urban planning; and the mutilation of Medibank.

* The most odious of reasons for some people having to leave their employment is that of sexual intimidation which young **women** sometimes find is imposed upon them by some employers.

* They live in areas which have produced a disproportionate number of our top class sports men and **women**.

* It is interesting to note that in the vicinity of 194,400 ex-service men and **women** are in receipt of the general rate pension.

* It is easily seen when 1 quote from Hansard of 23rd May the following 3 questions I asked of the Minister for Repatriation and the answers he gave: 
How many ex-servicemen and **women** receive the general rate war pension.

* The introduction of the proposed free of means test age pensions for persons of 65 or more years will not alter the position of people who are now  eligible  or may become eligible for pensions on a means tested basis, for example, **women** aged 60 years to 64 years, and widows and invalids who are residentially qualified for pension, and exservicemen aged 60 to 64 and ex-servicewomen aged 55 to 64 who have served in a theatre of war.

* The service pension is granted to exservicemen and **women** 5 years earlier in each case than the civilian age pension is granted.

* But in this instance, in the free of means test proposal, the ex-servicemen and **women** will be disregarded unless they are over 65 years of age.

* If the rigours of war were bad enough to warrant a service pension to men at 60 years of age instead of 65, and to **women** at 55 years of age instead of 60, surely it is good enough to grant them a free of means test pension 5 years earlier than the Government proposes to grant it to civilians.

* It is a wonder that the Women's Liberation Movement has not taken up this matter because it shows discrimination against **women**.

* The incentive has to be found to encour age migrant **women**, migrant men and their children to learn the English language.

* She communicated with prominent people, clergymen, **women** police, doctors and social workers.

* There is not much difference between ourselves and British people but the only affinity between ourselves and most Turks is the colour of our skin In religion, in political view, in social habit, in attitude to their **women** - 'the sub.jection of their **women** - in their skills and in their language, they have no affinity whatsoever with us.

* It had even become aware of the possibility that aid programs aimed at helping a whole community might unintentionally worsen the position of **women**.

* After all, tractors mean less digging for the men but can mean twice as much weeding for the **women** in these poorer parts of the world.

* The Tasmanian Government has decided to amend the Public Service Act to permit female officers to retire at 65 if they so desire but not yet to remove the restriction on the employment of married **women**.

* Will the Minister give similar thought to our young men and **women** who, through conscience, do not wish to join a trade union or to pay a political levy?

* All one can say is that it is a cynical exercise in sexism to use **women** as an investment stimulus for the Government's own shabby economic package.

* Both **women** have to look after their families.

* It will go a long way towards training **women** to return to work and to earn money to keep their families.

* It seeks to give the right to vote to men and **women** citizens of 18, 19 and 20 years of age.

* In particular he said the Country-Liberal Party would encourage the involvement of Territory **women** in future town planning, recognising the importance of this work in relation to the social environment.

* I have some figures relating to the 3 areas of imports- men's outer wear, **women**'s woven apparel and knitwear excluding tops.

* In 1975 4.7 million units of **women**'s woven apparel entered this country.

* Can he say whether the Labour Department in the United States of America releases figures of jobless rates for many groups in the labour force such as teenagers, adult men, married men, adult **women**, married **women**, black workers and white workers.

* My question, which is directed to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, concerns the plight of unemployed **women** and men who are suffering hardship as a result of 3 years of economic mismanagement by the former Labor Government.

* Unfortunately, there are a good many men, **women** and children in this industry in Australia who are probably as impoverished as any other sector of the Australian community.

* We see them kill 50 000 to 60 000 defenceless **women** and children just because they did not agree with their philosophy and they claimed that it was a threat to their security.

* In fact, they have for so many years been neglected by previous governments and starved by State governments that it is a wonder that the men and **women** who voluntarily service local government bodies have had any enthusiasm left to give.

* Anything I might say in criticism of local government should not be taken as a criticism of the dedicated men and **women** who serve in the cities, shires and municipalities of Australia.

* Loan Council representation would be the final and complete answer, the answer that will make worthwhile the work that the men "and **women** of Australia perform on local councils.

* Thus we come to the basic differences in philosophical stance between the Government on the one hand and men and **women** who support the Labor Party on the other hand.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Department of Repatriation and Compensation since 2 December 1972.

* One good reason for not doing so is that little more than one-half of the people who vote on election day are **women** and **women** are starting to stand up on their hind legs - if they have hind legs; I do not know what **women** do - and demand some proper recognition.

* I think that many honourable gentlemen opposite who are smiling at this idea of **women** standing up for their rights might find that they will lose either their smile or their seat after the next election if they do not pay proper heed to what **women** are thinking.

* I am greatly in the debt of the honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Riordan)  for the superb role that he has played and is playing in bringing about equal pay for **women** in the Public Service.

* The Government has taken steps to give **women** a better deal than they have ever had before in the question of maternity leave.

* Again the Government decided to intervene on the side of **women** to ensure that they received the same pay as men.

* I think we all ought to express our indebtedness to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which in its recent judgment decided that the increase in the total wage of $2.50 plus 24 per cent should apply to men and **women** alike.

* For example, equal pay has been given to **women** in the civil service.

* That they welcome the statements by the honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
No.

* These **women** are provided for under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act.

* The working men and **women** and their organisations- organised labour- will not blithely accept this latest assault upon their very existence.

* No legislation will prevent men and **women** from organising themselves for survival.

* The thought was that it might be specific broadcasting for **women** or a **women**'s broadcast station.

* In fact I think that the amendment may in reality as a principle tend to downgrade the status of **women**.

* I do not believe that it is and neither do the **women** in Australia, who represent 50 per cent of the population.

* Many **women** with families were paying almost no taxation after the normal concessions.

* One of the great issues in this debate which concerns me is whether a motion such as the original motion or this amendment will have the effect of discriminating against poor **women** as against other **women** who can perhaps afford abortions.

* Women are severely beaten and families neglected.

* Fancy suggesting that **women** ought to regard cosmetics and toiletries as luxuries.

* Cosmetics are as much a necessity to most **women** as are clothes.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Department of Agriculture since 2 December 1972.

* As honourable members will recall, I was saying that again our actions in the field of repatriation have demonstrated a deep desire on behalf of the Australian Labor Party to see that our ex-service men and **women** receive the benefits to which they are justly entitled.

* There is no doubt in my mind that since 1972 the Australian Labor Party Government has demonstrated far more readily its interest in the welfare of our returned service men and **women** than did the previous government.

* 3) 1975 be made an order of the day for a later hour this day I now move: 
How many **women** were using oral contraceptives in each of the last 5 years and what percentage was this number of all **women** aged 18 to 45 years at 31st December of the year in question.

* How many **women** does he expect to be using oral contraceptives on 31st December 1973 and what percentage is this number of all **women** who will be aged 18 to 45 years on that date.

* What is the cost of a month's supply of prescribed oral contraceptives to **women** who buy (a) monthly, (b) every 2 months and (c) every 6 months and what was the cost in each case a year ago.

* They were **women**, for whom it is hardest to find employment in provincial areas.

* Forty **women** have been dismissed from the Pelaco factory in Geelong and this is a serious loss of employment opportunities for females in the area.

* -My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs.

* With the recent international success of films such as  Caddie  which received financial assistance during the International Women's Year, can the Minister inform the House whether anything further is being done to ensure a continuing contribution by **women** to the Australian film industry?

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and thai, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned- 
I thank the House.

* The Mascot CES office estimated that 3/ per cent of the men registered and 50 per cent of the **women** are migrants.

* At all the inner Sydney CES offices, over 75 per cent of the males registered and over 90 per cent of the **women** registered are unskilled or semi-skilled workers.

* The range of communications that has suffered as a result of this Government's Budget strategy goes to the very areas of my responsibility as spokeman for the Oppositionsuch areas as bilingual education, the education of migrant **women**, the Public Service and migrant services generally.

* The feeling against the Bill is not confined to any one section of the community; it runs high and wide, and is shared by all concerned - men and **women**, labourers and professional men, doctors and lawyers, rich and poor and young and old.

* Then we are told that only **women** should be responsible for the decision to destroy the foetus.

* To say that **women** should have the say as to whether abortion on demand is legalised is as ridiculous as saying that only criminals should say what facilities should be provided to prisoners in gaols.

* That I have employed some attractive **women**- **women**, more unfairly misrepresented about this nation than any other people in it, who have served me with a loyalty and dedication that I have not experienced up to now, and I do not intend to be intimidated about any one of them.

* Certain achievements this year have been especially symbolic of our whole philosophyour legislation against racial discrimination, our work for **women**, our vigorous and successful policies for environmental protection, and our 30 per cent increase in our foreign aid program.

* We shall mark the 26th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights next Tuesday by becoming a party to 2 significant international conventions on the civil rights of **women**, the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women.

* No government has done more for those most in need, for the working man and his family, for **women** and children.

* Within hours of taking office we reopened the wage case to secure equal pay for **women**.

* In May this year we supported the extension of the adult minimum wage to **women**.

* I have at Maitland in my electorate the big Bradmill Industries Ltd textile mill employing 1,350 men and **women**.

* Together with mills throughout Australia they employ 120,000 men and **women**.

* Does the Government propose to introduce legislation to rationalise the old maintenance and married **women**'s property legislation in force in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, and to consolidate it in the Family Law An.

* Quite apart from the economic damage caused by that decision and quite apart from the wholesale assault on those industries, what concerns me far more than all of them is the indifference that was shown on that occasion to the individual men and **women** in those industries.

* What a callous, indifferent and heartless attitude that was towards the ordinary men and **women** working in those industries whom the Labor Party continually pretends that it represents.

* For instance, the very much wider range of job opportunities available to **women** nowadays must mean that many young **women** who only a few years ago would have chosen nursing as a career now choose other work.

* The Labor Party is supposed to be taking the lead in seeking equal pay for **women**, equal opportunity and so on.

* He went on to say that Chrysler Was having to relax its age limits for vacancies and was taking on more **women** workers.

* For **women** who now find themselves or their children suffering from the effects of Stilboestrol, is it the Government, the doctor or the drug manufacturer who takes responsibility for their predicament.

* Will the Government establish a register of these **women**.

* If the Minister carries out the intention which he expressed in his original Press statement and pays the widow's pension to these people it seems likely that we will have many **women** coming to Australia for the purpose of giving birth and having their offspring qualified, or qualifying themselves, for widow's pensions.

* What kind of men and **women** make up this Goverment when all they can do is to sit around the Cabinet table and devise such a scheme?

* The proposal embodied in the Bill will confer eligibility for a loan on all servicemen and **women** engaged after 16 August 1977 when they have completed six years full-time continuous service and are committed to further service either through the conditions of the initial engagement or re-engagement.

* Older people in the community still talk of returning to the scene of those atrocities and of still hearing the cries of **women** and children coming out of the land.

* What number of (a) indigenous men, (b) expatriate men, (c) indigenous **women** and (d) expatriate **women** are (i) sponsored by the Administration at each tertiary institution in Papua New Guinea and (ii) assisted to attend tertiary institutions in Australia.

* I pointed out the other day - I believe it to be accurate - that if men or **women** lose their jobs in the textile industry in metropolitan areas they are able to find other employment.

* I also noted that there are some country towns - in particular, I said, in Victoria and the Hunter Valley - where at the present time alternative employment is not readily available for **women** who lose their jobs in the textile industry.

* As I said a moment ago, the Opposition recognises that special courses are required to improve the knowledge of union officials and potential union officials' in areas such as the various industrial Acts, the tribunals -especially the working of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission- the preparation and presentation of cases, the conduct of negotiations, the role of the job delegate, how to run an office, the growing importance of **women** in the work force with the majority of them being married, and so on.

* It should be the objective of courses to ensure a fair representation of, for example, the rank and file, and a fair representation of **women**.

* I am glad that this discrimination against **women** and that most essential role of the housewife and mother have been recognised by the Government.

* Discrimination against **women** in the assessment of the sickness benefit has also been removed.

* First Offenders ( Women ) Ordinance, 1 947 ss.

* We need the skill, awareness, concern and courage of men and **women** of goodwill if we are to succeed in overcoming our urban problems.

* We need men and **women** of goodwill to work in the spirit of partnership and co-operation.

* We are told that at 8 p.m. there were 614 guests, including notable politicians, a dozen or so Sirs', several millionaires and 2 **women**.

* They have gone for **women**'s lib in a big way.

* Yet he does not mention that his proposal would mean that **women** would go to the public hospitals and obtain abortions free of charge in public wards.

* But what about providing those very important support services for pregnant **women** in need?

* Is this not one of the best means of ensuring that **women** do not have abortions and that they keep their children?

* But when the Whitlam Government provided the supporting mothers benefit for single **women**, conservatives in this community- the wowsers- went around saying that we were encouraging **women** to have children out of wedlock.

* To the contrary, we were helping young **women** to keep their children.

* But can honourable members imagine this Government providing funds to improve and increase the support services for pregnant **women**?

* Given the quality of the men, and possibly the **women**, who will serve on this Commission, one can surely leave it to their judgment and their discretion as to how often they will have to meet to consider the work that obviously they will have to do.

* Further, the Bill proposes an easing of residence qualifications for **women** who apply for a widow's pension or a supporting mother's benefit.

* This involves a series of volunteers who can be trained to take the language into the homes of migrant womenfolk so that they are adopted as the **women**'s teachers and of course as their friends.

* This is a new initiative, very much overdue, to try to break the barriers of loneliness and isolation which have beset so many **women** who have come to our shores over the years.

* Honourable members opposite ought to pay a visit to the occasional care centres and have a look at the houses which have been made available to **women**'s groups to provide care for children whose parents are in special need.

* A **women**'s refuge has been set up.

* Telephones give families, particularly the **women** and children, a sense of security so necessary in remote areas.

* It is relatively easy for men to live in the bush, but for our **women** and children it is a lot harder.

* Is it a fact that professional and other working **women** who require domestic help in the house, or for child minding purposes, are unable to claim such costs as a deduction against taxable income?

* If this is so, does this discriminate against **women** or are males also denied such deductions?

* A marked result of this has been the flow of married **women** into the work force.

* It was also due to the fact that few of these **women** are counted as members of the work force until they have a job.

* Largely as a result of the size of the flow of married **women** into the work force, the supply of labour during the last 5 years has been growing faster than the demand for labour.

* Another factor may have been the different composition of unemployment in this recession; increased job opportunities for **women** led to a rise in female participation rates while the greater relative decline in the manufacturing sector, in particular, led to a rise in the level of male unemployed, the latter being less likely to leave the labour force.

* It also appears to express regret that, unlike **women**, men do not leave the labour force when they lose their jobs.

* Let us look at other social welfare programs, such as the programs for single mothers, deserted wives, **women**'s shelters, **women**'s clinics, nursing homes and so on.

* I would also refer the Minister to surveys of married **women** who are wives of members of the Electrical Trade Union.

* These surveys, done in 1971, indicated that 96 per cent of the **women** would prefer to stay at home with their children, certainly until they reach the age of three and many said until they reach the age of five.

* In that State single accommodation is provided for single **women** after a long waiting period, but lack of finance prevents such accommodation being provided for single men.

* I would say that it applies to the **women**, because in these isolated areas of Australia, if there is one group that has suffered over the years, it has been the **women**.

* In the mail this morning I received a letter from  Mrs Lois  Welsh, the Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Women's Committee of the Australian Labor Party which sat last weekend.

* The Women's Committee has appealed to me.

* AH these **women** get is an increment of 50c to $15.50 a week, which falls some $6 a week below the 50 per cent of the minimum wage sought by the RSL.

* I believe that, as a result of the gallant and brave actions of some **women** in Victoria in going to gaol in protest against the destroying of human life and in the hope that others might live, there will be more demonstrations by the mothers of our nation against our involvement in Vietnam.

* The **women** of Australia have woken up to the evil of conscripting their sons to serve in Vietnam and will not allow themselves to be used as the producers of gun fodder and to be reduced virtually to receptacles for man's bloody lust.

* Men and **women** who work in the retail industry, the rural industry, the construction industry, the tourist industry and the Public Service have said to me that it is very important for Australia to get back on its feet, for us to wrestle with inflation and bring it back to a level that is acceptable to the men and **women** of Australia.

* This is particularly so with **women** who do not have the same opportunities as men.

* Another is conducted at Enterprise, the migrant hostel in my electorate, butI am thinking mainly of the non-English speaking migrant **women**.

* Migrant **women** who are having difficulty with English are not anxious to attend large classes in public for various reasons, including embarrassment.

* Such **women**, however, are more inclined to attend a small private class for numbers between 5 and 10.

* Such a class was established last year in Doveton in my electorate at the local infant welfare centre where **women** could attend and leave their babies under the care of the infant welfare teacher.

* As a result of the imprisonment of those **women** for 14 days for a trivial, insignificant offence, as far as I could discover - and nothing that the Minister has said today in any way contradicts that - I decided that from the point of view of civil rights and civil liberties this was going too far.

* As far as I can make out, we did exactly what those 5 **women** did.

* The Prime Minister wrote to all State Premiers in December 1972 advising them that the Commonwealth Government would lower the franchise age for all men and **women** to 18 years early in the sittings of the new Parliament.

* Although the distribution of 18 to 20 year old persons is not yet available electorate by electorate, the Commonwealth Statistician estimates that there are almost 700,000 young Australian men and **women** in this category, all of whom will be entitled to the franchise under this measure.

* The article in the  Age  records that more than half of the migrant **women** taking the first conversion course, primary school teachers with overseas teaching qualifications, will be forced to give up their studies because of the Government's cut in the National Employment and Training scheme allowance.

* Under the Labor Government the **women** doing the course were clearing $83.60 a week, most of which was spent on child care and housekeeping costs.

* As a result of the callousness of the new Government, married **women** whose husbands earn more than $70.50 will receive the princely sum of $23.40 a week.

* -I ask the Minister for Finance: Did he say on Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday, 9 March, that married **women** are responsible for much unemployment among males?

* Is it the Government's aim to ensure that there are jobs for all married **women** who want work or does it have an alternative aim?

* The report pointed out that employment would be reduced in those industries as follows: Women's and girls' blouses and frocks, 8 per cent; **women**'s and girls' outer wear, 7.6 per cent; hosiery, 6.9 per cent; household textiles, 5.9 per cent; textile floor coverings, 4.6 per cent; men's trousers and work clothing, 8.1 per cent; men's suits, coats and waterproof clothing, 9.6 per cent; and underwear, nightwear, shirts, 7.7 per cent.

* I would suggest that the members of that Assembly are a team of the most competent men and **women**.

* This will be of particular assistance to married **women** who wish to undertake training, particularly married **women** in the low income groups who have a desire to undertake training but would like to relate that desire to their family responsibilities.

* I was told in Alice Springs of examples of tribal **women** who were brought into hospitals for treatment.

* The **women** were taught how to prepare a bottle for the baby because it was inconvenient in the rigid system of the hospital to have the baby still breast feeding.

* The Government should be training men and **women** who can assist the Aborigines themselves to develop their own skills and to develop their own determination to work for themselves in order to enable them to own and operate a considerable part of this country.

* In respect of two halls of residence - the Women's Hall of Residence at the University of Tasmania and a hall of residence to be known as Roberts Hall at Monash University - unavoidable delays in planning meant that the amounts of State funds expended on these projects up to 31st December 1969 were insufficient to attract the full Commonwealth grant.

* The amounts involved are $47,241 in respect of the Women's Hall of Residence at the University of Tasmania and $454,930 in respect of Roberts Hail at Monash University.

* Women have great difficulty.

* There is a tradition in this country that **women** do not take on trades courses.

* -I ask the Minster for Defence: Is it a fact that the Government is preparing to re-introduce compulsory military service, both for men and for **women**?

* We would be derelict in our responsibility to the people of Australia if we did not exert all the influence available to us through the proper constitutional processes not to say who will govern this country but to give the average men and **women** of Australia an opportunity to vote- a basic right of people in a democracy and a basic right that this Prime Minister seeks to deny.

* Does the Australian Labor Party not regognise the right of **women** to be in charge of a ward?

* Does it not wish to defend the rights of **women**?

* The honourable member for Casey  (Mr Mathews),  supported by the honourable mem ber for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  has seen fit to shape and fashion their motion 4 times, the last literally in the eleventh hour, using various kinds of plastic surgery in the process, desperately trying to camouflage the original and basic concern - that of the right or otherwise of **women** to have legalised abortion.

* Essentially the amendment recommends that we examine the role of **women** in our society and I say it is high time that this was done, but not just in the narrow confines of an inquiry that would reduce **women** to mere curio objects.

* I do not claim that sex, pregnancy and abortion are not important to **women** or, for that matter, to men.

* But I do argue that there is much more to this problem than merely determining whether or not **women** should have the sole prerogative of deciding to terminate a pregnancy.

* It fails to examine the much wider implications involved that cause **women** not to want babies after they have already conceived.

* It shows compassion, honesty and, above all, common sense when it refuses to accept abortion as an isolated phenomenon, almost as though it was the result of an unfortunate oversight by **women**, something we men must nobly allow them to have - a sort of social pardon.

* In our rich and lucky country, the number of **women** who have had children but are experiencing economic problems is far greater than the number of abortions in any one year.

* Are we to worry only about those who, for one reason or another, want to terminate their pregnancy; or are we prepared to examine the implications of their decisions and their circumstances, and to help all **women**, pregnant or not, married or not, aborting or not, as befits my and my Party's socialist principles and beliefs?

* When we investigate, in accordance with the amendment, all circumstances relating to abortion and children and families, I hope we will also find time to spare a thought for those **women** who prefer to have their unplanned, possibly illegitimate babies rather than face an abortion.

* If these **women** need help, we should give it to them; if the babies require medical, social or welfare assistance, they are entitled to it.

* The role of **women** in society, their status in the world and their economic equality are at stake - not merely their reproductive problems.

* The amendment, in my view, ensures that any inquiry ordered by the House would benefit greatly all **women** in this country, not just the minority who may seek abortion.

* If we can make the lot of **women**, children and families any easier and their lives any happier, surely even the most shortsighted and cynical male will be lucky enough to derive residual benefits from such a changed world.

* I wish also to express my thanks to the various organisations of exservicemen and **women** whose members put in a tremendous amount of honorary time and work to help fight the cause of their fellow ex-servicemen and **women**.

* It seems extraordinary that the simple act of terminating the pregnancy immediately restored to sound mental health over 3,500 South Australian **women** in one year.

* The state of mental health of most of these **women** was such that they required no psychiatric treatment, they required no admittance to a mental institution, they required no follow-up treatment or consultation.

* In addition, Council recommended precautionary measures for persons engaged in the manufacture and use of 2,4,5T and that special precautions should be taken to avoid the exposure of **women**, especially those in the child-bearing age group to 2,4,5T.

* The Griffith Co-Operative Cannery Ltd last season gave employment to 180 **women**, that is, 3 shifts of 60 **women** each.

* I believe that it was right and proper that this Government allowed single men the same right as we have allowed single service **women** to buy defence homes.

* We do not want to be discriminating against men any more than we do against **women**.

* The honourable member thinks that married **women** go to work just to wear out their old clothes.

* He ignores the fact that in most cases- certainly it is the case in my electorate- if married **women** are working they are doing so to sustain the income of the family and not to keep kids out of work.

* There is a feature of this whole issue which has been overlooked frequently in this debate and that is that the vast majority of Australian men and **women**- three out of four employees- work in the private sector.

* The ordinary men and **women** of Australia, the employees of Australia, whom the Labor Party pretends it represents in this place, work in relationships with their employers subject, in effect, to what on many occasions is little more than the whim of the employer.

* The report of the working party on homeless men and **women** estimated that in 1973 approximately 25,000 people in Australia were homeless.

* The report on the survey conducted recently by the Department of Social Security- I refer to the booklet entitled 'A Place of Dignity' which is the report on a survey of homeless people and homeless persons assistance centres- opened with the comment that an estimated 10,000 homeless men and **women** in Australia were being assisted by welfare agencies.

* lt increases company tax by 2] per cent on all levels, lt increases substantially the age allowance made to **women** over 60 years of agc and men over 65 years of age to a point where a person entitled to an age allowance can earn a net income - that is, income less deductions - of $1,326 a year before any taxation is payable.

* How many people, men and **women**, are in each category.

* This work value study is immensely important for the whole status and remuneration of Australian servicemen and **women**.

* It is to be hoped that the Committee's recommendations will be brought quickly before the Government and transmitted to the thousands of servicemen and **women** who will benefit by better pay and conditions.

* The Government has apparently costed this proposal on the basis of **women** not using the plastic intra-ulterine device but the old fashioned gold stem intra-uterine device.

* The Government seems to think that under a Labor Government **women** would be able to afford this.

* Under existing conditions **women** whose husbands die overseas may qualify for a widow's pension immediately on their return to Australia if they have resided here for a continuous period of not less than 10 years at any time.

* However, cases have arisen where Australian **women** have been widowed on account of desertion or divorce while residing overseas and, upon their return to Australia have had to wait a period of 5 years before becoming eligible for widow's pension, notwithstanding that they may have lived in Australia for most of their lives.

* The honourable gentleman talked about our seeking to require both men and **women** to vote and that that could be at variance with Aboriginal practices.

* I understand that it is in some parts of Australia at least, but he should note that there is no obligation for Aboriginal **women** to vote or for Aboriginal men to vote in this situation unless they choose to do so.

* I agree that it may well be that at times men and **women** may prefer  to  meet at such centres rather than have the meals delivered to their homes.

* Does anybody suggest, therefore, that the **women**'s Services have no discipline and are completely destroyed because they are not subject to this law.

* What about adopting a positive resolution on what we can do for **women** in order to guarantee that they can retain a child and not be subjected to the physical and mental disturbances that obviously occur?

* Let us look at the facts as to what is practical in relation to how we can help **women** in need.

* Over the years it has employed 18,000 or 19,000 men and **women**.

* The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation today is employing some 2,700 men and **women**.

* There is no objection to their being used otherwise, provided that this specific purpose is not disturbed because the men and **women** whom the Repatriation Department was instituted to assist have, through their actions in defence of this country, earned the right to receive this assistance.

* I am sure that all members of this House will be pleased with the 12 men and **women** who have been chosen by the Government to form the first National Youth Advisory Group.

* The seven young men and five young **women** represent Australia geographically, ethnically and racially.

* It will be imposed on the **women** in the work force.

* The Acting Treasurer shakes his head with that sort of economic wisdom that comes from success as chief floorwalker in **women**'s underwear in David Jones.

* We must remember that this type of disaster is measured in the loss of jobs by Australian men and **women**.

* If an industry is considered to be non-essential, inefficient or necessary to be closed in the light of the Brussels Definition of Value, I believe that a warning should be given to that industry and alternative arrangements for employment made for the men and **women** whose jobs would be affected.

* Women would move to the States in order to ensure that they could take advantage of the State laws.

* I think he did so wisely in the interests of **women**.

* He said: 
The accused must have an honest belief on reasonable grounds that what they did was necessary to preserve the **women** involved from serious danger to their life, or physical or mental health, which the continuance of the pregnancy would entail, not merely the normal dangers of pregnancy and childbirth, and that in the circumstances the danger of the operation was not out of proportion to the danger intended to be averted.

* I believe it is a very wise and civilised judgment, sympathetic to the cause of **women**, and I believe that it is designed to do good rather than harm.

* States support propositions that I believe are right at law in the interest of **women** and in the best interests of a tolerant and concerned society.

* It would be a disgrace to humanity and a disgrace for this Parliament to allow such legislation go through which would mean that **women**, because they had a simple curette or some other internal operation, must have a certificate signed and have all of the facts associated with the operation made known and recorded day after day.

* I believe that it is the **women**, not the men, who are under stress in these cases.

* I believe that **women** must receive special understanding, sympathy and care.

* I find it strange and unacceptable that men should make such savage judgments on **women**.

* Australia faces another indomitable foe- a shortage of skilled men and **women**.

* Employers have for some time had insufficient encouragement to increase their apprentice intake despite the shortage of skilled men and **women** in the trades.

* The total number of people in that electorate with a bachelor degree was 2,043 men and 1,115 **women**.

* The number of those with a higher degree was 386 men and 123 **women**.

* He appears to see no significance in the fact that over the 12 months to May 1970 the number of married **women** in the employed work force increased by no less than 9.8 per cent.

* It talks of the unfortunate English gentleman named Alfred Beck who was picked out in identification parades by 12 **women**, served 7 years and was released.

* As the offences which society was complaining about and wrongly thought Beck was guilty of continued, he was again picked out in a subsequent parade by 4 **women**, was convicted and was awaiting sentence when the real villain was apprehended.

* 1 ) Within the scope of policy, provision exists for sportsmen and **women** in the top levels of their sport to be considered for change of status if they meet certain migrant criteria, are considered to be economically viable, and their presence here contributes to the advancement of their sport and to the benefit of aspiring players in Australia.

* Applications for permanent residency from other sportsmen and **women** who have been here since 1975 would be considered on their individual merits, allowing for such factors as marriage to an Australian resident, family disposition and ability to maintain themselves without recourse to dependence on social welfare.

* It is recognised that sportsmen and **women** over a period of 4 years in Australia would develop personal and financial ties.

* As stated, cases presenting special circumstances would be looked at on an individual basis, but there is no intention of relaxing the rules related to change of status for sportsmen and **women** beyond those already outlined.

* There is no reason why sportsmen and **women** who intend to stay in Australia indefinitely or for extended periods should not apply for migrant entry rather than temporary entry at the outset and so obviate a need to seek change of status after arrival.

* Consideration is currently being given to a variation of the rules relating to the issue of temporary entry visas to sportsmen and **women**, which in some instances will limit the numbers being admitted to Australia temporarily, so that Australian residents of equal talent will be given opportunities to enter the higher levels of sports.

* Such an approach, however, would still allow for the temporary entry of sportsmen and **women** whose skills were regarded by the appropriate sporting national body as of benefit to a particular sport.

* Until I get straight and satisfactory answers to all these questions I can only assume that these amendments to the Repatriation Act are a backdoor method of further reducing the prospects of ex-servicemen and **women** and their dependants obtaining just compensation for their war service.

* The 1977 amendments have created some confusion amongst ex-servicemen and **women**, medical practitioners, advocates and the appellants themselves.

* Some of the kids in my electorate of Melbourne, aborigines, **women** who would like to enter the workforce and disadvantaged groups could become as job motivated as the Government likes but there still will not be jobs available for them unless we have a concerted manpower policy which creates jobs and which runs parallel with the schemes which are envisaged.

* The level of youth unemployment is worsening and is particularly bad in relation to young **women**, especially those born overseas.

* A paper produced by the Working Women's Centre of Collins Street, Melbourne, discusses the situation.

* It outlines the grave difficulties being faced, particularly by people born in Australia in the age groups between IS and 19 years and 20 years and over, The figures provided by the Working Women's Centre show that unemployed males in the first group represent 14.5 per cent of the work force, unemployed females represent 16.4 per cent of the labour force, and the total represents 15.4 per cent of the labour force.

* As I read the Bill, it talks about disadvantaged groups but **women** do not rate a mention.

* I have dealt very briefly with the area of **women**'s unemployment.

* The Working Women's Charter Conference of the Australian Council of Trade Unions called for affiliates involved in traditionally male preserves to encourage **women** to move into trade and technical training in those areas.

* It is also apparent that mothers tend to transfer their low expectations on to their daughters; in other words strong cultural forces operate in Australian society to keep many **women** in subservient roles.

* The new job opportunities are not likely to be ones favoured by **women** owing to their outback and /or technological nature.

* The satellite will bring about a discriminatory employment effect on **women** with many put out of work and few new attractive opportunities created.

* I congratulate the Minister for Repatriation  (Mr Holten)  on being able to obtain Cabinet's approval for these substantial increases because I feel that there is no more worthy a group than those servicemen and **women** who have been repatriated.

* These are practical examples of the Government's desire to help the lot of the pensioners and repatriated servicemen and **women**.

* Every" man is worthy of his hire, and if we are to attract men and **women** of quality to participate in local government we must ensure that they are compensated adequately for their time and efforts.

* It is vital that these dedicated men and **women** in control of the local government scene - the area of government closest to the people - retain autonomy of their areas of responsibility.

* and (2) Australian Government assistance for the redevelopment of Launceston General Hospital and for the construction of a new **women**'s hospital in Hobart have been the subject of correspondence between the Tasmanian Minister for Health, Social Welfare and Road Safety and myself.

* Regular Army Volunteer Strength (including Women's Services and CMF on full-time duty but excluding national servicemen, Pacific Islanders and illegal absentees).

* Sometimes the person who brings the meal is the only visitor some elderly people have during the day and I think we owe a great debt of gratitude to those hundreds of **women** throughout Australia who voluntarily go out each day delivering meals and keeping the persons to whom they are delivering the meals in touch with living.

* So this Government, and in fact the Australian community, is heavily indebted to all those **women** who take part in voluntarily delivering meals on wheels.

* Some married **women** who do not need assistance get it; others with the same criteria for eligibility are refused.

* There appears to be some evidence that all married **women** are discriminated against to some degree.

* Women now have equal rights of employment, whether married or single.

* I noticed a few nights ago that the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions was complaining at a big union meeting that no **women** were present.

* It is important that he realise that the men and **women** in the soup queues and the men and **women** who were receiving unemployment benefits were in no way better off for the visit that he made and the time he spent in countries abroad.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a Working Party on Homeless Men and Women, which recommended, amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to 35m per year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects, such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units, in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and **women**.

* That is what was said by honourable members opposite about the granting of equal pay to **women**.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December, 1 972.

* They mowed down 32 men and **women** at Rome Airport.

* From this informed situation I pay very high tribute indeed to the diligence, ability and very high calibre of the men and **women**- there are a number of **women**- who are engaged in every avenue of Customs.

* Why is this House being asked to deny medical benefits to **women** having an operation in accordance with the law of the State in which the operation is performed?

* Some **women** would be tempted to go to cheap 'backyard' abortionists, with a consequent risk of physical injury or even death.

* Many arguments are raised by people of goodwill against the practice of abortion itself, but it is simply not practicable to oblige **women** to have children they do not wish to have, and it is not realistic or fair to argue that if a woman did not want a child she should not have become pregnant in the first place.

* A curious aspect of the cost-saving approach of this motion is highlighted in this morning's Age in an article written by Claude Forell who points out that, on the logic of this motion, medical benefits ought not to be paid to **women** for prenatal treatment or for childbirth unless such treatment is to save the woman's life, as such treatment is not prescribed for the 'physical, pathological condition' described in this motion.

* It also lacks compassion for the **women** who are concerned.

* The public testimony of **women** who have had abortions is that it is painful and traumatic.

* Perhaps, above all, it ill becomes a group of men to tell the **women** of Australia what their responsibilities are and that they should save their housekeeping money to pay for abortions which are deemed by doctors under State laws to be legally necessary in the interests of the woman 's health.

* He will assist the Prime Minister in **women** 's affairs and he will assist the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street).

* I can see the new Minister looking after **women**'s affairs himself.

* With the new Minister having 2 Minister-assisting portfolios and a powerful Minister on top of him, and having to guarantee that he will carry out his duties as Minister - 
At approximately this time last year, after a similar exhibition by the Government, about midday on the last sitting day - after a 1.30 a.m. and a 3.30 a.m. sitting, which is nowhere near as bad as this - we had **women** chaining themselves up in the gallery.

* In regard to those disadvantaged **women** who require an abortion to protect their lives, benefits would be paid if they were bulk billed by their doctors as long as they conformed to the terms of the motion.

* However, one would presume that disadvantaged persons who could not afford to pay the premium- I say this because there has been so much argument that the motion will harm disadvantaged **women**- would not be privately insured in most circumstances.

* More married **women** are either entering the work force or remaining longer in the work force, thus withholding some job opportunities that would otherwise be available to those single females who seek to enter the work force on leaving school.

* Family planning procedures, including abortion, undoubtedly are allowing more married **women** to remain in the work force.

* Although extra jobs have been created during the past three years, the increase in these jobs has not been sufficient to meet the increasing number of married **women** and school leavers seeking jobs.

* Another study to which I can point has concluded that there is structural hidden unemployment of about 150 000 people among **women** in country areas.

* Another vital piece of information for our analysis is that 6.8 per cent of all **women** in the work force were unemployed at the end of May.

* My attention was also drawn to the plight of those Yugoslav **women** who were working in market gardens at Werribee.

* I assure the honourable member that I know first hand that the plight of migrant people in general, but **women** in particular, was the subject of review by a Government committee very recently.

* It is very pleasing to note that the new proposals will extend benefits to, (A), members of the forces on continuous full time service on or after 7th December 1972 who, before or after that date, completed or complete 3 years' effective full time service; (B), a person engaged for full time service of not less than  3  years but who is discharged on medical grounds before completion of 3 years service, unless discharged before the completion of 12 months service; (Q, persons undergoing training at a naval, military or Air Force college who successfully complete their course of training; (D), persons commissioned under the) undergraduate scheme after they have given  3  years' effective service following the completion of their studies; (E), national servicemen and national service officers serving immediately before 7th December who complete the period of service for which they were engaged to serve or who are discharged on medical grounds prior to the completion of their service; (F), to those national servicemen serving at 6th December 1972 who voluntarily chose to complete the period for which they were originally enlisted; and (G), to single and widowed nurses and ex-service **women** without dependants who served overseas with the forces in the 1939-45 War.

* It seems incredible,  Mr Speaker,  that to date representatives of welfare organisations such as the Young Men's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Australian Red Cross Society that served in all theatres of war with distinction, such as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore, have not been recognised and given the opportunity to participate and have the same rights as a returned person under the War Service Homes Act.

* The next most pleasing feature of this Bill is the recognition of the single and widowed nurses and ex-service **women**, without dependents, who served overseas with the forces in the 1939-45 War.

* Its original purpose was to provide homes for servicemen and service **women** returning from the 1914-18 War.

* Since the inception of the war service homes scheme 327,262 ex-servicemen and **women**, and their dependents, have been assisted to acquire, complete or enlarge homes.

* There must have been some fear that there were too many entitlements of **women** who have served so members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women 's Army Service, the Women 's Auxiliary 
Australian Air Force, the Austraiian Army Medical Women's Service and the Voluntary Aid Detachment are specified in this legislation.

* I refer to the imprisonment of 5 **women** in Melbourne following demonstration activities in and around the Princes Gate Melbourne office of the Department of Labour and National Service and to a subsequent demonstration involving the honourable member for Lalor in the same office yesterday.

* Has the Minister seen the statement by the honourable member for Lalor that he and other demonstrators did everything, and more, that the 5 **women** did and that he was subject to cynical and corrupt discrimination in not being similarly dealt with?

* Eligibility for such a loan was also extended to include single and widowed nurses and ex-service **women** without dependants who had previously been debarred from obtaining a war service home.

* After all these years, after all the pain and after all the blood of honest and honourable men and **women** who have done nothing wrong except to wish to live in the South and to be able to make decisions of their own free of the dictates of the communists who control the lives and hearts of all those who are unlucky enough to be under their control, what have we to give and what is our message of sympathy?

* Over 400 Australian men have died in Vietnam and many other Australian men and **women** to this day have the courage of their convictions to stay in Vietnam and to work for those poor people in that country who have lost everything but their desire for life and freedom.

* There is a high percentage of **women** in the work force in those countries as well but the point I should like to make in relation to pro-natalist policies is that the evidence we have so far indicates that they are not likely to be terribly successful and even if they were, the cost to the community of achieving the aims of these pro-natalist policies would be extremely high.

* Rotary clubs, the Country Women's Association, Legacy, Civilian Widows associations, the Returned Services League, Leagues clubs, Meals on Wheels, Red Cross, War Widows associations and the Australian Birthright 
That is an example of the problems I am talking about.

* More importantly, 68 per cent of the students are **women**.

* Clearly, because of this limitation, **women** will suffer a great disadvantage in gaining access to teacher training in the tertiary education field.

* The list of priorities to which the honourable member refers is applied without discrimination to **women** and men alike.

* The National Employment and Training System, by discarding the constraints imposed on **women** by the restrictive criteria of the previous Employment Training Scheme for Women, enables the provision of training on a basis sufficiently flexible to meet the variable needs of **women** as individuals.

* On present estimates some 6,500 **women** are currently being assisted under NEAT.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1972.

* Married and adult single **women** whose domestic responsibilities on the farm have restricted them from seeking job opportunities but who now desire to enter into employment can qualify for training under the employment training scheme for **women** restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities.

* I refer, of course, to the human suffering and enormous loss of production which is represented by the 100,000 men and **women** who cannot find employment.

* Instead of being able to find jobs for all migrants, school leavers and married **women** wishing to re-enter the workforce, our national economy is scarcely capable of maintaining employment for those already employed.

* It is based on a faith in the collective integrity and collective honour of men and **women** in our community.

* I firmly believe, and my experience has shown, that where men and **women** employees of an industry understand that they have made an agreement or commitment to an industrial code, the commitment is almost invariably kept.

* The largest increases in real wages in 1974 flowed to young people by way of increased wages to adult rates and to **women** through the introduction of equal pay.

* It cannot be disputed that the largest areas of unemployment at the present time are with youth and with **women**.

* Certainly it is not going to help immediately the men, **women** and children of whom I spoke a little while ago.

* Irrespective of the fact that the industry asked the Government for $50m- not $20m- and asked for an interest rate not of 1  Vi  per cent but at reasonable commercial rates, the Government must realise that that representation was made months ago and must realise that a reference to the Australian Industries Assistance Commission is not going to provide any help to those men and **women** who have no money to buy their bread, butter, milk, meat and other things they need to eat tomorrow.

* Department of the Environment and Conservation: Appointment of Women  (Question No.

* I can say much more about the maintenance provisions which, despite what has been said by some people, are entirely fair to **women** and protect the rights and status of **women**.

* In a study carried out in Winnipeg in Canada the amount of surgery performed on doctors' wives was compared with that carried out on **women** in the same age group whose husbands were in the same professional bracket and in the same income bracket.

* One of the unfortunate things that has occurred in the Western World in recent times is the necessity for the 2-income or 3-income family because this prevents **women** who wish to stay at home and increase their families from doing so.

* I accept the right of every woman to pursue basically what she wishes to pursue in life consistent with the law, but if **women** are forced through economic circumstances against their will to work when they would prefer to remain at home or to have additional children the resources of our society should be directed where possible to overcome that situation.

* Over 70% of abortions are performed on married **women**.

* Over 25% of all married **women** have an abortion performed at some stage of their married lives.

* We ail knew and expected the **women** to start coming to the casualty department, bleeding, on Friday evening and Saturday morning.

* What of the **women** themselves who, in the main, are married with other children?

* They are related to, associated with, responsible for pregnant **women** no more or less often than any other male in the community.

* Due to the fact that **women** demand the right to have an abortion they will inevitably find some way to achieve this in certain circumstances.

* If a legally qualified medical practitioner is not available some **women** will attempt to induce an abortion on themselves or they will persuade their husbands to try or they will go to some neighbour or backyard abortionist.

* To all this is added the increased risk of infection, severe illness, permanent damage or even death for some **women** when the operations are performed in poor surroundings or by unqualified people.

* Many men and **women** in the community break the law not because they are promiscuous and irresponsible but because they are married, over stressed and desperately seek abortions as the only way out in a perfectly respectable family situation where an unexpected pregnancy threatens the health or welfare of the mother and her whole family.

* Such a law denies a basic freedom to **women**.

* It has been said that if **women** were the legislators then such a law would not be on the statute books.

* Gone are the days when **women** expected to do without sex if they did not wish to have babies.

* Women clearly now refuse to be condemned to have babies as the price for being human and expressing their feelings normally.

* To **women** abortion is not a crime but just another phase of family planning to be utilised rarely but if all other measures have failed.

* A prawn processing factory on Groote Eylandt has very successfully employed up to 36 Aboriginal **women**, a party of whom made a visit to Perth for a holiday under arrangements made by the factory owners.

* The employment of **women** in industry in this way represents a significant change in outlook by the Aboriginal community concerned.

* The study concerned the dental health of **women** attending the antenatal clinic there.

* It was found that fewer than one-third of the **women** were receiving regular dental care, but of those, one-half not receiving regular care had on interest in the state of their teeth.

* The unemployed will be mainly **women**.

* The **women** in country areas and city areas who work in factories are the ones who will suffer and will be out of work.

* that a better society can only be realised by giving the men and **women** of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and freedom.

* The first 50 sites on the list were given extra non-teaching staff, Infant schools and departments received one full-time helper per two classes, one of the positions to be filled by a qualified nursery assistant and the remainder by **women** helpers.

* Extra **women** helper on secretarial assistance was also made available to schools with a high immigrant population.

* Ofthe 34, 9 were **women**.

* The Committee comprises five members- The Assistant Director of Welfare Branch, a representative of Women's Electoral Lobby, National Council of Women and A.C.T.

* In addition, for control purposes the survey covered a group of Aboriginal males with no occupational exposure to asbestos and **women** and children over the age of 12 years living at Baryulgil.

* I say to the people of Whyalla and especially to the **women** of Whyalla and Newcastle that when their husbands come home they should tell them that the Communists are pulling them out to wreck their livelihoods.

* I say to those **women**: 'Follow the example of the **women** in Northern Ireland and go out and march in the streets of Newcastle and Whyalla tomorrow.

* Arrival at adulthood is a most significant point in the developing lives of young men and **women**.

* In like fashion **women** in this country have twice the chance of losing their uterus as have **women** in the United States in services where the doctors are on salary or in the United Kingdom.

* Is the Opposition suggesting that our **women** are twice as unhealthy as the **women** of America and England?

* I think it is a very poor thing that at a time when these proceedings are being broadcast all over Australia a responsible Minister in a national government is willing to say things that were never given in evidence in court against those **women** and which were never suggested to me yesterday by officers of his own Department when I asked what complaints they had about these **women**.

* I was at the Department of Labour and National Service for  2i  hours yesterday and J covered far more of the building than the **women** did.

* Nothing that the Minister has said has suggested that there has not been discrimination in this matter, when 5 **women** whom somebody thought they could intimidate along with a lot of others were imprisoned for 14 days for the purpose of intimidating them and when, for some special reason or other - whether it be political or some kind of view that one can go too far - no action was taken against me.

* In 1977, among **women** aged 1 5-44 - 
In 1 977, among **women** aged 1 5-19 - 
In 1 977, among **women** aged 20-24- 
In summary the statistics show that 40 per cent of all confinements of **women** under the age of 20 resulted in termination of pregnancy.

* Of the 9 members, two will have to be **women**.

* It appears that the Government would rather bribe **women** not to work than live up to its responsibility for providing child care.

* Women are blamed for unemployment figures being so high, along with arguments that wages across the board are too high.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1972.

* East Timorese **women** who are employed in Australia are keeping their husbands who are living in East Timor.

* The Minister might close his eyes to this situation, but later in my speech I will refer to East Timorese **women** who are sending money to East Timor to keep their husbands and whose children are in other countries.

* It is run by a  Dr Thomas  Beck and he has convinced thousands of **women** to take this $ 1 1 8 diet course- the wonder drug diet course.

* This wonder diet involves an injection of hormones taken from pregnant **women** and it is regarded as useless by the experts.

* Dr Beck  regards this as having such great potential that he has actually sought to extract the hormone from the bodies of starving **women** in Bangladesh.

* I say that the Bill is unfair to **women** because it does, unfortunately, give to the man the power of casting off a woman.

* So it is unfair to **women** and it is unfair to men.

* I direct a question to the Minister for Health who will know of a report in today's  Australian  concerning the Liverpool Women's Clinic in New South Wales.

* How much money was granted to the Liverpool Women's Clinic by the former Labor Government?

* I find it abhorrent and an indictment on society that 50,000-odd **women** annually in Australia have need to seek an abortion for whatever reason.

* I am thus led to believe that the reason for this motion is to cause a situation whereby **women** on the lower economic levels would find it relatively more difficult to obtain an abortion than their more affluent sisters.

* Any member who thinks that **women** desperate enough to seek an abortion would resile from that decision because of the non availability of medical benefit fund support or the pious statements of well meaning churchmen or politicians, in my opinion is grievously misjudging the grounds on which the great bulk of **women** need an abortion service.

* My respect for Australian womanhood at large leads me to believe that the great bulk of **women** who seek abortions would rather not.

* The range of possible patients is very wide, as has been spelt out by other speakers- incest cases, rape cases, cancer victims, desperate **women** all.

* A survey shows that Catholic **women** with three or four children make up a high percentage of **women** who seek abortion because of their moral beliefs abour contraception.

* I believe that most of the **women** who are forced to abort would also describe it as such.

* However, if the passing of this motion caused desperate **women**, few or many, to revert for whatever personal reason to seeking cheaper, more hazardous procedures, even self inflicted abortion, then I think that result would be more hideous than abortion itself.

* I find it repugnant that 124 men in this House- no **women**- are passing judgment on **women**'s rights.

* I would not seek to impose my moral judgment on these **women**.

* Women endure abortion, men cause the need.

* If members on the other side were genuinely concerned about ensuring that **women** went on with their pregnancies and had babies, why did not some of them come over and vote against the Budget that took away the lousy $32 maternity allowance?

* 1 ) No data are available for **women** in the workforce with children under 5 years of age.

* However, information relating to **women** in the workforce with children aged 0-5 years, i.e.

* 277,200 **women** in the workforce were responsible for children under 6 years of age, and 
these **women** represented 27.1 per cent of **women** in the population who were responsible for children under 6 years of age.

* We were told that children as young as 8 years of age are being intoxicated; that wives are being beaten up to make them hand over child endowment, and that child endowment increases- the baby money- has been and is being used to buy grog; that charter planes are flying loads of liquor into reserves; that one community passed around a hat on one occasion and that $3,000 was collected in 2 days to buy grog; that husbands are selling **women** to finance liquor supplies.

* It is the hard earned money of people- the men and **women** who have toiled for many hours each week of their working lives to finance government.

* I am reminded of the comment of the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen),  as he now is, in my electorate during the last election campaign, when he said: 
As I explained in my press statement of5th May 1970 when announcing the establishment of the Committee on Women's Employment, the Committee, which is consultative and advisory in character, advises through the National Labour Advisory Council, the Government and the Department of Labour and National Service on questions relating to the employment of **women** in the work force.

* These birth control techniques have introduced a completely new dimension into the role that **women** play in the community at large.

* This new found freedom of **women**- a freedom which allows them to develop their God-given intellect and talents in a way they have never been able to develop them beforemeans that we have to look very seriously at the whole structural relationships of our society, particularly the family structural relationship.

* It also made the point that because the funds are not available there will be no new classes, there will be no effective classes in industry and there will be no **women**'s day classes.

* The day classes for **women** will not be able to continue.

* Why does the 1971-72 report omit such important information as the 1970-71 report gave on the age groups of men and **women** who were unemployed for long periods, the areas in which there were concentrations of men and **women** unemployed for long periods and the number of children in the families of the unemployed?

* Do not believe that Australian equity is the shareholding of Australian men and **women**, because that is not what the Minister is talking about.

* In a comprehensive survey on alcoholism presented to the 29th International Congress on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence at Sydney in 1970, research participants stated that, in Australia, within the age group 15 years and over, approximately 80 per cent of men*, and 70 per cent of **women*** drink alcoholic beverages.

* It further showed that, within the same age group, 5 per cent of men and 1 per cent of **women** were estimated to be alcoholics.

* 1 ) Under what conditions does the Department subsidise the fares of eminent sportsmen and **women** and coaches who visit Australia.

* I told Women's Action Alliance at weekend that the economic value of domestic work should be assessed and recognised in the National Accounts when we are calculating GDP and that housewives should be counted when determining workforce numbers.

* I did not argue that **women** should be paid a wage for domestic work because their work value would often be greater than the breadwinner's total wage.

* I ask members of the Liberal Party and members of the National Country Party to consider this point: Thousands of men and **women**- I mention the **women** because the men have to be backed by their **women**- do not go out on strike for nine weeks over an issue in which there is no justice.

* Single men and single **women**, serving members of the forces, ancillary groups of people associated with the Comforts Fund, the Salvation Army, and so on, have been brought into  the scheme.

* I especially commend the Treasurer for the fact that he is encouraging the banks to make loans available to single **women** as people in this category have been the subject of neglect for such a long time in respect of housing opportunities.

* I  point also to the fact that there has been a major uplift in our expenditure on funds on television advertising and general printing in Britain, and that we are providing additional resources, by way of counselling, to professional workers and single men and **women**.

* An increased number of **women** have now tasted the benefits of a second income coming into the home, especially during the boom of 1974.

* The Government will have to burn the candle for a long time and work hard to come up with a policy to attract **women** back into the home from the work place.

* It would seem to me that irrespective of the policies that may be enunciated oy the Government over the next year or two about what population goal it is setting, nothing will happen to offset the trend towards a larger proportion of our work force being **women**.

* I have already touched on the question of **women** in the work force, which was also mentioned in the Green Paper.

* The honourable member for Lilley ought to look at that subject because there is an obvious desire, which is easily understood, for **women** to go to work.

* Those industries that are looking ahead to see what work force may be available to them in the future ought to look seriously at what jobs can be done by **women** in their particular industries.

* ACTU has placed no conditions upon the right of married **women** in this country to work.

* What members of the Australian National Advisory Committee for International Women's Year belong to (a) the Country Women's Association and (b) church **women**'s organisations.

* In truth the removal has not solved the problems, nor has it satisfied the normal and proper aspirations of **women** for equality in our community.

* We need to continue as vigorously as we can the evolution of policies which will probably take some time but which in the end will answer the aspirations of **women** in our community who, as I mentioned, possess 50 per cent of our intellect.

* -Does the Minister for Home Affairs recall that during the last Federal election campaign the Government undertook to establish a permanent **women**'s advisory body?

* Before I expand on those questions I applaud the Women's Electoral Lobby which, I understand, demonstrated outside Parliament House yesterday.

* The Bill leaves scope for abuse in that it allows for the possibility of **women** joining the Commonwealth Public Service when pregnant in order to take advantage of the very considerable concessions which are proposed in this legislation.

* But there were **women** who joined the Public 
-Forty weeks.

* I have been told- it is interesting to note this-that 57 per cent of **women** who proceeded on maternity leave did not return to their place of employment.

* I am sorry that the honourable member for Port Adelaide said that this Government was discriminating against **women** because no such statement is inferred in the Minister's second reading speech.

* The Minister said: 
Without such provisions, a number of **women** with needed skills and experiences would be lost to the public sector.

* Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that **women**, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise, are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a family.

* Because of the many and varied changes involving **women** in employment in Australia in recent times, and the consequential rapid outdaring of draft material prepared for inclusion in the proposed 'Handbook For Women Workers', my Department has found it necessary to develop a revised approach to that which was originally envisaged when I advised the honourable member on 8 September 1976 that it was in the course of preparation  (Hansard  page 789).

* Is it a fact that showers are provided in the men's toilets at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices, Brisbane, on the 12th floor of the Australian Government Centre, whereas the **women**'s toilets in that same complex do not have showers even though one member of Parliament whose offices are on the 13th floor is a woman and all the secretaries in the 1 2 Parliamentarians ' offices are **women**.

* 3 ) Will the Minister consider having a shower installed in the **women**'s toilet on the 12th floor of the Australian Government Centre, Brisbane.

* I might add that it is clear that as a result of the programs which I further developed in my statement on Tuesday night employees- that is, the vast bulk of men and **women** who work in Australiawill be more secure in their jobs and their plans, and private employers, who provide three-quarters of the employment in Australia, will be able with confidence to pursue programs which will enable them to keep and put men and **women** on their payrolls.

* What were the (a) numbers and (b) percentages of scholarships awarded to (i) men and (ii) **women** in 1972 in each State and Territory.

* But it is one of the conventions of meteorology that cyclones are named after **women**.

* I think that perhaps in this year, International Women's Year, when so much devastation has taken place through cyclones, just the **women** of the community should not be so readily identifiable with that devastation, and I believe that the honourable member has made in this particular year a very sensible suggestion.

* No doubt he will refer to certain **women**'s fashion magazines, which will get a light laugh throughout the House.

* -Is the Minister for Health aware of concern expressed by administrators of **women**'s refuges in New South Wales that Federal Government funding of existing refuges would be cut to enable new refuges to be established?

* Can he assure the House that the Government has no intention of reducing the funding of existing **women** 's refuges in New South Wales?

* 89 restricts, with certain exceptions, the employment of **women** on night work.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  ( 1 ), (2) and (3) The use of Kwikasair Pty Ltd as the delivery medium for the  Women's Weekly  lift-out 'Legal Aid' booklets about the Australian Legal Aid Office was determined by the contractor, Conpress Pty Ltd, with whom a contract for production and distribution of the booklets was arranged.

* I ask the Minister representing the Special Minister of State: What was the original estimated cost of the Women and POlitiCS Conference in Canberra?

* If the actual cost exceeds the estimated cost does this mean that other planned International Women's Year activities will suffer, or will the Government make good the difference out of general revenue?

* The indication in those statistics, which I intend to examine very closely, is that an increasing number of married **women** in the work force is causing significant difficulties for unskilled young **women** entering the work force.

* 1 venture to say that milk is the most important food item in India and in many of these other countries today, particularly insofar as the **women** and children are concerned, because there is just nothing to supplement the mother's milk.

* I believe it is the duty of our leaders, both religious and political, and the duty of our leaders in industry and commerce - trade union leaders, heads of schools, ex-service organisations and **women**'s organisations - to throw down this challenge to all with whom they come in contact.

* What the Government is doing is using these 2 changes- a representative from each State and 2 **women** members- as an excuse to sack the whole Commission.

* It is using a sop to primitive federalism and a sop to **women** as an excuse to disband the Commission and to appoint its own sympathisers.

* I say 'an excuse' because, if the Government wants to appoint 2 **women** and a commissioner from each State, there is nothing in the present Act to prevent it from doing so.

* As there are 1,200 unemployed **women** in the Wollongong employment district, will he consult wilh the Minister for Labour and ascertain whether any of the 600 stated vacancies at Broken Hill Co. Pty Ltd could reasonably be filled by **women**?

* It is at the base of the pyramid where encouragement is needed and from that base will come the champion men and **women** whom we as rugged, outdoor Australians all.

* Very noticeably there is the still growing participation of married **women** in the labour force.

* As part of my Department's continuing programme of preparing, publishing and distributing information in relation to **women** and the workforce, work is proceeding on the up-dating of material for inclusion in a proposed 'Handbook for Women Workers'.

* We do not want to go back to the time of backyard factories in which **women** were making textile goods, working in conditions that were not proper and being exploited.

* International Women 's Year, or as one woman has called it Mother's Day 363 times over, has been allocated $2m.

* The role of **women** in Australia would be advanced.

* We would review discriminatory aspects of taxation against **women**.

* Can the Minister say whether Ansett Airlines has refused employment to a woman as a pilot on the grounds that **women** are unsuitable as pilots, despite the evidence of the applicant's qualifications and the fact that many United States airlines employ **women** pilots.

* The basic intent of this clause is to provide for representation on the Commission from each State as well as ensuring that at least two of the commissioners will be **women**.

* This, in tura, leads to the desirability of providing some flexibility in the numbers of members who may be appointed to the Commission so that State representation and an increase in the number of **women** on the Commission can be achieved, without prejudice to the unexpired periods of office of the existing commissioners.

* Because of the intention for the Commission to comprise a representative from each State and also at least 2 **women**, as well as the Government's intention to retain all existing commissioners, it will be necessary to deem certain of the present commissioners as representing a State.

* Can the Minister for Health advise the House at what rate the Commonwealth Government is funding **women**'s refuges in the States under the community health program?

* Further, is there any intention of transferring his responsibility for **women**'s refuges to the Department of Social Security?

* What would be the cost of providing a full pension for (a) all men over the age of 63 and all **women** over the age of 60 and (b) all men over the age of 70 and all **women** over the age of 65.

* The provision of the Defence Service Homes Act apply equally to men and **women**.

* Accordingly, ex-servicemen and **women** are required to meet the same qualifying conditions.

* Only yesterday a friend of mine told me a story of two young **women** who were talking about this motion which was to be debated in the Parliament.

* Indeed, it can lead to the death of some **women** although that aspect has been greatly reduced.

* I disagree with the Minister, as does the Community Standards Organisation, when he argues that 'the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms'.

* However, among the generally undisturbing film cuts  Mr Williams  found repugnant the love scene with 2 **women** from the film The Killing of Sister George'.

* I think there are many people in Australia at the present time who see able bodied men and **women** not responding to these kinds of work opportunities.

* Members of the Australian National Advisory Committee on International Women's Year were selected on an individual basis, so that the best blend and balance of expertise and experience of the problems facing **women** could be obtained.

* How utterly ridiculous it would be if someone followed the same line of thought which has been expressed and said that we could not fund such things as a girl's high school or a **women**'s refuge because we males do not have the know-all, and do not have the right to interfere.

* I hope that we will give emphasis to family support and to helping those **women** and those young people who are under threat, by ensuring that the conditions are favourable for them to rear their children, and to have the children who have been commenced.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1 972. 
.

* why do **women** need to be paid a pension at 60 in these days of **women**'s lib, while men wait until 65?

* Under what title can married **women** engaged in home-making duties in their own home be classified in the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.

* Is there any plan to give a title in keeping with the move by **women** of Australia seeking recognition for the work done in the home, Le.

* Does it not mean that there will be a number of **women** and children denied the opportunities of child care in Australia?

* The States were provided with $1 lm for new projects on the basis that these projects would be flexible and innovative and would assist **women** and children.

* Is this the Government of big business where **women** and children are expendable?

* We also support the proposed amendment suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, to which the Prime Minister has given his approval, that **women** members in this place and in the Senate should be accorded equal status with those of us who are males.

* Grants are made to bona fide national amateur sporting associations to: subsidise fares of approved Australian amateur sportsmen, **women** and officials to attend bona fide national and international events; subsidise, under certain conditions, the fares of eminent overseas sportsmen, sportswomen and coaches who visit Australia; assist with the administration costs of conducting international events in Australia.

* I take up the cause of the thousands of men and **women** who work for themselves in small businesses like the corner shop, the garage, the family farm and so on, and the people who work for and with them.

* These men and **women** are the great productive strength of Australia.

* We need these young men and young **women** to be inducted into full citizenship.

* They are the **women** whose husbands gave their lives in the defence of their country.

* We all know that certain **women** have become war widows at varying times for various causes, but it is my opinion that both the Government of which I was a member and the present Government have not treated war widows generously enough.

* That does not give the Repatriation Department or the ex-servicemen and **women** of this country any guarantee that the Repatriation Department will continue as a separate entity.

* It affirms our belief that all men and **women** should be equal in making the law as they are before the law.

* It seems that the ACTU and the Labor Party are not concerned about unemployment, about **women** in the work force and about other important measures.

* They have made it impossible for ordinary men and **women** to plan their future with any degree of consistency and with any kind of confidence.

* I am not sure what the position is with **women**'s and men's toilets.

* They speak of **women**'s rights.

* They speak of the rights of **women** to control their bodies.

* Those **women** have no right to have their unborn children murdered.

* The good old fashioned values upon which we have based our whole civilisation, our whole existence, should not be jettisoned because some **women** believe they have the right over life and death.

* As a result the Textiles Authority, which was set up within the Industries Assistance Commission, recommended restraints to take effect from 1 July on the following products: Items of knitwearmen's and boys' shirts; coats, cardigans, jumpers, sweaters, **women**'s blouses, shirts and the like; dresses; tracksuits, playsuits, rompersuits in respect of imports from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China; **women**'s and girls' dresses, blouses and shirts of woven fabric in respect of imports from India and Hong Kong; and **women**'s, girls and infants' coats of woven fabric in respect of imports from Hong Kong.

* Who can blame the **women** of Batman and everywhere for thinking that above all the other hallmarks of a conservatist elitist he is an arrogant sexist when he referred to the possibility of more **women** member of the House of Representatives as adding decoration, brightness and order to the Parliament?

* How can one blame the unfortunate migrants, the school leavers, older people and **women** who find themselves unemployed for hating him when they are spoken of as bludgers, cheats and long-hairs who should undergo more rigid testing and regimentation?

* This increase has occurred because of the rise in migration and the rate at which married **women** are entering the work force, in 1961 only 17.3% of married **women** were at work.

* In February of this year approximately 33% of married **women** were in our work force, [n spite of this fact, the high demand for labour caused the number of registered unemployed as a percentage of the labour force to fall from 1.07% to 0.9% in the 12 months to June 1970.

* The Minister for Agriculture rides roughshod over his advisers, turns a bUnd eye to the mounting problems of rural poverty in Australia and a deaf ear to the voice of the Australian country men and country **women**.

* He knew hundreds of the men and **women** by their Christian names.

* This may sound to be a small proportion of the 900 local Aboriginals but when one realises that 500 of them are children, 200 are **women** and about a further 100 are too old to work or otherwise incapable of working, it leaves only about 100 males of whom one-third are being trained by the company.

* We heard of incidents between Aboriginal **women** and European **women**.

* Several honourable members have referred to the situation of **women**.

* Through the very successful national and State discrimination committees, the role of **women** in the work force has been significantly protected.

* The pay of other ranks, unlike that of officers, is being subject to continuous review and adjustment as a result of the grouping of the various skills of servicemen and **women** into the appropriate categories, and the alignment of skills with comparable areas in industry where pay increases have been occurring as a result of the determinations of industrial tribunals and other authorities.

* I have directed that a full review be submitted to the Government of the composition and structure of the continuing allowances over and above salary or base pay which are paid to all servicemen and **women** or groups of servicemen and **women**.

* The object will be to permit clear comparisons with scales of emoluments in the rest of the community and to aid understanding of the true value of the benefit contained in servicemen and **women**'s allowances.

* Because of the present complexity of the allowances of some 85,000 members of the Armed Services, reform of the system in a manner best calculated to produce improved administrative efficiency with proper regard to the interests of the servicemen and **women** themselves will be a lengthy process.

* According to the Bureau of Census and Statistics, over 100,000 Australian **women** are willing to go to work and want to go for economic reasons, but many are prevented from doing so through the cost or unavailability of pre-school education facilities.

* I am not advocating by any means that **women** should have to go to work but it is an economic necessity for many **women** at the present time, and that this is the barrier to their employment is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.

* Having regard to the high interest which is being taken in the improvement of programs for children as well as those of more specific interest to **women**, and also the fact that considerably increased attention is being given to the social consequences of broadcasting, it has been decided to increase the minimum number of **women** on the commission to at least two.

* This is not to say, of course, that additional **women** who have the qualifications, skills or experience which would enable them to make a valuable contribution will not be appointed to the Commission.

* Has his attention been drawn to the tent which has been erected on the lawns outside Parliament House and which carries 2 signs, one being Women's Embassy' and the other 'Abortion Law Reform'?

* Technoligical change, accelerated economic growth, new concepts of urbanisation and the use of leisure time, worker participation in management, recurrent education and paid study leave, and a work force which contains 40 per cent to 50 per cent **women**- the majority being married- will all form part of the trade union official's world in addition to his present responsibilities.

* My Party has joined with many concerned groups in the community- trade unions, Aboriginal people, church groups, **women**'s groups, environmentalists and groups of citizens concerned with the preservation of democractic rights- in condemning the haste of the Government in making its 11 November statement, its disregard of the final recommendation of the Fox report and its general stance on the issue of uranium mining development.

* Enormous concern is being expressed, particularly amongst young people and **women**.

* Why is it that the pregnant **women** in Harrisburg had to be evacuated first?

* We are asking members of this Parliament to act as rational men- there are no **women** here.

* In our universities today we are educating a lot of young men and young **women** who, regrettably, may not find adequate opportunity for meaningful employment in the community.

* One that comes to mind is the **women**'s retraining scheme.

* In Victoria after the scheme had operated for 18 months 111 **women** were being retrained.

* Probably about 20,000 **women** should have been eligible for retraining.

* What I think is of considerable concern to **women**, **women**'s groups and **women**'s movements in Australia about the effect of the decision is the degree of corroboration which judges are required to direct a jury about in rape cases- that it is unwise to convict unless there is an element of corroboration.

* Grayndler concerning **women** and their unpreparedness to learn the English language.

* There is a need for special orientation, lt has been suggested by speakers at immigration conventions that morning classes should be initiated to encourage **women** to participate; that **women** teachers should be introduced into the system; that there should be husband and wife teaching teams and that migrant couples should be encouraged to participate in these courses.

* I think the time has long since passed when employees - men and **women** of the work force of Australia - could be regarded as chattels to be bought and sold, to be haggled over and to be cast aside if somebody does not want them.

* On one occasion nine Australian prisoners comprising five men, three **women** and one child were brought in by natives and subsequently killed and beheaded.

* He saw the Japanese enter the building and then depart When the **women** came out a Japanese siezed  Miss Parkinson and started to hug her.

* Mr Mona pointed out that other groups of **women** were raped continuously and raped close to death.

* The day enables us, as a nation, to pay tribute to those men and **women** who did not return from wars, and the important thing is that we pay this tribute as free men and free **women**.

* Perhaps more importantly we are free men and free **women** because of the sacrifices made by those men and **women** we honour on this occasion.

* Mr Acting Speaker,  they will only see groups of men and **women**, many sadly getting on in years, yet marching and participating with pride- a pride derived from the knowledge that they were once able to serve their country in an hour of need.

* We owe them this debt because the simple fact must be recognised that unless they had served we would not be lucky enough to be here now, as I have said, as free men and free **women**.

* It would give future young Australian men and **women** opportunities for education, training, work experience or support which would help them acquire the skills and experience needed to obtain a job.

* Equally important, of course, is the quality of the men and **women** appointed to the Office.

* I have a fundamental belief- I suppose an inbuilt or inbred belief- that **women** have a position in our society and that they are the people whom males have a responsibility to protect and provide for.

* Women, in accepting the responsibility of bearing the children, take upon themselves a position which must be respected by the males in our society.

* That is a fundamental change which should not lightly be pushed upon the **women** of our society.

* 12 which deals with the role of **women**.

* The platform states: 
The Liberal Party is firmly committed to the view that **women** are equal members of society.

* A good percentage of those 200 people will be **women**.

* So much for the Government's concern for employment opportunities and opportunities for skilled **women** in International Women's Year.

* The organisational wing of the Liberal Party, the branch members, the **women**'s sections and the Young Liberal movement will have a greater role in policy advising.

* We appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister about **women** undertaking technical education.

* Most of us are aware that **women** are very competent and very skilled, particularly in the type of work that is called processing work.

* Those of us who live in rural areas and understand the very great difficulties of country men, **women** and children iri obtaining access to technical education are appreciative of the new idea of the making available of money for the construction of residences for students who attend technical colleges.

* I am pleased, as an exmember of the Royal Australian Air Force and having had some association with the **women** to whom this amendment refers, namely, the members of the Royal Australian Air Force Nursing Service and the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force- who were known, of course, as the WAAFs- to support the amendment.

* It could be said to be an enlightened recognition of the equality of **women** in the Services.

* I speak from personal experience when I say that these **women** played a very valuable part during the Second World War and they shared with the servicemen the dangers, the hardships, the long hours, the varying degrees of comfort and fluctuating weather conditions.

* I can see the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr 
In addition, of course, the **women** shared the food which, for the most part, was prepared and presented by the kitchen staff as well as possible.

* I wager that the ex-servicemen in this House will never forget 2 very regular delicacies that were served up by the **women** in the kitchen, namely M and V, otherwise known as meat and vegetables and goldfish, otherwise known as herrings.

* In conclusion, I say quite seriously that the **women** to whom this amendment refers played a magnificent part in all the ways I have mentioned.

* I have not mentioned the care of people wounded in combat or as a result of combat for whom the **women** of the nursing service were responsible.

* The last point I want to make about this legislation is that I welcome the changes that have been made to the old scheme to eliminate the disadvantage suffered by **women** public servants and to achieve a more consistent and balanced scheme in that respect.

* The changes, as the House is already aware, will enable **women** to preserve superannuation benefits while their careers are interrupted for such reasons as raising a family.

* It seems unfortunate that it has taken so long for **women** public servants to be treated fully like people rather than discriminated against.

* On 19 December 1977 I announced that some functions of my Department, including **women**'s affairs, would be transferred to the new Department of Home Affairs.

* The establishment of a new Department, in which **women**'s issues will be one of the major functions, will permit greater ministerial attention to be given to this increasingly important subject than a Prime Minister would personally be able to give it.

* I can assure the Committee and people listening to the broadcast of this debate that no-one is more entitled to speak on behalf of the ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia than the honourable member for Mitchell.

* It is a fact that under the block grant under the community health program of the Federal Government the Queensland Government decided not to pass on any Federal funds to the **women**'s refuges which were mentioned by the honourable member.

* They have pointed out the anomalies that exist in sales tax and what a luxury it is for **women** to appear beautiful and for husbands to pay for their wives' cosmetics at the current rate of taxation.

* Hair nets are free of sales tax but hair spray which **women** use attracts sales tax of 271%.

* Women's gloves are free from sales tax but hand lotion, which they may use instead of gloves, attracts 27* % sales tax.

* My Department does have a list of **women**'s groups in Australia and, where appropriate, their office bearers.

* The list does not cover all **women**'s groups because of the continual establishment and demise of individual groups.

* Some **women**'s groups are of an informal nature and hence do not have official office bearers; and some groups are unstructured as a matter of principle.

* 765 (Hansard, 17 October 1974, page 2573) how were the 472 migrant **women** selected to receive assistance under the home tutor training program.

* How many migrant **women** have sought assistance under this program since its inception.

* Is any Government assistance given to **women** who volunteer to undertake home tutoring. 
)

* How many migrant **women** are in need of this type of training and assistance.

* community nursing services), **women**'s refuges, the training and provision of ethnic health workers, and a new initiative- the training and provision of interpreters and translators to work in health services provided for migrants and Aboriginals.

* The ethnic health workers would be trained to provide direct health education, preventive, support and counselling services to members of ethnic groups, with particular attention to the needs of **women**, the aged, the handicapped, those at risk of mental breakdown and those under treatment in the community.

* How many applications for training by married **women** in Western Australia have been approved under the NEAT System.

* For the first time 2 commissioners must be **women**.

* For instance, it is insisting that at least 2 **women** be appointed to the Commission, but there is no limitation on the number of **women** who will take their place on the Commission.

* If they are the most suitable people, **women** may occupy every position on the Commission because the Government has not limited their number.

* Neither capitalism nor communism can provide a society which will respect and safeguard the dignity of all men and **women** and their deepest needs as human beings, a society which will protect the interests of all.

* How many (a) men and (b) **women** voted in each regional and open electorate at the elections for the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly.

* If we are talking about **women**'s lib and things like that, as we do, why should we deny to the supporting father with dependent children the same kind of privileges  a3  we give to the deserted woman or widow?

* I remember with some distaste that in 1972 some **women**'s lib people came to see me as Minister for Social Services.

* I was shocked and horrified to find that they had published an article ridiculing me and saying that I knew nothing about **women**'s problems because I was concerned only with supporting fathers.

* These problems come on us with increased impact now because of the changing position of **women** in society.

* That change, with so many young mothers working, with equal wages for **women** and things of that nature, is bringing quite a few social needs.

* The Minister for Labor and Immigration  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  has been at the table in the chamber recently boasting of the increases in the work force, patting himself on the back for this and saying that so many of the additions to the work force are married **women**.

* When the Minister for Labor and Immigration gets up in this chamber and boasts that because of these economic stresses these **women** with young families have been forced to take employment which they would not take of their own choice, I find it, if I may say so, a little distasteful.

* He said:  lt is estimated that at present between 700,000 and 725,000 **women** are using oral contraceptives.

* lt has been assumed that 50 per cent of **women** in the 18 to 45-year age group who do not at present use oral contraceptives would use them if they were free and that those at present using them would continue to use them.

* On this basis it is estimated that a total of 1.535 million **women** would use ora!

* That means that another 820,000 **women** in Australia will use oral contraceptives if the Labor Party comes into government.

* putting the oral contraceptives on the pharmaceutical benefits list because, according to the Minister for Health, another 820,000 **women** in Australia would like to use oral contraceptives but at present are unable to do so because they cannot afford the pills as they are unavailable on the pharmaceutical benefits list.

* At the objective level there is no evidence for a difference in average intelligence of men and **women**, when we take each group as a whole.

* I see no reason for not sponsoring or subsidising foreign language editions of the popular **women**'s magazines.

* We have had thousands of our young men and **women** killed in four wars which were started or instigated by the Arabs.

* We have had hundreds and thousands of innocent civilians and **women** and children killed by terrorist guerrillas in schools, hospitals, homes and shopping centres.

* So I say to the people of Australia that at the speed the Liberal Party has been going, finding the Women's Liberal League after 76 years, and planning to abolish the means test 23 years later, it will be the year 2001 before a plan is brought down for the Australian people.

* The Government's response to the problem has been to slash expenditure, to throw at least 4,000 Aborigines out of work, and then to offer employment opportunities to approximately 500 Aboriginal men and **women** through its inadequate community development employment program.

* I ask the Minister for Defence whether he has seen newspaper reports indicating that there is to be a reduction in scale of the proposed relocation to Bonegilla of the Army Apprentices' School, the School of Military Survey and the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps Training School.

* One may well ask whether the incapacity referred to in clause 20 of the Bill extends to **women** whoare pregnant.

* This Government introduced maternity allowances, and I would appreciate on behalfof the **women** of Australia, some clarification about whether this definition of incapacity in clause 20 extends to the maternity leave situation.

* Many **women** in Australia need to work for economic reasons and tend to work as long as possible into their pregnancies, often to the detriment of their health, simply because they require the extra money.

* But this creates problems because most of the migrant **women** in the population are used to taking jobs.

* When they go to Whyalla they find there is practically nothing in the way of employment for married **women** or, for that matter, for single girls, which should be the most important consideration.

* At the present time there is no big light industry in Whyalla employing **women**.

* One of the advantages that I hope will come from the building of this railway is that it will attract light industries to Whyalla which are capable of employing **women** and so give the whole area, which is after all in a bit of an isolated pocket of South Australia, a more balanced economy, lt would certainly help to make people in the area more contented, which makes for the building of a better community.

* I also ask honourable members to consider the views of the **women** in our society.

* For example, the convener of the National Women's Advisory Council, the advisory body of this Government on **women**'s affairs, issued a statement on this subject last Monday.

* If the motion is passed it will discriminate against the majority of the **women** who presently terminate their pregnancies.

* Australia, in common with all other countries of the Western world, continues to suffer from the twin problems of unemployment of men and **women** and under-employment of resources on the one hand and an intolerable rate of inflation on the other hand.

* It is true to say that the RED scheme cannot provide a great deal of employment for **women**.

* More than two in every three who are approved for training under the NEAT scheme are **women**.

* So what the **women** lose under the RED scheme they pick up under the NEAT scheme.

* I found them - both men and **women** - to be most interested in Australia and in our policies and development.

* Is it a fact that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, currently servicing thousands of Australian ex-servicemen and **women**, will not reach its peak workload for a few years yet and that therefore its national importance is increasing rather than decreasing?

* The issue has gone from being one of debate to one of a national joke- a joke for the Government but no joke for the men and **women** whose livelihoods are threatened, no joke for the fitters and boilermakers and other skilled personnel who have now brought their protests to the steps of Parliament House.

* In his statement, Professor Berndt spoke of Aboriginal men and **women** 'dazed and staggering, lying inert, yelling, quarrelling and fighting.'

* But, however promising that observation may have appeared at the time, to any one of 1.3 million men and **women** over pensionable age in Australia and the more than 600,000 people who are within, say, five years of it, your subsequent announcement of the Government's proposal to impose a tax surcharge on income received by individuals from property rendered your statement of intention to make Australia ' a fairer society ' rather meaningless.

* Let me remind him that there are no **women** in the House of Representatives.

* Fifty per cent of the electorate is constituted of **women**.

* Women want some say about what the Government is doing to the incomes that come into their homes.

* Women, as well as other members of the community, are having their say outside this House in rallies.

* I think it provides only due and proper recognition of the service given to this country by the men and **women** concerned.

* This is why it is necessary that we recognise the work done by these men and **women** when they give service to this country.

* I speak of those men and **women** who on occasions work for long hours in excess of any normal hours of work sought from men or **women**.

* The Bill is one which certainly will be received with tremendous thanksgiving and pleasure by all those ex-servicemen and exservice **women** and by present serving men and **women** who can look forward in time to something of a better deal.

* But I am speaking of an important difference- a difference that is important to young men and **women** who will be the future Australia.

* Has he made any public suggestion that (a) **women**'s health centres should have their funds cut, (b) funds be cut for the **women**'s health centre at Liverpool, NSW and (c) **women** 's health centres should in future charge patients on a fee-for-service basis.

* A Councilthe Government's top science policy advisory body- which contains no **women**, and no public sector employees will surely find it difficult to gain the confidence of the Australian people to whom its reports will be available.

* -Can the Treasurer tell the House what would be the cost of recently suggested changes to the conditions under which **women** can gain the unemployment benefit?

* T remember going to Vietnam some time ago when the Press of Australia was full of the story that incendiary bombs were being flung around at random in the countryside and on towns and causing dreadful burns to **women** and children.

* -I wish to draw to the attention of the House a number of measures, contained in the Government's notorious 1978-79 Budget, which have brought hardship to one of the most deserving groups in our society, returned servicemen and **women**.

* These men and **women** saw that their patriotic duty lay in serving their country in times of danger and gave generously of their energies and abilities so that this country could develop in freedom and prosperity.

* Repatriation hospitals are a source of great pride and affection amongst ex-servicemen and **women** who, because of their unique origins, regard them as their own.

* One aspect which concerns me is that many of the young **women** who have gone into community nursing, certainly many I have met in my area, are exceptionally bright girls with much more go in them, I think, than many others in the nursing profession.

* The only explanation I can think of is that some **women** will be transferred from unemployment benefits to supporting mothers benefits and thus hide the unemployment figures.

* For example, in the preamble the peoples of the member nations expressed their determination 'to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and **women** and of nations large and small'.

* The objectives include the following: 
Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Chaner reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and **women** and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, 
Men and **women** of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family.

* For example, there has been action on the problems of discrimination, the status of **women**, the right of asylum, the administration of justice, freedom of information and so on.

* They work to have men and **women** released from prisons where they have been incarcerated because of their beliefs, colour, ethnic origin, language or religion.

* We have a growing movement by **women**, young and old, in the community to assert their rights and their position in this society.

* For too long **women** have been considered second class citizens.

* Women are taking a more active part in this campaign, but not just at that level.

* The introduction of the original legislation in 1974 followed the 1973 report of the working party on homeless men and **women**.

* The report's recommendations highlighted the need to concentrate assistance on upgrading existing facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and **women**.

* These provide overnight accommodation for about 3,600 men and **women**.

* A number of centres cater exclusively for single homeless **women**.

* I move: 
What about the number of married **women** who are going back into the work force?

* Ten years ago 14.1 per cent of the work force was made up of married **women**.

* That accounts for an extra 450,000 married **women** in the work force.

* How many of those married **women** are keeping kids in the dole queues?

* These **women** have gone out to work to boost the family budget because the alternative is starvation and financial trouble for themselves and for their families.

* The new Federal  President  of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Burns,  made a striking comment yesterday in addressing the Federal Australian Labor Party Women's Conference in Brisbane.

* He said that he wanted the votes of **women** in the next Federal election.

* He said that the next Federal election should be a supermarket election and that the Australian Labor Party was entitled to the support of **women**.

* As at 1 January 1 978 there were no **women** employed at the second division level and the class 1 1 level.

* There were 2 1 **women** employed at the class 6 level and 283 **women** employed in the 4th division.

* The basic reason for the continuing unemployment problem largely revolves around the crisis for young **women** as many more married **women** and senior **women** are now making it more difficult for young **women** to get jobs.

* Has there been any alteration to the plan to erect a health hostel for Aboriginal **women** at Port Augusta in September 1970.

* The Government has of course maintained the funding of **women**'s refuges on a 100 per cent basis in the States through the community health program.

* The Minister for Social Security and I have been having discussions on ways of funding **women**'s refuges for 1977-78.

* The Prime Minister has written to the Premier of Queensland indicating that the Government wishes to continue the funding of 2 **women**'s refuges in Queensland which the Queensland Government has not been prepared to fund out of the resources of the community health program.

* The Government generally feels that there is a need for refuges for **women** who are in distress.

* From unfortunate **women** who are compelled to go to abortionists to terminate pregnancies for some reason or other.

* Many of them, I believe, are concerned only with getting money from unfortunate **women** who find themselves in a predicament and want to terminate a pregnancy.

* Governments are limited in what they can do to provide employment but this Government has introduced apprenticeship schemes which have been of benefit to young men and **women** who want to take up a career or trade.

* I make one other point: The honourable member for Wimmera totally misrepresented the remarks of both the honourable member for Maribyrnong  (Dr Cass)  and the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  relating to the appointment of **women** to the Commission.

* The argument is not that **women** should not be appointed.

* The argument is that **women** should be appointed on their merits and not purely because 2 positions must be filled by **women**.

* Is he aware that reports of the number of those retrenched at Fibremakers vary from 106 to 180 and at Healesville from 30 to 40 **women**?

* Women 's Community Aid.

* Women's Community Aid- 
WCA operate a 6 room family house for threatened, battered and raped **women** with children in Brisbane (SHELTA).

* established a **women**'s film fund which will provide financial support in the form of investment for films by, for and about **women**.

* Film projects such as  Caddie  were funded by the National Advisory Committee for International Women's Year and returns on investment - 
Police drew their batons as punches and kicks were exchanged in the foyer and offices of the Flinders Street building.

* Women secretaries were running around and being told to lock their doors because these hoodlums were abou* to break in.

* The most serious indictment relates to the position of **women** enrolling in the teacher training area.

* The report makes the point that in normal enrolments **women** represent an equal percentage with men.

* But in teacher education we find that 68 per cent of enrolments are **women**.

* Because of the reduction in the funds available the report states that the Advanced Education Council is aware that if the existing structure of advanced education is maintained a general reduction in pre-service teacher education enrolments must significantly affect the participation of **women**.

* I am particularly grateful for the way in which our wives have represented us when we have been here, for the way in which they have spoken when called upon to do so and for the way in which they have stood up to the pressure which has been put on them and which no ordinary **women** would bear.

* What saves marriages is access to places such as the Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre in my district, which is always pilloried in the lowest terms by members from the other side of the House.

* There were approximately 60,000 members of the wartime Women's Services who did not qualify for Defence Service Homes benefits.

* It is not practicable to estimate with confidence the cost of offering loans to **women** in that category, but it is pointed out that $15m would be required, at the current level of the maximum loan, to "satisfy each 1,000 applicants.

* I would like to be critical also of the supplement to the  Women's Weekly  that was mailed air express in great volumes to honourable members at considerable cost to the taxpayer.

* Sixthly, he increased benefits specifically for **women**.

* He has also introduced a a supporting mothers benefit for unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners and married **women** not living with their husbands for one reason or another.

* Some of these **women** are also eligible for the rehabilitation allowance.

* Ex-servicemen and Women: Free Treatment of Cancer  (Question No.

* The Government has always displayed a general disregard for the welfare of the  4i  million men and **women** employees of the nation's workforce.

* Why, in heaven's name, if anyone has time and skill to counsel **women**, can they not counsel them to accept their babies instead of the dreadful negation of killing them?

* In fact the previous member representing this electorate - a member of a board - had the effrontery to have letters sent to aged **women** - **women** as old as 85 years - a week before this federal election threatening them with expulsion and eviction into the streets.

* We in the Australian Government seek the co-operation of all levels of government We must meet together as a team in the spirit of co-operative federalism, as a team of men and **women** of goodwill who are concerned to put this nation on the right tracks again.

* As at 30 June1977, 49.04 per cent of **women** were aged15 to 49.

* From the 1914-18 conflict there are 15 000 ex-servicemen and **women**, 22 000 of their dependants, and 20 000 people who are dependants of deceased ex-servicemen- 57 000 in all.

* From the 1939-45 conflict there are enormous numbers- 176 000 ex-servicemen and **women**, 213 000 dependants, 34 000 dependants of deceased people, a total of 500 000 or more.

* The great guiding principles of the Government that men and **women** can grow to their full moral stature only when they control their own lives will be a source of untold comfort and inspiration and a solid base of confidence to all Australians in whatever fields of endeavour they may pursue.

* The Industrial Training Act of 1964 aimed at ensuring an adequate supply of skilled men and **women** and at improving the quality and efficiency of training and sharing costs more evenly between firms.

* In the Melbourne  Age  quite recently we find that in the 15 to 19 years bracket there are 42,000 males looking for jobs and 45,000 females; in the 20 to 24 years bracket 33,000 males and 24,000 young **women** are looking for jobs.

* In Leichhardt 575 young men and 546 young **women** are unemployed.

* As a result of this over 100 men and **women** have been displaced from the food wholesaling section of the Newcastle economy.

* Such people include representatives from the Country Women's Association of Victoria and the Shepparton Historic Society.

* It is amazing when one considers that all of those people - men, **women** and children - who live in my constituency could be employed in some manner by the Australian Post Office.

* I suggest this, bearing in mind that there are thousands upon thousands of dedicated men and **women** employed in the Australian Post Office.

* The industry is in trouble but I believe that the tide of fashion will turn and that the smart **women**, the fashionable men such as the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder)  and even the honourable member for Riverina, will see the light and wear woollen suits.

* I am sure that those **women** recognise that this Government's transfer of the cash from their husbands' wallets into their purses was one of the significant reforms introduced by this Government.

* The way in which it can and should be overcome is to put those **women** on a pension also when their husbands become eligible to receive a pension.

* It could be suggested that the recent decline is only temporary as **women** have delayed their child-bearing because of short term economic circumstances.

* Much of the decline in births since 1971 is due to **women** in their 20s having fewer children than **women** of a similar age did in the 1 960s.

* Assuming these are only temporary delays, many of these marriages and delayed births may be made up for later in the lives of these **women**.

* I would argue that factors such as these, together with the so-called new identity for **women** which is espoused by the feminist movements, together with the increasing temptations of increased affluence, are all of a long term nature.

* Also she is much maligned by **women**'s activist groups who can see no merit in the role of the woman who stays at home to raise and care for her children.

* Notwithstanding the arguments I have advanced for increasing our immigration program over the longer term, I submit that this Government and all future Australian Governments have an obligation to ensure that we amend the present social and economic structure of Australia so that those **women** who wish to raise a family are no longer penalised or discriminated against as compared with the typical 2-income families.

* The lives of Australian men and **women**, both young and old, and of our children are being needlessly and wantonly wasted each day.

* I ask the Minister for the Interior a question concerning the enrolment of 18, 19 and 20 year-old men and **women**.

* What administrative assistance is available to the National Advisory Committee for International Women's Year.

* What funds have been made available for the planning of a program to celebrate International Women's Year in 1975.

* He spoke as though it is desirable in any community to take the young men and **women** away a" a tender age because the Government of the country is not prepared to do for Aboriginal people what it does for white people in every State.

* This is another example of the Government's concern for the most seriously disabled TPI and intermediate rate pensioners and its concern for the widows of deceased ex-servicemen as well as its interest in the welfare of that small and very wonderful band of **women** who served overseas as nurses during World War I.

* The Minister mentioned in his second reading speech a figure of over 300,000 ex-servicemen and **women** or their dependants.

* In the meantime, the Bill that the Minister has put before the House today, for which he is to be commended, goes a long way in standing up to our responsibility to the ex-servicemen and exservice **women** of Australia, their widows and their dependants.

* In the course of the review, the question of extending the Defence Service Homes Scheme to members of the Citizen Military Force and the Women's Forces, who served in Australia during the 1939-4S War, was considered, but it was decided that, for the time being at least, there would be no change in the eligibility conditions relating to service in these Forces in the 1 939-45 War.

* So let me dismiss the Senate report because we will be looking to the Toose Committee to report to this Parliament under the terms of reference that this Parliament agreed to and which I believe will enable that Committee to give comprehensive recommendations on matters relating to ex-servicemen and **women** in this country.

* The honourable member for Barton a few moments ago quoted the number of exservice men and **women** pensioners in this country who are in receipt of the general rate or 100 per cent pension.

* That figure includes married **women** whose husbands are in employment, but I do not know the number of married **women** included in the number registered for employment.

* However, I do know that the  1947  census showed that  8  per cent of married **women** were in the work force.

* The  1972  census showed that  35.2  per cent of married **women** are in the work force so I think it is fair to assume that a substantial number of registrants for employment are married **women** whose husbands are working.

* The Women's Bureau was established in 1967 in the then Department of Labour and National Service with an initial establishment of 3 positions.

* It replaced the former Women 's Section which was set up in 1 963.

* The Bureau is concerned with policies and measures related to **women** preparing to enter, in and leaving the work force, research into existing and emerging problems in these areas and liaison with appropriate organisations.

* The Bureau is headed by a Director,  Mrs R.  Lyne-Browne, who is a member of the ILO Panel of Consultants on the Problems of Women Workers.

* One cannot expect men and **women** of 18, 19 and 20 years of age to respect laws which they abominate.

* The Commonwealth can help the States provide proper career opportunities for the men and **women** in their law enforcement services.

* The measure affects 1 million Australian men, **women** and children.

* 3 ) What proportion of apprentices in each category were **women**.

* I do not know the sort of **women** that the honourable member associates with and I am not reflecting on anybody who is related to him but from the way he described people to the House one would think that we had a community of 'Bluebeards' in which **women** went around accumulating husbands who were eligible for a Government pension and then disposed of them.

* In that same year - and the matter is related - the Income Tax Assessment Act was amended to make pensions and similar benefits payable to people of pensionable age (65 years for men and 60 for **women**) taxable as from 1 July 1973.

* In the afternoon I saw a deputation concerned with the problems of homeless men and bashed up **women** and other personal situations whereby refuge housing is required as a matter of urgency.

* Do not tell me that the Opposition parties have so many old **women** raffling eggs that they can raise that sort of money.

* A person like John Singleton and all his mates can march up to a political party and say: 'If you want to win this election this is the way to do it: Forget about telling someone for 10 minutes that you have a good policy on a peace zone in the Indian Ocean or that you support equal rights for **women** because that is not the way in which to win votes'.

* I say to him: Please be frank because those men and **women** in the service station industry are suffering.

* Is the Minister aware that Myers, the company which supported Labor in 1972, placed an order with a South-East Asian country, where they have cheap labour, for the supply of thousands of pairs of **women**'s thongs of the same kind as have been made by a firm in Brisbane for the last decade?

* It was originally run by a retired Air Force officer and is now being run by 2 Aboriginal **women**.

* The Lane Committee concluded that some **women** would find the burden of making their own decision unsupported a heavy one, and might be vulnerable to pressure from parents, husbands or boyfriends.

* It is important that proper counselling services be established and supported to provide helpful, non-directive counselling for **women** seeking an abortion, should they require it.

* Many **women** might not get any counselling at all unless the services were attached to the clinic.

* the social, economic, psychological and medical pressures on **women** in determining whether to proceed with unplanned or unwanted pregnancies, having regard to: 
Lusher motion discriminatory against **women** and the poor creates dangerous precedent.

* We must make grants to the States so that they can bring alive the plans already drawn up for building and construction works in those areas where there are unemployed men, **women** and other resources.

* I had also outlined the alternative strategy which was being put forward by the Australian Labor Party Opposition- modest, stimulatory increased spending in specific areas, particularly in areas of manpower policy and particularly in the area of grants to the States in order to allow the States to get on with construction and building programs in those centres where these programs were ready to go, where we knew the resources could be used, where there were unemployed men and **women**, and where there were building materials, to name just one resource additional to that of people.

* For the information of honourable members I present a report on a survey conducted for the Young Women's Christian Association by Robin Anderson with assistance from Sheryl Ward entitled: 'Leisure- An Inappropriate Concept for Women'.

* Anti-apartheid demonstrators tried to wreck the **women**'s basketball game between South Africa and Victoria at Royal Park last night.

* In the past a great deal of the assistance has come from **women** whose families are grown or nearly grown and for one reason or another they feel they have a little time to spare.

* I trust that when people get to know what is required they will come forward to fill the vacuum that has been created by the **women** who formerly helped with the service but who are now earning an income.

* 1 ) How many **women**'s refuges are now receiving funding through the Community Health Program.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1 972.

* How is it possible to evaluate the effect on the future wellbeing of men, **women** and children who fall into the cold category of flood victims?

* Men and **women** from all walks of life - office workers, labourers, tradesmen and professional people, some young and some not so young - volunteered for the mammoth job of cleaning up.

* The Leader of the Opposition said that this Government has no concern for **women** and children.

* Since only a minority of **women** earn separate incomes, naturally most pay no tax.

* I think it should be the view of all honourable members of the House that it is not an unreasonable expectation for people, both men and **women**, who have given a lifetime of service to the Australian people and to the Public Service of the Commonwealth that the system be based on the principle that those officers who have worked their way through the second and third divisions of the Service over a period of years and so gained substantial knowledge should be given the opportunity of being selected as First Division officers.

* It is a fact of life that some ambitious men and **women** will take a short cut wherever they can.

* I refer to  Mrs Jean  Nolan, a psychologist with the Department of Health, who spoke to the National Council of Women on the drug problem in perspective on 9th September this year.

* It found that heart and chest diseases were more common among men but that **women** were much more prone to chronic liver disease and brain damage.

* The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908 provided for pensions to be paid to both men and **women** at the age of 65 years.

* It provided also that at a time to be proclaimed, namely, when finances permitted, **women** were to be granted pensions at the age of 60 years.

* History does not specifically reveal the reason for granting pensions to **women** five years earlier than men.

* The expectancy in each case is - 
It goes on to mention a number of reasons why technical education has been neglected, why it will cater for retraining positions, why it will cater particularly for **women** re-entering the work force and states that there is a great need to retain that Commission in an independent status.

* It is my intention not to vote to support the downgrading of **women**.

* I rather hope that the majority of members of this Parliament are prepared to vote in favour of this amendment to ensure, if in fact there is some doubt about it, as I believe there is, the rights and the protection of **women** under this new Family Law Bill.

* He spoke of 1,000 teachers, then 260 married **women**, another 260 married **women** and another 40 married **women**, 300 of whom, apparently would not go and teach anywhere.

* I am not prejudging the Government of New South Wales but the honourable gentleman has spoken of 1,000 unemployed and he mentioned 560 married **women** among them.

* The question of the employment of married **women** teachers is not an obligation that any State government takes on itself, especially if they are not free to move.

* When he tried to make a case about 1,000 unemployed he began by mentioning 560 married **women** teachers whom the Government of New South Wales does not regard as being other than casual and not under any obligation to employ but whom the New South Wales Teachers Federation regards the Government as being under an obligation to employ.

* How many homeless men and **women** are there in Western Australia who may qualify for assistance under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act.

* -To organise and manage a nation properly requires outstanding people- men and **women** who seek responsibility and who know challenge.

* This legislation is the product of the activities of such men and **women**.

* Both young **women** and young men are encouraged to think of their future.

* 41- Night Work (Women) (Revised), 1934, which entered into force on 22nd November 1936, and 
-Last week two seemingly unrelated events occurred- one was Anzac Day, the other was the infamous sacking of Noel Latham by the Broken Hill City Council.

* The principle so enunciated has been abrogated, cast to the four winds and virtually spat upon by those creatures whose iron fists control the Barrier Industrial Council and the Broken Hill City Council and who have a stranglehold over the destiny and livelihoods of thousands of ordinary decent Australian men and **women**.

* This is a fight by all men and **women** of peace and goodwill and by all those who stand for the democratic way of life against any duly elected representative of the people who pays lip service only to the very principles for which the flower of this nation died.

* We assert that modest, selective, stimulatory expenditure in areas where there are unemployed men and **women** and idle materials and reducing charges such as the Medibank tax are not only beneficial in themselves but they are also the key to consumer confidence, consumer spending, business investment and thus, modest, slow but sure recovery.

* My grievance is expressed on behalf of the great majority of pregnant **women** in Australia who do not receive paid maternity leave or its equivalent.

* More than 60 per cent of the married **women** in Australia are not in the work force and, therefore, are not entitled to any payment other than the $30 social security maternity payment which all pregnant **women** receive.

* Furthermore, of the 40 per cent of these **women** in the work force, the majority are in the private sector.

* Many of these **women** are second income earners in the family.

* I am in favour of leave for pregnant **women** in the work force.

* I am in favour of no discrimination against pregnant **women** over employment or promotion.

* More particularly, I am in favour of maternity leave in some form for all pregnant **women** in Australia and still more in favour of a financial arrangement to cover all pregnant **women**, not just the fortunate minority in the Commonwealth Public Service.

* I recommend the provision of leave without pay for pregnant **women** in the work force.

* That can include a paternity leave provision and the provision of a social security payment for all pregnant **women** and fathers-to-be.

* This will provide social justice for all pregnant **women** in Australia.

* They are the **women** who can never join the salaried work force for a variety of reasons.

* I believe that on behalf of these **women** we should call a halt to the scandals that are developing in this practice.

* I refer to this morning's Melbourne  Age,  in which there is an article headed: 
Four **women** employed by Telecom Australia in Adelaide have each been given 12 months maternity and other leave and for much of the time they are being paid.

* I appeal to certain **women**'s organisations and public service groups to look beyond their narrow borders and see the unfair discrimination against the vast majority of pregnant **women** in Australia before they push for any further maternity, paternity or parental leave conditions.

* I appeal to the Government to consider seriously the .replacement of paid maternity leave for the fortunate few in certain categories of employment with a benefit for all pregnant **women**.

* 1 believe that it is an incredible reflection on humanity that as we move into the 1980s men and **women** are still losing their lives as a result of collisions at sea.

* The sooner we have 100 per cent of Australian coastal waters adequately surveyed the better it will be for the safety of the thousands of Australian men and **women** who sail upon our coastal waters.

* It employs some 320,000 men and **women**.

* The Commonwealth will not give equal pay to **women** in its employ because it does not want the wages of **women** in the Commonwealth Public Service to be used as a lever by the trade union movement to get equal pay for **women** employed by private enterprise.

* A **women** who looks after the cleaning of toilets can get the male rate because males are employed in looking after toilets.

* They do not have the ability to do that work as well as **women**.

* Men do not have the ability, as **women** have, to be in charge of child minding centres.

* The Government grasps this slender, miserable reed and says: 'For these reasons we will not give **women** the full adult male rate'.

* The Government in fact refuses to give equal pay to **women** employed by Commonwealth Hostels Ltd who, according to the Arbitration Commissioner, were entitled to it.

* 1 asked the Minister: 'Why did the Government approve of the intervention in the postal workers case when it appealed on the question  o'  equal pay for **women**?'

* I am still waiting for the Minister to give an answer to my question as to whether the Government gives to **women** employed by the Commonwealth Public Service a cheaper rate of board and lodging than that for men at the Macquarie pentagon and the various other hostels that it owns.

* I am waiting for the Minister to explain how it is that men and **women** have to pay the same fares.

* This is the point I want to make: Women in the Public Service are now obliged to have their wages fixed by a formula, determined by the Government and rubber-stamped by the Commission which consists of a 9-point proposition which again the Minister tried to disown by pretending that this is the formula adopted by the Commission.

* Issued recommendations on radiological examination of pregnant **women** and of **women** of reproductive age (report of 5 7th Session, 1964, page 19).

* It fails because the present Government, made up of men and **women** who allegedly represent the working man, have been unable to recognise the needs of people as they exist in 1975.

* The hardworking men and **women** of this country recognise the Government for what it is- incompetent and totally incapable of governing this country any longer.

* Nowhere is it clearer than in the building industry that it is useless pumping more funds into the industry than there are men and **women** and materials to use those funds.

* They are allowing unemployment of men and **women** to continue.

* This country needs leadership that is strong, direct and purposeful, yet fair and compassionate; leadership that is morally and politically incorrupt and incorruptible; leadership that recognises and holds up high, above all else, the personal freedom of individual men and **women**; that puts people first, rejecting any notion of subservience to the State; leadership that recognises personal choice, initiative, enterprise and energy; leadership that withdraws from the nuts and bolts of everyday life decisionmaking and instead provides leadership- just that, leadership- which points the way by example and by deed and action.

* The list of our sports heroes includes men and **women** who have reached a pinnacle of accomplishments in international class in their field of sport.

* In 1975-76 the Australian Women's Amateur Athletic Union received $12,899 but in 1977-78 it received only $2,000.

* The Australian people are demanding an answer to the question of why the Government is not doing more to alleviate the growing army of unemployed youth, **women** and school leavers- people who are wasting their talents and growing more despondent about their future.

* We are interested in the rights of children as well as the rights of **women** and the value and worth of the family unit, rather than the concept of sex without responsibility.

* It provides also for a full and extensive evaluation of all the pressures on **women** beset by unwanted and unplanned pregnancies.

* This Government is not in the business of hitting the pockets of the working men and **women** of Australia.

* So, in just nine months this Government increased taxes by a total of $2,800m a year- all of it, with minor exceptions, from the pockets of, to quote the Prime Minister, 'the working men and **women** of Australia'.

* Why did the Commonwealth wait until 12th June 1969 to supply the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations with the information which, in reply to its request of 18th July 1968, the States gave it in July and August 1968 on the implementation of the principles of the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women (Hansard, 3 May 1971, page 2418).

* Each year in Australia we have the spectacle of young men and **women** who leave school suffering the frustration of not being able to follow their chosen careers because of difficulties of being admitted to the system of trade training.

* It is fundamentally wrong in principle to spend public funds in training young men and **women** for jobs which will not be required in the foreseeable future.

* It was a sound proposition from the Government 's point of view because at the end of next year a **women** would be qualified- I am talking now only about those who passed- would have gone back into the work force, would have resumed a normal, vigorous life, contributing something to society, and would have been a better mother to her children.

* 1 should have thought that a government like ours, which is concerned with the work ethic, would be concerned to get these **women** back to work and to encourage them to work rather than to penalise them.

* We believe that all men and **women** in Australia of whatever age are entitled to expect employment if they wish it.

* Three **women**'s health advisers were attached to the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, Mt Isa and Kalgoorlie for 3 months in 1975.

* They were employed in a pilot project, initiated by my Department which aimed to assess the need for family planning services for **women** in outback areas.

* The Homeless Persons Assistance Bill was introduced in November 1974 by the then Minister for Social Security, Bill Hayden, on the basis of a report of a working party on homeless men and **women**.

* The report recommended, amongst other things, that capital grants should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects such as night shelters, reception and assistance centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and **women**.

* As a result, employment opportunities for **women** and minority groups has increased dramatically.

* If the Government is prepared to work men for years without allowing them to take recreation leave and to pay wages which are far below those paid to municipal meat inspectors and to workers on the beef and mutton chain and which are even below the wages paid to **women** in the packing shed who, with a little overtime, can earn more than the meat inspector, and in addition to those anomalies, to work men for 8 hours without a meal break, then I say that chaos, resignations and disruption must continue to be the lot of the employer and employee in the meat industry in Australia.

* There are 76 **women** employed in this category.

* The 76 **women** referred to in part (3) represent 3.2 per cent of total departmental personnel.

* Women represent 23.5 per cent of officers employed in a senior executive/administrative capacity as defined above.

* An examination of the recent summary by the Department of Labour and National Service of **women** in employment in provincial centres will show the very heavy dependence of **women** on the textile industry in Geelong.

* Certainly a number of single **women** will be included among those to be processed.

* It was initially suggested that there could be some 2,000 single **women** in need of resettlement, but enquiries have indicated that the number is likely to be considerably less than this.

* Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
Another aspect which the Committee probed was the location of this central hospitals complex.

* One would think that with so many new-Australian **women** in this region the task of getting female labour for a job where they would not encounter language difficulties would be much more simple.

* We ought to think of the audience as being equivalent with the community and recognise that every majority is made up of groups which are themselves minoritiesyoung **women**, old **women**, girls, young men, old men, boys, Anglicans, Catholics, agnostics, rich, middle income, poor, under-educated and over-educated.

* This is private property and every day and night there are these white blokes coming in here, and, you know what I mean - taking the **women** out.

* Questioned last year in the Victorian Legislative Assembly,  .Mr Hamer,  now the Premier, told  Mr Evans  that police from Lakes Entrance were frequently called to deal with drunken brawling and damage to property at Lake Tyers and that the  Chairman  and other Trust members had complained to the police about Europeans taking alcohol into Lake Tyers for the purpose of procuring young **women**.

* Arrangements should be made for the enrolment in Australian Government restraining programs of those residents of Lake Tyers - particularly **women** - who at present are unemployed dr under-employed, and for provision of the necessary training facilities either at Lake Tyers or in nearby centres.

* I doubt whether many people realise what a great number of these **women** went through prior to the deaths of their husbands.

* Many of these **women** have nursed their husbands for years before their husbands died.

* The second matter for concern is the figures which show the areas in which **women** are employed and their average wages.

* The figures show that **women** are not favoured in managerial positions.

* Only 2 per cent of **women** are managers, compared with 8 per cent of men.

* Women in Australia and around the world have shown that they can do just about anything if they have to and that they can do some surprising things well.

* There are areas in which individuals can do something to involve **women** more closely in the fabric of society as a whole and not just in one area - namely, the home.

* It mav seem surprising at first, but the first **women** barristers were a surprise, as were the first **women** doctors, the first **women** politicians, the first **women** taxi drivers, the first **women** company directors and a host of others who are now regarded as commonplace.

* I focused on this aspect of the Bill because **women** in our community are a most conspicuous example of a group in our society which is under-involved.

* There are many young **women** who are not involved in society and who have so much to offer.

* I wanted to point out this under-involvement of **women**.

* Progress towards a more equitable social role for **women** must of necessity involve an altered social role for men.

* Women deserve equal pay and opportunity.

* He was respected for his churchmanship by, I believe, men and **women** of all faiths.

* As I have already indicated, wife's pension will be extended to **women** who are in benevolent homes and to **women** with no children or who are under 50 years of age where their age or invalid pensioner husbands are in benevolent homes.

* I warn him to desist from personal attacks on **women**, especially my wife.

* As has been said by  President  de Gaulle, 'to stick to wages alone is to maintain a permanent class struggle', whereas if the philosophies of Louis Kelso were adopted we could avoid that result by giving to the men and **women** who work in Australia the opportunity to have an income apart from the wages they earn.

* So the men and **women** who work see that the harder they work the more the Government takes out of" their pay packet.

* The first was the widow pensioners training scheme run by the Department of Social Services the second was the national service vocational training scheme; the third was the employment training scheme for **women** restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities; the fourth was the employment training scheme for Aborigines; the fifth - this is one that was mentioned - was the employment training scheme, for persons displaced by technological change; and the sixth was the rural reconstruction employment training scheme.

* The 4 schemes which I just mentioned - the widow pensioners training scheme, the national service vocational training scheme, the employment training scheme for **women** restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities and the employment training scheme for Aborigines - stand in this way at the present time: They have been available for over 12 months and each has been effective in assisting a significant number of people.

* However, it should be stressed that according to the 1971 census only 17.6 per cent of Australia's population was engaged in farming, mining, manufacturing or construction- that is, in the direct production or processing of goods- while children, students, retired people and **women** outside the work force totally 58.74 per cent.

* Women's groups point out, correctly, that these services are directly essential to society and they promote production indirectly- in fact they are essential to at least one form of domestic production- yet are disregarded in economic and social planning.

* I am tired of the plunder of Australia, this treasure chest, by foreign companies which owe little or no allegiance to the men and **women** who have made this country.

* This staggering financial burden being borne by local government is being transferred to the men, **women** and children in our community and is expressed in increased rates.

* It gives us hope that maybe there is an air of tolerance coming into our community that would allow single **women** to do that.

* No wonder the Chilean people, particularly the **women**, took to the streets to call for the removal of the Marxists.

* This is the time to think about the consequences of this legislation for all men, all **women** and all children of this generation and future generations in this country.

* We, as men and **women**, are brought together to consider the needs of the community.

* He was a Minister in a government which had a priority of spending thousands of millions of dollars on the murder of South Vietnamese **women** and children and young Australians and which could not provide a few hundred million dollars for beef road schemes.

* The **women** who find it easy to obtain work in the tourist industry also find it suitable work because of the convenient hours of work.

* Women and kids last.

* It has been a long haul through manhood suffrage, abolition of plural voting, removal of the property franchise, fixing up other qualifications, giving votes to the Aboriginal people of Australia, votes for **women** and recently votes for people over 18 years of age.

* I hope that what has been fought by the National Country Party today is a rearguard action, that the concession made by the Liberal Party is a rearguard concession and that we will eventually come to the stage, not too far off, where Australian elections will be an example to the rest of the world as were the general principles of establishment of manhood suffrage, secret ballot and votes for **women** some three-quarters of a century ago.

* Women should stay at home and have children instead of going out to work, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs,  Mr Michael  MacKellar, said yesterday.

* I have talked to a lot of **women** about this.

* A lot of **women** feel a great pressure on themselves that modern society somehow expects them to be unfulfilled unless they are out doing something else rather than the traditional role of being a mother and raiser of the family.

* It includes new projects for a **women**'s refuge, a handicapped children's home, a YMCA hostel and additions to the Goodwin Homes.

* Would he close down the **women**'s refuges?

* If we do not have a clause like 36a and we do not have men and **women** of the highest calibre filling the role of Ombudsman then that office will not have the status that it should have and it will not be listened to with the respect that it should attract.

* People are starving, **women** and children are dying.

* But having failed to do that, there is a responsibility on every decent person in this region to try to ensure that representatives of international agencies, representatives of the United Nations, representatives of governments of this area are in those towns that are being taken over by communist aggression to ensure that justice is being done to innocent people; not to soldiers, not to those who chose to- go out and fight on the battlefield, but to the **women** and children who are suffering the great consequences of this conflict in South Vietnam.

* In the first 2 years of the South Australian experiment, of those **women** having pregnancy terminations only one in eight had employed contraception.

* If a man now is permitted by society to avoid responsibility in these matters, to what greater extent will he be encouraged to avoid responsibility in these matters if **women** are called upon to accept an even larger part of what should be.

* It is one of the last frontiers of Australia opened up by adventurous, stout-hearted men and **women**.

* This is particularly hard on the **women** of the outback, another instance of the tyranny of distance.

* 1 ) Do servicemen and service **women** of equal rank receive equal pay.

* We must realise that these dedicated people - both men and **women** - who work for the 354 meal services use their own vehicles and their own time.

* The third Bill related to assistance for unmarried mothers and married **women** who no longer live with their husbands in order to help them to care for their children adequately.

* There have also been disturbing reports from within Indonesia, including the remark to the press by Lopes da Cruz, a former UDT leader, who is now  deputy  governor of the provincial government of East Timor, early last year that 50 000 to 60 000 people 'mostly **women** and children' had been killed, and the report from church aid workers in Indonesia that in October last year as many as 100 000 Timorese, or about one sixth of the population may have been killed in the brutal military operation against this territory.

* 103- Maternity Protection (Revised), 1952, is concerned with ensuring that the existence of maternity benefits should not result in discrimination against **women** in employment.

* Accordingly the Convention provides, in Article 4.8, that the individual employer shall not be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.

* Had he not heard of the 23-year period before that time when the economy was such that more and more **women** were forced into the work force because of economic circumstances and did not have the freedom of choice?

* Women can be employed and are being employed in this excellent pilot program.

* This is a small contribution, but at least work is being provided for some **women**.

* Perhaps this will be the greatest tragedy because never before, at least since the Second World War, have so many men and **women** been led to hope in others, expected the assistance of others, been naive enough to believe in the unity of common goal and believed that ultimately our destinies were inter-related.

* For the sake of their parents and friends, I hope that we are men and **women** of enough honour and integrity to stand up and say, when people fight wars for principles that are right and just, regardless of the consequences and the outcome: 'You did your duty. '

* Tt attacked the social and economic services of the southern government, hospitals, schools, malaria eradication teams, agricultural research stations, it raided a leprosarium and brutally attacked the patients, lt murdered Buddhist and Catholic priests, teachers, **women** and even children.

* Is the honourable member suggesting that we equate the victims of an armed conflict between 2 armies with the deliberate murder of **women** and children in an orphanage to prevent a democratic election?

* The grant to our sportsmen and **women** will enable them to compete with the rest of the world on more equal terms.

* In hotels and restaurants, **women** represent 60 per cent of total employees compared with the national average of 38 per cent.

* When one looks back on the recent Budget and recalls that this mean, lousy Government has taken away from all men over 65 years of age and from all **women** over 60 the age tax allowance, one wonders how it can parade itself in this Parliament as a Party with heart.

* -This evening I wish to draw attention to a scandalous and sad situation for those of us who believe that **women**'s shelters have a valuable role to play in our community.

* The issue I wish to raise relates to the mismanagement of the Naomi Women's Shelter in Adelaide, and particularly the involvement of a  Ms A  Wilcox m the problems of that shelter.

* All these actions are contrary to the intended way in which **women**'s shelters should operate.

* In particular, they are detrimental to the welfare of the **women** who are dependent on this shelter.

* Funds for **women**'s shelters are provided under community health projects.

* Commonwealth financial assistance for community health projects in the States take the form of annual block grants covering each State's total program of projects, including projects conducted by non-government organisations such as the Naomi Women's Refuge.

* The State authorities are regarded as having primary responsibility for the administration of projects operated by the States and for the immediate supervision of projects operated by nongovernment organisations, such as Naomi Women's Refuge, thus ensuring that the nature and standard of services are appropriate and that public moneys are duly accounted for.

* Then, with the ball back in its own court on this issue, the State Government tried to put the responsibility on to the **women** themselves.

* It is up to them to run their own affairs and up to **women** especially to run the affairs of **women** 's shelters.

* The real tragedy is that in the Kingston electorate the **women**'s shelter at Christies Beach, run by dedicated and competent people, is struggling desperately to survive, starved of funds.

* How many citizens are (a) men aged 65 years and over and(b) **women** aged 60 years and over.

* Today's  Australian Financial Review  contains a letter from  Mrs Joan  Adamson, the National  President  of the Women's Action Alliance of Nunawading in Victoria- a very conservative organisation.

* In the next few months the Government can expect an influx of married **women** into the paid work market.

* National President, Women's Action Alliance, Nunawading, Vic.

* The NEAT scheme is especially discriminatory against married **women**.

* One area of ferment is the role of **women** in our community and, of course, when considering the role of **women** in our community the question of sexual relations comes up.

* But quite clearly the oral contraceptive taken by **women** is the most common form of contraception and there should be no social stigma about its use.

* The right to prevent conception is the right of men and **women** in our community and cannot be changed by edict.

* An additional reason why I would not want by my vote to pass this Bill is that I would not want to contribute to a situation in which young men and **women** may take a decision which could haunt them with guilt for the rest of their lives when a chance event brought back to their recollection the decision which they took many years ago and which deprived them of the opportunity of a child - stifled a life at a time when there were on them great pressures which they could not withstand at the time.

* I feel deeply for **women** who undergo abortions.

* 5 ) and ( 6 ) Questions concerning the funding of **women** 's refuges have been under discussion for some time between the Prime Minister, the Minister for Social Security and myself, also our Departments.

* With regard to the two Queensland refuges currently approved for Commonwealth purposes under the 
As far as my Department is aware, the other 17 **women**'s refuges are being maintained at a viable level of activity.

* That must always be at the expense of the working men and **women** of the country.

* Now, I am sure that the working men and **women** of Australia- those who are members of unions, those who are notappreciate what is happening to their country through the deliberate policy of inflation of the present Government.

* This should remove barriers discouraging adults and it should have particular regard for the needs of **women**, country students, migrants and handicapped persons.

* In this regard the Kangan report has drawn attention to the fact that almost 70 per cent of men and over 80 per cent of **women** in the Australian work force have no formal educational qualifications for the trade or occupation in which they are engaged and that these people do not have anything approaching equality of access to vocational education with those who are preparing for a livelihood by attendance at a university or, in more recent times, at a college of advanced education.

* Also to be taken into account iiI C 203,800 school leavers who have to be found jobs this year, 77,000 migrants who have to be found jobs - these are official figures that I am citing - plus an unknown number, estimated to be 30,000, of  rna.ried  **women** wanting to re-enter the workforce after having reared their children to an age which makes it possible for them to do so.

* In order to have an economy that is healthy enough and is expanding at a rate that is rapid enough to absorb all those school leavers, married **women** and migrants who want work, we ought to be able to maintain an expansion of roughly 4 per cent.

* 'The intention of New South Wales plan is to similarly train unemployed young **women** receiving the dole allowance for careers of their choice, including full time secretarial courses, technical occupations and other professions, including computer operations for example, ' he said.

* Of the 950 registrations, 240 were made by **women**.

* The Country Women's Association, Yea Branch.

* The whole matter cannot be considered without considering the role of mothers, no matter to what extent the Federal Government Advisory Committee on the International Women's Year would seek to ignore that proposition.

* Does the Minister agree that increased expenditure of Government funds will necessarily improve the excellence of sportsmen and **women** in international competition?

* Pioneered by men and **women** of vision and enterprise it is slowly being suffocated by a lack of appreciation of the difficulties arising from a sick economy which was not pan of their mismanagement; high fares for air travel which make it cheaper for an Australian to holiday offshore than in Australia itself; unrealistic industrial awards; the high cost of capital for facilities; insufficient tax allowances or recognition to allow a subsidy against the tremendous cost of running a tourist establishment.

* am asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1977: 
What is the publication date of the booklet to replace the Directory of Support Services to Women in Australia which  Woman 's Day  published without payment or authority on 23 and 30 August 1976  (Hansard,  8 September 1976, page 789 and 6 October 1 976, page 1613).

* She is a person of very considerable experience and achievement in the field of **women**'s rights.

* It is true that my Government has made many appointments of **women** where it is open to a government to make such appointments.

* For instance, we were the first government in Australia ever to appoint **women** to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

* We have appointed four such **women**.

* Where other appointments have been available- such as in the Industries Assistance Commission, formerly the Tariff Board, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Wool Corporation- we have appointed **women** for the first time.

* Where new bodies have been established, such as education commissions, the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, the Children's Commission and the Australia Council, from the very outset my Government has appointed **women** to them.

* Also administratively  Dr Evatt  as Foreign Minister said that one-third of the people recruited to the diplomatic service had to be **women**.

* Accordingly, Australia's diplomatic service is short or **women** of senior level.

* The survey found that  at  mid-1969 there were approximately 3,560 dentists practising in Australia of whom about 5 per cent were **women**.

* In this connection it is evident that the supply of dental services will be much enhanced if increased numbers of **women** continue to be attracted not only into the profession, but also into the newly developing auxiliary dental nursing (theraphy) services.

* But looking at the amount that is allocated, I feel that no provision has been made to include hospital and medical benefits for all ex-servicemen and **women**.

* However, to assist in implementing this policy affecting these ex-servicemen and **women**, I suggest that this policy could be introduced at regular intervals on a priority basis as finance became available.

* The priorities I suggest, and which the RSL has researched and agreed upon, are as follows: Firstly, ex-servicemen and **women** suffering from vascular disease; secondly, ex-servicemen and **women** suffering from arthritic disease; thirdly the dependent wife and children of a totally and permanently incapacitated pensioner who is also in receipt of a part service pension; fourthly general rate pensioners of 70 per cent or more; fifthly, ex-servicemen and **women** suffering from other chronic complaints; sixthly, all returned exservicemen of World War II over 60 years of age- and that is a bit of a plug for me; seventhly, all other returned ex-servicemen and **women** from World War II; eighthly, all ex-servicemen of 70 years of age or more - 
Finally, the ninth matter in the list of priorities is ex-servicemen and **women** in receipt of a tapered service pension.

* If this policy was progressively introduced according to the priorities I have suggested, and as finances permitted, this Government would have honoured its promise to extend hospital and medical benefits to all ex-servicemen and **women** at a rate it could afford and to the satisfaction of everybody.

* The most recent public opinion poll found that 77 per cent of Australian **women** and 7 1 per cent of men favoured the introduction of no fault divorce; 61 per cent of **women** and 59 per cent of men favoured a separation period of 12 months or less.

* Why shouldn't men and **women** have equal rights in the question of custody?

* I feel a percentage of men are equally as capable of looking after children as a percentage of **women**.

* Men and **women** of outstanding ability and talent in various fields who have not been adequately recognised in their own country have reached their zenith and obtained full reward only when they have gone to Britain, Europe or America.

* Among the men and **women** of science and medicine would be Lord Florey- -ealier  Sir Howard  Florey- the codiscoverer of penicillin which has transfored medical science and saved so many lives.

* Typically, the statement made today and the statement made on 16th September demonstrate the attitude of doing everything without consultation with the men and **women** who are working in the Post Office or in a government department and of making a decision without telling or without consultation.

* It is significant to note that the tent that has been erected bears a sign declaring it to be a **women**'s embassy.

* I suppose I can add as part of my answer that personally I am glad that they are not in power now - otherwise the **women**'s embassy would probably be dispersed in like manner.

* May I add that there is significance in their choice of a **women**'s embassy because there is oppression against **women** in this community.

* Women who are aware of social issues like the abortion issue and who know that this issue and other issues that fundamentally concern them are going to be decided in this House of men do feel oppressed.

* Women who are aware of social issues and who like to think that they should be treated with full civilian rights and have opportunities available to them in much the same way as you gentlemen have opportunities available to you feel oppressed and discriminated against.

* The other thing to which the honourable member for Robertson referred was the transfer of the office of Women's Affairs from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to my Department.

* We know that on the very first day the Director of the Office of Women's Affairs resigned.

* The Office of Women's Affairs was being placed in a department where it could have access to the Minister and could start to do things positively.

* It also is involved in an important project which is assisted very much by the report on human relationships, and that is the development of laws relating to rape and the protection of **women** in relation to sexual assaults in the Australian Capital Territory.

* I hope that the efforts of the Office of Women's Affairs in this regard will lead to some major advances in the law either of the Commonwealth or of the Australian Capital Territory.

* Another thing that the Office has organised is the establishment of the National Women's Advisory Council.

* Since then the members of that body have been appointed and the National Women's Advisory Council has had its first meeting.

* The purpose of that body is to give **women** a voice in government.

* It is all right for honourable members on either side of the chamber to talk about the role of **women**, but **women** do not have much voice in government.

* At least this Government has a Cabinet Minister who is a woman, but the voice of **women** is not often heard in government.

* So, the National Women's Advisory Council will do exactly, precisely, what has not been done in the past.

* Under the chairmanship of  Mrs Beryl  Beaurepaire and with the assistance of **women** who have been chosen from right across the political spectrum in this country, I believe that the cause of **women** will be furthered.

* One thing of note that will happen in Canberra this week is that a shopfront office will be established in the Office of Women's Affairs in the CML Building in Civic.

* If the honourable member for Kennedy wishes to know something about **women**'s affairs- I am sure that he could learn a lot- he can go to the CML Building, visit the Office of Women's Affairs and find out something about the Government's policies.

* If he wishes to say something about **women**'s affairs he may do so in that shopfront office.

* The other purpose of that office is to enable **women** to come in off the street, as it were, and seek information about where **women** can be aided in government.

* Honourable members opposite guffaw when I say that, but **women** in the community do not have the opportunity to go to places or offices where there is a concentration on matters relating to **women** 's affairs.

* In a sense this is an experiment, but in another sense it is a real project by the Government to enable a form of access to information to be obtained by **women** throughout the nation and **women** who live in the national capital.

* If it is a successful experiment I hope that in future years the Government will see fit to set up similar offices around this country, I hope in co-ordination with State governments, so that there will be places to which **women** can go to have some of the questions that affect them answered.

* A lot was said by the honourable member for Robertson about married **women** in the work force.

* It has never been a policy of this Government that married **women** should stay at home.

* There is no discrimination against married **women** on the part of this Government.

* Married **women** who want to go to work are entitled to do so, just as anybody else is.

* -I am not kidding to the **women** at all.

* At the moment there are 1.3 million married **women** in the work force, in case the honourable member for Hindmarsh does not know.

* If those 1.3 million married **women** were taken out of the work force it would not solve anything.

* People such as the honourable member for Hindmarsh- I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  would back me up- apparently believe that married **women** should stay at home.

* I thought that the honourable member for Hindmarsh did not accept such a proposition, but apparently he thinks that married **women** should stay at home.

* I said then that there must be no doubt that this Government is determined to improve the CMF, that it will give this country an Army Reserve which is attractive to the young men and **women** who wish to serve in it, and which, with the Regular Army, will also provide a viable base for expansion should this be necessary in the future.

* What I am submitting to the House, therefore, is a record of achievement in regard to the nation's defence capability; major improvements in conditions of service of our servicemen and **women**; greater efficiency and economy in defence organisation and spending; and a prudent and responsible defence posture for present circumstances and the future strategic prospect.

* Making political footballs out of the two million men, **women** and children directly or indirectly dependent upon social security payments is less than cheap.

* Between 1972 and 1975 more benefits were granted to our returned servicemen and **women** than for many years previously.

* A study of the statistics will show that it is reasonable for me to say that the system has worked extremely well over the years and greatly to the advantage of the ex-servicemen and **women** and their dependants in this country.

* The Government has made a decision which, as far as I can make out, has not led to the executive of the Returned Services League, the main body representing the welfare of ex-servicemen and **women** in Australia, appearing to complain to the Parliament.

* Women suffer the burden of unemployment more than men.

* The rate of unemployment among **women** is nearly 70 per cent higher than among men.

* Not very long after making that statement he introduced the 25 per cent across the board tariff cut which put thousands, tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of men and **women** in the textile and other industries out of work.

* The proposal that each party to the divorce pay his or her own costs may appear on the surface to be based on a principle of" equality but in fact it discriminates against **women**.

* The burden falls unequally on men and **women**, on husbands and wives.

* Many **women** do not work outside the home and depend on their husbands for any money that they get.

* Women in this position are particularly vulnerable to an order for costs.

* Some **women** are engaged in industry and work both in the home and out of it.

* No one would suggest, particularly in this International Women's Year, that we should deny in any shape or form the right of a woman to fulfil herself in whichever venue or through whichever avenue she might so desire.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister.

* Of the 3 **women** who have sat in this House, 2 were the widows of former members.

* It is a striking commentary on the singular difficulty facing **women** who seek a political career in our country in their own right.

* There is thi allegation that companies discriminate against some **women**.

* But there is a hard core of about 60 men, **women** and children who could be described as permanent dwellers on Cape Barren Island.

* 1 ) With reference to the Women and Work Newsletter, Vol.

* He said that the legislation was brought in only as a means of getting more **women** into the work force.

* Although we can argue about the merits of **women** in the work force, whether they should leave children at home or at some other place and at what age they should leave their children, there is no doubt at all about the existence of the problem.

* The fact is that about 35 per cent of all married **women** in Australia are employed at present and the percentage is rising.

* It is repeated in many other advanced countries and I believe that the proportion of working mothers will continue to rise as **women** see their role in life as embracing more than just being married and raising a family.

* It is of particular concern to mothers who go out to work but it is also of importance to **women** who are sick or incapacitated.

* During question time the diplomats were asked whether it was true that **women** worked in all types of professions in the Soviet Union, and whether this was necessary.

* One of the diplomats answered the questions very courteously by saying that more **women** worked in the Soviet Union that probably in any other country in the world, the reason being that when they were at war as our allies against the tyranny of Nazi Fascism, so many of their men were in the fighting forces that it was necessary for the **women** to do the men's jobs.

* He said that they had lost so many of their men in that warapproximately 20 million to 25 million- that the **women** who had been trained carried on with their professions after the war.

* Then, the diplomat added in conclusion that **women** in the Soviet Union worked for the same reasons as **women** worked in Australia, that is, to get extra money for the household.

* Women have had less of a fair go than have young men: people in industrial areas have had fewer opportunities than those in nonindustrial areas; people in country districts have had much less access to higher education than those in a city; people in Victoria had much less access to higher education than people in New South Wales; and Aboriginal people have still not achieved the same equality or anywhere near it.

* Rather than attack the men and **women** who enjoy those benefits in the Australian Public Service, honourable members opposite ought to aim for a national superannuation scheme in the future which would allow ordinary men and **women** to retire on at least 50 per cent of their earnings or the national average wage.

* I conclude my remarks on this iniquitous Bill by echoing the words of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Port Adelaide, in demanding that the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted so that the real needs of the men and **women** in the Commonwealth Public Service can be taken into account.

* It is completely unfair to the railway men, and indeed the railway **women**, of Tasmania that their fate should be up in the air while a State Labor Government dilly dallies for month after month and will not indicate whether it is prepared to bring in legislation to protect the State railways system.

* I wonder whether the honourable member for Oxley has talked to the men and **women** in those townships, the labourers and the plant operators, as I have done.

* I should like him to go to the central coal fields and talk to the men and **women** there who receive wonderful support from this company.

* In 1966, some 1.6 million married **women** were in the childbearing age range.

* This is an overestimate based on a 90 per cent usage rate by non-Catholic **women**.

* Just a few days ago a group of young Australian **women** at the Barham High School, which is right on the Murray River - there were about a dozen of them - wrote to me to protest against discrimination.

* That was the reply I gave to the young **women** concerned.

* The facts, as evidenced only the other day at a function I went to, are that the men and **women** of that area are prepared to work far harder for their community organisations than are people from more affluent areas.

* A far greater percentage of **women** in those areas have to work and they have to travel greater distances to work than people in the more affluent districts have to travel.

* The wish of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Fraser)  was to insert in that clause a paragraph (k) (a) to include those **women** who wish only to continue their role as wife or.

* The Convention applies to **women** employed in industrial undertakings and in non-industrial and agricultural occupations, including **women** wage earners working at home.

* Women who fail to qualify for benefits provided as a matter of right shall be entitled, subject to the means test required for social assistance, to adequate benefits out of social assistance funds.

* In no case is the employer to be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.

* Provisions are also included concerning the protection of  employment  before and after confinement and the forms of work which may be engaged in by pregnant and nursing **women**.

* 1 ) How many **women**'s refuges are currently operating in each State with Australian Government assistance.

* Both involve the destruction of life, both are products of stress, both are examples of inner directed violence, both involve **women** of child-bearing years and both involve **women** who have a sense of being overwhelmed by events.

* After suicide attempts, **women** and men routinely go to hospital for treatment.

* I firmly believe that the majority of Catholic **women** certainly are in favour of abortion.

* They may not be able to say so publicly, but I am convinced that **women** as a whole are more aware of the need for abortion law reform, and that includes Catholic **women**.

* The one I am now quoting is the sort of document that average men and **women** read, and I think it is very important.

* His Excellency in his Speech said that a training scheme for married and single **women** who, for domestic reasons, have not previously been employed will be introduced.

* The first inference I draw is that there is a shortage of workers in some areas and that **women** workers are to be injected into the labour field.

* If this is the case then these **women** workers will perform an important function.

* I trust that it is implicit in the proposal that all **women** engaged in industry and commerce are indispensable and are needed.

* Until now there has not been any guarantee that this program would be an on-going one, which has meant that neither the Government nor the organisations delivering this welfare have been able to undertake long term planning of programs designed to assist homeless men and **women**.

* The Minister, in her second reading speech, said that at present there are 113 approved centres and these provide overnight accommodation for something like 3,600 men and **women**.

* I keep in close contact with some of the organisations in Perth which look after homeless men and **women** and youths and their experience certainly shows that there is a need to update these subsidies.

* This may mean that these men, **women** and youths will be discouraged from entering homeless persons' hostels and will be forced back into the streets and on to the park benches.

* 1 make 2 points: Firstly, members of parliament subscribe heavily to their so-called pension - more than SI, 100 a year goes directly out of each member's own pocket; secondly, members of Parliament for the most part have about the most precarious job in the country, and there are many, many capable men and **women** who refuse to consider leaving a secure job for the chances of politics.

* They are working men and **women** who have precious little to show for a life-time of hard work, and small business and professional people, plagued by the constant fear of being denied assistance because they have been able to save some of their hard-won earnings, and on the basis of the new Treasurer's Budget for the immediate future these people are condemned to further suffering.

* However we may find our opponents from time to time politically obnoxious, their wives are very gracious, nice **women** and that applies to the Prime Minister, to his Ministry and to those who sit behind him.

* We must be extraordinarily difficult people to work with due to the times and the tempo at which we work and we really are very well served by the men and **women** who work in this building and who work beside the members of Parliament.

* There is in Australia an increasing number of men and **women** who specialise in this highly lucrative skilled work of doing these killings for a living.

* I have heard arguments over the years about **women**'s rights and all sorts of rights.

* We shall also eliminate the restriction on single persons because we believe there is strong discrimination against **women** and men who are unmarried.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned - 
There is no sound medical reason for this decision.

* The babble of interjection that is coming from sections of the Labor Party illustrates their interest in and appreciation of the job the ex-servicemen and ex-service **women** have done for this country over the years.

* I think the House, the people and the exservicemen and ex-service **women** are entitled to receive an explanation of what those last few words in the section of the Prime Minister's policy speech relating to repatriation really mean.

* It is an unfortunate aspect that in many of these non-metropolitan areas there are many single **women** who need work but whose local authority is not able to provide employment for them; and the State governments care little about them.

* There was a time when arguments in favour of voting rights for **women** and Aborigines were also rejected.

* And, finally, the age at which it is appropriate for the country's welfare to call up young men or **women** could well vary; the military might decide that they needed them at 15 or at 20 or at 25.

* Less than half of the **women** aged between 65 and 70 are living with their husbands, and at the age of 80 and over only one in 12 is doing so.

* A recent New South Wales study of chronic illness suggests that about 4 per cent of the population over 65 years of age are in need of help from others in many of the acts of daily living, 11 per cent are prevented from getting about alone for shopping or visiting the doctor, 15 per cent of **women** are handicapped in their ability to do housework, and 57 per cent of both sexes suffer from one or more chronic illnesses.

* About one-fifth of the aged **women** are childless.

* In my own case I have a considerable number of these young men and **women** come to me looking for jobs.

* It is amazing that this Government is prepared to give young men and **women** between 18 and 20 years of age only $11 a week after depriving them of employment.

* per cent of the **women** receiving that benefit were actually living with their husband or a man in a de facto relationship.

* Four, five or six young men or young **women** or mixed company may occupy a flat and pool their resources.

* It is true enough that other sections of the Australian community are affected- young school leavers, including migrant children; **women**, including migrant **women**.

* I have indicated that school children or **women** probably are the first to be retrenched.

* After all, they are only **women**.

* But they are not the main breadwinners, so the **women** can afford to lose their jobs first.

* This Government says that it will stand loyally by our ex-servicemen and **women**.

* It also discriminates- I want to emphasise that word strongly to honourable members opposite because this is a discriminating Government- between men and **women** who have different terms of enlistment.

* But Army personnel- those men and **women** who comprise the great mass of the Services- serve for six years in the first case and then they must re-enlist.

* Servicemen and **women** are being told, in effect, that if they want their home loan they must re-enlist and extend their period of service.

* Clause 6 of the Bill proposes the introduction of a preference system for those servicemen and **women** who have war service and also provides for the first time specific authority for imposing a waiting period.

* It is essential that not only should the Australian people be aware and kept informed of the world around us and the circumstances, which change daily, but that the men and **women** who are elected to this Parliament with the fundamental responsibility of leading the Australian people and of setting a standard of excellence and an appreciaton of the problems which this nation must face, should ensure that this Committee has indeed a real role to perform.

* The proposal is a boost to the status of **women** generally; that must be acknowledged.

* We have recognised the special position and the degree of independence needed to help **women** in the community.

* which has been kept down by the Australian Labor Party - only 8 **women** have become members of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.

* Two **women** have entered the House of Representatives and six **women** have entered the Senate.

* The 2 **women** who have come into the House of Representatives both have been Liberals, and of the 6 **women** who have come into the Senate five have been Liberal ladies.

* Either directly or by inference, he said he would increase expenditure on schools, roads, health services, sewerage, environment, **women** and children, Aborigines, the unemployed, public works, construction, shipbuilding, Medibank, State funds, growth centres, pensions, supporting mothers, unemployed school leavers, aged persons homes, destitute and lonely men- that includes most of the Opposition- supporting fathers, migrants, defence, nursing homes, hospitals, school dental services, refuges for **women**, national highways and last but not least, **women**.

* It was made out of desperation by the Opposition because it has no attitudes, no purposes, no policies in relation to the main matters of concern to the Australian people- the working men and **women** whom the Labor Party once in the distant past used to represent but whom it no longer represents.

* The Leader of the Opposition has made a grave and fundamental error in his tactics because he has underestimated the Australian working men and **women**, the people who put members into this Parliament.

* At least one eloquent body on **women**'s rights, the Women's Electoral Lobby- an organisation whose members are never slow to find themselves discriminated against- has now stated emphatically that discrimination does not exist in the Bill.

* The allegation frequently heard in this chamber, that after this Bill passes **women** will lose their rights to maintenance and will be forced to support themselves, is arrant nonsense and a total misrepresentation of the facts.

* Thirty-two per cent of **women** who are divorced presently fall within that category.

* Some **women** have been manipulating the present system by refusing to remarry, although living in a de facto situation, because if the **women** did remarry they would lose their entitlement to maintenance payments from their former spouses.

* It must be clearly understood that many **women** prefer the security of a pension to the tremendous uncertainty of maintenance payments from a spouse.

* Working class **women** will receive greater protection than those with education and training as they are less able to assist themselves, because work in unskilled employment for a small remuneration may not permit them to obtain adequate paid childminding facilities.

* Women on the whole are more protected than they have ever been, and the emotive mouthings to the contrary are deliberate falsehoods to arouse uninformed public opinion to further the ends of those who seek to impose their views on the community by the use of all possible means, legitimate and illegitimate.

* 4) is to remove certain provisions relating to employment for **women**.

* A lot has been said in more recent times relating to the numbers of **women** now employed throughout Australia by various industries.

* The employment of **women** has come more to the forefront as far as the public and statistics are concerned in more recent times, but I assure this House and the nation that everyone should know that **women** have been in the workforce in Australia for a long time - since there have been people in this country.

* Of course it would not have been unusual to go onto farms in years gone by, and still today, and find **women** cooking for and looking after many men with no recognition whatsoever by the nation.

* Women have been in the work force for a long time.

* Women are now moving into other areas within the Public Service.

* Different circumstances apply in some areas in which **women** would like to be accepted as members of the work force.

* I believe that the period worked could vary to a great extent with **women** working for a few hours each day and also carrying out their responsibilities in their homes.

* I am speaking of **women** being employed for a short period in the Public Service work force.

* I am sure that there are in Canberra many **women** who would be available to be employed in these positions.

* I believe that this principle could be applied to the nursing profession in respect of which, for instance, **women** have been trained and then have worked for a number of years at a hospital somewhere.

* Many of these **women** have then married and assumed other responsibilites.

* If men and **women** are capable by reason of their qualifications of carrying out certain duties in certain positions, in my book regardless of where those duties may be carried out the benefit of those qualifications and that expertise should be taken advantage of.

* Convention on the Political Rights of Women (Question No.

* We were advised of grown men and **women** who were unable to read even the simplest sign board, who did not know where they were going or how to get somewhere.

* I conclude by saying that I hope that the new Committee will display the same amount of infectious enthusiasm as did the previous Committee and that it will receive the same cooperation from all sectors of the community in helping to brighten the day for many boys, girls, men and **women** who otherwise would have a vast world of knowledge not available to them.

* The British survey found that 95% of old people - these people were defined in the research in much the same way as we define them; that is, as being men over 65 years of age and **women** over 60 years of age - thought that it was a good idea; 65% said that they personally would gladly use such a service.

* The ones who were not prepared to use it - and the number of men and **women** was equally divided approximately between the two sexes - gave reasons of independence, pride, shyness or, in some cases, physical disabilities.

* Coming as it does from one who, quite honestly, has a very tender regard for the position of **women**- I say this quite solemnly and seriously; I know that he does- I can only say that he is misguided if he believes that the proposed new clause ought to be put into the Bill.

* We will run into - 
This is particularly true in the case of employment opportunities for **women**.

* Women represent 60 per cent of employees in hotels and restaurants compared with approximately onethird of the national work force.

* We need to develop the concept in which all men and **women** who work in an industry are regarded as having a common objective and not regarded as competitors.

* It is within our capacity to protect men and **women** who become redundant for that last reason.

* Such a change, if it were desirable, might take a lifetime or more to accomplish but it might also do much to help give men and **women** who work in a particular industry a sense of.

* Men and **women** cannot be regarded as mere inputs like an ingot of steel in the production process.

* for her work in South Brisbane, and I recall the job which has been done for both men and **women** by the Salvation Army.

* The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  made references earlier to the bashed **women** for whom these homes might be able to serve as a half way house.

* But it is a fact that many men have been mentally beaten from their homes whereas many **women** are physically beaten.

* In reply to a question on **women**'s refuges, I indicated that Commonwealth funding was 75 per cent of capital costs and 50 per cent of operating costs.

* 1 ) The assistance provided under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act is not payable direct to homeless men and **women**, but to the eligible organisations that provide assistance to homeless persons by way of food, accommodation or a social welfare service.

* This is the finding of the Working Party on Homeless Men and Women which reported to the Minister for Social Security in June 1973.

* Bearing in mind that over 190,000 ex-servicemen and **women** receive a war pension within the general rate scale, we have always maintained that the Government's goal in this direction would have to be reached in stages as resources permit.

* Those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, or who have served in a theatre of war and are over 60 in the case of men, or 55 in the case of **women**, or permanently unemployable, qualify for service pensions, if they satisfy the existing means test.

* Have the RSL and other ex-servicemen's and **women**'s organisations been consulted cither before or after the States were approached: if so, what was the reaction of those groups.

* But the 1966 10 per cent sample census showed that about 23 per cent of unemployed men and well over 40 per cent of unemployed **women** in good health did not register their unemployment.

* The Lamameri at that stage- I do not know what the situation is now- consisted of 2 elderly **women** who had no sons.

* Employment of Women in Defence Services (Question No.

* 994) 
I feel that this is basically an argument between those who have little faith in their and other people's morality, but need laws to buttress it because they are scared that all marriages will dissolve if divorce is available, all **women** will have abortions if they are available and everybody will act in a homosexual way if that becomes legal.

* When I refer to small outside groups I include organisations such as the Abortion Law Reform Association and its opposite, the Right to Life Association; the Women's Electoral Lobby; resident action groups; the Festival of 
In the event of conceptions which are unplanned or unwanted, the social, economic, psychological and medical pressures on **women** in determining whether to proceed with the pregnancy or to have an abortion.

* Such pressures should be examined having regard to the adequacy of (i) housing, (ii) child-minding facilities, (iii) pre-school facilities, (iv) disabilities of families with handicapped children and the means of assisting them, (v) domestic assistance for families and working mothers, (vi) adoption procedures, (vii) assistance to single parent families, (viii) social status of -**women** in the community and (bt) other assistance to mothers employed in industry.

* Surveys here and overseas show that the great majority of **women** seeking abortion - 80 per cent or more very often - took no contraceptive precautions at all.

* The pressures of inadequate housing, as I have mentioned, child minding facilities, adoption methods, the social status of **women**, the problems and attitudes of parents who might already have had a handicapped child and their attitude to another pregnancy, surely are matters that ought to be encompassed within an inquiry that is to give this Parliament some realistic evidence and advice in these matters.

* In determining this level of assistance the Government has taken into account likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as retraining of married **women** and retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service and industry for higher technician courses, which could have an effect on the programme of the States.

* As announced in the 1972-73 Budget Speech, the Government is committed to abolition, within the next 3 years, of the means test on age pension eligibility for residentially qualified men and **women** aged 65 years and over.

* The terms of reference of the committee will be: 
Having In mind the policy of the Government to abolish the means test within the next 3 years on age pension eligibility for residentially qualified men and **women** aged 65 years and over, as announced in the 1972 Budget speech, to report on - 
The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The information soughtin respect of States is not presently available.

* Results of this survey are set out in booklet number 7 of the Women in the Workforce' series, prepared by the Women's Bureau of the previous Department of Labour and National Service.

* I believe from what I have heard about the measures which are being taken, particularly in the field of getting nurses who speak the Aboriginal language to talk to Aboriginal **women** - here it is again a question not only of money but of approach - that by doing these sorts of things we can reduce very significantly the rate of infant mortality among the Aboriginal people.

* Many men and **women** devote their working lives to the railways and they have collectively formed some of the finest traditions in any government service.

* I am also arranging for detailed discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and officers of railway unions to establish methods of consultation and liaison which ensure all railwaymen and **women** are fully informed on the progress of the transfer.

* Service pensions available to ex-servicemen and **women** between the ages of 60 and 65 and 55 and 60 respectively are to become taxable for 1976-77.

* By any standards men and **women** are as mature at 18 years now as they were at 21 only a generation ago.

* If the Government cannot make these pledges to the young and idealistic men and **women** of this country whom it is planning to enfranchise, its actions in giving them the vote will be seen by young people - and by the electorate at large - as a measure of hypocrisy.

* Special attention has been given to the position of **women** in the scheme.

* This significant reduction in the qualifying period will be of particular assistance to **women** who interrupt their careers for reasons such as child rearing.

* The local **women** have introduced them to their social institutions and have looked after the children while the deserted wives have been trained for employment.

* It is often more difficult for country residents than it is for city people to go somewhere to buy food or to obtain a meal and many **women** are doing a tremendous job in meeting this problem.

* I believe that the approach to married **women** and sickness benefits, which is put in the Bill as a demonstration of non-discriminatory tactics on the pan of this Government, is a specious exercise.

* Perhaps one million married **women** are not active in the work force and half a million people are unemployed.

* What sum was paid to these **women** in 1971-72 by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the State of New South Wales.

* Ninety per cent of the persons engaged in this industry are **women**.

* In the provincial city of Geelong, for example, the Young Women's Christian Association late last year conducted a good survey of about a thousand **women** in the Geelong area.

* The survey showed that the most significant problem to which the **women** drew attention was the lack of public transport services.

* Clearly transport is important not simply for **women** but for all people in terms of relating them to a whole range of activities.

* But so far it has not done anything about it and the people who lose from that lack of planning of Geelong 's development particularly are **women** such as those surveyed by the YWCA.

* 1 shall also be writing in the same vein to such groups as the United Nations Association and its associated Committee on the Status of Women and to significant bodies representing Aboriginals, **women** and religious groups.

* I shall also be calling on the Women's Bureau of my Department ;o broaden and intensify its activities in the field of **women**'s employment, paying particular attention to promoting equality of opportunity for **women** and co-ordinating the work of other agencies and organisations involved in this area.

* I am pleased to say that the Women's Bureau is being strengthened.

* But in any event, she will advise and consult with me on questions affecting **women** generally.

* An examination of the Commonwealth Public Service Act and Regulations and administrative instructions is currently under way with a view to removing any remaining traces of discrimination against **women** in the Commonwealth Public Service.

* I am sorry to say that there is within this Capital Territory now a discrimination against **women** in the engagement of apprentices.

* This appointment was not simply a gesture to **women**.

* We were able to appoint Justice Evatt to the position because she had better qualifications in our view than anybody else offering, men or **women**.

* It was not an empty meaningless gesture to **women** but a recognition .aid acknowledgement of the tremendous capabilities and competence of a woman.

* Particular attention is being given to Aborigines and to **women** in this regard.

* In the operations of the Commonwealth Employment Service, what is involved is drawing up guide lines to eliminate the discriminatory practices associated with notifying and filling job vacancies; for example, where employers specify that only men should be referred to fill vacancies which could be filled by **women**, or specify that they do not want Aborigines.

* The Committee will be assisted in its operations by a panel of expert consultants, including academics, and people drawn from Government agencies, **women**'s groups, Aboriginal groups and religious denominations and bodies.

* I state categorically that whatever pension we grant to exservicemen and **women**, especially those totally and permanently incapacitated, they are justly entitled to, and a grateful nation should be proud to grant it.

* Its treatment of ex-service men and **women** is better than, if not superior to, the treatment afforded to ex-service men and **women** by most other countries.

* It has agreed to the establishment in the area of a clothing manufacturing plant which has provided employment for quite a number of **women**.

* a member of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service or the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force; 
a member of the Australian Army Medical Women's Service but not a member of the Australian Imperial Force; or 
One direction, issued in 1948 and reaffirmed in 1973- those dates ought to be significant to honourable members on the other side of the chamber- prohibits the granting of assistance to a person who served during the 1939-45 War in the Citizen Military Forces or the wartime **women**'s Services unless that person served outside Australia.

* AsI indicated in my reply to the honourable member's question, there were three main points of difference between the circumstances surrounding the action taken against the **women** and those in relation to the presence of the honourable member for Lalor.

* He did not sit on the floor and obstruct traffic as did the **women**.

* To my knowledge, he did not utter vulgarities as did at least one of the **women**.

* The **women**, after being warned and after repeated efforts by a police officer to persuade them, refused to leave.

* Mr Allen  is emphatic, from his notes made at the time, that he explained the facts about the **women** to the honourable member for Lalor.

* Courses are also conducted for **women** and young people to teach skills needed in the home and in employment.

* The courses are concerned largely with the introduction of new food crops and cash crops, improvements in diet and health education; the promotion of **women**'s interests and activities: the detection and control of diseases of humans, animals and crops; and improving production methods to provide money income.

* Queensland this evening would have read the article which dealt with the obstetrics section of the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital.

* I quote briefly from this article, which reads: 
By the end of next year, the facilities at the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital will not be enough to cope with **women** having babies, according to a specialist obstetrician al the hospital.

* In the meantime, the **women** of Brisbane are in for a rough time.

* As a side consideration I might mention that members of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force are able to proceed to the rank of sergeant.

* We have moved an amendment in those terms on previous occasions and we have moved other amendments in this place during repatriation debates in the time that I have been here, each time trying to get better justice for the exservicemen and **women** of Australia than the Government is prepared to give them.

* Each year the National Executive of the 
I have spoken to the Minister about these matters and if I have sounded heated it is because I believe that the exservicemen and **women** of Australia deserve better treatment than they have received from this Government.

* It does not consist of just the affiliates that were represented at the last congress; now the amalgamation of the salaried personnel with the ACTU gives it a combined affiliated membership of something like  2lA  million men and **women** of this country.

* The basic wage for an ordinary plantation labourer is $WS1.00 per day ($A1.25) for men or $WS0.80 ($A1.00) for **women**.

* It reminds me of the opposition which I suppose the **women**'s hysterical lobby had at the time the wheel was introduced.

* _ _ 
Probably it would have been called the **women**'s hysterical lobby at that time.

* Pregnant **women** riding in carts on wheels may well have suffered miscarriages as a result of the jolting.

* I refer to the **women** in the community, in particular the married **women**.

* The figures will probably show that there are 40,000 more young men in the Australian universities this year than there are young **women**.

* Yet young **women** have the same intellectual capacity, social characteristics and so on as their brothers.

* But they have been drop-outs, not because of any lack of intellectual capacity but simply because they happened to be **women**.

* They were preceded by similar generations of **women** who may well be 30 years or 40 years of age but who could well be offered university training at this stage.

* In addition to that, we can expect 200,000 **women**, who are not now in full-time education and who are not presently in the work force, to seek work in that period.

* My question, which is addressed to the Prime Minister, concerns the recently announced resignation of the Prime Minister's adviser on **women**'s affairs, Miss Elizabeth Reid.

* Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether Miss Reid's resignation means that there has been any loss of interest by the Australian Government in promoting the equality and advancement of **women** in Australia?

* In particular can he say whether it is the Government's intention to establish within the Prime Minister's Department, or any other department, a section to deal with policy for the advancement of **women** and, if this is intended, whether the position of personal adviser on **women**'s affairs will be continued?

* If a **women**'s policy section within the Public Service is to replace the personal adviser will he inform the House what advantages are expected to accrue from that arrangement?

* It is readily seen, I am sure, that this Bill is focussed on the employment of **women** in the work force.

* The direction of focus is of getting **women** into the work force rather than care and consideration for young children.

* How many **women** were there at the (a) second division level, (b) class 1 1 level, (c) class 6 level and (d) fourth division level in his Department as at 1 January 1978.

* It would be wrong of me not to acknowledge publicly the contribution she made for the people of Darwin, particularly the **women**.

* Elizabeth Reid gave freely of her time to help the distressed **women** of Darwin.

* With her colleagues, other members of the ministerial staff, and the staff of the International Women's Year Secretariat, she arranged for necessary supplies to be sent to the **women** of Darwin.

* She arranged for **women** to be helped and given advice as they arrived in the southern States from beleagured Darwin.

* She arranged for supplies of basic necessities to be sent to the **women** who remained.

* Mothers were without refrigerators to keep milk cool for their children- one can imagine that in the tropics during the summer time or the wet season- **women** were without basic clothes, **women** needed to know that other Australian **women** cared for them.

* The efforts of Elizabeth Reid showed to all those brave **women** of Darwin that there were Australian **women** who, regardless of politics, cared for the **women** of Darwin and it was those **women** of Darwin who were deeply touched and given extra spirit to get to work alongside their men and rebuild Darwin as their home city, as they are now doing.

* Since her appointment, Elizabeth Reid has been criticised for some of the administrative actions of the Women's Year movement.

* The private citizens of the city, both men and **women**, whom Elizabeth Reid helped so very much during those days, are fighting back.

* **women** and children of all age groups.

* Your petitioner therefore humbly prays that the House of Representatives will initiate or concur in appropriate legislation for the purpose of (1) making grants suitable to the financial needs of benevolent institutions for additional accommodation and equipment of a capital nature and the estimated costs of same, in particular for destitute or near-destitute men, **women** and children of all age groups, and for those in a nonpensionable age category and (2) enabling financial grants of a supplementary nature to be made for maintenance costs of an urgent nature in such institutions.

* It removes discrimination against **women**, as has been indicated.

* of the Public Service Act provides: 
1 ) Is it a fact that the refusal of the Government to allow Rhodesian passport holders to enter Australia has resulted in the Rhodesian Country Women's Association delegation missing the Associated Country Women of the World's Triennial Conference.

* -- My contribution to the consideration of the Treasury estimates deals with the discrimination to which our society subjects single **women** of various categories in obtaining finance for housing.

* I refer to **women** who are divorced or separated with or without children.

* Also I refer to **women** who may not want to marry and who may want to retain their freedom and independence.

* There are other **women** who through no fault of their own have not married.

* Of course, lending authorities may argue that there is no discrimination whatever against **women** who are the heads of households if they wish to obtain finance for housing.

* In practice, however, **women** are discriminated against in various ways, both direct and indirect.

* Secondly, they are discriminated against because of a persuasive and difficult to pin down conviction that **women**, irrespective of their economic positions, are poor financial risks.

* However, generally speaking, the story in the case of single **women** or men is always the same.

* Whether it be in regard to Canberra's Department of the Interior, the savings banks or the terminating building societies throughout Australia, **women** are discriminated against.

* The woman's denial - and some **women** have pointed out the biological impossibility of their becoming pregnant - produces no change in the demand for a guarantor.

* While not directly relevant, but perhaps illustrating the pervasive conservatism towards **women** working, most private lending agencies will not consider a wife's income when assessing the finances of a couple wishing to borrow.

* Those **women** who financially can meet the requirements of lending agencies yet fail to be granted a loan unless they have a guarantor can be considered to be discriminated against, as **women**, by lending agencies.

* The difficulties encountered by deserted wives and **women** with dependent children in obtaining housing finance occur not only because of their sex but also as a result of their poor financial position.

* Women in this category form a substantial proportion of those aided by the State housing commissions.

* However, this figure includes young men and **women** who would as yet be financially unable to be interested in acquiring a house.

* Indeed, some **women**, especially those without children, may prefer to live in a flat rather than a house because flats tend to be more available closer to their employment and require less maintenance.

* Might I point out also that there may be **women** - creative **women** - who want to live in a house, to have their garden, to create beauty and to experience the changing seasons in that garden.

* It seems to me that if we are to have a free society then **women** are entitled to have their freedom whether they are married or single.

* At present **women** are not free.

* I think it is about time that this Parliament, this Government and the financial system as a whole looked afresh at the question of **women**, particularly single, divorced and separated **women**.

* For example, such figures would only cover those **women** who would be willing to reveal that they, are pregnant.

* The honourable member will be aware that all employees in the Commonwealth service, including pregnant **women**, are entitled to rest periods.

* The Bill has been denounced as unchristian, a marriage breaker, a nation destroyer, one which neglects the rights and obligations of **women** and men and the rights and welfare of children.

* It works for the release of men and **women** imprisoned anywhere for their beliefs, colour, ethnic origin or religion, provided they have neither nor advocated nor used violence.

* He said that there are 3 ways for a politician to ruin a career- chasing **women**, gambling and trusting experts.

* What I and others like me are concerned about is that ultimately this Government intends to use the Superior Court to rule on all manner of matters such as discrimination, environment, children, **women**, motor accidents, the stock exchange, corporations and trade unions.

* Earlier this year, I advised the State Ministers for Health, who have primary responsibility for the administration of community health projects, including **women** 's health centres, of the Commonwealth's policy concerning the charging of fees for medical services provided by general practitioners employed on a salaried or sessional basis in centres funded under the Community Health Program.

* In relation to **women**'s health centres specifically, an exception may also be made for clients who, because of the nature of their private domestic arrangements, might experience problems if the consultation were made known to other members of the family.

* Subject to the relevant qualifications the highest numbers of persons registered as unemployed in each of the above Offices showing (a) single and (b) married **women** and (c) total persons and the end-month in which this highest registration occurred for each of the years requested in part ( 1 ) of the honourable member's question were as follows: 
and (3) Subject also to the relevant qualifications, the numbers of persons registered as unemployed in each of the above Offices showing (a) single and (b) married **women** and (c) total persons at end-January and (d) end-February 1977 were as follows: 
The letter is from  Mr W.  G. Osmond, State Secretary of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Services League.

* We extended the eligibility to single men and single **women**.

* The Convention further provides that any contributions to a social insurance scheme or any special tax imposed to raise funds must be raised in respect of the total number of men and **women** employed by the undertakings concerned without distinctions of sex.

* The Convention is not restricted in its application to **women** in government employment.

* The Bill leaves scope for abuse in that it allows for the possibility of **women** joining the Commonwealth Public Service when pregnant in order to take advantage of the very considerable concessions which are proposed in this legislation.

* There has been insufficient discussion of the initiatives which might be taken to assist **women** with children in their employment, either in the Commonwealth or in the private sector.

* If the Government has serious concern for the problems created for working **women** in caring for their families it ought to be more closely examining the concept of work recycling as distinct from the total number of working hours on a 5-day week basis.

* The Government also might have considered the employment of **women** on the basis of an optional number of working days per week.

* The Minister also failed to indicate whether his Department has conducted any form of needs survey among working **women** in the Commonwealth Public Service to determine those forms of assistance which they regard as being most important An employer who was concerned about the welfare of his staff would first ascertain what the employees regarded as important priorities, but this the Government has failed to do.

* The Opposition does not regard the question of maternity leave solely as an industrial benefit, because to consider the proposition in that way is to introduce an element of positive discrimination in favour of working **women** who raise a family.

* Those **women** receive benefits while **women** who choose to be housewives do not.

* Equally, we have an obligation to ensure that non-working **women** have equal access to society's resources for the provision of necessary benefits.

* Twelve weeks' leave on good pay for the well-paid woman, on low pay for the low-paid woman and on no pay for the unpaid woman worker might not be  a  palatable proposition to **women** generally.

* The Bill also discriminates in favour of those **women** who are able to return to work and against those who need to return but are unable to do so because of the unavailability of satisfactory child care arrangements.

* The child care scheme introduced by the former Government was designed specifically to provide assistance to working **women**.

* It is for this reason that the question should be considered as part of a general examination of the role of **women** in contemporary Australian society.

* Throughout society today there is certainly a conflict between the traditional role of **women** and the opportunities now available to **women** as a consequence of education, smaller families and the greater range of suitable work provided by modern technology.

* It is demonstrable that **women** today are still subject to very considerable prejudices.

* The 3 principal influences which have shaped Western society - Greek philosophy, Roman law and Judao-Christian theology - have each held almost axiomatically that **women** are inferior to men.

* But we know now that, aside from physical differences, there has been no scientific proof  of  differences, either psychlogical or intellectual, in the genetic inheritance  of  men and **women**.

* Yet **women**'s child bearing functions undoubtedly have served as the basis  of  restrictions and discrimination.

* The simple fact is that for a very long period of time **women** have been treated as second class citizens in Australian society.

* Industry has yet to face up to its proper responsibilities in the employment of **women** and the advancement of their careers.

* It is both in their self-interest and in the interest of the nation at large that the resources of **women** should be utilised more fully than they have been, notwithstanding the trends and developments of recent years.

* There is an increasing feeling by **women** that their aspirations and rights are being frustrated by the present political, economic and social structures of this country.

* This Parliament itself provides a salient example of a major structure of society in which **women** have had a minimal involvement and therefore is seen by many **women** to represent a narrow and unsympathetic legislative authority.

* This Bill can be seen only as a totally inadequate and isolated response to those needs which must be examined by the Government if there is to be an adequate response to the special problems faced by **women** in today's society.

* It was in recognition of these special problems in the work force that in 1963 the former Government established in the Department of Labour a **women**'s section which subsequently, in 1967, became the Women's Bureau.

* In view of this, it was more than a matter of surprise that the present AttorneyGeneral,  Senator Murphy,  made an election promise on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in November 1972 stating that a Labor government would introduce and establish a **women**'s bureau in the Department of Labour.

* This comment was the logical corollary of a party which remains an almost exclusive male preserve and which has taken a traditionally narrow view of the problems confronting **women** in Australian society.

* The Women's Bureau was established because of the significant increase in the size of the female work force in Australia.

* Through the Bureau we actively sought ways to enable **women** in the community to play a role in the labour force commensurate with the talents and the many resources which they have to offer.

* It must also be made clear that the former Government made social provisions for all **women** in respect of childbirth in the forms of a maternity allowance and child endowment.

* During this time a **women** may receive $17 a week.

* I have outlined these provisions which now exist because they demonstrate that the former Government sought on a continuing basis to make provision for the maternity problems of **women**.

* The needs of **women** in the Australian community are too important to be "treated in isolation.

* They must be subject to a concerted program by the Government and which will place the needs of pregnant **women** in what must be the Government's response to the total needs of **women** everywhere in the Australian society.

* In view of the benefits which are provided to **women** in the Commonwealth Public Service, and for the reasons I mentioned, the Opposition does not oppose the passage of this Bill.

* 100  -  Equal Remuneration 1951  -  which provides that ratifying countries shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and, in so far as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and **women** workers for work of equal value, has been ratified by the following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Byelorussia, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Colombia, Congo (Kinshasa), Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Gabon, Federal Republic of Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Republic of Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Japan, Jordan, Libya, Luxembourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Republic of Mali, Mexico, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Niger, Norway, Panama, Paraquay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sweden, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, U.S.S.R., United Arab Republic, Upper Volta, Yugoslavia.

* Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has given a very wide interpretation to the concept of 'work of equal value', applying it not only to **women** doing the same work as men or like work and doing the same range and volume of work and under the same conditions, but also to quite unlike types of work.

* Some two weeks ago, I raised in this House the question of discrimination against **women** who, having been widowed - 
-I think it is unfortunate that the honourable member for Bendigo seeks to make a joke of what I consider to be a very serious matter.

* The case I refer to is that of a **women** who, having been widowed, subsequently has a child and that child is treated by the Department of Veterans' Affairs as nonexistent where the woman receives a war pension.

* As one lady said in her letter to the  Age,  removal of that program means a return to the kitchen sink and soap operas for **women**.

* How many (a) indigenous men, (b) expatriate men, (c) indigenous **women** and (d) expatriate **women** are (i) sponsored by his Department at each tertiary institution in Papua New Guinea and (ii) assisted to attend tertiary institutions in Australia.

* It follows from this decision that unless that was directly related to ancillary provisions, the major contest being the question of a divorce, it could not be dealt with under the Family Law Act but would have to be dealt with under the State law called the Married Women's Property Act.

* Women were stripped, beaten and often raped.

* We will seek ways to encourage private enterprisebased industries and businesses to locate in Canberra, and in the regional towns, to increase employment opportunities for Canberra and adjacent New South Wales residents alike, particularly school leavers, **women** and university graduates.

* If we have nothing to worry about, why does not any honourable member on the Government side stand in this place and say to me that the high rise development in Melbourne, 36 storeys high, to house **women** and children in little boxes is the desire of the people who inhabit them?

* It is also interesting to note that during the 1970s the number of married **women** in the fulltime work force has risen from 17.3 per cent to 21.2 per cent.

* In other words, during the 1970s an additional 448,000 married **women** have entered the work force.

* I do not want to put forward views as to the correctness or otherwise of married **women** holding jobs but I think that in assessing unemployment the community needs to take that fact into account and to make a very careful assessment as to whether there should be two wage earners in the one family when others are on the unemployment list or whether full-time work should be limited to one wage earner per family.

* Surely nobody is going to be critical of working men and **women** not wanting to work in situations that are not considered safe.

* Although we have a significant amount of unemployment of men and **women**- 4 per cent or 5 per cent- is it realised that we have a significant amount of unemployment of machines in Australia today?

* This is quite clear in the statement in which J said: 'This is fundamental to the Government's position that all servicemen and **women** should be adequately recompensed for the service that they give'.

* That is the Government's objective- 
In making recommendations, the Committee of Inquiry should have full regard to the national requirement to attract and retain men and **women** with needed qualities, skills and experience for the Armed Forces.

* It is fundamental to the Government's position that all servicemen and **women** should be adequately recompensed for the service that they give.

* In its examination of the barriers preventing ready access to technical and further education, the Committee refers to the special problems faced by people in rural areas, by **women** and girls, and by handicapped persons and migrants.

* 3 - Maternity Protection, 19.19 applies only to **women** employed in public or private industrial or commercial undertakings.

* It provides that **women** shall not be permitted to work during the 6 weeks following confinement and that they shall have the right to leave from work during a period of 6 weeks prior to confinement.

* 1 ) The present method of salary fixation for females in the Defence Force provides for equal pay where it has been established that men and **women** do perform equal work.

* For example, equal increases are applied to men and **women** when national wage case increases are extended to the Defence Force.

* He said Cardinal Knox shared this view 'The judgment would show the major social problems that lead **women** to having an abortion,' he said.

* A Royal Commission would point out ins social and personal needs for **women** in the community - marriage counselling, family planning and sex education.

* The fact of the matter was that so many of the **women** who were employed in these areas were underpaid compared with other people in the community and adjustments had to be made. 
)

* 97 (Hansard, page 625, 24/7/74) and in particular would draw attention to the 1974  Annual Report of the Public Service Board, tabled in Parliament on 17 September 1974, pages 162 and 237, where statistical information on the **women** employed in the Australian Public Service may be found.

* 14) Will child care facilities continue to be provided for **women** after they have completed training and entered the work force; if so, will such child care facilities be extended to all working mothers.

* Have studies been undertaken into the reaction of mothers, who choose to stay at home and care for their children, to the provision of Government child care facilities to **women** who are being paid allowances to undertake training; if so, will they be provided with an equivalent grant.

* The police acted mainly against local residents, **women** and children, whose only interest was to save their neighbourhood from the ravages of traffic.

* One can see them sometimes when one goes to a public library- men, and to some extent **women**, in their dishevelled gear in a moment of sobriety, knowing that they have seen better days and trying to recapture some of the glory of those former days.

* If the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  will excuse me I am not being chauvinistic when I say men, because as she would know that for some interesting philosophical reason for which I do not have the answer, of the homeless in our country the men outnumber the **women** ten to one.

* The purpose of the Bill is to assist the eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and **women** and, in one-parent family situations, their children.

* One of the basic requirements, in my view, is the opportunity for the homeless man to relate to a **women** in the role of substitute mother.

* Perhaps that is the reason why with respect to the homeless in this country men outnumber **women** by ten to one.

* Sociological research indicates that almost all of these people were denied the love of a **women** in their childhood.

* Summing up, Deaconess Towers says: 
Thirdly, I hope that a program of care would mean providing the opportunity for these men to meet and mix with decent **women**.

* Although the house mothers would encounter some problems with some of the men, such as the handling of jealousy, the men do respond to the care and attention given by **women**.

* The Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  also left Australia on 1 June to attend the International Conference of Women Leaders in Israel and to take up activities associated with the International Year of the Child in the course of visits to Europe and the United States.

* Many of them are men and **women** with whom I have worked intimately over a long period.

* Many of them are men and **women** I have known in this place for some 20 years.

* Often **women** under stress have Valium prescribed for their condition.

* Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  when presenting this Bill, the **women**, who retire at 60 years of age will not benefit from this means test free pension for some 5 years of their pension life.

* Why is it that men at their standard retiring age of 65 will qualify for this means test free pension while this traditional discriminatory attitude which has always characterised this Government bears so heavily upon **women**.

* For 5 years of their retirement **women** will be deprived of the benefits of this means test free pension which is only, available to people 65 years and over.

* It does not matter whether these people are Widows, ex-servicemen, ex-service **women** or invalids.

* In the case taken in April 1963 by the Miners' Federation against Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui over living and other conditions at Moura, the Coal Industry Tribunal (Judge Gallagher) paid a warm tribute to the miners' **women** folk there.

* Despite the conditions under which they had to live, the 2 **women** have not lost their dignity and they have not lost any element of femine refinement.

* My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs.

* Is it a fact that all States, except Queensland, are funding **women**'s refuges from Commonwealth grants under the community health program?

* Is it also a fact that the Brisbane and Townsville **women**'s refuges and the Brisbane Women's Health Centre are short of funds?

* Is there any likelihood of **women**'s refuges being established and funded in Queensland by the Commonwealth Government?

* Unemployment is hitting **women** more harshly than men and the hardest hit of all are the recently arrived migrants.

* If the Prime Minister is committed to the Governor-General's word- I do not believe he is- about 'giving the men and **women** of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and freedom' it is to this corporate sector that he must turn.

* Is it a fact that the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act does not make adequate provision for **women** seeking part-time employment in the Public Service at the conclusion of maternity leave.

* Was it his intention that **women** who seek such parttime employment and who previously held permanent positions will be required to resign or to forego their permanency and accept temporary employment.

* Assistance was provided as follows: to subsidise fares of approved Australian amateur sportsmen, **women** and officials to attend bona fide national and international events; under certain circumstances, to assist eminent overseas sportsmen, sportswomen and coaches visit Australia; to assist with administrative costs of conducting international events in Australia.

* I have no intention of keeping the House for very long, but I do wish to express the disappointment felt by the returned soldiers on this side of the House at the treatment that has been meted out by this Government to those men and **women** of our armed forces who have served in the number of wars in which we have been involved.

* I remind the House and the returned servicemen's organisations that between 1972 and 1975 more benefits were granted to our returned servicemen and **women** than had been granted for many years previously.

* But when it comes to the real crunch, when it comes to their doing something for our ex-servicemen and **women**, we find instead that many of the entitlements granted to our returned servicemen and **women** are being taken away.

* The great humanitarians opposite, the people who wave the flag on every possible occasion and say how wonderful it is that men and **women** are prepared to sacrifice themselves for our country in time of war, are now taking away the automatic acceptance of tuberculosis amongst ex-servicemen as being war caused.

* I only wish that honourable members on the other side of the House would realise that the time has now passed when they could say how loyal they were and how wonderful it was that our exservicemen and **women** had been prepared to go away and fight for our country, while gradually dwindling away the benefits that have been available to our returned soldiers, sailors and airmen.

* We cannot attract sufficient men and **women** into our permanent Army, Navy and Air Force.

* The Government has shown once again that while it talks about the need to pay a tribute to our exservicemen and **women**, when it comes to the crunch it does very little about the matter.

* The Government stands condemned for its poor treatment of our ex-servicemen and **women** in this Bill, the same as it stands condemned for its poor treatment of the pensioners of Australia in the legislation that just recently passed through this House.

* They include inequalities between pre-school children, depending upon whether they live in the Australian Capital Territory or in the various States; inequalities between our children, depending upon which school they attend; inequalities between men and **women**; inequalities between the wage earner and the prices setter, inequalities between the electors in the State electorates and particularly in Commonwealth electorates, depending upon the electorate in which they leave; inequalities between migrants, depending upon the country of their origin; inequalities between overseas visitors and more particularly between migrants, depending upon the country of origin; and, of course, inequalities between applicants who seek eligibility for citizenship under the terms of the Act enforced by the previous Government - the Act which this Bill seeks to amend.

* At 30 June 1975, twelve **women**'s refuges were in receipt of Commonwealth Government assistance, under the Community Health Program.

* At 31 December 1975, nineteen **women**'s refuges were receiving such assistance.

* At 30 June 1976, nineteen **women**'s refuges were receiving such assistance.

* At 30 June 1975, approximately $48,247 of Commonwealth funds had been spent by **women**'s refuges.

* Expenditure figures for **women**'s refuges as at 31 December 1975 and 30 June 1976 have not yet been finalised.

* However, Commonwealth monies transferred to **women**'s refuges by State health authorities at those dates were $267,228 and $792,532, respectively.

* No specific allocations have been made by the Commonwealth to **women**'s refuges in 1976-77.

* Accordingly, the Commonwealth's intention is that funds be available for continuation of the nineteen previously approved **women**'s refuges throughout 1976-77. 
am asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1977: 
Which departments reviewed the material which had been prepared for a Directory of Support Services for Women  (Hansard,  8 September 1976, page 789, 6 October 1976, page 1613 and 24 May 1977, page 1774, and Senate Hansard, 9 December 1976, page 2985).

* I refer specifically to the homeless men and **women** of Australia, the casualties of our society, whom governments in the past have been happy to ignore.

* No date can be given for the possible publication of a directory of support services for **women**.

* It is understood however, that the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations is going ahead with a handbook dealing with aspects of employment for **women**.

* The next segment of the program dealt with various **women**'s magazines with a heavy emphasis on sex and even with fold-out colour photographs, like femine ones in 'Playboy', of male models.

* 1 have been informed that the Queensland Department of Health informed the Hospitals and Health Services Commission by letter of 20 July 1976 that **women**'s refuges in Brisbane and Townsville would be excluded from consideration when financial allocations under the Community Health Program were determined.

* In addition, major organisations representing exservicemen and **women** and their dependants and others interested in Repatriation matters were invited by letter to submit matters for consideration and generally to express their views.

* This Bill is another example of the Government paying only lip service to its oftrepeated assertion about the great debt of gratitude we owe our ex-service men and **women** and the serving members of our defence forces.

* Governments of all complexions have always placed value on the votes of our serving personnel and our ex-servicemen rather than seek value for taxpayers' money spent on the requirements of eligible ex-service men and **women**.

* From 1973 exservice men or **women** who had three years continuous regular or national service in the defence forces were covered.

* The present aims and objectives of the scheme appear to be to reward those who served their country in time of war, to attract and retain regular servicemen in peacetime, to recognise the significant contribution made to national defence by servicemen who undertake full time service of a substantial duration and to compensate regular service men and **women** for the considerable disadvantages they suffer in acquiring a permanent home when compared with other members of the community.

* I am absolutely certain that nobody in this House would quarrel with the reward for service concept for our ex-service men and **women** and the serving members of our regular forces.

* Again, so much for this Government's concern to keep its promise to our ex-servicemen and **women** and the regular members of our armed forces.

* Invalid Pensions and Sickness Benefits Paid to Women  (Question No.

* 454)  Mr Lloyd  asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice: 
How many **women** aged between IS and 45 received (a) an invalid pension and (b) sickness benefit in the latest month for which figures are available.

* and (4) The above studies are related equally to men's and **women**'s employment.

* Last year, however, the Women 's Bureau of my Department undertook a major survey of **women**'s employment, on behalf of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, on 'The role of **women** in the economy'.

* The report dealt with such subjects as trends in labor force participation, employment patterns, education and training of **women**.

* The Bureau is currently undertaking a pilot study of Federal industrial awards 
It is disappointing to see that the number of **women** in the work force increased from 444,700 in November 1961 to 1.4 million in 1977.

* The number of married **women** as a percentage of all **women** in the work force has increased from 42 per cent to 65 per cent in 1976.

* 1 ) How many delegates attended the recently concluded Women's Health Conference at Queensland University.

* How many of these were selected on (a) a health professional, (b) Government department, (c) social welfare, (d) consumer organisation, (e) **women**'s organisations and (f) political, basis.

* It has a responsibility to the 800,000 surviving ex-servicemen and **women**, to the ex-service organisations and, above all, to the nearly 10,000 people on the staff of the Repatriation Department.

* On this point I urge the Returned Services League and other ex-service organisations to speak up loud and clear and to demand that the Repatriation Department be retained as a specialist organisation responsible for and to the 800,000 ex-service men and **women** who defended their country when defence was needed.

* It stated: 
Not only am I, as a member of the Opposition and as a former Minister for Repatriation, concerned, but also members of the Australian Country Party, members of the Opposition generally, the RSL and the 800,000 ex-service men and **women** want to know the position.

* I challenge the Government to specify exactly what is meant in the policy speech of the Australian Labor Party where the Prime Minister stated: 
Another major let-down for the ex-service men and **women** is in the area of the general rate pension.

* For the factual reasons I have advanced the Government deserves to be condemned by the 800,000 ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia and the Service organisations that represent them.

* 1 ) At what locations were the 1 9 **women** 's refuges, which were receiving Australian Government assistance as at 31 
Is the total Australian Government assistance available to the States for Community Health Centres and Women's Refuges $64.9m in 1976-77.

* The Minister talks about the special needs of migrant **women**.

* If the actions being taken in respect of migrant **women** matched the actions being taken by the Government in the whole area of **women** generally, then it is tokenism of the worst kind which is characteristic of this Government.

* There are very few **women** in this country who would say that the Government is doing anywhere enough for the special needs of **women** generally.

* My bet is that the migrant **women** feel exactly the same.

* We are told that at least one woman has been appointed to each settlement council and we are urging that **women** be included on the committees of management that run the migrant resource centres.

* Why not talk about nearly half of the appointments to these bodies being **women**.

* After all, half the people who come to the country as migrants are **women**.

* It would destroy a dictatorship much more ruthless and far less human than any dictatorship of the right wing, lt would eliminate immediately much of the present industrial unrest through which thousands of men are thrown out of work and **women** and children are going without proper food and clothing merely to satisfy a foreign philosophy.

* -Mr Speaker, I would like to inform the House that today, at 12.43 p.m., at Frances Perry House in the Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne, a boy was born to Kay, the wife of Gary Johnson.

* The last point I want to make is that I understand that under the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress the Aboriginal people themselves have very much wanted instruction for **women** and for men in health care.

* I believe that a  Dr Helen  Thorn is doing work in this regard as far as the health education of Aboriginal **women** is concerned.

* A **women**'s refuge primarily for Aboriginal **women** and operated by the Aborigines Advancement League, Northcote, is included in the Victorian program of **women**'s refuges approved for funding under the Community Health Program.

* The level of Commonwealth support for this refuge in 1979-80 will be dependent upon the level of funds available for **women**'s refuges nationally and upon the level of funds allocated to this particular refuge by the State authorities.

* Has his Government made a decision on whether young men and **women** who leave school this year and who genuinely seek work and cannot find it but who are not going on to higher education next year will be granted unemployment benefit during the period before schools resume next year?

* "(2 ) At least 2 of the Commissioners shall be **women**.

* 2995, will he now advise whether any further costs have been or will be incurred in respect of advertising, promotion, or public relations for the Women and Politics Conference.

* What is the estimated cost of all services and personnel involvement in the Women and Politics Conference.

* It proposes complete abolition of the means test for residentially qualified men and **women** aged 75 or more.

* The rate of training allowance for **women** undergoing full time courses under the training scheme for widow pensioners and supporting mothers is to be increased by $4 per week to $8 per week.

* Its main industries are Bradford Cotton Mills, which employs 1,800 men and **women**.

* In my electorate we have the unenviable distinction of having 3,000 registered unemployed  -  1,800 men and 1,200 **women**.

* There has not been the comparable and balanced growth of secondary industry of the types which would provide employment, in particular for **women**.

* The other aspect of the report which is important is that at the end of December 1974 twothirds of those training under NEAT were **women**.

* However, before referring to the training of **women** under NEAT I would like to make clear that all members of this Committee have experienced problems associated with maladministration, problems stemming from the fact that the policy in regard to NEAT has changed almost daily.

* Before I move on to the question of **women** under the NEAT scheme, I would like to raise a third factor.

* There is also discrimination against married **women** who since 6 December are not regarded as 'primary breadwinners'.

* I am referring to **women** who wish to undertake a tertiary training program and to be reimbursed for books or fares and, where appropriate, fees.

* Firstly, she applied for assistance under NEAT in October 1974 when the then Minister boasted that NEAT did not discriminate against **women** and that both men and **women** had the right to qualify in their own right.

* If we were to pay married **women** who have a primary breadwinner less than the $97 decreed by NEAT there would be more money to go around, more people would be able to be trained and more would be able to satisfy the essential aims of the Cochrane report which are to contribute to overcoming skills in short supply; to assist in long term structuring of the work force and bring about overall increases in the general levels of skill; and to serve the social and economic well-being of the community by the removal of inequalities and the enhancement of employment opportunities.

* Since the Government was elected to office all its economic decisions have been directed to shifting men, **women** and resources from private industry and employment to the official government sector.

* The people it purports to represent are those who will suffer the  most, 
Have any studies been undertaken on the possible replacement of the present maternity leave provisions for female employees in the Commonwealth Public Service and several associated groups with a realistic maternity benefit available to all pregnant **women**.

* How many **women** are employed in each of the groups referred to in pan ( 3 ).

* How many ex-servicemen and **women** who have served in a theatre of war have applied for free treatment of malignant cancer.

* The first and most important is the welfare and wellbeing of the men, **women** and children of Australia in the future who are going to be entitled to the benefits which this Bill is designed to provide.

* 1 ) How many (a) men and (b) **women** were granted Australian citizenship in 1977.

* How many (a) men and (b) **women** were refused citizenship in 1977 because of their insufficient knowledge of English.

* Rix AMWU activist (**women**), Communist Party of Australia 'Tribune' 27 October 1971.

* If offering and paying decent wages and granting decent conditions to our servicemen and **women** is a bribe then the Opposition would have been well advised, when its members were in Government, to have paid bribes to the servicemen instead of conscripting our gallant young men and sending them to death in Vietnam.

* Accompanying that promise was our stated aim to make the conditions of service in the armed forces such that we would attract to the service of their country not only sufficient suitable young men and **women**, but also that we would retain the services of these trained people, as they would be, after their first term of enlistment was ended.

* It was our party's well-publicised judgement that attractive conditions of service would make it easier for young men and **women** to make their decision to enlist in the service of their country without being penalised relative to the remainder of the community.

* But even so the moral question would still remain, and I believe that few people would agree that young men and **women** who have willingly offered to serve their country and pay the supreme sacrifice if needs be, should be disadvantaged in relation to the remainder of the community, but it does appear that since 1949 Austraiian governments have not subscribed to this sentiment.

* For that reason I am pleased that this Bill not only changes the basic philosophy of the Act, but also, in doing so, extends the eligibility for benefits to single and widowed nurses and ex-service **women** without dependants, who have the necessary qualifying service under the Act.

* This Bill not only gives belated justice to the **women** in this category, but also gives justice to those members of welfare organisations who served overseas.

* Why have we a situation in which men and **women** in his own electorate, and in other parts of Brisbane- indeed in every part of this country- are being thrust on to the dole queues?

* We may even need to encourage companies which employed married **women** to come to an area by making land available free up to a certain period and by offering other incentives.

* When will financial and other assistance be provided to homeless men and **women**.

* What action has been taken on the report of the working party on homeless men and **women** which he received more than 8 months ago.

* Has the Government explored employment opportunites for **women** wishing to work part-time.

* The repatriation content of the 1972-73 Budget demonstrates clearly this Government's acceptance of its responsibilities to the exservicemen and **women** of Australia, their widows and their dependants.

* Indeed, the testimony given by Warrant Officer Ossie Ostara to which I referred in a question to the Prime Minister today, is another testimony to the degree to which these communists who are taking over South Vietnam and who are at the moment taking over Cambodia are likely to demonstrate little concern for the men, the **women** and the children whose lives and well-being are of no consequence to them.

* In circumstances of conflict, a head in the sand rigid attitude of ideology, the advancement of ideology insensitive to the sufferings of men, **women** and children and the exploitation by the Government of the concern of" the Australian people for human causes provide no excuse for a foreign policy.

* Labor's numbers in Federal Parliament are small, but I am proud that we have a number of men and **women** who have the ability and understanding needed to lead Australia when the time comes.

* 1 ) Are **women** able to join Australian expeditions to the Antarctic; if not why not.

* Does he intend to revise the expedition program so that **women** may be included in it.

* They are the effect of new technologies, employment and unemployment, discrimination in employment and the tripartite committee on issues affecting **women** in the work force.

* Before I am accused of being a hopeless reactionary who is not aware of the extraordinary difficultiespersonal and financial- faced by men and **women** whose marriages have failed, let me hasten to add that I am strongly of the view that divorce law reform is urgently needed.

* The Opposition's alternatives which would take us right outside our capitalist system are just not on for the working men and **women** of Australia- the people whom we as a coalition are bent on supporting in the context of the present Budget.

* What percentage of that number are **women**.

* How many **women** in the Department are employed in a senior executive/administrative capacity.

* About 4 years ago in Melbourne it was found that of SO consecutive **women** admitted to a general geriatric unit, 23 were mentally ill enough to be in a psychiatric hospital; whilst 28 of SO consecutively admitted to a mental hospital were seriously physically disabled.

* Unfortunately some men and **women** are alcoholics and drug addicts.

* I would also express my deep appreciation to the men and **women** of my Department who worked untiringly to meet the deadlines set by the emergency Cabinet meeting.

* The valuable tradition of frankness and forthrightness in Public Service advice is sustained not by security of tenure but by the character and integrity of the men and **women** appointed to senior positions.

* In all cases it is men and **women** who matter most, not red tape.

* The honourable member for La Trobe asked me specifically whether the honourable member for Lalor was correct when in Melbourne recently he said that his activities had exceeded those of the 5 **women** who served a term of imprisonment.

* According to the terms of a statement issued in Melbourne by the honourable gentleman he was not dealt with in similar terms to the 5 **women** and because of the absence of similar treatment, to use his words, there was cynicism in the application of the law.

* I am informed by senior officers of my Department that the situation depicted by the honourable member for Lalor is a distortion and a misrepresentation of the facts because his misadventure at the office of the Department of Labour and National Service in Melbourne on Monday was very different from those of the 5 **women** concerned.

* Firstly, the honourable gentleman was not sitting on the floor or in the lift as was the case with the 5 **women** concerned.

* In the second place, I understand that the honourable gentleman was not heard to be issuing vulgarities as one of the **women** involved was so heard.

* That was not the case with the 5 **women**; they refused to leave.

* The **women** concerned were asked to leave.

* In recent years we have become more aware of our responsibility to the Australian men and **women** and boys and girls who live with a physical disability or handicap.

* It is an appeal from many fine, wonderful Australians- men and **women** and boys and girls- to include them in our appreciation of television and perhaps films.

* It is a reasonable conclusion reached by concerned men and **women** with the future needs, comforts and prosperity of the people of Victoria very much in mind.

* make life hell for **women** and children- 
Turning to recent incidents that have been verified by independent observers and covered by reputable news media, there is no question but that Kampuchea troops have killed villagers, including **women** and children, living in the border areas between Thailand and Kampuchea.

* and (3) The Women's Services are auxiliary forces to enable the release of men for employment on operational tasks.

* In accordance with accepted national attitudes **women** are not trained for combat duty.

* Women have the same opportunities for promotion as men in their respective fields.

* Has he also seen reports of numerous border clashes with Thailand stating that numerous Thai villagers, including **women** and children, have been massacred?

* It is apparent that in this sector involving the training of young men, and **women** perhaps, the Department of Works has not suffered the cut backs that are apparent in other branches of the Public Service.

* The campaign was also featured in 4 foreign language sessions and was discussed in detail in an interview in a **women**'s programme on Station 2WL.

* The campaign and the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan in general, were featured by WIN4 in 3 successive Saturday morning migrant education programmes, and were also discussed in an interview in a **women**'s programme on that channel.

* There are training schemes for Aborigines, for national servicemen to whom I referred a moment ago, for those displaced owing to redundancy or replaced by technological change, for **women** wishing to re-enter the work force, and there is training provided under the rural reconstruction scheme.

* By our encouragement of double incentives to employers of apprentices in country areas we are providing opportunities to young men and **women** who would otherwise have to leave the country to seek employment.

* More men and **women** would be employed and more resources would be in use if only more government contracts were let.

* The honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  said today- I almost hate to quote it- that **women** should not have been given the vote.

* It is an indictment of the **women** of this country.

* In fact I would like to discuss the very concept of representation from each State which the Government is enshrining in legislation and its sexist approach in insisting that 2 **women** be appointed.

* Did we think that **women** did not listen to the radio and did not know anything about it?

* At present there is nothing in the legislation to preclude all the commissioners being **women**.

* The circumstances which cause **women** to seek abortion; 
The action required to assist **women** in avoiding the necessity for abortion; 
The action required to ensure that all medical services are available free of cost to all **women** where pregnancy becomes a social and medical problem; 
Are employment opportunities for local **women** being inhibited by the employment of wives of American servicemen.

* I would have thought it unbelievable that the Australian Parliament, manned by men and **women** with normal cerebral processes, would ever have put in an Act of Parliament something like the words contained in clause 7: 
The amendments refer to the matter to which I was just speaking.

* Indeed to single out the spouse in this way surely must be offensive to those who are taking an interest in such matters as International Women's Year and in the rights of **women** and their position in the Australian community.

* It singles **women** out and gives them a right to vote simply because they are with their husbands or wives as the case may be.

* No doubt 'spouse' would apply mainly to **women** and in very few cases to men.

* Finally I mention **women** who become involved in bigamous marriages.

* It is unfortunately true that a small number of **women** become involved unknowingly in bigamous marriages.

* I believe that a humanitarian service would thus be provided to a group of unfortunate **women** in our community.

* The remainder, roughly  19%  of the men and  13%  of he **women**, were living at home.

* A sum of $47,241 is mentioned in the case of the **women**'s hall of residence proposed for Tasmania, and a figure considerably in excess of that for the hall of residence at Monash University.

* Already a sum of $566,000 is earmarked to be shared by the Commonwealth and the States for the first stage of real building of this **women**'s hall of residence.

* The only **women**'s hall of residence is one which is not of the university but has long been associated with it.

* Until the recent advent of a rather small Catholic **women**'s college, again off campus, this was the only accommodation available for female students.

* So the proposition that there should be a **women**'s hall of residence - the direct female counterpart of Hytten Hall - is to be commended, lt is very much in demand and will be amply and properly used when the time comes.

* They are men and **women** who have offered a great deal from Australia and are great ambassadors for this country.

* Those functions have been connected with the Country Women's Association, the Red Cross Society, the Crippled Children's Association and the Returned Services League.

* Nearly 90 per cent of all age pensioners, 43 per cent of invalid pensioners, 29 per cent of widow pensioners and over 63 per cent of **women** receiving the supporting mothers benefit are in receipt of supplementary assistance.

* The Opposition has as its paramount objective to draft into citizen rights and responsibilities young men and young **women** at the age of 18.

* As a matter of fact, what we are asking for is this: That a legal anachronism, a feudal anachronism, some 900 years old should be removed for all time as a permanent insult to the young men and young **women** of this country.

* It has had to retrench one hundred out of 300 **women** who work in an area where alternative employment does not exist.

* The vast majority of special beneficiaries - who also make up the 84,000 claimed by the Minister - were **women**.

* The interesting thing about the group of people in the less than $46.50 a week income bracket who have registered is, as the Department of Social Services report indicates, that 6 out of 10 families registered are families led by **women** and, in particular, by deserted wives.

* So the majority of people in the scheme are **women**, because they earn far less and are relying on State government subsidies.

* The Commission will be able to force conditions of equal pay, conditions for **women** and all these sorts of social policies rather than do as purchasers for the Government do now, that is, buy where they can get the best value for money.

* It seems to me to argue that tenders should be rejected by the Stores and Tender Board if they are from a firm that is not certified as having no discriminatory practices against **women**.

* Of course, there will be an army of public servants going through every factory that is likely to supply anything from a button or a needle to an aeroplane, to see whether there are discriminatory practices against **women**.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1972.

* The men and **women** employed in these controlling departments are fully conscious of the need for better facilities and equipment and for modern buildings.

* Until this year the **women**'s prison in South Australia was situated in the middle of the Adelaide Gaol which was built 2 years after the State was colonised.

* Women were incarcerated in that place without segregation.

* (a) During the period 1 July 1973 to 30 June 1976 approximately 11,000 **women** employed under the Public Service Act have made use of the provisions of the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act 1 973.

* Information on the number of **women** returning to duty on completion of maternity leave is not recorded.

* The Public Service Board estimates that between 40 and 45 per cent of **women** availing themselves of the maternity leave provisions resume their public service careers at the end of their maternity leave.

* And is he therefore saying, against the background of what he has already said about the cutback in our defence forces, that the men and **women** at Richmond are to be sacrificed to a sloppy piece of decision making by a Government which has been in operation long enough to have done better?

* The situation of **women** who leave work for marriage and child rearing only to face years of boredom and isolation after the children are able to look after themselves is probably worse.

* They have an expectation of 78 years for **women** and 73 years for men.

* The result of this might be that many **women** presently in the work force would choose to remain at home.

* I do not want to see the Government coercing **women** out of the work force but I think that option should be open to them.

* The Western Australian men's and **women**'s hockey associations have combined their resources and have embarked on a giant public fund raising campaign with a target of $250,000.

* Australia's men's and **women**'s hockey teams will use it extensively in the lead-up to their preparations for the 1980 Olympics and, of course, beyond that time.

* For the first time, **women**'s hockey will be an Olympic sport.

* I can only describe these terrorists as a murdering band of thugs who take as their victims civilian men, **women** and children.

* Sincere as these people may be, I ask them seriously: What would Australia have done if at regular intervals bands of terrorists landed on Australian shores, assassinated our men, **women** and children, and then retired to the sanctuary of a friendly neighbouring country?

* For, in a sense, the cold-blooded killing of innocent Israeli civilians, **women** and children by Al Fatah desperadoes was aimed against both Israel and Egypt.

* Moreover, the Government believes that servicemen and service **women** would wish to have the major aspects of their pay and financial conditions of employment given a thorough examination by a body sufficiently detached from their employing organisations in the government area and equipped to draw relevant comparisons with pay and conditions in the civilian community.

* As requested by the Minister for Defence during the course of the inquiry, to inquire into and report on any existing specific allowances intended to cover financial costs which from time to time fall upon service men and service **women** when meeting Service requirements.

* In making recommendations, the Committee of inquiry should have full regard to the national requirement to attract and retain men and **women** with needed qualities, skills and experience for the armed forces, (viii) In making its recommendations upon the system of emoluments the Committee of inquiry should have it as an objective that emoluments payable to the members of the regular armed forces should be readily com.

* The Government's objective is to develop further the defence force Australia requires and in the words of the terms of reference 'to attract and retain men and **women** with needed qualities, skills and experience for the Australian forces'.

* But if we ignore infringements of liberty, freedom and the rights of men and **women** throughout the world we cheapen the respect we hold for our own freedoms and we move closer to the total enslavement of all mankind.

* I believe that **women** who happen to be nurses should be liberated from this prospective violation of their nature as **women** and this repudiation of the very raison d'etre of the nursing profession.

* A considerable number of **women** come back for several abortions.

* I cannot for the life of me understand what objective they had in mind in murdering innocent men, **women** and children.

* If anything, I believe it will strengthen their resolve and the result will be, regrettably, massive retaliation which in turn will result in possibly hundreds, though hopefully not, of innocent Palestinian men, **women** and children being killed.

* Those honourable members who are familiar with the Middle East situation will know that it has been the practice of Palestinians to have their guerrilla hideouts in villages so that when the Israelis retaliate they hit villages with the result that **women** and children are killed.

* It is interesting to note that these **women**, representing the three armed services, were placed in circumstances during the period of the great wars whereby they could be subject to the threat of this dreadful disease.

* I refer honourable members opposite to the project carried out by a group of migrant **women** in Victoria.

* Once again, if honourable members opposite have any reasonable attitude at all they will take into account how vital are the translation services to the migrant **women** who are under pressure of massive exploitation in this country.

* The Government is determined to relegate migrants, in particular migrant **women**, to the role of factory fodder, to the role of second class citizens unable to communicate their needs, unable to demand their rights.

* They are: The widow pensioners training scheme; the national service vocational training scheme; the employment training scheme for **women** restricted from employment by domestic responsibilities; the employment training scheme for Aborigines; the employment training scheme for persons displaced by technological change; and the rural reconstruction employment training scheme to which the honourable member made passing reference.

* But we know that the real figure is vastly greater than that because the figure I have just mentioned does not include people such as **women** who are out of the work force or people who are waiting for a job or new school leavers who have not been able to register.

* How do **women** get a job under the RED scheme?

* Anyone who is naive enough to believe that the abortion business is motivated solely by deep compassion for a few desperate **women** and girls should look at how profitable that compassion can be.

* There is a demand for abortions coming from the community, not only from **women** but also from men.

* I can only hope and pray that we will recover our senses before it is too late and that our men and **women** eventually will realise the dignity and precious value of every human life.

* The reason I wish to speak to the amendment is specifically this: The presumption throughout this legislation has been the equality of men and **women** to enter divorce and therefore to have exactly the same basis on which their marriages should be terminated, the fact of the matter is that a vast number of marriages up to the present time have been based on decisions made on social mores which were the accepted views of the community as early as 50 or 60 years ago.

* Many **women** who entered into marriage contracts in earlier times did so on the specific presumption that their husbands would take care of them and be the sole or main source of their maintenance.

* In  other words, a vast number of marriages do not in fact give **women** the basis of equality that is presumed in this legislation.

* What is the percentage break-down for degree and diploma courses undertaken by men and **women** in Australian tertiary institutions?

* How many Women's Health Centres are there in New South Wales, and where are they located.

* 5 ) Is he able to say what has been the amount of the New South Wales Government's financial (a) allocation to and (b) expenditure on the Women's Health Centre program during each of the last 4 years and in 1 978 to date.

* Is he able to say whether the services being provided by the Women's Health Centres in New South Wales are being cut back; if so, what effect is this having on those persons using the services.

* I would do all that I could to dissuade individual **women** from having abortions and to provide all possible servicesmedical, counselling, home help- so that they could go ahead with their pregnancies without fear.

* It would be a moral outrage if **women** who did not want to abort were forced, cajoled or coerced into doing so.

* But I am also concerned about a situation where girls and **women** are told by some bureaucrat that they are compelled to go through with a pregnancy that they fear and hate.

* This light capsules the spirit of strong yet gentle men and **women** who have lost their patience, who have suffered for what must seem to them an enternity and who are now putting into practice in this modern environment the same sense of preservation, determination and survival demonstrated by their forebears who tamed the harsh dry areas of Australia.

* It grieves us to realise that waterside workers can load a boat destined for Vietnam to help the people of that country but do refuse to load boats with cargoes, the sale of which will safeguard and ensure the living of Australian men, **women** and children.

* Does his Department maintain a list of all **women**'s groups in Australia and their office bearers.

* This programme was mentioned by the Government in its policy speech and results from a recognition of the factors to which the honourable gentleman made reference, that is, the increase in the number of married **women** who have entered the work force.

* Some 35 per cent of all married **women** were in the work force in  1970.

* I want to observe very quickly that in the first place this programme was designed not to encourage **women** to enter the work force but to deal with an immediate problem which now exists and which, as I understand it, is of such dimensions that a quarter of a million children under  6  years of age have mothers who are currently in the work force.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1972.

* It is time that we looked again at the Meals on Wheels movement and considered it in the light of our present society - a society in which more **women** work than ever before.

* Many of the **women** who are now in the work force previously made great contributions to charity and assisted with various community efforts.

* I am quite sure that there are many **women** in our society who would dearly love to assist in delivering meals to the aged and to the sick, but who, because they are not born lucky or are not living in an affluent situation, simply cannot afford to do so.

* 1 ) There is no record of expectant alien **women** seeking visitors' visas in order that their confinements should take place in Australia and there is no provision within visitor policy for applications to be approved if they were made for that purpose.

* Children have, however, been born in Australia to **women**- both British and alien- who were granted visitor entry for other purposes.

* They know that they are guilty of the crime of forcing young men and **women** out of country towns into the cities because there is no employment there for them.

* One major question he hoped to answer was whether cannabis had thalidomide-type action on pregnant **women**.

* Will he confer with the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs and, as recently suggested by me, set up a programme to train men and **women** so that a team of experienced practical people may be brought into being in order to undertake the long and hard job of leading and teaching the Aborigines in the Northern Territory to develop their own vast resources for their own benefit.

* I am unlikely to be in the situation of having to make a personal judgment on this and I do not know what Women's Lib would say if it were interested in pregnant **women** teachers.

* But, incredibly, members of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force are not eligible because of the way in which the Defence Service Homes Act is worded.

* Women who also enlisted to serve anywhere but who were not sent overseas are ineligible.

* I ask: Why should **women** who serve in peacetime be eligible for these homes whilst those who served in time of war are not?

* We have decided to abolish the means test within the next 3  years  for age pension eligibility for residentially qualified men and **women** aged 65 and over.

* They believe that a significant improvement in the fertility rate could be induced by an improved social benefits scheme for **women** with children.

* Specifically they suggest that **women** leaving work to have families should be paid a benefit for the period during which they are caring for their family.

* It is one of the things that, if implemented, will probably help to solve the unemployment problem as well because the unemployment figures no doubt include quite a number of married **women** who have no desire to work.

* That is that I believe that **women** in rural areas have had a very significant role to play.

* Whether we like it or not, there is very good evidence that in the country at least, **women** have attained higher levels of education than their husbands and are more receptive, more responsive and are better equipped to undergo further training than their husbands.

* I refer to the lack of employment opportunities for the young, for **women**, particularly those who wish to return to the work force, lack of mobility in jobs, lack of post-school educational facilities, inadequate specialist services, communication costs, which are quite disastrous particularly for small business, the remoteness from centres of administration and, in some cases, without exaggeration, the survival of some of the smaller centres in these rural electorates.

* Women in my electorate have taken it wholeheartedly and welcome it greatly.

* The reform that was introduced last year, to change the basis of family allowances, I believe, was probably the most significant single social welfare reform since Federation especially to help **women**.

* In many cases it has given **women** in the Australian community a degree of financial independence which they never had before.

* Some people say that this approach encourages **women** to go out to work and that that kind of encouragement ought not to be provided, but I think that kind of criticism is utterly missing the point.

* There are many **women** and single parents in the Australian work force and unless there are adequate child care facilities, in a great many cases children are not properly looked after when their parents, whether they come from a 2 parent or a single parent family, are working.

* What percentage of the workforce is currently composed of **women**.

* What percentage of the total wage and salary bill computed on an annual basis is earned by **women**.

* It is a vital factor in the employment of **women**.

* There is a very high percentage of **women** employed in the textile and clothing industries in this country.

* If he had, surely the Government would never have introduced this 25 per cent across-the-board tariff cut and put thousands of decent Australian men and **women** out of work.

* I ask the Minister for Health: Is it a fact that in Leichhardt, a suburb of Sydney, there is in existence a **women**'s medical centre operated by a group of **women** who previously ran an abortion referral service known as 'Control'?

* In particular some of the factors which have influenced today's decision include the increasing number of refugees entering Australia, the Government's desire to improve access to language classes for migrant **women**, a general increase in demand for English language classes for migrants, and the commendable way in which some employers are encouraging their employees to develop faculty with the English language.

* This wil be of particular importance for migrant **women** employees.

* In this case the Government has chosen to single out **women** working in Commonwealth employment who for the first time in the history of Australian industrial legislation have achieved paid maternity leave.

* It is widely recognised in the Australian community that the legislation introduced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  as Minister for Labour and Immigration in 1973 was a significant breakthrough in the quest of working **women** to achieve equality of opportunity.

* They are an insult to the integrity of many thousands of **women** working in public employment.

* Of those **women** two out of three were married.

* Most **women** bear children and they should not be discriminated against in the work force because of their unique biological function of childbearing.

* Maternity leave is necessary to enable **women** to combine their dual roles as workers and child bearers.

* As recently as the last election the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  reiterated that point when he said: 
The Government is committed to complete equality of opportunity for **women**.

* Most of the alleged problems associated with this legislation are: The **women** never come back; **women** join the Public Service when they are already pregnant just to get the benefits that are available; and **women** tie up jobs.

* Surveys show that, despite the enormous difficulties in getting child care for children under 1 8 months old, 50 per cent of **women** return from maternity leave.

* This Bill reveals the Government's callous disregard for working **women** in Australia.

* Instead of cutting back on maternity leave for public employees it should be concerned to see that all Australian **women** have access to paid maternity leave.

* 1 percent; in 1966, 35.2 percent and in 1975, 41.7 per cent- underline **women**'s tremendous contribution to Australian society.

* Despite this increase **women** still tend to be employed in those areas that are considered traditionally female- the less skilled and lower paid jobs.

* Yet this Government, and particularly the less rational sections of its back bench, speak of **women** as invaders of the work place.

* Sections of this Government and the ratbag element in our media have taken up the 'dump **women**' slogan.

* Why did Government not support the Australian Council of Trade Unions maternity leave case, if it is genuine in its concern for working **women**?

* To this must be added heightened career and occupational aspirations of **women** themselves.

* Many **women** find it essential to return to work after having a child because they are family breadwinners or because the survival of the family depends upon two incomes.

* The implication is clear: The stock of jobs must be increased to meet their growing employment aspirations and governments must act to ensure that **women** are not discriminated against in employment on the grounds of marriage and pregnancy.

* I ask the Minister for the Capital Territory if he is aware that **women**, including a very distinguished senator, have been refused service by certain Canberra hotels?

* Will the Minister ensure that in Territories administered by the Australian Government **women** do not suffer discrimination in this or in any other form?

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in the Department of Foreign Affairs since  2  December 1972.

* The Public Service Board has recently introduced an executive development scheme directed to men and **women** in the senior levels of the Third Division who have the capacity to undertake higher administrative duties and who require further experience in practical and theoretical aspects of administration, policy advising and management.

* All States provide assistance to various categories of **women** with children and subsequently claim reimbursement of proportionate amounts from the Commonwealth under the provisions of the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act.

* and (2) At April 1973 approximately 61 per cent of men aged 65 years and over and approximately 74 per cent of **women** aged 60 years and over who were qualified by residence for an age pension were in receipt of a pension from the Department of Social Security.

* I refer the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the clarion call he issued yesterday, calling on Australian **women** to procreate or perish.

* Is the Minister for Labor and Immigration aware of the recent dispute involving the sacking of 17 **women** at Dreffin Everhot Ltd, a manufacturing company in Bayswater, Victoria, in respect of which charges have been made by the sacked **women** that they have been sexually discriminated against?

* Is he aware of the allegations that some of the sacked **women** are single parents and the breadwinners of their families, while some of the men who now occupy their positions hold more than one job?

* Ill and this is United Nations International Women's Year?

* That they welcome the statement by the honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned.

* He said, for example, that **women**'s refuges are being forced to close because of expenditure cuts by this Government.

* I recall that in the last Budget we allocated an amount of up to $ 1 ,7m to be expended on **women**'s refuges, compared with the amount of $700,000 allocated in the previous Budget.

* It not only enabled the Maroondah Halfway House, which is located in my electorate, to continue operating in security but also enabled other **women**'s refuges to be opened up around the country.

* I took him along to the Maroondah Halfway House late last year to let him see what was happening there and to allow him to speak to some of the **women** inhabiting that house at the time.

* There is increasing evidence that sufficiently widespread motivation for limiting family size cannot be produced without more families becoming aware that their standard of living is rising, including benefiting from a higher level of education, especially for **women**.

* This clarion call to **women** in the community hardly fits the absence of any tax deduction for child care centres in this Budget - a preelection promise which has been broken.

* Has he seen reports about an Australian interviewed repeatedly on radio and television who claims to be a principal in a company advertising in the United States of America and Hong Kong for **women** to marry 
Australian men?

* Does he claim- that is, the principal of the company, not the Minister- to have more than 20 000 single, good looking, clean, well educated, sexy and rich Australian men on his books and does he charge these **women** large sums to arrange introductions?

* Will the Minister advise our consular representatives overseas to tell any interested **women** that 'it ain't necessarily so' and that all 3 Melbourne daily newspapers and the  Sydney Morning Herald  refuse to accept advertisements from this company?

* The Committee, assisted by over 100 advisers- men and **women** of eminence in their own professions- has undoubtedly established itself as the principal authority in Australia on qualifications gained overseas and, as such, is a central reference point for professional bodies, registration authorities, universities, public and private employers and individual applicants who seek advice in evaluating foreign degrees, diplomas and professional experience.

* There is no alternative for the employment of **women**.

* until further evidence is available, special precautions should be taken to avoid exposure of **women**, particularly those in the child-bearing age group to 2,4,5T.'

* Federal Funds for Women's Refuges in Queensland (Question No.

* It is time that we gave a publicity boost to this beautiful land of ours with its vastness, its grandeur, its beauty, its colour, its vigour, its varieties, its history, its customs, its humour, its uniqueness, its music, its adventure, its rawness, its beautiful **women** and its sports-minded men.

The people concerned with the dairy industry in Victoria are in trouble.

* The mood of dairy men and **women** in the McMillan electorate is one of depression, particularly in those areas where farmers supply the manufacturing sector of the industry.

* From that day to this, such statements have meant that the men and **women** of the

* The heart of the nation will prevail because people want to remain free men and free **women** in a free society.

* But the statement underlines the hostility which the Opposition parties have- if one assumes that the honourable member for Wannon does officially represent their view- towards **women**.

* It shows an underlying prejudice against **women**.

* It shows an underlying prejudice against **women**.

* And the Government is determined - 
The following table sets out the percentage of married **women** among employed persons for the years most closely corresponding to the honourable member's question.

* The number of employed persons includes those who are selfemployed since these cannot be separated for married **women** from 1964 onwards: 
Table 1: Percentage of Married Women among Employed Persons in the Australian Workforce: 1911, 1921, 1933, 1947, 1954, 1961 and 1964 to 1975 inclusive.

* asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs, upon notice, on 26 May 1977: 
With reference to his answer on 24 May 1977  (Hansard,  page 1774) that a working **women**'s centre has not yet been established in Adelaide and the answer of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on 9 December 1976  (Hansard,  page 3702) that Adelaide is among the cities where there are Working Women's Centres or Groups, what is the reason for the difference in the answers.

* There are families- men, **women** and children- involved.

* These mean nothing to the Administration now in power because apparently on this question and in so many of the other basic areas that concern the interests of the men and **women** on the land it is prepared to cause those electors and those persons to be stabbed in the back because of the wanton disregard by the ALP in this House of the real needs of the people on the land.

* What has been his response to representations made to him on 28 October 1977 by the NSW Local Government Community Workers' Association in which concern and dismay was expressed about the drastic curtailment of funding for the following Government responsibilities: (a) welfare workers under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, (b) Family Law Court Counselling Service, (c) education programs, including after school care, child care and other family care programs, and migrant classes for adults, (d) health care services including community health centres, domiciliary care services and **women**'s health centres, (e) unemployment and unemployment relief schemes, (0 housing, in particular housing for the aged and invalid people, (g) pension and benefit reductions in real values and proposed transfers of responsibility for these, (h) 470 community programs funded under the Australian Assistance Plan, (i) programs for the handicapped, (j) the Legal Aid Commission Bill, (k) Aboriginal affairs, (1) grant in aid services for migrants and interpreter services, (m) Australian Government printing services, (n) national co-ordinating bodies for youth affairs, (o) **women** 's refuges subsidies reductions and (p) Australian Bureau of Statistics processing.

* I told the **women** representing the welfare clubs not to underestimate the power of commercial television operators to put pressure on certain people to prevent teeth being put into this legislation.

* I think it is most fitting that in this Parliament we pay tribute to the Australian men and **women** who were on the field staff.

* The answer of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations on 9 December  (Hansard, page  3702) to the honourable member's previous question stated that there are Working Women's Centres or Groups in a number of cities, including Adelaide.

* There is no Working Women's Centre as yet in Adelaide.

* However, a group called the Working Women's Charter Campaign Group has plans to set up a centre.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1 972.

* Removal of a provision which discriminates against married **women** in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into line with that applying to unemployment benefit.

* The Government has decided to remove an element of discrimination existing in relation to the eligibility of married **women** to receive sickness benefit.

* This provision is considered to discriminate against **women**.

* In other words, it catered for parents who were other than **women**.

* It is a way by which ordinary persons, the men and **women** down the street, will be able to put their money into something from which they will be able to get a reasonable return and, at the same time, feel that they are making a real contribution to the development of Australia.

* One of these is that **women**'s reproductive organs are affected to a point at which monstrosities can be produced.

* While these dangers of the drug pusher exist, these men and **women** in public life who promulgate the smoking of marihuana should be put away for the rest of their lives.

* We pay tribute to those men and **women** who served Australia so greatly.

* We have often heard of our servicemen and **women** being 'on active service'.

* No fancy rhetoric, no nifty footwork can assuage the deep feelings of resentment permeating the nation and the workers following the slaughtering of jobs for Australian men, **women** and youth by the Australian Labor Party.

* Did a survey conducted by his Department in 1969 estimate that an additional 100,000 **women** would join the work force if adequate child-minding centres were available.

* If so, (a) how many additional **women** are now likely to join the work force and (b) where will they find jobs.

* The mock trials of Orlov, Scharansky, Ginsberg and the Baltic dissident Petkus besmirched the name of justice in the eyes of all right-thinking men and **women** in all corners of the globe.

* The emphasis now being placed on personal fulfilment for **women** in their non-maternal role provides further incentive over and above the economic necessity which compels many a mother into the work force while her children still need her presence at home.

* The traditional emphasis on the importance of the maternal role has, I believe, suffered on both counts, and there is now a need to help contemporary **women** achieve the balance that they are entitled to find between personal fulfilment and maternal responsibility.

* Women's groups, educationalists, social workers and the medical profession have all gone on record in recent times advocating the need to make it possible for mothers to stay at home to care for their young children if they choose to do so, instead of being forced by economic circumstances to go out to work.

* In addition to reducing the financial pressures which prematurely force **women** out of work there is a need to help parents to understand and provide for the needs of their young children.

* asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs, upon notice: 
1 ) Can he say whether the Working Women 's Centre in Melbourne and the Women's Trade Union Commission in Sydney are short of funds.

* It is time we had a look at that situation, whatever **women**'s liberation may say about it.

* The question of **women** in the work force raises another facet of unemployment.

* I think that in the terms of the child care centres and other things it is thoroughly within the province of the Minister - not my personal problem but the problem of the unemployment of **women** who are available for employment.

* If, in fact, we are doing the sort of thing that was projected yesterday in this chamber in relation to child care centres, then clearly there are measures being taken to make it possible for **women** to make themselves available for various forms of work.

* Information on the numbers of **women** and men who have sat as staff association nominees on Promotions Appeal Committees in the last twelve months is not available.

* Further surveys are being conducted of the representation of men and **women** on Promotions Appeal Committees in New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

* I know that the minds of honourable members opposite are closed and that their course is set but we are not talking to them tonight; we are talking to the men and **women** and the trade unionists of Australia - 
I congratulate the Minister however because he has found it possible to give us ready reckoners and tables to enable us to explain the true situation to our constituents.

* Even if they are doubtful whether they are eligible to receive this new benefit, all aged persons - men over 65 years, servicemen over 60 and **women** over 60  -  should make application for this new benefit in social service pensions if they are in receipt of superannuation payments, because the amounts are.

* Support for the parliamentary principle goes far beyond our ranks and the real pressure on him is going to come from the overwhelming ' majority of decent Australians- not least the overwhelming mass of decent Liberals- men and **women**- who, whatever their opinion of the Labor Party may be, believe profoundly in the great parliamentary principle which this House &lt; itself and this House alone embodies.

* I believe that the Speech was an attempt by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  to express the rather paternalistic view that he and the establishment he represents would like the ordinary men and **women** of Australia to have of him and his Government.

* This is a great pity because I am sure that the majority of members of the profession are still men and **women** who act with the highest integrity and ethics in the pursuit of their profession.

* I am sure that every honourable member here has known **women** who at some stage in their life have found themselves in the situation of considering abortion.

* I am sure every honourable member has known **women** who have decided to have an abortion and some who could not have one perhaps because of fear.

* Many honourable members would know the social cost in terms of neuroses when **women** for one reason or another do not have an abortion.

* Is that not a reminder of what the honourable member for Bradfield said, that we sit here as men making decisions for **women** when there is not a woman amongst us?

* Among industries affected is the woven shirts industry which employs some 85,000 **women** throughout Australia, and quite a proportion of those **women** are engaged in decentralised industry.

* As I said earlier, about 85,000 **women** are employed in the industry.

* I am told that about 60 per cent of those **women** are migrants.

* In my electorate alone Whitmonts employ 700 **women**.

* If that industry goes to the wall 700 **women** will be out of work in one town.

* In order to avoid any danger of his staff members becoming pregnant, he will not even give **women** job opportunities.

* Turning to a more serious aspect of this subject, I endorse the comments of the honourable member for Macquarie  (Mr Gillard)  who pointed out that the Government is not stripping away the rights to take leave of **women** in the Public Service who fall pregnant.

* I inform the House that after the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, made some comments last June or July foreshadowing changes in the maternity leave provisions, I received five phone calls from both men and **women** who were concerned about those provisions, either because they were men married to female public servants or, alternatively, being **women**, because they were planning families.

* We have already been told by the honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Young)  that some 70 per cent of the **women** who take advantage of the 12 weeks leave with pay, and who have access to a longer fully paid absence from work, return to work within a period of 12 weeks.

* He also mentioned that another 2 per cent to 3 per cent of those **women** have become pregnant and needed to take the leave within the first 12 months of their employment.

* The more pleasing feature of these figures is that which reveals the extent of the participation of married **women** in the work force.

* Minister, only 20,100 more jobs were made available to **women**.

* During last year when the Honourable E. G. Whitlam was the Prime Minister, 129,000 extra jobs were made available to **women**.

* I will repeat the figures: Under the Whitlam Government, in 1973, 129,000 extra jobs were made available to **women**, while under the McMahon Government in 1971 only 20,000 extra jobs were made available to **women**.

* They said that the **women** of the electorate of Lilley should vote Labor for a number of reasons.

* As I mentioned earlier, a special pamphlet was issued during the campaign for the last election which stated: 'Why will **women** vote Labor in Lilley?'

* One of the reasons for stating that that would be the case was because Labor **women** cared about the Brisbane airport.

* -I direct a question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs.

* Did the Government cancel the planned publication of a directory of support services to **women** in Australia?

* How has this decision been explained to the **women**'s groups with which Ministers have been consulting this week?

* Does the Government still consider it appropriate that **women** wishing to have access to this important information, which was collected and compiled at government expense, can have it only by purchasing  Woman's Day oi  23 and 30 August?

* There is this extraordinary avant-garde attitude that if a **women** is divorced and finds herself with a new status the forces of equality take over and she should be considered on all fours with the former partner of the marriage.

* The **women** is then obliged to go back to work.

* I think it is about time the national Parliament took cognisance of the fact that married **women** are not second class citizens.

* These will initially include the handicapped, the aged, migrants, youth and **women**.

* What is the percentage of (a) single **women**, (b) married **women** under 20 years of age, (c) married **women** from 20 to 30 years of age, (d) married **women** from 30 to 35 years of age, (e) married **women** from 35 years of age to 45 years of age and (f) 45 years of age and over, included in the total employees of the Australian work force.

* 1 ) Prior to 9 February, 1977, cash benefits were available to the aged in New Zealand in the form of either: age benefit- an income-tested, non-taxable cash payment to men and **women** aged 60 years of age and over (55 years for **women** in certain circumstances) subject to residence qualifications (generally ten years); or superannuation benefit- a cash payment made free of any income or assets test but subject to income tax, to men and **women** aged 65 years and over, subject to residence qualifications (generally twenty years).

* From 9 February, 1977, age and superannuation benefits were replaced by national superannuation, a taxable cash payment generally payable free of any income or assets test to men and **women** aged 60 years or more.

* The mining and export of uranium is the first political issue that has been surveyed in 20 years to which more **women** are opposed than men.

* On almost every other political issue surveyed in this country men voted differently to **women** by between 6 per cent and 10 per cent.

* More than SO per cent of the **women** in this country who have been surveyed are opposed to the mining and export of uranium.

* Can one imagine telling some of the **women** in Australia who are opposed to this policy to drop their opposition to it because the Government is going to look after the workers at Chryslers and General Motors-Holdens Pty Ltd?

* Throughout the poll, the negative response from **women** was stronger than from men, reflecting the influence of the rising cost of living and its sharper impact on the housewife.

* I know this is one of the matters about which **women** in Australia are concerned.

* I have written to the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  about this, and I hope the matter can be taken further within the Public Service so that in practice discrimination, whether against **women** or handicapped persons of any kind, can be eliminated altogether.

* Probably Government members, including the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury),  who is to follow, will give some indication of what the Government is doing in this case and also what it intends to do in regard to the closing by the Chysler-Rootes group of its plant at Fishermen's Bend in Victoria, where some 300 men and **women** have been thrown out of employment.

* These foreign-owned companies are using Australia's assets with complete disregard for the men and **women** they employ.

* In 1969, 785 men and **women** were engaged in wool merchandising at Newcastle.

* In the basic course 12 scholarships will be provided, tenable for 12 months, open in general to young men and **women** from any part of Australia who have passed the higher school certificate.

* I notice that there is a qualification which is worded: 
1) On the assumption that the right honourable member is referring to **women** who have been appointed or promoted to senior positions in my Department since 2 December 1972, 1 am advised that six **women**, including two who have been promoted to more senior positions that time, have been involved.

* These are in addition to three other **women** who were already in senior positions prior to 2 December 1972, but who have not been promoted in the meantime.

* At the moment people retire at certain arbitrary ages - men at 65 years and **women** at 60 years.

* Health Centre, Peakhurst Hunter Working Women's Centre, Mayfield Women's Health Centre, Liverpool Women's Health Centre,  Leichhardt 
-There were one or two things that the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt)  had to say that demand a reply.

* The Minister also knows, and on other occasions would be quite happy to admit, that the 36.7 per cent explosion in wage costs in 1975-76 about which he spoke was clearly related to a policy decision- certainly of the Labor Government but it was long overdue- to give equal pay to **women**.

* We all are aware that a very high percentage of people who work in hospitals are **women**.

* The Liberal Party, if it had been concerned about **women**, would have taken that step many years ago.

* It took the Australian Labor Party to identify that need for the thousands of **women** in hospitals across Australia and move to meet that need.

* The very important and basic point that that paper made is that if we seriously want to look- I do not think the Minister for Health really wants to look- for the primary cause of the uncontrolled escalation of health costs in Australia we should not look to the sick, the ill and the ordinary men and **women** of this country but to the medical profession itself.

* 6 ( Hansard, 17 October 1974, page 2582) relating to the number of men and **women** who have sat as union representatives on promotion appeal panels, when was the survey of the A.C.T.

* Arrangements are also being made to develop regular consultation between the Department of Social Security and organisations representative of **women**'s interests.

* This will ensure that the very valuable contribution which these groups can make in relation to the special needs of **women** is available to the Government in formulating its social welfare policies.

* I hope that this Parliament will make significant progress towards giving **women** an equal place in our society.

* For a country which once led the world in granting rights to **women** about the time this Parliament was established we have often since lagged behind the rest of the world.

* What many people fail to realise is that true equality for **women** is of great benefit to society - to both men and **women**.

* When this Parliament considers legislation which affects **women**, **women** should be consulted, and they should help make the decisions.

* This House can make a significant contribution to rights for **women** by, among other things, passing legislation to provide much better adult education facilities, to establish equal pay for work of equal value, to provide for family planning clinics, to build child care centres and to reform those laws which discriminate against **women** both socially and financially.

* I do not know that the senators come quite so close to this sort of thing, but every day every member of the House of Representatives has people coming in, more particularly **women**, seeking assistance.

* I agree with two or three speakers who today brought out the point that what is happening in the world is that some **women** are anxious to become identified with way-out attitudes and with some of the very strange and odd things that are happening and twisting this world beyond recognition, and that we slavishly follow other countries.

* We had a magnificent country with the highest possible standards and ideals until the media began extracting from some of these strange and odd countries new standards or substandards and we found many **women**'s organisations beginning to espouse them.

* How many **women** re-marry?

* How many **women** in Australia are still trying to work out how they are to sustain their children and educate them during an agonising ordeal?

* The Country Women's Association presumably could run stalls there to raise money for some country town or some country charity.

* It has particular regard to the needs of **women**, of country students, of migrants and of handicapped persons.

* Almost 70 per cent of men and over 80 per cent of **women** in the labour force have no formal educational qualification at the trade, technician or vocational level or a degree.

* In 1961 9.6 per cent of the labour force consisted of married **women**.

* The report specifically recognises the crucial role that married **women** have been playing and will continue to play in maintaining the growth rate in the workforce.

* It specifically seeks to make provision for married **women** to re-orient their skills or refresh their skills by making tangible suggestions as to the future organisation as to curricula and timetables.

* The Committee reacts sensitively and creatively to the disabilities experienced by girls and **women**, married or single, who have greater barriers to access to technical and further education than boys and men.

* The proportion of **women** enrolled in technical colleges is too low.

* Too few **women** are employed as teachers in technical colleges.

* The report states: 
The Committee is of the view that the proposed Commission should make special provision within its organisation for continuous consultation with State authorities to remove any access problems **women** have to courses within technical and further education.

* The lack of formal qualifications among **women** is exceeded by a greater lack in men in some of these groups; and of course the **women** of the Aboriginal race, ethnic minorities and migrant communities suffer special disabilities.

* and community interest; greater flexibility in entry requirements and in attendance requirements; particular attention should be paid to adapting technical and further education to the needs of **women**, handicapped, country students and migrants; the development of further education - the concept ranging from adult literacy and primary education to advanced studies and technology as an integral part of the education structure open to all; the provision of better means of pre-service teacher education, in consultation with the Commission on Advanced Education; the report seeks to foster community colleges in country areas - multi-level institutions combining technical and advanced education courses and avoiding unnecessary duplication, the funding to be in the hands of the Commission primarily responsible for the particular courses, in consultation with the other; technical colleges should contribute to developing new approaches to apprenticeship training; initial programs are designed to upgrade existing technical colleges, improve educational quality, and lay foundations for substantial improvements in the next triennium.

* A recent survey showed that by far the majority of Australian **women** really want to be wives and mothers and to remain in the home.

* This may have surprised some but not anyone with any perception of how closely linked are **women**'s biological capacity to bear children and the deep instinctive desire of the majority of **women** to fulfil themselves through that capacity.

* So also is any government action which forces or even encourages **women** to leave the home and their vital work of mothering and go out into the workforce.

* I want to emphasise that I do not deny **women** the right to choose their lifestyle in the community provided that their choice does not impinge on the rights of others.

* I believe we should upgrade the special nature of the woman as wife and mother within the home, encourage more **women** to take up that role and restore its pride, and remove from our society any pressures that might militate against any woman choosing that role if she wishes.

* The burden of direct and indirect taxation also falls heavily on the family and undoubtedly is one factor in forcing **women** out to work, even though this adds to the family's overall tax bill.

* In this context the Government is the community and I urge the Government to do all it can to encourage **women** back into the home so the family is not deprived of its heart.

* I think this would be one of the factors which would encourage **women** to stay at home instead of going out into the workforce.

* For instance, I refer to the magnificent services performed by Catholic nuns and other men and **women** interested in the care of their fellow human beings.

* The proposed amendments: Remove certain provisions relating to the employment of **women**; make certain changes in the provisions relating to long service leave; modify the current blanket prohibition on officers accepting directorships; remove the requirement for officers to take oaths or make affirmations; and change the  title  of the Service.

* Section 54a contains special provisions relating to married **women**.

* The repeal of these sections is one of the results of a review of aspects of employment of **women** in the Australian Public Service conducted by the Public Service Board.

* The attitude of the Australian community and of **women** themselves to their role in society are changing.

* Increasingly it is being accepted that **women** will assume a more important economic role and will combine marriage with a career which will extend throughout their adult lives.

* Honourable members will recall that barriers against the permanent appointment of **women** to the Third Division were removed in 1949, and restrictions against the permanent appointment of married woman to the service were removed in 1966.

* It was announced in August that as a result of the Board's review, all positions in the Australian Public Service are to be open equally to men and **women** applicants who can perform the full range of duties required.

* The Prime Minister indicated that the Government had agreed to repeal these provisions in the Public Service Act which could be said to discriminate against **women**, but which had become redundant.

* The Government has emphasised that it has a role and responsibility as Australia's largest employer in promoting the status of **women**.

* This amendment is one of the steps taken by the Government since coming to office in its endeavour to eliminate possibilities of discrimination and promote opportunity for those **women** wishing to contribute to the economic prosperity of Australia as members of the work force.

* We are pledged, for example, to give greater equality of opportunity to **women**, who have long been disadvantaged - often in subtle and hidden ways - in a male-oriented society.

* No Government has done more for the welfare of **women** - and I do not mean simply **women** in need or **women** in obvious hardship.

* They include: Legislative Record of the Year; Reports Tabled in Parliament on Inquiries Instituted by the Present Government; Statements Arising from Meetings Between Australian Government and State Government Ministers; Committees; Commissions of Inquiry and Task Forces Reporting to the Government; Reports Tabled by the Present Government on Inquiries Instituted by Previous Governments and the record on Cities, Women, Social Security, Resources, Other Decisions, Migrants, Rural Industries, the Economy, Education, the Environment and a Text of Treaties and so on presented to the Parliament.

* Continuing follow-up surveys conducted by my Department show that about 77 per cent of **women** who complete training under the Scheme go on to employment after training.

* These surveys also show that many **women** who complete training under the Schemedo not choose to go on to immediate employment.

* Applying this percentage of the 2,197 **women** who had completed training at the end of August 1972, it will be seen that the Scheme has been 15 times more successful than he has claimed it to have been when he has reportedly said that only 111 **women** trained under the Scheme have secured employment.

* The purpose of the Schemeis to give **women** who have already decided to return to work an opportunity to make full use of existing or potential capacities.

* The present program is intended to assist the States provide buildings and equipment for the training of young men and **women** undertaking trade and certificate courses in technical colleges and trade schools, and for similar courses at agricultural colleges and rural training schools.

* Is it a fact that the Working Women's Centre in Melbourne may have to close its doors through lack of financial support.

* Is it also a fact that the initial funding, which it received from the International Women's Year Advisory Committee, was insufficient for continued operation.

* Is it considered that the work done by the Centre, for **women** of all occupations in the important areas of child care, equal pay and maternity leave, is of value.

* During the time I knew her she retained her active and effective interest in the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the Women's International.

* As a parliamentarian she was effective; as a leader of **women**'s rights and movements in Australia, she was more than effective.

* Sir Arthur  said: 'Why should ex-servicemen and **women** who had suffered disabilities through war service find the compensation they receive adversely affected by the need for allocation in other areas of Government expenditure?

* The classes of **women** to whom the new benefit will be payable under this Bill are (a) unmarried mothers, including deserted de facto wives and de facto wives of prisoners; and (b) married **women** not living with their husbands (deserting wives) or wives who have been separated for various other reasons, provided that the **women** be living with, and have the custody, care and control of a child (or children) of whom they are the mothers.

* These **women** are those who are not at present eligible for a widow's pension under the Social Services Act and who, with their children, have been subject to discrimination in the level of assistance available to them in the past.

* As with widows pensions, supporting mother's benefit will not be payable if the **women** return to live with their husbands or if they are living with any man on a de facto basis.

* For the moment these **women** will continue to be the responsibility of the States for the first 6 months, and the States will continue to receive assistance from the Commonwealth under the States Grants (Deserted Wives) Act during that period.

* There will, however, be some **women** who will become eligible to the supporting mother's benefit who have not received State assistance because they would have been excluded by the State means tests.

* I am hopeful that when these talks are finalised benefits payable to **women** through these proposed amendments will be paid immediately instead of requiring a 6 months' lapse, as is necessary now.

* I repeat that we aim to end these anomalies, but the important thing about this Bill is that it is a clear demonstration of this Government's determination to bring an end as quickly as it can to the discrimination that existed against **women** and, in this case, certain classes of **women** such as unmarried mothers, deserted wives or wives who have been separated for other reasons.

* Its effect will perhaps be felt mainly by the children of the **women** concerned.

* I think that they are a wonderfully courageous and magnificent group of **women**.

* Article 119 of the Treaty which member countries of the European Economic Community signed in Rome in 1957 provides that each Member State shall ensure and maintain the application of the principle of equal remuneration for equal work as between men and **women** workers.

* These hospitals will lose their identity, the owners will become mere trustees, will lose control and we will have impersonalised medicine completely removing from the scene dedicated people such as nuns, cultured **women** and others who work without reward to express their personality.

* I want to draw the attention of the House to the deaths of two of the most remarkable **women** in the history of the Australian cinema, Paulette and Phyllis McDonagh.

* I invite honourable members to consider the audacity of these young **women** and the enormous odds they overcame.

* In fact at a recent such function I was placed- not that I minded it- with the **women** in the back row.

* I am not in disagreement with Women's Lib, but I sat, as I say, with the **women** in the back row, while everybody from  Sir Eric  Willis down made a speech about how good the State Liberal Government was in spending so much money, and yet the Government which granted this money was not mentioned, and that is the Federal Government.

* One question before honourable members is whether we should discriminate against a large group of **women**; another is whether we should interfere in the confidential consultative process between a medical practitioner and a patient.

* The effect of the motion is to discriminate against **women** who have their pregnancies terminated in accordance with the law of the State unless their lives are in danger.

* Only those **women** would be entitled to Commonwealth benefits.

* Women whose physical or mental health is seriously prejudiced would not be entitled to receive medical benefits.

* Whichever way one looks at this aspect of the motion it clearly is discriminatory against the group of **women** whose pregnancies are terminated on grounds other than 'to protect the life of the mother'.

* A. Johnson while he was Research Director of the Family Planning Centre, St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, and  Mr D.  B. Roberts, which showed that about 25 per cent of the **women** who have abortions in Australia are of the Catholic faith.

* However,  Dr Johnson  emphasised the 'acute moral and ethical dilemma' of those **women** in deciding to terminate their pregnancies.

* Thus every year thousands of **women** who have no intention of seeking to end a pregnancy would be faced with the embarrassment of having to produce a certificate to that effect before being able to obtain benefits.

* Why should we in the Commonwealth Parliament endorse a discriminatory process against any one of the **women** in the cases to which I have referred?

* There are many pregnant **women** who seek support after the decision has been made to terminate a pregnancy.

* There are many in this country who would not agree with sterilisation operations for men or **women**.

* When one talks glibly about bringing programs together under a service head, such as all the programs that are providing shelter, it sounds good; but when we talk about the particular characteristics of the various homeless populations and the conjunction, for example, as was suggested at one stage, of the **women**'s refuge program with the traditional program for social derelicts, we are talking about very different populations.

* Women do not get the same go from the education system as do young men.

* Over the last few years there was a wastage of 81,000 young men and 34,000 young **women** in our universities.

* About 46,000 or 47,000 young **women** who are the equals of their brothers in social background and intellectual attainment are deprived of a university education not because of their intellectual incapacity but because they happen to be **women**.

* With a university education **women** can solve many of the shortages at the intellectual and professional levels.

* That, in accordance with the provisions of the  Public Works Committee Act  1969-1974, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report: Construction of sleeping accommodation for 80 Women's Royal Australian Army Corps personnel atPuckapuny al, Victoria.

* If there were no textile industry in Wangaratta, these **women** would be unemployed because no alternative employment is available.

* Unlike widows, deserted wives or divorced **women** these people receive no help from the Government whatsoever.

* It is a terrible thing for a husband to lose his wife by death, particularly a young wife, because it is only comparatively young **women** who have dependent children.

* Two days later , there were reports that 100,000 people might have to be evacuated, and the State Government had issued a 'voluntary evacuation' of children and pregnant **women**.

* A surgeon has contacted me complaining that some people, usually wealthy **women**, join hospital and medical insurance schemes and, after 2 months - that is, once they have established their eligibility for medical benefits - go into hospital for expensive cosmetic surgery.

* Large numbers of **women** come to the airport from many different places, including other countries, and it is said that those **women** have abortions in that clinic and then leave.

* Women from other parts of New South Wales come to the clinic.

* The Royal Women's Hospital in Victoria was good enough to write to all honourable members.

* The work of Fitzgerald and Crosher entitled Pre-School Education of Australia', published by the Australian Council for Education Research, claims that in a recent survey there were 63,000 **women** not of the work force with one or more children under 6 years of age who stated that they would go into the work force if suitable child care facilities were available.

* He said that in the decade 1960-70 the number of married **women** in the work force almost doubled, increasing from 9.3 per cent to 18.3 per cent.

* He claimed that: 
We wish to ensure that the children of these **women** have every opportunity for the fullest development in both the emotional and physical sense.

* The Government is concerned to see that employment is available to all men and **women** who want it.

* It is a fact that in many country towns, such as Wangaratta and a few other towns in Victoria and also some in the Hunter Valley, the main employment hitherto for **women** has been in the textile industry.

* It is quite erroneous to suggest that employment is not available generally in Australia for men and **women** who lose their jobs in the textile industry.

* My comment about a commuter transport system between Wangaratta and WodongaAlbury stems from the experience that where there is a large growing manufacturing centre such as Newcastle or a large employment centre such as Canberra then all towns within 50 miles or even more from it prosper, but it is necessary to have public transport available for men and **women** to go to the growing, the big employment centre and to get home from it.

* I believe that the men and **women** in Wangaratta would be advantaged by the range of employment available over the next decade in Albury-Wodonga instead of the restricted opportunities for employment which have hitherto obtained in Wangaratta.

* The Government has introduced measures for humanitarian reasons and out of gratitude to all those ex-servicemen and ex-service **women** who have died and left dependants and those who are still with us but who have incurred disabilities.

* Persons who have received pensionswhether they are Australian born or exservicemen and **women** from British Commonwealth countries- like other kinds of pensioners in the community will be able to take thenbenefits with them to some other country and retire there if they wish to do so.

* There will be an extension of benefits to children of ex-servicemen and **women**.

* There have been reports already of the feelings of **women** about the reconstruction and planning of this city.

* The **women** of Darwin say that they want a different Darwin.

* I have no doubt that when the Minister chooses the Citizens 
Council the interests of **women** will be fully represented.

* We had hundreds of thousands of men and **women** in our armed forces.

* It has particular application to **women** employees of the Public Service.

* Again this will be of particular benefit to married **women**, but not only to them.

* We all know that quite apart from reason and consultation, the processes of conciliation have to be backed on occasions by the force of law to protect the rights of individual working men and **women** of Australia and to protect the rights of all citizens in this country against the predatory actions of some union leaders in some circumstances.

* In New South Wales, for instance, the Armidale Women's Rugby League Football Club - purchase of sports equipment, $548.

* Council of Aboriginal Women of South Australia - operating costs, $12,000.

* The establishment of these community centres where people, especially the Aboriginal **women**, could meet regularly would be a tremendous help to them.

* My one regret is that greater assistance was not given to men and **women** in the much lower income brackets.

* I believe that if a **women** only walks past those places she is encouraged to go in and have a termination of pregnancy.

* A radical hysterectomy and dissection of pelvic glands is carried out on **women** with cancer of the uterus or the cervix.

* Is the Right to Life Association arguing that pregnant **women** who have cancer of the cervix or cancer of the uterus should carry on with that particular pregnancy?

* I appreciate also the fact that in Australia **women** are playing a big part in the work force.

* If there is to be any alteration to the wage scale or if a decision has to be made in relation to these matters it is very important, particularly in some of those areas mentioned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that **women** should have the protection of the arbitration system.

* They should have this independent machinery to go to because in many areas in which **women** are being employed their unions do not have the strength of the very large unions.

* I have already said that in my view **women** constitute an important section of the work force.

* I firmly believe that well trained **women** in some professions should be better paid than they are today.

* Millions of **women**, men and children, both born and unborn, can be affected by this Bill which will be introduced by those 2 honourable members.

* There has been no greater social issue since I have been a member of this Parliament- 
How many **women**'s refuges were operating in each State with Australian Government assistance on (a) 30 June 1975, (b) 31 December 1975 and (c) 30 June 1976.

* How much had been spent by the Federal Government on **women** 's refuges at each of those dates.

* How much was allocated for expenditure on  **women**'s  refuges in the 1976-77 Budget.

* How many **women**'s refuges will be operating with Australian Government assistance by 3 1 December 1976.

* Included in the adults are married **women**, many of whom do not go to work because of family circumstances.

* Women said that they were too busy at home or had family responsibility.

* I wonder whether any investigations have been made concerning what percentage of migrants in this category, or men and **women** over school age, really want to learn the language, and what is their intellectual capacity.

* The idea of saying to returned servicemen and **women** 'We will give you a house in  10, 15  or  20  years time' would be quite unthinkable.

* There is another one which I consider to be very important, and that is the problems of groups such as migrants, **women**, apprentices and other such groups in the community.

* A training scheme for married and single **women** who, for domestic reasons have not previously been employed, will be set up.

* A working party was established within the Department in August, 1 976 to study matters of special concern to migrant **women**.

* The working party was given the broad task of reporting on the major problems of migrant **women** from the point of view of social relationships, language difficulties, problems in the workforce, and the need for special facilities and was required to seek effective solutions through the development and improvement of existing services.

* The working party was examining Departmental procedures, migrant selection criteria and community facilities available to migrant **women** when its tasks were subsumed by the establishment of the Ethnic Affairs Branch in early 1977 and the Task Force on Migrant Women as part of the Inter-departmental Working Group on Women's Affairs, in June 1977.

* In the past this has been partly responsible for the long established drift of population from rural districts of Australia to the cities, particularly among young men and **women** who after leaving school cannot find employment in their home districts suitable to their aptitudes.

* This applies particularly to **women**.

* Thirdly, it is important for employment opportunities to be maintained for migrants with language problems, particularly for **women** migrants, in industrial and light industrial work where this is not a handicap.

* Some time ago the Department of Labour and National Service produced a publication dealing with the problems surrounding the employment of **women** in certain provincial centres.

* One would have thought that, the publication having been produced, some action would have been taken to provide the necessary employment for **women** in these centres.

* This is due to the high percentage of married **women** who are employed in this industry.

* Whilst the dropping out of employment of married **women** would not show up in the figures of the recipients of benefits it would very seriously affect the economy of the area and of the families concerned because the income of these **women** has become a part of the normal income of the family and the spending rates and standards of living have been geared accordingly.

* To put it briefly, as one writer did - **women** and children last.

* In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about the increasing number of **women** in the work force.

* Back in 1964 they represented about 65 per cent of the total, and continually over that long term they have represented between 60 per cent and up as high as 80 per cent of the total number of unemployed **women** receiving unemployment benefits for more than 6 months.

* When I look at the unemployment figures of those people on unemployment benefits for more than 6 months who are under 25 years of age and note that the number of **women** are a proportion several times higher than is the case for males, clearly a structural problem exists.

* Within eight or nine weeks of that event whilst the mother is in the post-natal condition, whilst she may even be in the position of having what is termed post-natal madness, the problem that comes on **women** who have had a difficult childbirth, the 12 months is up.

* It is proposed that this is a BUI that has a great deal to do with the equality of **women**.

* I ask honourable members to ponder whether there are sufficient guarantees for **women** or for both partners of a marriage to enter into marriage.

* It certainly is not a Bill which has anything to do with the rights or equality of **women** in that situation.

* Changing the status of domestic work may provide wider real options for many people, mostly **women**, who are forced to seek jobs in manufacturing or service industries but who might prefer to work at home if it were economically possible.

* It is striking that the proportion of **women** in the work force increased from about 3 1.5 per cent in 1971 to 35.8 percent in 1977.

* Many **women** might opt to withdraw from either the manufacturing sector or the sector I describe as general economic services.

* The potential victims of postindustrialism are migrants, **women**, unskilled, and semi-skilled workers and the young.

* In this environment men, **women**, boys and girls can be engaged in worthwhile activities which satisfy their dignity as human beings by providing the opportunity to engage actively in manufacturing or processing and thus making a contribution to society.

* It seemed to the mothers of these children, and I think our society generally would agree, that it is a great waste for these young men and young **women** who have a handicap, whether physical or intellectual, at the age of 16 to have to leave the school which they have been attending in familiar surroundings and under the care and the guidance of the teachers of that school.

* Yet these **women** are so concerned about the future of their children that they did try.

* If young men and **women** in Australia leave school with that sense of frustration and because the nature of training at school is one of the causes of unemployment- I emphasise that it is only one- they have difficulty in getting work, the sense of frustration and lack of achievement can only be compounded.

* Project 1- (a) Women's Research Group, Knox Community Relations Centre, Melbourne.

* Examination of the economic, social and physical situation of **women** in the home and their perception of their role.

* But we are desirous, and indeed this is in the legislation, that each State will be represented by at least one Commissioner and that there will be 2 **women** on the Commission.

* In 1975 there were 6,500 unemployed migrant **women** between the ages of 1 5 and 1 9 years.

* There were 4,700 unemployed migrant **women** between the ages of 20 and 24 years in 1975.

* In 1975 there were 9,600 unemployed migrant **women** between the ages of 25 and 34.

* I suppose that one could say that the principal purpose of the Bill is to omit from the principal Act in the definition of an eligible person the word 'male ' and to add the following paragraph: a former member of the Royal Australian Air Force Nursing Service or of the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force - and leave the matter at that.

* This Bill is probably one of the most unique that the Parliament has considered, not that it is unique in the sense that at long last we recognise the fact that the **women** who served in the armed Services now have access to the advantages offered by a trust fund, although it has taken a long time for us mere males to emancipate ourselves in that sense.

* This Bill will enable former members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and former members of the Royal Australian Nursing Service who are in necessitous circumstances to receive assistance pursuant to the provisions of the Act.

* Unfortunately, the actions of the Government give the lie to any suggestion that it is trying to create employment for Australian men and **women**.

* Certainly it was a good manoeuvre for the men and **women** concerned.

* Yet it does this sort of thing to the men and **women** who are employed in our various industries.

* There was a huge increase in the number of **women** who entered the work force during that period.

* According to this Press Statement, which was duly reported in the Australian Press, the data, while not necessarily comparable from one country to another, showed that in the countries covered, unemployed **women** workers represented more than 40 per cent of total unemployment, while **women** made up only 35 per cent of their labour force.

* The program is administered within the overall NEAT context which itself is already assisting many **women** with training.

* At the end of October 1976 in the order of 5000 **women**, including those placed under the Special Youth Employment Training Program, were receiving assistance under NEAT.

* A growing proportion of married **women** almost certainly will be employed outside their homes during their working lives.

* There is an increasing tendency for married **women** to return to work when their domestic responsibilities permit.

* It is suggested that **women** work from the time they complete their formal education until the commencement of the family formation period.

* For a time the wage differential between rates of pay for men and **women** doing the same job was justified on the ground that the wage system was thus made sensitive to family size.

* The task is to resolve how best to enable men and **women** to spread their income over their lives so as to give them the means of keeping the family when they need it.

* As more and more **women** work and have higher and better standards of education they wish in many instances to continue te be involved in the community outside the home.

* Many young **women** want to continue such involvement within the community, working and using the skills for which they have been trained.

* The classes of contributors are pregnant **women** and uninsured people who become recipients of social security unemployment, sickness or special benefits.

* It is now an accepted fact that the majority of the nations of the world consider that men and **women** at 18 years of age are more mature, better educated and articulate than those of a generation ago at 21 years of age.

* Let me now present the case in support of a vote at 18 years of age for men and **women**.

* Young men and **women** are more mature and better educated in most cases and because of the times in which they live, more advanced mentally than those of a few generations ago.

* Whether or not men and **women** are mature enough to vote at 18, the test to be applied is that they are increasingly involved in social, financial, industrial and political affairs and to take a responsible role in society they must have the right to vote.

* The Commonwealth Statistician indicates that 700,000 men and **women** will be eligible to vote if the age is lowered to 18 years for the next Federal elections.

* He promised about 1 million exservicemen and **women** that a Labor government would take certain action in regard to repatriation pensions, including the general rate pension and the pension for totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen.

* The test that must be applied is whether the Prime Minis ter has done , for ex-servicemen and **women** and the organisations representing them - the Returned Services League and others - what he promised he would do.

* The answer is no, he has not carried out his promise and I hope the ex-servicemen and **women** of this country will register their disapproval at the appropriate time.

* Married Women in Workforce  (Question No.

* It is all right for honourable members to laugh but a few weeks prior to his sentence two aged **women** from the United States of America were sentenced to 14 years penal servitude.

* It may be said that the two aged **women** from America had 1.5 tonnes of dangerous drugs in their vehicle when arrested at Gosford, fortunately outside the electorate of Hunter, but near enough, and that Tait had only about one hundredweight of drugs in his plane but there is a limit to what a plane can carry compared with a Volkswagen.

* American **women** and a sentence on Tait of seven years with a non-parole period of three years, or there is something wrong with the Commonwealth 's administration of the criminal law.

* The second factor that makes pre-school education so important, of course, is the greater tendency on the part of **women** to go into the work force.

* Our own surveys revealed that 67 per cent of professional **women** would prefer part time work.

* So, 67 per cent of professional **women** would have preferred part time work, 10 per cent would have preferred full time work and 23 per cent would have preferred not to have to work at all.

* The corresponding figures for nonprofessional **women** were as follows: 54 per cent preferred part time work, only 5 per cent desired full time work and 41 per cent preferred not to have to work at all.

* While we acknowledge that there is a number of **women** who would like to go to work and while there are many others who perforce have to go to work for economic reasons, there is a very strong demand for part time work opportunities.

* Hostels provided by organisations such as church bodies, the Country Women's Association and local authorities also have played a very commendable part in this area but costs are of great concern and many boarding schools have closed the boarding section of their schools.

* There is something ludicrous in seeing second-hand car dealers sacking **women** workers, waiting several months, employing replacements to wash cars and then receiving $45 a week on behalf of each of them under the Government's manpower scheme.

* I conclude by saying that I want all ex-servicemen and **women** to see the type of person that is demonstrating- 
My question is directed to the Prime Minister.

* What has the Government done since coming to office to improve equality of opportunity and quality of life for **women**.

* 1 ) The response from **women** to act as voluntary tutors in the home tutor scheme has been most encouraging.

* To date 962 **women** have volunteered.

* As at 1 August 1974 472 migrant **women** were receiving assistance in their homes under the scheme- 
I now wish to turn to some of the social service aspects of this Budget.

* Also, one should keep in mind that nearly half the **women** on the A class widow's pensions - that is, civilian widows with children - are deserted wives.

* In other words, by its parsimonious attitude the Government is forcing **women** to go out to work, irrespective of the interests of the children.

* I know that some **women** wish to work, but other **women** do not; they wish to look after their families and I do not think that it is right or just that a woman should be forced into this situation, particularly when she does not have a partner to share the responsibilities of parenthood.

* Estimates of the average number of married **women** and other females in the civilian labour force in each year from 1964 to 1972, derived from the quarterly population survey, are as follows: 
If we had won a majority of the seats in this House last October - under any other electoral system in the world we would have done so - this law would have been amended to provide in those cases where there was a need for conscription that at least there would be, as every church in this country has advised, exemption for those with a conscientious objection to a particular war.

* Even under this electoral system we would have had a majority of seats in this House if votes had been available to men and **women** of  18, 19  and  20  years of age - a reform in relation to the introduction of which members on the other side have so long stalled.

* Of abortions performed in South Australia, 27 per cent are procured by **women** under the age of 19 years- some of these **women** are under the age of 16 years- and 49 per cent are single.

* It is one of the misfortunes of human affairs that the people who are likely to be the most seriously victimised in these matters are the **women** in the first instance and the poor in the second.

* Following a working party on homeless men and **women** set up by Bill Hayden in February 1973, which reported later in the year on the feasibility of a program to assist them, legislation was foreshadowed by the then Prime Minister in the 1974 election campaign and introduced by  Mr Hayden  in November 1974.

* The then Minister for Social Security, the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden),  in his second reading speech said: 
The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems of homeless men and **women** and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair .

* The main provisions of the principal Act which the Labor Government initiated were to support organisations and agencies catering for homeless men and **women**.

* I refer to the argument put by the Minister for Productivity  (Mr Macphee)  that this is an all male House and that we are purporting to make a decision on a **women**'s issue.

* We are elected by both men and **women**.

* Far from it being improper for me to express a view in this Parliament on this matter, I believe I would be failing in my duty if I did not maintain the view I expressed on both those occasions, and chose instead to ignore the views of many men and **women** who supported me on the basis of my expressed views.

* -For some time there have been United Nations conventions dealing with discrimination against **women**.

* It was left to my Government to ratify the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women, the 1951 International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention and the 1958 Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention.

* Unfortunately, the honourable member for Hotham did not realise that there are now **women** in the Senate.

* It can be applied to men or **women**.

* I am pleased to see that the Government has widened the eligibility for this benefit to include not just ex-servicemen and **women** who had served in a theatre of war but all ex-service men and **women** who qualify for repatriation benefits.

* But I have said that the provision of free medical and hospital treatment just to cancer sufferers who served in a theatre of war was a grossly unjust decision as it excluded from the benefit many hundreds of thousands of exservice men and **women** who volunteered for service overseas but who through no fault of their own did not serve in a theatre of war.

* I do not disagree with the provision of medical and hospital treatment for all ex-service men and **women** who are suffering from cancer although it does depart from the true blue principles of the repatriation system.

* But as I have said, I am glad to see that the Government having first provided this benefit for people who served in a theatre of war has now made the benefit available to all exservice men and **women** who broadly speaking enlisted for service anywhere at any time.

* I understand that the reasons for decisions have been sent by the tribunals to the ex-service men and **women** since 1 July 1974 and that the boards- that is the first determining authority that hears a claim from a veteran- will start giving reasons for their decisions on 1 January 1975.

* Of course one of the disadvantages of this practice will be to slow down the hearing of the claims of ex-service men and **women**.

* These people will receive the same benefits as are available to ex-service men and **women** who have served in the Australian forces.

* I repeat my warning to those who are interested in maintaining the repatriation section of the Department as a specialist organisation, representative of the 800,000 veterans, ex-servicemen and **women** still surviving in Australia, that they are in danger of losing this specialist organisation.

* This Bill will of course have beneficial results for the ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia.

* I hope the ex-servicemen and **women** and exservice organisations do not regret this changing situation in the future.

* If the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs were concerned about these matters he would be concerned about migrants- particularly **women** migrants- who go to hospitals, who speak no English and who find no translators to translate their requirements to the staff.

* 1 ) In principle it is possible for **women** to join Australian expeditions to the Antarctic Continent.

* Firstly, conditions and facilities at our stations are not suitable at the present time for **women** to spend the winter in the Antarctic.

* Secondly, for summer visits, whilst it would be possible for **women** to sleep on board and make brief visits in the vicinity of the stations during the annual relief voyages, the obstacle to this course is the shortage of ship berths and their arrangement in 4-berth cabins.

* Similar difficulties as at stations on the Antarctic continent confront **women** who wish to winter at Macquarie Island.

* Berths, however, are sometimes more readily available on the Macquarie Island voyages and **women** have visited the island for a few days in summer to undertake short-term projects.

* It is unlikely that the situation regarding wintering with Australian expeditions can be altered in the next few years but this will not preclude consideration being given to **women** making brief visits during the annual summer relief operations if their proposals have sufficient merit on the basis of scientific or other considerations.

* One would have thought, after watching the advertising campaigns which took place a little earlier this year, that a serious effort would have been made to ensure that the co-operation with the reserve force that was sought from civilian industry, the input that was asked of officers who give a considerable amount of their time to the reserve force and the participation in that force that was sought from young men and **women** would have been accompanied by a serious effort by the Government to make that force not only attractive but also a functional and effective means of providing additional Defence Force personnel in times of any need.

* These **women** and girls should not be called upon to make great personal sacrifices to help keep our under-financed, overstrained public hospital services in operation.

* On this basis alone one finds dramatic cause for the current grave failure of the nursing profession to attract and hold adequate numbers of young **women**.

* In short, it is a cynical cruelty and a dishonourable deception for public authorities charged with conducting the nation's public hospitals to foster the fond belief in young **women** that nursing is an exalted position and then, once they are in the profession, to underpay, overwork and inadequately train them.

* Of all the A class widows to which 1 have referred 41.5 per cent are **women** with one child, 29.7 per cent of them have 2 children, 16 per cent have 3 children, 4 per cent have 4 children, and 5.1 per cent of widows have 5 or more children.

* Many **women** can be widowed at the early age of 20, 30 or maybe 40 and left with children, but because they are not paying rent they do not qualify for the supplementary assistance.

* For years I've worked closely with Madame Vera Fels, the governing director of Germaine Rocher (French house of haute couture in Australia) and being an Australian myself was amazed to find that only imported woollen piecegoods from France, England and Italy were used in the making up of our exclusive **women**'s wear.

* Being 'all for Australia' I called in a representative of one of our largest manufacturers of textiles and an offshoot of an overseas textile company and asked him to bring us the full range of woolen fabrics suitable for exclusive **women**'s wear.

* This awful apathy still appears to prevail - if the woollen materials displayed for the making of **women**'s wear are any guide.

* Urge intervention to end victimisation of 40 Griffith **women** thrown out of work as a result of black ban by Food Preservers Union of Victoria on onions peeled by Nugan staff members for delivery to frozen foods and other preservers stop this ban is in defiance of court ruling and victimised **women** who are trade unionists covered according to the law by the union recognised by the law stop Griffith unemployment has long been matter of concern particularly for **women** and this is an irresponsible and harmful ban for purely administrative reasons and would urge strongest possible action in defence of **women** who are my constituents and full trade unionists stop would appreciate your advice on possible action regards.'

* It has been left to the wife of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  to draw attention to those programs which perhaps have so much impact upon the thinking of **women** in Australia, that is, talk-back programs.

* While I am speaking of the forming of opinions among **women** let me say that I did not rise to speak tonight to be drawn into a debate about the media.

* The majority of those who gave that opinion were **women**; **women** more than men said that the shipbuilding industry ought to be retained in Australia.

* Where do **women** fit into the list of priorities of the National Employment and Training Scheme.

* What specific schemes have been formulated to provide assistance to **women**.

* How many **women** have applied for assistance under the Scheme.

* The Leader of the Opposition will recall the recent case of 2 young Indo-Chinese **women** in Victoria whose mother and 2 brothers managed to get to the United States.

* Did the tactics of the Vietcong include the destruction of an orphanage and the deliberate murder of **women** and children?

* All this legislation does is to seek the approval of the Parliament to give the Australian people the right to say whether their fellow men and **women** in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, including Jervis Bay, shall have the right to exercise their vote in referendums.

* 1) and (2) A capital grant of $21,645 under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act has been approved for the Country Women's Association (Yea Branch) towards the cost of constructing two self-contained units for aged persons' accommodation at Railway Place, Yea, which is adjacent to Francis Street, Yea.

* That is one of the most important rights which should be guarded by all men and **women**.

* The honourable member for Hunter mentions the point I was about to make, the right of **women** to vote.

* I ask the **women** in the Riverina electorate never to forget that statement- the quote of the week.

* Then there was the suffragette movement, the movement for **women**'s rights.

* The **women** of Ireland today are working for peace in Ireland.

* Few children survived and pregnant **women** gave birth along the roadside.

* He has served, for a small fee, as an instructor in a course for **women** designed to develop handyman skills for **women** in the home.

* Without such provisions, a number of **women** with needed skills and experiences would be lost to the public sector.

* Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that **women**, in whom the Government has made a considerable investment in terms of training and development of expertise, are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment while also raising a family.

* For **women** who do not resume duty following maternity leave, the sick leave entitlement under the existing provisions becomes a 'retirement benefit' not available to other employees on resignation or retirement.

* Although access to sick leave will become dependent on the production of a medical certificate, **women** on maternity leave will still be able to draw on their accrued recreation and long service leave credits during the unpaid period of their maternity leave.

* He and other 'campaigners' from his group had been told that their organisation called 'the group to assist the observance of Helsinki agreements' could not be regarded as a mass organisation because it did not reflect the interests of any broad section of society and had only twelve 'angry' men and **women** as its members.

* He and other 'campaigners' from his group had been told that their organisation called 'the group to assist the observance of Helsinki agreements' could not be regarded as a mass organisation because it did not reflect the interests of any broad section of society and had only twelve 'angry' men and **women** as its members.

* They see a sign but do not know whether it is a street sign, a shop direction or a sign on a **women**'s lavatory.

* Department of the Northern Territory: Appointment of Women  (Question No.

* 109) 
Women's Electoral Lobby 
National Council of Women 
No.

* 33 Employment training scheme to assist married and single **women** - Ministerial statement - Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate on  the motion, That the House take note of the paper.

* True most of those retrenched are the second wage earners in the family and even then their wages are being continued for 6 months by the Government but how few families can afford a sudden cut in income now or in 6 months and how many of the **women** retrenched are, in fact, supporting their families?

* But obviously the question which was troubling all the men and **women**, who were experts in their own fields, was: Were they wasting their time in attending that 3-day symposium?

* There is no doubt that road accidents in Australia are costing the lives of about 4,000 men, **women** and children and are maiming and injuring up to 80,000 people each year.

* He would like to return to the days when men and **women** were gaoled if they dared to organise against the employers.

* Here was a body of men and **women** who were prepared to stand on their own feet, while others sought protection and handouts from the governments of the day.

* Major criticisms  of the Bill have been: Firstly, that it abandons fault as a ground for divorce; secondly, that it encourages quick divorce; thirdly, that 12 months is too short a period as a criterion for breakdown of marriage; fourthly, that no immediate ground for divorce is provided; and, fifthly, that the maintenance provisions of the Bill are unfair to **women**.

* A criticism that has been made of this BUI is that the maintenance provisions are unfair to **women**.

* This may well be so because aU laws are unfair to **women**.

* Women are part of the property system and their status reflects its requirements.

* It is not as though **women** are protected by the existing law concerning family relations.

* Women occupy an inferior social status in Australia and society still wants to keep them in that position.

* The existing marriage and divorce law provides no haven for **women**.

* The changes recommended in this legislation offer significant advances for **women**.

* In Ballarat one in every 40 of the unemployed men and **women** attempted suicide during each of the two years of the survey, whilst in Dandenong the proportion was one in 80.

* Dr Abie  Kessel, the then acting  deputy  chief medical officer of the Victorian Health Authority, who worked on the survey, said: 
In regard to domestic violence, a survey conducted last year by the Royal Commission into Human Relationships of 1 1 1 **women** who went to the Elsie Women's Refuge in Sydney showed a definite link between unemployment and wife bashing.

* Last year we amended the Act to provide for single **women** with qualifying service.

* The Government has decided to assist the celebration of International Women's Year by making a grant of $2m to help co-ordinate the activities and celebrations in Australia.

* While welcoming International Women's Year, it is worth noting that it had to be thought necessary by the United Nations that all nations should make an effort to ensure that **women** enjoy the dignity of basic human rights.

* It is a sobering thought that **women** throughout the world have to be granted an opportunity to be heard.

* It is my earnest hope that 1975 will make a lasting international impact on reducing the prejudices and lack of opportunity from which **women** suffer.

* I hope it will be a year in which the lasting contribution **women** have made in the Australian society will be recognised and I hope that it does not finish with December 1975 but that the changes carry through and are permanent.

* The Public Service Board has advised me that information on the number of **women** and men who have sat on selection panels, tribunals and other appeal boards established under the Public Service Act in the last 1 2 months is not available.

* As outlined in my previous answer (Hansard, 17 October 1 974, p.2582), surveys are being conducted on the representation of men and **women** on Promotions Appeal Committees in New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

* Promotions Appeal Committees covering the eight-week period 1 March 1974 to 30 April 1974, reveal that, apart from the  Chairman,  the total membership consisted of (a) 1 1 **women** and (b) 208 men.

* 1 ) and (2) No.- Following the introduction of maternity leave in the Australian Public Service my Department estimated that, as at December 1973, the full year cost of a scheme under which all pregnant **women** (working and nonworking) would qualify for a payment equivalent to the minimum weekly wage rate for adult females (then estimated to be $64.08 by the Commonwealth Statistician) for 1 2 weeks would be about $ 1 95 million.

* The Public Service Board has advised that it does not have any information on costs of maternity leave or the number of Women employed in universities or colleges of advanced education.

* At June 1 976, 49 995 **women** were employed full-time in the Australian Public Service.

* The latest estimates of **women** aborted in Australia each year range from 70,000 to 120,000.

* The amendment to clause (d) says: 
The commission is to inquire into - the social, economic, psychological and medical pressures on **women** in determining whether to proceed with the pregnancy or to have an abortion.

* There is no scope of power in this amendment for the commission to inquire into the effect of an abortion on **women**.

* In their search they found 24 editions of the  Australian Women's Weekly,  15 editions of  Woman's Day  and 10 editions of  House and Garden.

* As employment prospects improve, however, more people- especially married **women**- will register for employment, and to some extent this will distort the unemployment figures.

* Do they want a demonstration on a Friday afternoon in the middle of Bourke Street, outside Myers as the honourable member for Lalor says, when it is full of **women** and children who are doing their shopping and who may well in this way help to create the impression that the crowd is swelled by supporters?

* This desire is shared by all, but the people must ask themselves whether this is a genuine protest and whether it is intended to be violent or non-violent, bearing in mind that it will be held in Melbourne on a Friday afternoon, the most busy shopping afternoon, in the busiest block, when school children, young children and **women** will be present.

* One of the basic questions will be whether abortion should be made easier or whether active steps should be taken to remove those factors which drive some **women** into what they see as economic and social compulsion to have an abortion.

* Many young **women** have been driven to abortion because of the narrow, selfish and petty attitudes of others in our society.

* It should also be concerned to ensure that there is appropriate economic protection for pregnant **women**.

* Women, single or married, should be in receipt of maternity leave - an issue on which this Parliament was slow in acting in past years.

* Money can be used to extend one's personality: for instance, men pour money into such virility symbols as costly and powerful cars, and **women** buy such symbols of sexuality as lavish clothes.'

* An article in the 'Financial Review' of 29th December pointed out that according to SO per cent or more employers, the following occupations are in a glut: Administrative work (**women**); agricultural economics; agricultural science; articled  clerks  (law); biometry, data processing (without computer training in course); economic research; editorial work: geography; journalism; market research; marketing (general); psychology; stockbroking and security analyses.

* We ought to have a high level of benefits to discourage the using of humans - men, **women** and youngsters - as sacrificial offerings to mollify the economic gods of the Government when they express their wrath.

* I think all honourable members know that at least 240,000 **women** are in the work force.

* While all this goes on, **women** with their small babies are left to starve.

* The Minister and all of us in this Parliament are culpable in relation to this type of case because while we spend hundred of millions of dollars to bring migrants here we refuse to look after the babies born of our own **women**.

* When will the ordinary men and **women** in this country receive their just rewards?

* Migrant **women** especially work in many instances in appalling conditions in a work force  in  which they make up  a  full third of working  -..... -..... -j-------  -r - :~.....--- -*--------- o  **women**.

* A total of 45 per cent of Italian **women** and 56 per cent of Greek **women** in employment work as labourers, production or process workers.

* This compares with only 9.2 per cent of native-born Australian working **women**.

* In most cases, however, these **women** are locked into this situation by economic necessity which in turn imposes enormous stress on the life style of thousands of migrant families.

* In the work force as a whole statistics show that migrants, both men and **women**, are the first to be sacked in times of recession and suffer a higher rate of industrial accidents, mostly because of language difficulties.

* 1 ) The 10 nations that have the largest life expectancy for men and **women** and the respective life expectancies are shown in Table 1.

* It is related to the employment of **women** in part.

* We have seen a remarkable increase in the number of unemployed **women** in the electorate of Parramatta and the surrounding areas, but for school leavers the problem is even more immense.

* A factory located in Rydalmere at which I inquired had this sort of record: In July 1974 it employed 100 **women** and in July 1975 it employed 88 **women**.

* Another factory at Ermington - 
I did not quite hear the first part of the honourable gentleman's question but I gather in broad terms that he was referring to the fact that in his own view **women** were treated as second class citizens in the industrial scene of this country.

* He referred to the fact that he regarded **women** as having been treated as second class citizens.

* He may well be surprised to learn that I agree with him that in many areas of this country, particularly in industry, **women** have been treated as second class citizens in the sense that they have not been accorded those opportunities which, certainly, they ought to have been accorded having regard to the talents they have and the contributions that they can make to industry at present.

* Women, frankly, have not had the opportunities which many large companies ought to have provided to them.

* I refer, of course, in the first place to the programme which seeks to provide **women** with opportunities to return to the work force.

* I think secondly - if the honourable gentleman will listen to the point which is being explained to him - of the many areas of activity of the Women's Bureau.

* I also join the Opposition with the remarks of the Minister in his thanks and praise for the men and **women** of the voluntary organisations.

* He said: 
Lecturer in P.E.. Adelaide College of Advanced Education: President S.A. Women's Amateur Athletic Association: research on '**women** and sport': involved with coaching: silver medal 1958 Commonwealth Games: accomplished sportswoman in a variety of fields.

* President Australian Women's Hockey Association, member of the Queensland Olympic Council, Queensland National Fitness Council, manager **women**'s team at Mexico Olympics, former President Brisbane Softball Association, lite member Queensland Swimming Association.

* In speaking to this resolution, with which I believe every member of this House would wish to be associated, can I say that the men and **women** of our 3 Services carried out their assignment in Vietnam in the best tradition of the Australian Armed Forces.

* They are among the finest young men and **women** that Australia has ever sent overseas to an operational area.

* This is what was said by the Phuoc 
At every point in the implementation program the special needs of migrant **women** are being taken into account, although it is not always easy to determine the extent to which migrant **women** are disadvantaged as migrants or disadvantaged as **women**.

* The Office of Women's Affairs is overseeing the implementation of recommendation 43 which requires that **women**'s interests be met in all aspects of the program.

* We are taking into account the National Women's Advisory Council report entitled 'Migrant Women Speak' which my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr Ellicott),  tabled on 6 June.

* We are taking account of the recommendations of the National Conference on the English Language Needs of Migrant Women held in Melbourne during May this year.

* Women are involved in every aspect of the implementation program as professional planners, as advisers, as service deliverers and, significantly, as community volunteers.

* At least one woman has been appointed to each settlement council and we are urging that **women** to be included on the committees of management that run the migrant resource centres.

* Material prepared for on-arrival orientation courses is emphasising **women**'s needs.

* The survey of migrants' information needs will reflect the views of **women**.

* More than half the people consulted in the qualitative phase were **women** and, as far as possible, men and **women** were interviewed in equal numbers during the quantitative phase.

* Other examples of the emphasis on **women**'s needs can be found within the document I have tabled tonight.

* All these centres are being run by community groups in which migrants, including migrant **women**, are represented.

* The formerly accepted standard that **women** work because they have to has gone.

* It is obvious, after these many years with chambers of commerce attracting **women** to the work force, that industry generally has failed to initiate these provisions.

* How many of the available beds at each institution are available for (a) patients from Vietnam, (b) the Regular Army, (c)ex-service men and **women** and (d) war widows.

* How many abortions are performed each year in Australia and what are the characteristics of the **women** who are aborted and the circumstances in which abortions occur.

* What are the consequences of abortion for **women** who are aborted, practitioners performing abortion procedures, police enforcing the laws on abortion and the community as a whole.

* What are the courses open to **women** who carry through unwanted pregnancies and what are the consequences of each course for the mother and for the child.

* In a nutshell, the Government recognises that three-quarters of the men and **women** in Australia are employed by private enterprise.

* Contrary to the view of my Leader, I believe that perhaps there should be a little bit of politics in this debate, because in my view the Australian Labor Party in the election campaign promised to remove the sales tax on contraceptives to appeal for the vote of **women** in the electorate.

* It surrendered to pressure groups such as the Women's Electoral Lobby and Zero Population Growth and sought by doing that to obtain support from **women** voters who thought that that was all that was involved.

* In my view the Labor Party has no real interest in **women**'s causes.

* It has real interest only in **women**'s votes.

* Other recommendations in the paper were that the national attitude must be changed so that **women** are encouraged to educate and retrain themselves for occupations outside the home and that it is important to stress the selfishness of having another baby.

* Those **women** who aresuited on medical grounds to the use of the pill, and companies which pay tax, and other taxpayers, are all required under Commonwealth law to pay a portion of their taxes for this purpose.

* A survey conducted by a Brisbane medical group and reported in the 'Australian' last October shows that, of the 60 per cent of married **women** who have unplanned babies and who approve the pill, only 6 per cent found it too costly.

* I also ask the Government to look at the other anomalies which exist in the treatment of **women**, which I have also mentioned.

* If the Government is sincere in its expressed intention to improve the lot of **women**, it should ensure that it helps all and not just some.

* It should begin by considering the ways in which **women** are disadvantaged when competing with men.

* In my view it should subsidise, for example, essential pharmaceutical items which all **women** are obliged to use rather than just subsidise the contraceptive pill.

* Did the National Advisory Committee for International Women's Year hand its report to him on or about 31 March 1976.

* 1 ) How many delegates from Western Australia is the Australian Government assisting financially to attend the conference at Queensland University between 25 and 29 August 1975 with the theme- Women's Health in a changing Society.

* What organisations do these **women** represent.

* Secondly, the decline in fertility may be just a consequence of **women** delaying child bearing perhaps because of temporary economic circumstances, such as the difficulties that young couples have now in buying houses, particularly in the major metropolitan areas.

* If **women** could be assured of keeping their jobs and of not being relegated, by being married, to staying within the house and if they could be assured of re-entering the workforce once the children were of manageable age, this might affect dramatically attitudes towards procreation.

* The figures for married migrant **women** are particularly striking: 56 per cent of **women** born in Greece, 54 per cent born in Yugoslavia, and 45 per cent of those born in Italy who are in the workforce work as production or process workers.

* That compares with only 9 per cent of Australian born workers, 14 per cent of **women** born in the United Kingdom and Eire and 20 per cent of **women** born in the Netherlands or Germany.

* I can assure honourable members that the **women** of those areas have great difficulty in doing their washing with this filthy water.

* I give the honourable member an assurance that the Government is maintaining very substantial funding for **women**'s refuges throughout Australia, and particularly in New South Wales.

* Under the funding arrangements that we have specially established for **women**'s refuges, they are favoured to this extent: Community health programs, other than those for ethnic health workers, and interpreters and translators in the ethnic communities, are receiving 50 per cent of the capital requirements.

* But for **women**'s refuges we are meeting 75 per cent of all the capital costs and 50 per cent of the operating costs.

* I will give an undertaking, as I have already done to the **women**'s refuges in New South Wales, that we will investigate the problem to see what is going on.

* It is just my hope that the New South Wales Government is not in some way diverting funds that we are making available to the States to other than **women**'s refuges.

* We will make sure that those funds go to **women**'s refuges.

* I am concerned, however, by what this Bill does to **women** in our society.

* The Bill will make the lot of **women** much harder and much more insecure.

* The maintenance clauses of this legislation which call for **women** to be equally responsible for the support of the children surprisingly have been supported by the Women's Electoral Lobby.

* They claim in a newssheet put out about the Bill: 
This clause will help change **women**'s attitudes and encourage **women** to look to their jobs as more than a fill-in occupation and marriage as a meal ticket.

* What a superficial and denigrating attitude to marriage by an organisation which claims to represent **women**'s interests.

* The newssheet went on in support of this legislation to say: 
Older **women** unable to adapt to changing attitudes will be protected by the fact that many judges are older too, and have protective attitudes towards **women**.

* What sort of logic is this to claim that judges, just because they may be older, will be protective to **women**?

* In view of the fact that this year is International Women's Year, it is sad to see a Bill before this Parliament which not only takes away rights to which every Australian woman has always been entitled but which also imposes upon them new obligations.

* It is an imposition on **women** of a legal and social duty to which they have never before been subjected in this country.

* The general majority of **women** cannot command an income capable of supporting a family, give them adequate housing and security, and then in addition face long hours of domestic work and supporting activities with their children out of school hours.

* Men and **women** in marriage perform different functions.

* Women play a special role in marriage and special provision must be made by legislators to assist them to perform that function, not only for their own fulfilment but also for the good of their family and society.

* Since I became the member for Werriwa all sorts of accusations have been hurled at the Liverpool Women's Health Centre in my electorate.

* Accordingly, I arranged for a professional welfare person from an outside organisation to approach this centre to request a breakdown of the reasons why **women** visit the centre.

* Of these 1,000 visits, 47 per cent of the **women** were aged between 20 and 40 years; some 45 per cent were below 20 years of age; and 8 per cent were over 40 years of age.

* Of the 1,000 visits, migrant **women** comprised about a quarter of the sample.

* So it cannot really be maintained that the Liverpool Women's Health Centre is an abortion clinic.

* I am sure that honourable members would wish to pay a similar tribute to the memory of 3 great North Americans who have served the men and **women** of the world in our generation - President Harry S. Truman who died on 26th December 1972; Prime Minister Lester Bowles Pearson who died on 27th December 1972 and President Lyndon Baines Johnson who died on 22nd January 1973.

* I do not speak in the House very often on this subject simply because it does not happen to be my ministerial responsibility, but I assure honourable members and others in the chamber that I, like many of my colleagues - indeed, all my colleagues on this side - believe that it is tragic that an insidious propaganda campaign is undermining the minds of men and **women** in the Australian community against what we see as the absolutely essential necessity for a defence effort which is capable of preserving this country for the future.

* I am pleased to note that the Minister has seen the need to give special attention to married **women** wishing to re-enter the work force after having passed their most fertile child bearing period so that they can come back into a work force which has changed very much from what it was 10 years earlier when they left to commence their child bearing activities.

* Others who are very hard hit are the handicapped people and married **women**, who the Minister recognises have a special problem when they want to re-enter the work force.

* The proportion of married **women** in the work force is lowest in the lowest age group for the simple reason that when married **women** are young they are having their children and they have to look after their babies.

* The greatest number of married **women** in the work force are between 35 and 44 years of age.

* Having reared their children to the point where they can be cared for by friends, neighbours or in-laws after they finish school and until the mother returns home, these **women** are in a position to go back into the work force.

* Some of the **women** are not terribly well educated.

* For instance, chronic bronchitis and emphysema are twice as common in men smokers and 3 times as common in **women** smokers than in non-smokers of the same sex.

* In 1968 the National Health and Medical Research Council warned in its report of the increased risk of perinatal mortality among pregnant **women** who smoked.

* Second was the influx of married **women** seeking employment which, in itself, was to some extent linked with the high level of migrant intake.

* Over the same period, the married **women** component rose from 7 per cent to 1 8 per cent.

* In the early years of the 1 970s the labour force continued to grow strongly, with migrants and married **women** still contributing to the increase at rates which maintained the trend towards the changed labour force structure developed in the two previous decades.

* Quite recently some of the **women** of Whyalla got together and went along to the local newspaper editor and had a talk to him.

* Two of the **women** were  Mrs Jean  Whiteman and  Mrs Pat  McGuinness.

* The report states: 
The **women** say there is widespread feeling among shipyard-department families that their interests are being too readily written off under the blanketing assurance that everything will be done to try to give the men jobs at the steelworks.

* Are Australian **women** who have entered into a bigamous association with a migrant who was married in another country entitled to a widow's pension, provided they meet other requirements.

* We are seeing moves to bring about greater equality in Australia for men, **women** and children and the various other matters which have been the main planks of our platform.

* In particular, the **women** who are unemployed are no longer registering.

* In one block of flats in Collingwood, 80 per cent of the inhabitants are either unmarried or single mothers or deserted wives- **women** who are on their own trying to bring up their children.

* The word 'repatriation' might not have been the best description of what it was about but it was enshrined and embedded in the Australian language as meaning something to do with the ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia.

* It meant what we meant it to mean; in other words, it meant things to do with ex-servicemen and **women**.

* The Bil] is intended to give the right to vote to men and **women** citizens of 18, 19 and 20 years of age.

* Before the last elections for the House of Representatives and during the election the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  promised that at the next election for the House of Representatives men and **women** citizens of 18, 19 and 20 years of age would have the vote.

* 19 and 20 year old men and **women** at this year's elections for the House  of  Representatives.

* At the last elections in the United Kingdom men and **women** of 18 years of age had votes.

* 1 do not have to go again through the arguments why votes should be given for men and **women** at 18 years.

* 19 and 20-year-old men and **women** felt more intensely than any other people in the community at that time are still matters upon which they feel intensely.

* In 19S4 only 6.2 per cent of men and **women** who were 18 years of age were in full-time education; in the 1961 census there were 13.2 per cent; in the 1966 census there were 27.2 per cent; and in a statistician's survey of a one per cent sample of households throughout Australia in 1968 there were 35.7 per cent.

* Is it to be wondered at then that men and **women** of 18, 19 and 20 years are becoming increasingly alienated and frustrated by the Liberals refusal to carry out an election understanding?

* If 18, 19 and 20 year old men and **women** had votes in Australia much more would have been done to see that conditions outside the metropolitan areas were such as to retain such people in those areas and give them some future in those areas.

* I refer to the men and **women** of 18.

* There are excellent chances that men and **women** of those ages will be able to have a vote in this year's House of Representatives election, even if the Government does not allow a vote to be taken on the Bill I have introduced today, or on the Bill which I introduced in June 1970, or on the Bill which the Government itself introduced in March last year to which we would move an amendment to give votes at 18 years of age, The reason why these people might have a vote at this years House of Representatives election is because the Constitution states: 
There has always been question as to what is meant by an 'adult'.

* But by the end of the next month men and **women** of 18, 19 and 20 years of age in South Australia will not only have adult rights in the general sense; they will also have the right to vote at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of that State.

* Since then the Western Australian Labor Government has announced that it will give complete adult rights to 18- year-old men and **women**.

* In South Australia it would appear clear, and in Western Australia it seems probable, that by the end of next month men and **women** of 18 will be adults and they will have the right to vote for their State Parliaments.

* The alternative is a supporting mothers' allowance, a guardians' allowance, a dependants' allowance, a family allowance and supplementary assistance for accommodation because most of the **women** receiving the supporting mothers' allowance draw on that benefit- a total cost over 16 years in current terms of $61,000.

* More than that, if the honourable member for Hume were to be successful in his stated objective- that, very simply and crudely put by him, is that poor, distressed **women** can go to the public hospitals and either complete their confinements or have their abortions- the result would be a strain on limited public hospital facilities.

* He says that poorer **women** can go to public hospitals for abortiontype operations.

* I wish to draw on some practical experiences that I had when I was a member of the police force and came in contact with **women** who had to resort to back street abortions.

* I saw some of the harrowing and demeaning experiences of those **women**, most usually young girls who were overwhelmed with the distress and what they believed to be the shame of the situations with which they were confronted.

* I wish some of the people who tried to prevent **women** from exercising what I believe to be a proper right had had some of these experiences.

* Women are urgently needed in the work force.

* Industry is in urgent need of these young **women** in the work force.

* This means **women** will be able to be absorbed within the local work force without having to leave and travel long distances by train to gain employment as they had to do in the immediate past.

* -The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1)1 understand that there have been difficulties involved in the establishment of the Adelaide Women's Health Collective Centre in a permanent building in Hindmarsh.

* Within five years the South African Student Organisation, the core of the black consciousness movement, had generated many other movements the best known of which are the Black People's Convention, the Black Workers Alliance, the Black Renaissance Movement, the Black Women's Movement and the South African Students movement.

* The Government has failed because once again it has shown that overall it has no concern for the men and **women** in country communities.

* In recent years there has been a change in attitude towards the adoption of measures restricting night work by **women**.

* on "Women Workers in a Changing World" in 1964 contended that the traditional measures adopted with  the  objective of protecting the health of **women** workers may now be discriminatory rather than protective.

* No evidence has been produced to show that night work is a health hazard to **women** or that it is more harmful to **women** than to men.

* When one looks hurriedly through the list of country towns and cities in the unemployment statistics one sees that in Dubbo 1,117 men and 382 **women** are unemployed; in Kempsey 425 men and 282 **women** are unemployed; in Maitland 457 men and 254 **women** are out of work; in Parkes 305 men and 187 **women** are unemployed; and in Wagga Wagga 468 men and 334 **women** are unemployed.

* Women in receipt of deserted wives pensions have come to my office and have told me that their husbands or former husbands have welshed on the maintenance payments.

* On International Women's Day last March I stated that I welcomed the decision of the United Nations to designate 1975 as International Women's Year.

* It is expected that these task forces will play an important role in investigating the special areas, such as Aboriginal, migrant, elderly and country **women**.

* The legislation also provides an important improvement in the conditions for service in Australia's defence forces and will help to ensure that a Service career holds as many advantages and attractions as possible to young men and **women**.

* The ex-servicemen and **women** are in effect given concurrent status as members of the forces under the Repatriation Act and as employees under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act.

* Free treatment for malignant cancer is also available to ex-servicemen and **women** who served in a theatre of war.

* The role of the repatriation artificial limb and appliance centres has been expanded to serve the whole community by providing artificial limbs free of cost for those who need them - both to ex-servicemen and **women** and to civilians.

* However, it could also be said that that is about where the consensus on the child care issue finishes because there are strong differences of opinion within the community on the whole philosophy of child care and this really centres on the role of **women** either as mothers or as members of the work force.

* One view is that as **women** have rights equal to men as members of the work force, their childbearing role should not be allowed to prevent them from finding work, job advancement or job satisfaction.

* Whether one agrees with the principle of **women** in the work force or not, the fact is that many families with modest incomes forgo the second pay packet because of a firm belief that being a full time mother is more important.

* The fact is that some **women** do take this view and forgo that second income and I would not like to see them penalised because of that.

* Abortion is an attitude problem and those with a moral objection to it need to do more to persuade **women** away from it.

* Courts are not likely to be locking **women** up because they have aborted their children.

* What is needed is an educative, supportive approach to encourage **women** away from this tragic option.

* 1 shall confine my remarks to the abolition of sales tax on contraceptives and the role of **women** in the community.

* The Government's all-male Ministry and all-male Parliamentary Party has shown a degree of realism in relation to the **women** in the community that I did not expect.

* Very few men can appreciate the burden which today's **women** are expected to carry.

* The party opposite, although it has claimed for a lengthy period of time both to have the interests of **women** at heart and to understand them, rarely gives them a role to play in this Parliament.

* There have been 4 other **women** serving with the Liberal Party in the Senate.

* That sums up the Labor Party's attitude towards **women**.

* In my party in Victoria **women** have equal footing with 50-50 representation in the organisation.

* I have just said that my Party has had a 500 per cent greater contribution from **women** than the Australian Labor Party has had in the period that I have been in the Parliament.

* Nor can I accept that the Government, by introducing this simple measure, can be regarded as filled with understanding of **women**'s problems.

* I want the House to consider a particular group - namely, **women** - who I believe are under-involved, who are vitally important and who would be able and willing to do more if certain difficulties could be resolved.

* At the moment in Australia there are slightly more **women** than men, at any rate of working age, which is taken to be from the age of 15 onwards in the work force figures.

* Yet about 80 per cent of those not in the work force are **women**.

* In the work force itself **women** numbered 1.7 million in May 1971.

* I make it clear that I realise that the bulk of the **women** not in the work force are working, and in many cases working very hard, in their homes in caring for their families.

* I believe that many **women** feel that at some stages of their lives they can make a greater contribution than they are making to society as a whole.

* Many of these **women** are not working.

* Gone are the times when marriage was a form of sentencing **women** to the house for the term of their natural life and when vocations were thought to be the preserve of the divorced, the separated or the frustrated.

* As the **women** reach marriageable age their numbers in the work force decline and the numbers of men in the work force increase.

* In the 25 to 34-year bracket only 40 per cent of **women** work, compared with 97 per cent of men.

* This would be the time when most **women** are looking after a young family and when most men are supporting one.

* One would expect that as **women** got older some would return to work.

* In the 35 to 44-year bracket the number of **women** working rose from 40 per cent to 47 per cent.

* In the 55 to 59-year bracket only 30 per cent of **women** work, compared with 90 per cent of men.

* In the 60 to 64-year bracket the figure for **women** is 16 per cent, compared with 70 per cent of men.

* Many **women** would like to work, but they feel that the burden would be too great or that they would have forgotten what they knew by the time they went back to a job after an absence of, say, 10 years.

* If we can afford opportunities for **women** to spend more time in the work force as  a  consequence of their consuming more contraceptives, the points that I am making flow from that.

* As the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  indicated- and this is realised by many people- the Government's action has been exposed as a cheap political gimmick which puts at risk the future of thousands of men, **women** and children not only in the Latrobe Valley but also throughout Victoria because of the spin-off effects that the dispute is having in other industries.

* The Senate Select Committee on Drug Trafficking and Drug Abuse reported in 1970 that in Australia 5 per cent of all men and 1 per cent of all **women** were dependent on alcohol, and the estimated number of people involved was 258,000.

* Did he state on 21 October 1976  (Hansard,  page 2173) that the Commonwealth's intention was that funds be available for continuation of the 19 previously approved **women** 's refuges throughout 1 976-77.

* When did he become aware that the Queensland government had decided in July 1976 not to pass on any Federal Funds for the two **women**'s refuges which had been approved in Queensland, namely in Brisbane and Townsville.

* Have the other States passed on Federal funds for the other 1 7 **women**'s refuges which had been approved.

* Are the other 17 **women**'s refuges being maintained at a viable level.

* Those figures indicate that the **women** have been the losers under the legislation that we have had and inevitably they are going to be the losers under this legislation which we are called upon to debate today.

* I am utterly astonished, amazed and disgusted that in this year- International Women's Year- we should have legislation of this kind which purports to help **women**, to strengthen the cause of **women** but which places them in such an invidious position.

* I can only hope that, if the contingent motion proposed by the Minister for Tourism and Recreation is carried, the Bill will be redrafted in a sense that it will strengthen homes, strengthen families, protect **women**, protect children and help to advance this country.

* Hitherto it has been alleged that that Act discriminated against **women**.

* Recalling the decisions of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, as well as the recommendations of the World Population Conference, the United Nations World Food Conference, the Second General Conference of the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, the World Conference of the International Women's Year; the Declaration and program of Action adopted by the sixth special session of the General Assembly of the United Nations and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States that establish the basis of the New International Economic Order, 
Creating more livable, attractive and efficient settlements which recognise human scale, the heritage and culture of people and the special needs of disadvantaged groups especially children, **women** and the infirm m order to ensure the provision of health, services, education, food and employment within a framework of social justice; 
Creating economic opportunities conducive to full employment where, under healthy, safe conditions, **women** and men will be fairly compensated for their labour in monetary, health and other personal benefits.

* All countries, particularly developing countries, must create conditions which make possible the full integration of **women** and youth in political, economic and social activities, particularly in the planning and implementation of human settlement proposals and in all the associated activities, on the basis of equal rights, in order to achieve an efficient and full utilisation of available human resources, bearing in mind that **women** constitute half of the world population.

* The equal participation of **women** must be guaranteed.

* These goals must be associated with a global training program to facilitate the introduction and use the technologies that maximise productive employment 
In the planning and management of human settlements, Governments should take into consideration all pertinent recommendations on human settlements planning which have emerged from earlier conferences dealing with the quality of life and development problems which affect it, starting with the high global priority represented by the transformation of the economic order at the national and international levels (sixth and seventh special sessions), the environmental impact of human settlements (Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment), the housing and sanitary ramifications of population growth (World Population Conference, Bucharest), rural development and the need to increase food supply (World Food Conference, Rome) and the effect on **women** of housing and urban development (International Women's Conference, Mexico City).

* Apart from the evidence contained in the report of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships and various statistics of questionable value submitted in this debate by organisations which run abortion clinics and by others, we are faced with an essential problem in that we cannot say categorically why so many thousands of **women** apparently feel that regardless of cost they have no available alternative but to seek a termination, whatever their reasons may be.

* It is encumbent upon this Parliament, as well as the State parliaments, to be prepared to develop and apply pre-natal and post-natal policies which would give **women** to a much greater extent than at present, a reasonable chance to work through their problems with the full support of the community in an atmosphere of understanding and genuine compassion.

* The preterm foundation survey of some 1,000 **women** conducted in 1975 stated that of those **women** obtaining abortions, 52.5 per cent had never been married, 55.4 per cent were young adolescents and 61.4 per cent stated that the reason for their situation was that they had not used contraception.

* Statistics provided to the Royal Commission by the Crown Street Women's Hospital in 1974 stated that 80 per cent of **women** seeking abortion gave inability to cope emotionally as their main reasons for terminating a pregnancy.

* Principally they are organised and run by the Catholic Church and are directed specifically at encouraging **women** to have their children and not to seek abortions.

* While abortion remains such an accessible option for **women**, the recognition of paternity and the attendant responsibilities are being avoided.

* The **women** went to the wells and carried the water back in the traditional Indian manner, in water pitchers on their heads.

* Consider a law that deprives **women**, of whom half are married, legal abortions on request and so causes untold misery, hardship and exposure to squalid dangerous surgery at the hands of 'backyard' abortionists.

* It is a notorious fact that **women** determined to have an abortion will not be deterred from their objective in spite of its illegality, after being refused by a doctor.

* It is true that **women** with money and connections can obtain an abortion from a competent and cautious doctor operating in an efficient suburban clinic.

* However, the majority of **women** are forced to go to the unqualified 'backyarder' abortionist who profits on the restrictions of the law at the expense of these **women**.

* We should not allow the health and the lives of **women** to be threatened by these people.

* We cannot allow the reproductive capacities of these **women** to be destroyed or damaged by bungled abortions.

* Afraid of prosecution and uncertain of their rights under the law some doctors are refusing **women** an abortion when they are in need.

* Consider the hypocrisy of a society that expects a woman to bear children against her will and then does little to support those children if in need or even suggests adoption so that other **women** can be happy at her expense.

* Parliaments have not protected all the rights involved when they force **women** to bear children against their will.

* I warn this wholly male House that it is because we are males there is a great danger that we will ignore the needs and rights of **women** in this matter.

* Full government responsibility suggests that special abortion clinics in teaching hospitals are needed to provide education of doctors and students in how best to counsel **women** concerning unwanted pregnancies, to set standards for the Australian Capital Territory and to carry out research, particularly in the follow up of patients.

* Those who accept without question the 'right to life' of the foetus must examine their consciences and answer for the desperate misery and hardship imposed upon pregnant **women**, the existence of illicit abortionists, the hypocrisy of a law that is different for rich and poor, and the confusion that faces doctors as to their medical rights.

* They were the product of the democratic process of the Party, developed over years and at grass-roots level by hundreds of involved men and **women** of the Australian Labor Party.

* I should like to know how many thousands of men and perhaps **women**, because we have found Filipino **women** who have been exploited in this way, are working in Australia at near slave rates of pay under threat of deportation by their employers who have only to say: 'Listen, if you are going to kick up a row about it or join the union I will ring the Department of Immigration and tell them where to locate you'.

* -The Prime Minister will know that within 6 days there is to be a conference here in Canberra on **women** in politics.

* Is the Prime Minister aware of the discontent among **women** over the organising of this convention?

* Is he aware that many **women** have submitted papers and have no idea whether they will be presented or when they will be presented?

* Further, is the lack of organisation for this important and worthwhile conference largely due to the fact that the people who were supposed to be organising it were jaunting around overseas after the world conference on **women** in Mexico?

* It is effectively saying that these service men and **women** will serve nine years prior to becoming eligible for a loan.

* I compliment the Government on clause 3, which deals with de facto relationships that exist between men and **women** by choice.

* Servicemen and **women** who serve for three years and then re-engage are eligible for a defence service homes loan.

* I refer the Minister to the questions asked of him this week and last by the honourable member for Wentworth regarding the employment of married **women**.

* These activities of IWS are concentrated on the 4 main end uses of wool - carpets, **women**'s outerwear, men's outerwear and knitted outerwear (excluding children's wear).

* 1 ) With reference to the survey carried out by the International Labour Organisation, as reported on 8 August 1976 in the  Sydney Morning Herald,  do the figures regarding unemployment for **women** reflect the Australian situation.

* Are **women** the first fired and last hired in times of economic recession.

* Is the percentage of unemployed **women** in excess of 40 per cent while the proportion of **women** in the work force is only 35 per cent.

* Does the Government have any plan to combat the problems which **women** have with regard to unemployment in times of economic slump.

* I was impressed by the new speech writer who had written the first part of his speech because I certainly agree with the general proposition as expressed to that stage, namely, that the question of the abolition of the sales tax and the inclusion of oral contraceptives in the list of items available under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was, of course, a focus of symbolical significance to **women**.

* There is no doubt about that even though sometimes, I must admit, as one who supported the abolition of sales tax and so forth, that I was somewhat depressed by reasonably intelligent **women** arguing the way the previous Government had argued, namely, that many people in the community who became pregnant were unable to take the pill because of the cost I do not accept that argument.

* To illustrate the main argument used then I quote from the answer of  Dr Forbes  as follows: 
The estimate of the number of **women** who might use oral contraceptives if they were listed as benefits is based on a total population of **women**, 18 years to 45 years of age, at 31st December 1970 of 2,346,614.

* It is estimated that at present between 700,000 and 725,000 **women** are using oral contraceptives.

* It has been assumed that 50 per cent of **women** in the 18 to 45 years age group who do not at present use oral contraceptives would use them if they were free and that those at present using them would continue to use them.

* On this basis it is estimated that a total of 1,536,000 **women** would use oral contraceptives if they were free.

* The argument is that there were, according to the previous Government, about 815,000 **women** who were unable to use oral contraceptives even though they wanted to use them, because they did not have the money for them.

* It was, as the Leader of the Opposition put it this afternoon, of symbolic significance only, though, as I said, I was rather depressed that some **women** seemed really to believe the facts as put by the then Government.

* The cost to **women** was somewhere between $1.25 and SI.

* I find it difficult to believe that there were about 815,000 **women** in Australia who wanted to use the pill and were unable to afford that amount.

* In fact, when I asked the then Minister in a follow up question the basis of the reasoned estimate, as he described it, given in an earlier answer which enabled him to say that an additional 824,000 Australian **women** would use oral contraceptives if they were available free as pharmaceutical benefits, the then Minister replied: 
The estimate was based on an assessment of information provided ... by the pharmaceutical industry on the number of **women** using oral contraceptives, statistics on the population of females .

* So the previous Government calculated the number of **women** who would use oral contraceptives, if they were included in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, on the same basis as it might calculate if aspirin or any other sort of tablet were included on the list Obviously it is a ridiculous method of calculating.

* I do not accept it completely but at the same time I see it as a reasonable argument oh the part of **women** that they should have control and should be able to decide whether they are to be mothers, even at a stage when they have conceived.

* But I do not accept the proposition put up now that anyone who opposes ZPG is in fact attacking **women**'s rights.

* I do not think **women**, or even men, in our society have any more right to tell other **women** that they should have children than they have to tell them that they should not have children.

* I strongly objected to the proposition which was current in this country and which certainly was current in places such as pre-war Germany where the state itself encouraged **women** to have children and where it insisted that it was in the national interest for them to do so.

* In countries such as Germany **women** were told that they should have children for the sake of the state.

* But on the same basis I also object to the proposition that to oppose the principle of ZPG is somehow an attack on the rights of **women**.

* This type of thinking comes into exactly the same category as telling **women** to have children.

* I wanted to raise the point in the House tonight that there are quite reasonable and intelligent people - and I am therefore surprised at their attitude - who will argue that there is some right on the part of the state to tell **women** not to have children, but will accept the proposition that there is no right on the part of a state to tell **women** to have children.

* In paying tribute to her, I also include all those other wives- in this case they are wives because there are no other **women** in this House; the members are all males- who are left behind at home.

* I pay tribute to all of those **women** who send their partners off to the Parliament in Canberra.

* I would like all honourable members tonight to think of the **women** that we leave behind, the **women** who support us so generously without being fully recognised by the Australian public for the great contribution they make to Australian life.

* The right honourable member will be aware that information on the employment of **women** in the Australian Public Service is presented in a number of regular statistical items, for instance 'Intake of Permanent Staff' and 'Staff Statistics' contained in annual reports of the Public Service Board.

* I also understand that the Board intends as part of its monitoring of equality of opportunity for men and **women** in the service to add to its list of regular statistical bulletins one on the employment of **women**.

* This bulletin, the first of which is expected to be released shortly will contain a variety of information including details of second division offices occupied by **women**.

* The Public Service Board has in recent times made available a substantial amount of information on the employment of **women** to, for example, the Joint Council Sub-Committee on Women.

* The groups of staff that are ineligible for OHA facilities include married **women** officers whose husbands are not 
Corporation officers, young single men and **women** officers, probationers, full-time temporary service staff and part-time staff.

* The basic considerations for regarding married **women** officers as being ineligible for OHA facilities are that, as a group, they generally have comparatively short working  Eves  and few, if any, are subject to transfer involving a change of domicile.

* However, in recognition of their value as serving officers of the Corporation, provision has been made for married **women** officers, jointly with their (nonCorporation officer) husbands, to have access to Commonwealth Savings Bank loans on terms and conditions that are advantageous to the officers (and their husbands) compared with facilities normally available to Savings Bank borrowers.

* When will the Commonwealth next make inquiries of the States to enable it to send the  two-yearlyinformation  to the Secretary-General in regard to the implementation of the 1953 Convention on the Political Rights of Women (Hansard, 27th October 1971, page 2648).

* My experience is that working men and **women** do not break arrangements made when they have been directly and fully involved in their making.

* Thirdly - this is a very important consideration - we have a growing number and a very much higher proportion of married **women** in employment.

* I speak of it as a dynamic policy which is good for the States and Australia and good for the men and **women** of this country.

* I condemn them for treating with such contempt the men and **women** who will be put out of work largely as a result of the policies which the Labor Party itself introduced.

* The family's desire and ability to care for its weak ones was fractured by the number of **women** forced to go into the work force, in so many cases simply because of unindexed tax.

* I suggest to the Government that the best thing to do, as a means of helping to solve the unemployment problem, is to encourage more **women** to stay in the home.

* She wrote: 
It is interesting to note that a well known Women's Libber, Meredith Evans, said very much the same thing.

* I am not advocating that the Government pay wages to housewives, but I am suggesting that increased family allowances in future would be a solid means of encouraging **women** to leave the work force and to do the job which many of them want to do.

* 1 ) The terms of reference for the 'Women in Transport' study are as follows: 
Identify and describe the present situation in regard to **women** in the Department of Transport, their level of employment and their concentration in various employment areas.

* Ascertain the current situation in regard to promotional opportunities for **women** in the Department.

* Identify the personnel development and training requirements of **women** (and other minority groups) within the Department by investigation and inquiry.

* Define Equal Employment Opportunity in accordance with the concepts established by the Public Service Board, particularly in relation to the employment of **women** in the Department of Transport 
Define and recommend an Equal Employment Opportunity strategy for the benefit of **women** in the Department.

* Develop criteria and monitoring procedures for the evaluation of personnel development and training programs for **women** in the Department 
The Family Law Bill is one of the most discriminatory, ill-considered and badly drafted Bills ever to be introduced into this Parliament.

* It discriminates against **women** and against those men and **women** who do not want their marriages to be dissolved at the whim of the other party to the marriage.

* The Bill proceeds on the basis that men and **women** are equal in the matrimonial situation.

* It is a fact of life that in marriage the longer it lasts the **women**'s independence, and particularly her economic ability to fend for herself, become less.

* It fails to give **women** the protection and support to which they are entitled as wives and mothers of the future generation of Australians.

* It takes away from **women** the security and legal safeguards of the present law and, in the guise of enabling marriages which have broken down irretrievably to be dissolved with dignity, enables all marriages to be dissolved on the unilateral decision of either party on 12 months notice.

* Do the people of Australia want such a law that will reduce marriage to a purely temporary union with little or no protection for **women** and children?

* The standard of living of men, **women** and children in Australia and in any developed society in the world will not be maintained, let alone developed, unless the management of water resources is conducted in accordance with regional and national policies on conservation and use.

* We want the national Government to continue to set the pace in improving the working conditions of Australian men and **women**.

* An alarming 1.2 million **women** took common pain relievers in the two days before being interviewed.

* Women are by far the biggest sufferers of high blood pressure.

* They are men and **women** of integrity.

* This figure includes **women**'s services and CMF on full time duty but excludes Pacific Islanders.

* We on this side of the House believe that it is our duty to inform people outside this House that although they may feel that it is absolutely hopeless to try to find employment, whether they be young persons leaving educational institutions, married **women** returning to the home or persons approaching retirement, they should continue to register for employment, in spite of the fact that they may not be entitled to any of the benefits under the present means test.

* Thousands of **women** who were in the work force, because they cannot claim unemployment benefit, do not continue to register for employment.

* What action has he taken to implement the recommendations of the report of the working party on homeless men and **women** which he received on 4 July 1973.

* Having several wives is no longer as fashionable as, and in modern conditions rather more troublesome than, it used to be; widows need the social insurance of a man's protection less, and are often content to live as widows on the pension they receive and young **women** increasingly resist having to accept status as co-wives.

* I fully recognise that the idea of young girls being required to marry men, often many years older, whom they may dislike, offends against our ideas of marriage, the liberty of the person, and **women**'s status.

* Aboriginal society allowed, and still allows - I stress this point - girls and **women** who refuse to go through with marriages ordained for them ways of escape.

* I thought it very interesting and significant that a recent congress of Aborigines in the Northern Territory decided, of their own motion, that promises of long standing would continue to be honoured but that in future young men and **women** would be free to marry by choice provided they kept the other laws of marriage.

* The effect of this policy on the child can only be guessed at, but there are outstanding examples of young Aboriginal men and **women** in our society who have overcome this trauma without loss of their cultural identity.

* When disputes arose they mistakenly believed that Australian men and **women** in industry could be stood over through the agency of savage penal provisions.

* The Opposition appears to believe that Australian men and **women** who are trade unionists and workers in industry have only one role on this planet and that is to do as they are bid by certain people, with no say in the industry in which they are employed and apparently with no right to seek improvements in wages and conditions.

* Looking at the matter of priorities, why should **women** and young children be expendable?

* It is an attempt to use the medical profession and the subterfuge of legal clarification to introduce a major change in social legislation, which would have far-reaching effects on the future status and health of **women**, and on the basic civil liberties of all citizens.

* lt should be stressed that a royal commission into abortion - this is my opinion; of course, every member will take his own view in relation to this question - is not justified when there is ample international evidence to reveal the full extent of its harmful effects - of the toll on the woman's health, especially on the health of young **women**, as the College of Obstetricians' report evidenced in detail to the Lane Committee; of the psychological damage done to abortees; of the disruption to hospital facilities and services; and most importantly of the steady erosion of civil liberties involved in destroying the life of the unborn.

* The British 'Medical Journal' remarked in an editorial on 20th January this year that many **women** have been misled toy pro-abortion propaganda to believe that an abortion is as simple and as safe as having a tooth out.

* For instance, a study by  Dr Miller  in 1973 remarked: 
The Czechoslovakian official study of the use of vacuum aspiration with 100,000 legal abortions found permanent complications in between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of all **women** aborted, with the rate higher in **women** pregnant for the first time.

* In the name of liberation it imposes new burdens on **women**, and for the unsuspecting single girl who is aborted those burdens in ill-health can be life-lasting.

* It is a solution which is promoted by some under the guise of a new liberation for **women**.

* In fact, in my view it treats **women** as second class citizens, not worth the proper care of society and the Government.

* I refer to the custom whereby unmarried **women** who become pregnant and do not wish or are not able to have an abortion or a termination quietly have the child adopted by some agency.

* A journal of the Australian Medical Association, which is not a notoriously radical or irresponsible body, recently estimated that each year a mininmum of 250,000 **women** in Australia become pregnant who do not wish to become pregnant.

* I would like to have some material incorporated in Hansard but I will not even bring myself down to the Minister's level to ask for leave to do so having in mind the way in which he refused leave for my Leader to incorporate the responsible document of the Liberal Party 's policies in the area of sex education, **women**'s community health centres and the like.

* Ex-servicemen and **women** who served in a theatre of war and who suffer from malignant cancer will be provided with free medical and hospital treatment for that condition.

* They have not been overlooked but, as a matter of priority, benefits for ex-servicemen and **women**, and the dependants of deceased ex-servicemen, have been given preference on this occasion.

* About 190,000, or 90 per cent, of those ex-servicemen and **women** who suffer war-related incapacity are pensioned under this rate at percentages from 10 to 100.

* The previous 

 -Mr Speaker, I enter this debate deeply regretting the fact that there is no opportunity for **women** to have an input into this discussion now before us.

* I want to switch to this article because it deals with the results of a survey supposedly conducted of Catholic **women** at St Vincents Hospital, Sydney, by a  Dr J.

* Part of the article states: 
This is the same  Dr Johnson  who did a survey at St Vincent's Hospital, supposedly a survey of Catholic **women**, referring to their abortions.

* Under the heading 'Recent Events' it states: 
Again that is the same  Dr Johnson  who reported this supposed survey of Catholic **women** at St Vincent's Hospital.

* On 14 February between 8.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. 35 **women** entered the Centre.

* On 2 1 February between 8.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m. 30 **women** entered the centre.

* I am concerned that a wide range of information services should be available to **women**.

* Consistent with this view I have proposed that the Officer of Women's Affairs should have a shop-front which would provide easy access to such information.

* I have been advised by the Minister for Social Security that her Department has no plans to publish a separate directory of support services for **women**.

* My own Department is currently considering the feasibility of producing a directory of services for **women** and I expect to receive a report on this matter at an early date.

* Members of the Australian National Advisory Committee for International Women's Year will receive fees and fares and travelling allowance according to the standard terms and conditions applicable for members of such advisory committees, namely: 
However, many of the social responsibilities of the family remain, particularly the rearing of children, although even here educational and other state responsibilities impinge upon the role of the family.

* The most important aspect of the Bill is that it makes men and **women** more equal before the law than they are at present.

* When both men and **women** understand the full implications of the equality of the sexes we may see a new era of more stable marriages.

* I cannot see that era coming for at least a generation, however, as the attitudes of men in particular- but some **women** also- will need to change before that eventuates.

* For reasons I shall give in Committee, I believe that this Bill does enable the courts to protect those **women** who have lost income as a result of spending years at home raising children and contributing to the professional and financial development of the husband.

* This group includes large numbers of those who are isolated at home- especially **women**- elderly migrants- whose numbers are expected to increase dramatically in the course of the next decade- those from smaller ethnic groups- whose own support services are limited -migrant **women** at work and the children of migrants.

* The Government is conscious that many of the initiatives it is taking have been designed with regard to the special needs of migrant **women**.

* In addition, for these **women** and for their young children, the Government will encourage establishment of more child-care facilities at places of work.

* The Young Men's Christian Association, the Lions clubs and the Christian Women's Association have all had commemorative stamps issued for the same reasons.

* Let us hope that we can decide to act in this House today with compassion and justice, certainly for the unborn, but also for the unfortunate **women** and their families.

* For such trainees, who will be mainly married **women**, the allowance now becomes $23.40.

* I understand that there have been no prosecutions of **women** involved in abortions.

* There is no doubt whatever what employers will think about this because employers will now have the confidence and the incentive to keep and to put men and **women** on their payrolls.

* Some 2 years ago a booklet was produced on the employment of **women** in provincial areas.

* It is a scandal that we are short of many skills at a time when there is so much underemployment of men, **women** and resources.

* The Aboriginal **women** had a natural ability to learn maternal and child welfare.

* The unfortunate thing was that these **women** could not be kept at the hospital indefinitely but had to return to their tribal grounds.

* By all means let us give adequate assistance to pregnant **women** in the period prescribed in the Bill.

* But let these benefits be spread over all our pregnant **women** who need and deserve such assistance and not merely over the privileged section of the work force as defined in this Bill.

* I think that surely must clearly demonstrate that the Government is not concerned with the employees or **women** generally outside the Commonwealth Public Service in the provision of these benefits.

* Despite what the Minister said I consider that maternity benefits should be paid to all **women** who need and deserve them.

* I also consider that a much more equitable method of providing maternity allowance would be to make that allowance at the same rate to all **women** who are in need of it rather than at a rate determined by the actual rate of pay received by the woman involved.

* Irrespective of whether there is some cost saving in relation to the reemployment of **women** who had been in employment, the cost to the taxpayers should be plainly spelt out.

* Only those people who have travelled through drought stricken areas when the great stress of economic hardship was added to the normal hardship of pregnant **women** and mothers generally would realise the difficulties which these **women** have had to face.

* Many of these **women** work under very difficult conditions, especially in times of drought, aggravated by low prices for products which so often precludes the employment of labour to carry out essential work for all categories of properties and primary producers generally.

* 5240 (Hansard, 23rd May 1972, pages 2936-7) suggest that the data sought are not regarded as essential to a national surveillance of the operation of the Employment Training Scheme for Women.

* Why have only one in every 9 of the **women** who applied for training reached the stage where employment has been found for them.

* I think that that survey just goes to bear out the great good sense of the majority of average Australian working men and **women**.

* Equal pay for the large number of **women** who work in hospitals has added thousands of dollars to the wages bills of the hospitals, and unfortunately the S22.40 per week, which is the new benefit awarded as from last January, is nowhere near sufficient to match the amount required to cover the cost of beds.

* I think this is of some concern particularly to **women** who will enter hospital to be confined.

* First, the **women** will have no choice of doctor.

* Not the least of the wage rises was the phased introduction of equal pay for **women**.

* Of course, money is not the only solution to the problem; it is also very much a case of getting the right men and **women** to staff the positions which might be created.

* I want to turn to the question of the number of **women** on the Commission.

* The number of **women** on the Commission was to be two.

* The point is that it is not a question of whether there should be one, 2, 3 or 5 **women**; the number of **women** has been specified.

* For some reason the Government has written in the number of **women** who should be allowed on the Commission.

* Is it any wonder that the younger **women** of today tear their hair out when they see this sort of sexism in legislation.

* I hope he can find time to explain to the **women** of Leichhardt how it is amusing.

* I do not mind if there are 1 1 **women** on the Commission or if there is none.

* The object of the exercise is that **women** on merit should be able to serve on this Commission.

* I am sure that there are plenty of **women** who have that merit.

* What will happen is that two out of eleven members to be appointed will be **women**.

* The Government has done its bit to show that it is interested in **women**'s affairs and **women**'s involvement.

* Why should there be any mention of the number of **women** at all?

* What we want is a society in which **women** are getting the opportunity to advance and to take an equal place with men.

* Nobody would want to oppose the development of these sorts of ad hoc child care centres attached to industries where the employers perhaps are enlightened enough to want them or are competing for the labour of married **women** and want to create this as an additional attraction.

* Thirty-five per cent of the married **women** of Australia are now working and 25 per cent of the married **women** of Australia who are working have children under the age of 6 years.

* - or, as an alternative from married **women** who go into industry, even if they have young families, because of the sheer need for a double income in the circumstances in which the lower income groups find themselves.

* The Minister for Labour and National Service said very carefully that he made no moral evaluation of the fact that **women** go into industry.

* Here is an emerging problem - the problem of **women** working in industry - and the Commonwealth has to take the initiative to establish child care centres where there is the greatest need.

* Suppose somebody employing a great number of married **women** or a local government authority does not happen to be interested in developing child care centres.

* It will lead to a situation where our highly qualified medical men and **women** will not tolerate interference in their work from people who do not know what they are talking about.

* This Government's plan will not hurt them but it will deny top quality medical care to the countless hundreds of thousands of Australian people - men, **women** and children - who at the present time in certain areas have access to it.

* To answer the first part of the question, I am not aware that the group which has set up a **women**'s clinic in Leichhardt with Federal funding and at the instance and initiative of the State Health Department was formerly operating an abortion clinic or that such clinic was known as 'Control'.

* What that Council is doing is inquiring into ways of attracting more **women** into the work force.

* My own Department does not have a study for the purpose of attracting **women** into the work force, lt realises the reality of the situation which is that for social reasons and because of community attitudes more **women** are going into the work force.

* There has been quite a remarkable growth in the number of **women** in the work force.

* The number of married **women** in the work force doubled from 9% to 18%.

* My attitude and that of the Department through me is not to attract **women** into the work force but to recognise that **women** are going into the work force.

* Women in rural areas constitute a very real problem in relation to decentralisation.

* It is very rare that the sea and sky are as blue as they are made out to be, that the flowers are so brilliant or the **women** are so beautiful.

* After all, that is an earnest of the Government's preparedness to place resources behind the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, but I think that all of us are aware of the fact that it is a case of men and **women** as well as resources.

* As the honourable member may know, the submission to which he refers ranges over a large number of issues relating to **women**, including equal pay end equal opportunity in employment, maternity leave, and the training, vocational guidance and employment services available to **women**.

* The inquiry by the Advisory Committee on Commonwealth Employment Service Statistics, the proposed household incomes and expenditure patterns survey and the National Survey of Incomes for the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, should all, among other things, lead to the provision of greater and better information about **women** in the labour force.

* I am effecting improvements to the Commonwealth Employment Service and vocational guidance services, planning the introduction of a National Training Scheme, and proposing to enhance and enlarge the role and functions of the Department of Labour's Women's (Bureau.

* Not all that the Women's Electoral Lobby seek in their submission has been achieved but the progress we have made to improve the situation of **women** in the labour force is considerable, especially when viewed against the performance of the previous Government in these matters.

* The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has already introduced equal pay for men and **women** doing the same or substantially the same work.

* At May 1974 the number of **women** working part-time in the Australian Public Service was 5808.

* These **women** worked part-time in all departments of the Australian Public Service with the exception of the Departments of Northern Development and Northern Territory.

* In line with the Government's principle of equality of opportunity for men and **women** in the Australian Public Service, I announced on 29 August 1973 that **women** are no longer required to notify the Public Service Board of their marriages and are not required to produce their marriage certificates for employment in the Australian Public Service.

* Furthermore, **women** now have the choice of Miss,  Mrs or Ms as  a title of courtesy.

* Consequently statistics identifying married **women** officers as such are no longer collected.

* Information on the age structure of the **women** employed part-time would not be available without a survey of all relevant departments.

* Members of this House have the closest contact with the men and **women** throughout Australia.

* The Party also receives allegiance from all the progressive movements- from ethnic groups, the **women**'s movement, the environmentalists, the artists and what can broadly be called the peace movement.

* A special maturity is required of progressive people, to realise that some of their colleagues who are workers or just of an older generation may not have had the opportunity to broaden their horizons far enough to really understand by say certain environmental concerns, or the liberation of **women**.

* Adverse effects have been confirmed to some only of the offspring of **women** who were administered the drug during pregnancy.

* That is an increase of 435,000 married **women** in the work force.

* Single aged persons - that is, residents of Australia aged 65. years or more for men and 60 or over for **women** - previously paid no tax if their taxable income did not exceed $1,300.

* Honourable members will be aware that hundreds of thousands of girls and **women** around Australia play netball.

* The inaugural meeting of that particular organisation, which was then called the All-Australian Women's Basketball Association, was held in Sydney on 26 and 27 August 1927.

* It is with a degree of reluctance that I say that I am possibly the only member of parliament in this country, State or Federal, who has had the unpleasant duty of taking dying depositions and declarations from unfortunate **women** who had been forced to go to a backyard abortionist.

* But despite that, the trend in the world has been that a **women** with an unwanted pregnancy, irrespective of the consequences and by whatever methods are available- the backyard abortionist, the darning needle, jumping off a ladder or a thousand other ways- will seek to terminate the unwanted pregnancy.

* No one should be permitted to make a profit out of the plight of the unfortunate **women** who have an unwanted pregnancy.

* The unfortunate New Zealand girls or married **women** who are determined to terminate their unwanted pregnancy have to find the air fare to enable them to come to Australia to end that pregnancy.

* Catholic authorities have been given a report which says Catholic **women** now have abortions at about the same rate as non-Catholics.

* 1 ) &amp; (2) I am advised that the Australian Bureau of Statistics collects information on **women** employed part-time and on those seeking to work pan-time (pan-time workers are defined as those who normally work less than 35 hours a week).

* This information shows that there has been a steady increase in the proportion of employed **women** working pan-time.

* The latest information indicates that in May 1974 about 560, 100 **women** were employed part-time, 29 per cent of the estimated total number of employed **women**.

* The Department through the Employment Service plays an active part in finding part-time employment for **women**.

* The Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor and Immigration has been active in seeking to secure a wider acceptance of part-time employment as a regular feature of the employment market structure.

* The Department of Foreign Affairs is served by a group of 1,345 very dedicated men and **women** drawn from many departments.

* Compared with a 6.2 per cent unemployment rate for Australian born **women**, for the Italian, Greek and Yugoslav **women** the unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent, whilst for those from the United Kingdom and Ireland the unemployment rate was 6 per cent.

* For those **women** who had been here from 10 to 15 years the unemployment rate was 7.3 per cent.

* The following groups of people in our community are eligible for legal assistance, as distinct from legal advice: All exservicemen and **women**; Aboriginals; students; all who are receiving benefits which include old age pensioners, widows, supporting mothers, people on sickness benefits and the unemployed.

* I do not think it is relevant to consider streamlining a piece of legislation unless it is likely to produce a better system for the ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia.

* It is approximately six years since the last men and **women** came home from Vietnam; it is about 25 years since the last men and **women** came home from Korea; it is 34 years since they came home from the Second World War; and it is 60 years since they came home from the First World War.

* I have the feeling that this legislation is part of the machinery which is being established to try to get the claims of ex-servicemen and **women** upon the gratitude of the people of this country to fade away as fast as possible.

* I have heard around the Parliament mention of people who are advocating that we should abolish the whole system- give our ex-service men and **women** a hearty golden handshake and then ask them to go away.

* Fringe benefits which have meant so much to many of the service men and **women** are slowly being whittled away.

* The War Memorial lists the names of 100,000 men and **women** who were killed in the wars.

* As I said earlier, some 330,000 men and **women** sailed from Australia in the First World War.

* The royal commission is to have a majority of **women** members.

* After all, this matter affects **women**.

* Yet **women** are obviously intimately concerned with this matter.

* So the amendment provides for the royal commission to have a majority of **women** members.

* Firstly how many abortions are performed each year in Australia and what are the characteristics of the **women** who are aborted and the circumstances in which abortions occur?

* Secondly, what are the consequences of abortion for **women** who are aborted?

* Thirdly, what are the courses open to **women** who carry through unwanted pregnancies and what are the consequences of each course for the mother and for the child?

* Many **women**, especially married **women**, have found it possible and desirable to join the work force for reasons often unrelated to the level of wages available.

* These reasons include the attitudes towards **women**'s liberation, a community acceptance that many married **women** may work, and the higher education which has given **women** the ability and desire to participate more actively in community affairs and business and other related influences.

* In this instance, the large potential increase of supply that was available from the ranks of married **women** was not only willing to respond to a higher wage, but also was probably willing to join the work force even if there had been no noticeable advance in the wage rates.

* Insofar as these discouraging experiences depress the interest and incentive of young workers or job seekers, their image suffers further in the minds of employers, who thus tend to favour older workers, including married **women**, as yielding a better return per dollar of labour cost.

* -I think an amount of $2m was appropriated in the previous Budget for International Women's Year activities and an amount less than that was appropriated in this Budget.

* I have no doubt that the committee considered that the Women and Politics Conference would be beneficial to the **women** of Australia.

* Women from all over the world were invited to take part in the seminar and the conference has taken place.

* Of course it does attract attention when people disagree at a conference or want to raise certain political issues, but the real merit of the conference lies in the fact that **women** have a role to play in the political spectrum.

* The great majority of men and **women** who receive the unemployment benefit want to work.

* It will make safe, sterile abortions inaccessible to **women** who so desperately need them- **women** on low incomes, **women** who have been raped, **women** with large families and **women** to whom an unwanted pregnancy threatens physical and mental health.

* I believe that the clinics run by  Dr Wainer  in Melbourne and  Dr Davis  in Sydney are run for the benefit of **women** who honestly believe, after a great deal of soulsearching, that a termination is the only answer.

* I do not believe that **women** lightly take the decision to have an abortion, especially those of the Catholic faith.

* Recent reports in the Press tell us that each year between 10,000 and 15,000 Catholic **women** in Australia have abortions.

* A recent survey commissioned by the Catholic Church shows that of 200 Catholic **women** surveyed nearly all believed that abortion was morally wrong.

* Australia once dominated tennis, squash, **women**'s athletics and swimming and produced world champion athletes in men's athletics, cycling and rowing and creditable performances in other sports but we now cannot claim to be the top nation in any sport.

* Just about everything is included except the Women's Electoral Lobby.

* I emphasise that I support the realisation by society of the principle that **women** have every right to plan and conduct their lives in a manner which gives them a wider choice as to the role they may wish to play both within society and within the marital relationship, an important part of which, of course, is the bearing of children and ensuring that they are adequately cared for.

* As my colleague the honourable member for Hughes has pointed out, one of the great comforts to those of us who have taken a part in this operation for many years- the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  has a distinguished record in this- is the remarkable increase in the articulate capacity and the eloquence in expression of the Aboriginal men and **women**.

* They know that single and married **women** are at times so threatened by the thought of bearing a child that their own welfare - possibly the welfare of a family- is seriously threatened.

* One of the big problems is that many **women** do not understand the difficulties associated with contraception.

* The real problem here is not with unmarried **women** but with married **women**.

* Many **women** become pregnant again shortly after consenting to an adoption.

* In response to a survey of over 2,000 **women** conducted in Sydney and Melbourne by the Women's Electoral Lobby, an overwhelming number of **women** answered in the affirmative the question: Do you believe a woman has a right to an abortion if she wants one?

* The legislation is to try to do just that - to take the power of repressive laws away from **women** in this community.

* I ask those people who are so loud in their criticism to show real compassion for **women** in this situation.

* In effect, what those people who oppose the Bill do is to force those **women** who have already decided that an abortion is the only solution to the situation they find themselves in to delay until there is a real possibility of complications.

* Daughters of Australia, Church of Christ, Department of Social Security, Good Neighbour Council, Grail, Church of England, Homefield Aged Persons Home, Mackay and District Senior Citizing, Mackay and District Development Bureau, Mackay Home Help Services, Mater Hospital, Methodist Church, North Queensland Society for Crippled Children, One people of Australia League, Parents without Partners, Queensland Association of University Women, Queensland Bush Children Health Scheme, Right to Life Association, West Mckay Rotary Club, Mackay R.S.S.A.I.L.A., Seventh Day Adventists, Presbyterian Church, St Vincent de Paul, Young Women 's Christian Association.

* It is an industry that needs some assistance and promotion, especially overseas, and by virtue of that promotion and the expected increase in international visitors and indeed more people moving around Australia, there are some tremendous prospects for growth in the employment of unskilled workers, **women** in the work force and young people.

* As the honourable member for Robertson said, those jobs are available to **women**, to many unskilled workers and to many young people in the community, which is something we should be looking at.

* If we look at the description of the commissioners in a generic way we find a genus geographic, that is that there must be one commissioner from each State; a genus female, that is that there must be 2 **women**; and then a genus others, which I suppose can mean anything.

* The other amendment deals with the inclusion in the clause of the words: 'At least 2 of the Commissioners shall be **women**'.

* In fact, there is no reason why all the commissioners should not be **women** under certain circumstances.

* I think that discretion should be used and **women** should not be mentioned specifically in this way.

* Why should not all the commissioners be **women**?

* The Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  has purported to give an account to the House of events that occurred in February when 5 **women** were arrested in or near the lift near the entrance to the Department of Labour and National Service on the tenth floor of the Princes Gate building in Melbourne and of events which occurred yesterday morning.

* In the first place, the 5 **women** concerned were charged with trespass, an offence which was created recently under an amendment to the Summary Offences Act in Victoria.

* If the **women** concerned had been sitting in the lift or in the passageway, as mentioned by the Minister, or if they had used any of the language that he mentioned, undoubtedly there would have been additional charges.

* I have made my own inquiries to ascertain exactly what did happen when those **women** went there.

* Indeed, I asked the Regional Director of the Department of Labour and National Service yesterday morning whether he had any objection to what the **women** had done, and he said no.

* The Department of Health is also involved, through the community health program and **women**'s refuges, in the provision of temporary accommodation.

* This year $3m will be spent on **women**'s refuges and, with Queensland at last coming into the program, over 80 womens' refuges will be financed.

* The introduction of the legislation in 1974 followed the 1 973 report of the Working Party on Homeless Men and Women.

* The report's recommendations highlighted the need to concentrate assistance on upgrading existing facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and **women**.

* These provide overnight accommodation for 3,600 men and **women**.

* It should be noted also that the program is not directed exclusively towards chronically homeless men and a number of centres cater exclusively for single homeless **women**.

* Some agencies in developing new hostels have taken the opportunity to provide accommodation for both men and **women**.

* These articles, instead of reporting what actually had been said to the Committee, under sensationalised headlines such as 'Maintenance for **women** "must go" ', selected complaints made by members of the public to the Attorney-General and then represented them as being endorsed by the Department.

* Those reports were in fact blamed for an event in Melbourne whereby a group called the Women's Revolutionary Guerilla Army threw a brick through the Attorney-General's Department's Office window.

* Women in particular are concerned because they feelwith justification- that the Act takes away any protection they may have had under the old divorce laws.

* It is the same story with **women**, children, migrants, pensioners- all disadvantaged people.

* The Budget falls heavily on the hopes and opportunities of **women**.

* The Prime Minister's view of **women** was given during the election campaign when he expressed the view that they might brighten up the Parliament.

* The Government's view of **women** is expressed in this Budget.

* There are no funds to expand the child care program and to help **women** who have to work to make ends meet or to support husbands who have lost their jobs.

* Married **women** who want to train for better or more useful jobs have had their allowances under the National Employment and Training scheme reduced from $96 to $23 a week.

* Already the number of **women** in full-time training has more than halved- down from 5,244 in March last year to 2,18 1 in March this year.

* The Budget takes away all funds for **women**'s health centres and refuges for **women** who are desperate or abandoned.

* The Brisbane Women's Centre is the first casualty in this area of the Government's crusade against waste and extravagance.

* Has his attention been drawn to the difficulties faced by the Adelaide Women's Health Collective in setting up a health centre at Hindmarsh, South Australia.

* How much finance was approved for the Adelaide Women's Health Collective by his Department and the South Australian Department of Health in November 1974.

* We are able to select the best of the young men and **women** available with all that this means to the Army and the quality of its serving personnel and the fact that it no longer has within its numbers those national servicemen who did not choose to serve, is, of course, another factor which will improve its morale and standard of service.

* The honourable member also drew attention to the disparity between the sentences passed on these two men and the sentences passed in relation to offences committed by two American **women**.

* It will be recalled that the two **women** were sentenced to a term of 14 years imprisonment.

* I point out to the House that the two American **women** were sentenced under that part of the customs law that concerns the illegal importation of hard drugs- for importing hashish in resin form, which is described as a hard drug under the legislation.

* There was a word of sense in what was attributed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs  (Mr MacKellar)  recently, when he was reported to have said that more **women** should stay in the homes and produce children.

* But he denied making that statement, because today it is not popular to produce children; we have to give **women** their place in life, and that is out in the work force.

* As honourable members will be aware, the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was introduced in December 1974 on the basis of a report by a working party on homeless men and **women**.

* The working party on homeless men and **women** recommended amongst other things, that capital grants totalling up to $5m a year should be made available over a three-year period to voluntary agencies and local and statutory authorities for approved projects- such as night shelters, reception and assessment centres, hostels, flats, day centres, special clinics and detoxification units- in order to upgrade and replace existing inadequate accommodation and to build new facilities for permanently and chronically homeless men and **women**.

* The Government has no doubt about the importance of this program, nor its effectiveness in helping to upgrade the standard of facilities for homeless men and **women** in many areas of Australia.

* Complementary to the assistance that has been provided under this program, 76 **women**'s refuges have been approved for funding, at an estimated cost of some $3m this financial year, through the community health program.

* This is in line with the spirit of the report of the working party on homeless men and **women**, which recognised the need for consultation concerning the continued development of service by all levels of government and voluntary agencies to meet the needs of homeless people.

* The Australian Consolidated Press Group has multiple share holdings in 10 television stations and 7 broadcasting stations, in addition to the 'Daily Telegraph' newspaper, the 'Sunday Telegraph' and a couple of **women**'s magazines.

* In particular it provides employment for **women**, youth, ethnic groups, the aged and the semi-skilled- the people who are most affected by the present economic recession.

* Until now **women** whose husbands have died overseas have been able to qualify for the widow's pension immediately on their return to Australia.

* I know of a number of cases in my electorate of **women** who have lived in Australia until the ages of 1 8, 20 or 25, then gone overseas and perhaps married overseas and had children.

* The marriage has broken up- there has been desertion, separation or divorce- and the **women** have returned to Australia, but they have not been eligible for a pension or benefit.

* If then this Parliament is of the view that first the laws of the States relating to abortion are reasonable, but secondly the law is in significant measure being set aside, then it has a means and a duty to use that means, weighing up any significant side or other effects of doing so such as an insupportable adverse impact on low income **women**, to redress the situation.

* The honourable member for Hume in response to the very important objection that low income **women** in particular will be disadvantaged by the passage of the motion, in a background paper he circulated to members states: 
The motion does not disadvantage lower income **women**.

* A letter which has been circulated to members from the Royal Women's Hospital of Melbourne casts some doubt on the likely adequacy of facilities to the detriment of low income **women**.

* Certain of the extremist feminist slogans about **women** having control over their own bodies seem to me morally to be question begging and the analogies treating the foetus as equivalent to a limb or an appendix are clearly morally vacuous.

* We have all claimed for ourselves the right to make a conscience decision, yet in much of what we have said we have indicated that, if we could prevent it, **women** would not be able to make this decision in terms of their own conscience.

* We certainly would make it emotionally tougher for a number of **women**, particularly poorer **women**, to have an abortion.

* It proposes to allow Commonwealth and fund benefits to be paid to **women** who are pregnant when they join a fund and who are not now able to receive benefits for care and service associated with the pregnancy and birth.

* Did he state twice on 23 March 1976 in answer to a question from the honourable member for Evans that he would visit the Liverpool Women's Clinic to make his 'own assessment of the value of its continued operation'.

* This Convention applies to **women** employed in industrial undertakings and in non-industrial and agricultural occupations, including **women** wage earners working at home.

* The cash and medical benefits shall be provided either by means of compulsory social insurance or by means of public funds; in either case they, shall be provided as a matter of right to all **women** who comply with the prescribed conditions.

* Women who fail to qualify for benefits provided as a matter of right shall be entitled, subject to the means test required for social assistance, to adequate benefits out of social assistance funds.

* Any contribution due under a compulsory social Insurance scheme providing maternity benefits and tax based upon payrolls which is raised for the purpose of providing such benefits shall, whether paid both by the employer and the employees or by the employer, be paid in respect of the total number of men and **women** employed by the undertakings concerned, without distinction of sex.

* In no case shall the employer be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.

* **women** wage earners working at home; 
Removal of a provision which discriminates against married **women** in relation to sickness benefit and bringing the income test for sickness benefit into line with that applying to unemployment benefit 
That sounds very impressive.

* The Government is removing some discrimination against married **women**.

* Anybody who heard the Minister making his second reading speech would have assumed that there will be a benefit for married **women**.

* If the Government were to grant equal pay to **women** to fight discrimination and so on it would do that by reducing the male rate of pay.

* Finally, I am not one of those who argue that **women** who become unemployed should be entitled to unemployment benefit when their husbands are employed.

* I know that this issue has been raised by a number of **women**, but I feel that it would be too difficult to police and too expensive.

* 260 married **women** applicants are seeking employment in specified country towns, usually those in which they now live.

* Another 260 married **women** will teach only  in their  own or adjacent suburbs in the metropolitan area.

* Only 40 of the married **women** teachers living in Sydney are prepared to consider an appointment anywhere in the metropolitan area itself.

* ( 1 ) Is it a fact that **women** more than 6 months pregnant are automatically entitled to a postal vote.

* What they mean is perfectly plain, that is, that **women** who are not in the work force and who want to apply for unemployment benefits, irrespective of the income of their husbands, would get unemployment benefits - 
-Under the honourable gentleman's proposal, if **women** under the age of 60 years applied for unemployment benefit, the cost to the Australian taxpayer, I am advised by my colleague the Treasurer, would be $3,300m.

* The cost of the honourable gentleman's proposal, if all **women** under the age of 60 years were to apply for and gain the unemployment benefit, would be over $3,000m.

* LABOR WOMEN'S CONFERENCE, SYDNEY 
I pay tribute to the magnificent support and practical encouragement given by Labor **women** to the cause of our party.

* Women have contributed in great measure to our gains in New South Wales and throughout Australia.

* That victory is assured if we rally the votes of **women**.

* On the support of **women** and the efforts of **women** in the party depends the outcome of the next election.

* First, we must fashion policies with the special needs and interests of **women** in mind.

* Second, and perhaps even more important, we must show that Labor's existing policies- our traditional and enduring policies-are as much designed for the benefit of **women** as they are for men.

* I would go further in Labor's great and historic concern for the disadvantaged, the underprivileged and the weak- in the primacy we give to justice and individual and family security- **women** may have more to gain from a Labor Government than men.

* There is a fallacy and a danger in putting men and **women** in separate compartments.

* We cannot treat men and **women** as if their interests were competing or mutually exclusive.

* I regard Labor's policies as designed, not for some **women**, not even just for all **women**, but for all people.

* Women cannot be treated, and would never wish to be treated, as a sectional interest.

* It would be arrogant and mistaken to devise policies for **women** in the way that special policies are needed, say for migrants or Aborigines or pensioners or other deprived minorities.

* Women are not a minority.

* All our policies must be developed with **women** in mind; and there will be some initiatives which have **women** specifically in mind.

* By doing so we will not only be clarifying the nature of our policies; we will be demonstrating a far more mature perception of **women**'s place in society.

* If we look at the whole range of Labor initiatives and Labor achievements- in health, in education, in social security, in child care, in industrial policy, in incomes policy, in human rights- we can see that **women** and children are as much the beneficiaries as men, and that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit.

* Everyone is vulnerable to poverty, illness, hardship and deprivation; very often these things fall more heavily on **women** than on men.

* Labor's policies in these fields are policies for **women**; they are part of our program to improve the welfare and widen the rights and opportunities of the whole community.

* Inevitably in government we found gaps and deficiencies in particular areas affecting **women** and we felt a special and urgent obligation to do something about them.

* Every statement of this kind from  Mr Fraser  is a threat to the security of **women** and everyone on social welfare benefits.

* But the general point I make is this: The supporting mother's benefit is merely one aspect of social security, and social security is not a specific objective for **women** but an objective for everyone.

* Labor's first priority for **women** was to rectify the problems of particular **women** with particular needs.

* Because of this it was often said that we looked after a minority of **women** to the exclusion of the vast majority.

* Rightly or wrongly the impression was given that Labor's concern for **women** was selective and elitist.

* Many people believed that our main concern was for the minority of career-minded **women** with higher education; that we were interested in abstract questions of **women**'s rights and **women**'s liberation rather than bread and butter issues; that the opportunities of professional **women** came before the needs of housewives.

* It was given because many of the **women** most active in our cause were, and are, among the most gifted, driving, and articulate people in the community.

* They have enlarged and sharpened our concern about **women** in a whole host of ways and they have helped to formulate and implement many of Labor's most progressive policies.

* I do not discount the importance of anything that **women**, whether inside or outside the **women**'s movement, have achieved for our party.

* And lest anyone imagine that these remarks are a veiled criticism of Elizabeth Reid I repeat what I have said before: no one has a broader, deeper and more humane concern for **women** everywhere- for people everywhere- than Elizabeth Reid, and no person in Australia, indeed scarcely a person in the world, has done more for **women** in practical and creative ways.

* Nevertheless I put it to you that the great challenge now before us is to persuade **women** that Labor is the party that can best meet their day-to-day needs and aspirations.

* We must move from a particular concern with specific **women**'s interests and rights to a more general concern for **women** as members of the community, as consumers, as members of the workforce.

* It was natural that in our first period of government we set about restoring **women**'s rights, and removing discrimination in all its social, economic or legal forms.

* We recognised that for **women** to take their place in society on a basis of dignity and equality it was necessary to remove discrimination and, beyond that, to meet the needs of **women** in overcoming handicaps.

* We extended the adult minimum wage to **women** and we supported equal pay.

* We established committees on discrimination in employment and an inquiry into the educational needs of **women** and girls.

* We ratified the International Labour Organisation Equal Remuneration Convention 1951, and the United Nations Convention on the Political Rights of Women, 1953.

* We appointed the Royal Commission into Human Relationships- an inquiry of fundamental importance to the rights and needs of **women** and families.

* We appointed a body to undertake a continuing review of developments affecting the employment of **women** in the public service.

* I have mentioned the supporting mother's benefit, payable to any **women** with the sole custody, care and control of a child (we would have extended, and we will extend, this benefit to supporting fathers too).

* We established health centres and many **women**'s refuges throughout Australia.

* We passed the Family Law Act to bring simpler, speedier, cheaper and more dignified treatment of matrimonial and family problems, we participated enthusiastically in International Women's Year.

* We vastly improved the status and opportunities of **women** in the field where we had full responsibility- in the Australian Public Service.

* We deliberately set out to see that **women** were given the opportunity the Government to advise the Government and run government enterprises.

* We appointed **women** as judges, as arbitration commissioners, as career diplomats, as second division public servants.

* We established a **women**'s section in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to ensure that every matter coming before the Cabinet is vetted for any aspects which concern **women** or should concern them.

* We appointed the Coombs Royal Commission into Australian Government Administration which has recommended a number of practical steps to give greater employment opportunities to **women**.

* Unfortunately the traditional methods of appointment in the public service have not helped **women**.

* In statutory bodies, however, the Government makes the appointment, and the Labor Government deliberately set out to find **women** who could contribute to the work of statutory authorities.

* Now these were impressive achievements and no conservative government can claim anything like our record of care and concern for **women**.

* The Fraser Government's economic mismanagement is destroying **women**'s jobs and living standards as surely as it is destroying those of men.

* It is wrecking creative programs for the health, security and welfare of **women** and children just as it is wrecking those for men.

* I ask **women** to remember that their needs and interests are not special or separate but identical with those of the whole community.

* The wrecking of Medibank is an attack on **women**; the neglect of the cities is an attack on **women**; the Fraser Government's onslaught on social welfare, urban transport, sewerage programs, area improvement, environmental and recreational programs are attacks on the living standards of everyone, men and **women** alike.

* I ask: What are the real needs and concerns of the vast majority of **women**?

* The Fraser Government, by demolishing the concept of Medibank and throttling Labor's programs for health care and hospitals, especially in outer suburbs and developing regions, is making life harder and more hazardous for millions of **women**.

* Fourth, **women**, like everyone else, want some reasonable prospects of security and companionship; a decent environment; surroundings and services that are at least modestly convenient, congenial and attractive; reasonable access to libraries, theatres, parks, playgrounds and transport.

* These are the fundamental, indeed the minimum, conditions of a civilized life for **women** in any advanced society.

* Mr Fraser  has no more understanding of the needs of **women** in our sprawling suburbs or impoverished country towns than he has of the needs of Eskimos.

* What would his Cabinet of wealthy graziers know about the problems of working wives, **women** with disabled husbands, **women** who travel hours to work each day to support their families, migrant **women** with language barriers, **women** who break down from overwork or stress or the pressures of large families, **women** caring for elderly relatives on pensions or low incomes, **women** cut off from any chance of recreation or enjoyment, **women** condemned to drudgery and isolation in poor houses or dreary jobs?

* It is time we recognised that **women** not only have a right to work if they want to but in most cases they need to work to support themselves and their families.

* Hundreds of thousands of **women** get jobs to make ends meet.

* There has been a big decline in participation in the work force as people have given up hope of getting a job, and clearly those people are mainly **women** or working wives.

* They don't appear in the unemployment statisticsbecause they don't apply for benefits; indeed if their husbands have any sort of job these **women** are not entitled to benefits.

* There is no attempt to help **women** with marketable skills.

* Let us be quite clear on the size of this vast reservoir of idle, workless **women**.

* That decline accounts for some 100 000 lost jobs- jobs that are no longer open to **women**.

* During the three years of the Labor Government, the number of **women** in the total workforce rose from 40.7 per cent in 1972 to 43-8 per cent in November 1975.

* In other words, **women**'s role in the workforce has declined under the Fraser Government.

* Until **women** have equal rights to employment they cannot be said to have equal rights as citizens.

* As a federal government we supported equal pay for **women** and that part of your struggle is largely won.

* What we still have to ensure are equal opportunities for **women** in the workforce.

* These are the basic goals of a Labor Government for **women**.

* To achieve them we must continue to expose and attack the failures and deceptions of the Fraser Government No government has so grossly betrayed the **women** of Australia or so deeply undermined their living standards and opportunities.

* The Fraser Government has not only neglected the specific needs of **women** but attacked their basic interests as members of the wider community.

* The only equality offered to **women** by the Fraser Government is an equality of misery and deprivation.

* Your needs and interests as **women** are those of society as a whole.

* Surely he should look at those married **women** who desire to get a job and who have registered with the CES.

* -Before speaking to the Nursing Homes Assistance Bill and the Homeless Persons Assistance Bill I tell the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  that I do not consider him a male chauvinist but I think I know the reason why there are more homeless men than **women**.

* It is because society designed **women** but not men to be home makers.

* There are a lot more homeless men than **women**.

* But that is what society designed **women** to be.

* There is no program to meet the material needs of homeless men and **women**.

* I hope that it will be researched thoroughly so that we can learn from the program as it is put into operation just why so many men and, increasingly, **women** are homeless.

* I hope that we will be able to finance half-way houses for those **women** and children who live in fear of being beaten, and who are probably being beaten daily or frightened of being beaten daily.

* People sometimes wonder why the **women** stays with the man.

* I know he finds her because I have been out several times trying to shelter **women** from their husbands.

* I hope also that the program will eventually recognise and cope with the problems of the men and **women** who batter their children either physically or mentally.

* Such half way houses for the victims of rape, members of Parents Anonymous, homeless men or beaten **women**, will run very well pivoting around the community health centres because there they will have all the paramedical servicesphysiotherapy, counselling, social work and nursing treatment- that will be needed by the homeless, the disturbed and the battered.

* But what about putting a mother on the commission from the point of view of the problem that we are trying to grapple with, the dignity of the **women**.

* The greatest tragedy in all these debates is that we do not give enough dignity to **women**.

* We cannot preserve it by destroying the dignity of **women**.

* What I would like to see is an inquiry into the circumstances which cause an abortion; the consequences of it; the action required to assist **women** in avoiding it; the action required to deter people from aiding and abetting it; the adequacy and effectiveness of family planning techniques; the action required to ensure that medical practitioners always act in the interests of the woman's health; the action required to ensure that all services are available free of cost; the action required to establish the necessary supportive services; and, generally, the action required to ensure the preservation of the lives of the mother and her unborn child.

* But I do not hold very much brief for some honourable members of this Parliament who for what they believe to be good political reasons and for no other reasons- in this they are sadly mistaken- have pontificated here on a matter which is purely the concern of **women**.

* It makes me sick to hear some of the hypocrisy that comes from the mouths of men about the rights of **women** to control their own bodies.

* That reaction is now strongly in favour of laws which allow **women** to regain ownership of their own bodies.

* He has very cleverly seized on this issue because he knows, first, that the majority of voters are **women** and, secondly, that the majority of people, men or **women**, favour the right of a woman to decide what will happen to her own body.

* I am angry because those honourable members who fall within that category are telling **women** something they would not allow **women** to tell men if the positions were reversed.

* If this were a House of 124 **women** they would have no more right to make laws relating to the bodies of men than we have to make laws concerning medical matters relating to the bodies of **women**.

* How would men like a parliament of **women** to make a law calling for the castration of every husband wishing to exercise what husbands are pleased to describe as their right when their wives are tired, have a headache or would rather read the Sunday newspapers.

* There is no difference between the number of Catholic and non-Catholic **women** having abortions today.

* Psychologically and physiologically the trauma is the same in the case of all pregnant **women**.

* This legislation expresses the Government's recognition of the rapidly increasing proportion of married **women** in the labour force and of the consequences of this phenomenon for the care of their children.

* Since 1961 the proportion of married **women** in the labour force has increased from 17 per cent to over 35 per cent.

* It is evident that, for a wide variety of reasons, an increasing number of married **women** are choosing to remain in or return to paid employment.

* Consistent with these developments the Government some time ago established a special section within my Department - the Women's Bureau - to examine problems relating to the employment of **women**.

* We must not cut government expenditure which would directly and indirectly throw men on the labour market which is already oversupplied with men and **women**.

* Those **women** who are unable to afford an abortion could only hope to get into the queue at a public hospital or be at the mercy of the backyard abortionist.

* What action has he taken in respect of the submission of the Women's Electoral Lobby entitled Aspects of Women in the Workforce' which was presented on 21 May 1973.

* Because of the 26-year period since the last major involvement of Australia in war - that is, in a numerical sense - and because of our relative security at the moment there- is a, perhaps understandable, tendency for people to attach less importance than they have previously to the debt we undoubtedly owe to the members of our fighting forces - men and **women**, past and present.

* It must be conceded that this Bill with its increases in rates for the totally and permanently incapacitated, war widows and some other categories, is evidence that even between budgets we are looking to make changes for the betterment of the lot of ex-servicemen and **women** who have disabilities because they served their country in war.

* Under this Bill $47,241 is being provided for the **women**'s hall of residence at the University of Tasmania and $454,930 for the Roberts Hall at Monash University.

* Plan and implement a program of domestic training for Aboriginal **women** and senior girls paying particular attention to: 
Encourage group cultural, social and recreational activities amongst Aboriginal **women** and their families along lines tending to conventionally accepted patterns; act as a bridge between **women** and girls of Aboriginal and European descent providing common activities, e.g.

* Carry out such other activities as may be necessary to further the advancement of Aboriginal **women** to standards acceptable to the wider Australian community.

* For the information of honourable members I present the first annual report by the National Women's Advisory Council 1979 entitled: 'More than a Token Gesture'.

* This provision also applies to members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service and others such as technical recruits who enter HMAS Nirimba'.

* They include Lions, Rotary and the Young Women's Christian Association.

* This type of flippant dismissal of the catastrophe of record unemployment depicts a minimum veneer of concern and proves conclusively that the Government does not care at all about the men and **women** who cannot obtain employment.

* Complementary studies were undertaken at the same time by my Department which again studied the abandonment rate from continuation classes and the special needs of migrant **women** and adolescent migrants.

* I might mention that the advertisements of the States for temporary appointment of special teachers have met with a very encouraging response, but it is important to observe that the majority are married **women** who are accepting appointment only on a part time basis.

* The standard of debate and the standard of administration depend significantly on the ability of Parliament to attract men and **women** who are prepared to forsake whatever their normal way of life might be for the uncertainties that this task places upon them.

* This Bill makes a significant range of concessions which are meaningful for past, present and future parliamentarians and in my opinion will help towards encouraging the right sort of men and **women** to stand for political office in the future.

* The principle involved here is as old a principle as one could apprehend in the struggle by free men and **women** to achieve their liberties and to protect them.

* This Bill is one legislative measure which can be taken by this House to ensure that **women** are not discriminated against in our society when it comes to the purchase of contraceptives.

* It is important that, in considering child care centres, we think of them as providing a service not only to those **women** who work but to the whole community.

* In my mind there is no reason why **women** who care for children at home should not, on occasions on which it can be justified - that would be on many occasions, I would imagine - leave the children in a properly staffed child care centre so that they can do some shopping, visit an art gallery, go to the pictures or do any of the other things which many **women**, because they have to care for their children on a 24-hour basis, find it difficult to do.

* Boys and men should be taught that girls and **women** are not sex objects to be exploited for their pleasure.

* Girls and **women** should be taught that boys and men are not there just to provide them with a succession of escorts.

* Of course, population control is not only a matter of providing good sex education and of making contraceptives available at a reasonable price to men and **women** who wish to use them; it is a matter of quality of life as much as a matter of birth control.

* He went on to say that **women** and migrants in the age group 30 to 39 years are largely missing from numbers attending English classes.

* He suggested that more **women** might be encouraged to attend if there were morning classes and more teachers.

* On the other hand the statement proposed that charges should be made for the supply of contraceptives to all but a limited number of impoverished or medically at risk **women**.

* At the London offices of the International Planned Parenthood Federation - which, as I have already mentioned, is supported by the Government - I was shown minute springloaded clips which hold out for **women** who might otherwise have had to undergo surgical sterilisation, the option of a reliable, readily reversible occlusion of the fallopian tubes.

* Any amendment which seeks to insert into the terms of reference matters such as housing, child minding facilities, pre-school facilities, domestic assistance for families and working mothers, the social status of **women** in the community and other assistance to **women** employed in industry will be seen as an attempt to replace an investigation of specific, pressing and practical problems with an inquiry into the whole human condition.

* On that occasion  Mr Whitlam,  later to be Prime Minister, when speaking to the Federal Labor Women's Conference in Brisbane, made it clear that he supported abortion on request.

* According to evidence from some people at southern universities as well as the Queensland Institute of Technology the unborn babies of **women** who are subjected to the insecticide are liable to deformity.

* The priority in public expenditure in this area lies there- to get superannuation arrangements available for the mass of ordinary men and **women**, for whose interests the Government constantly professes its concern.

* When the money ran short, around 6 December last year, married **women** were excluded whether or not their spouses were employed.

* That they welcome the statement by the Honourable the Minister for Customs and Excise,  Mr Chipp,  that the concept of censorship is abhorrent to all men and **women** who believe in the basic freedoms and that, as a philosophy, it is evil and ought to be condemned.

* Applications for training will be invited from men and **women** who, as a result of technological change introduced directly .

* Women who were being displaced could be trained as nurses or as teachers because there is a great shortage of nurses and teachers.

* These **women** are not incapable of being trained as teachers or nurses.

* The report found that the special branch kept files on people active in almost any progressive force in the State; from peace movements to the **women**'s movement and to conservationists simply trying to save the environment.

* The Role of Women in Japanese Society 
I am confident that future Australian parliamentary delegations to Japan will heed the Delegation's recommendation that they should endeavour to find out more about the role of **women** in Japanese society.

* It is a wonder to me that many of the dedicated men and **women** who give their services voluntarily in local government were able to keep pushing on in view of the debts which had been accumulated.

* I point out that they include **women**, children and men.

* The sufferers of baldness, particularly the children and the **women**'s experience, as one can imagine, countless frustrations.

* How many **women**'s refuge and crisis centres are in existence in each State and Territory.

* How many **women** and children were given shelter at each of the centres in the last 12 months.

* Therefore, if we are going to find jobs for the increasing number of people who are seeking employment- the young, the unskilled, the ethnic groups and **women** who are finding it difficult to get jobs in the system- it is essential that we direct our resources to those areas that show potential for growth, instead of propping up industries that we know are on the decline.

* The Government should be looking towards the training of men and **women**, particularly men, to lead the Aboriginal people.

* to (6) The existing program under which **women**'s refuges are funded by the Commonwealth, under the Community Health Program, is a Commonwealth/State agreementwhich is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.

* The other factor, of course, is that there is an increasing number of married **women** who, for their own economic need or because of their interest in following a trade or a job, wish to go out into employment.

* There is also an increasing demand by industry and institutions for the employment of married **women**.

* For example, in the electorate of my colleague, the honourable member for Burke  (Mr Keith Johnson)  a large factory - Ericssons Pty Ltd - has found it necessary to set up a creche for the female employees because it needs the **women** in its work force and to attract them it must provide facilities for the children to be cared for.

* In determining this level of assistance the Government has taken into account likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as retraining of married **women** and retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service and industry for higher technician courses, which could have an effect on the programme of the States.

* The retraining of married **women** and displaced farmers has been the proper subject for debate in the House in the past and is acknowledged as portion of the task these grants are meant to serve.

* How many Australian policemen and **women** are currently serving in Cyprus.

* If there were any faltering in our surge towards the new boom, it was the fault of the Labor Party, the trade unions, the dole bludgers, **women** who wanted to work, importers, the European Economic Community, Japan and the United States, the lavatory attendant at Parliament House and the Easter Bunny- everyone, it seems, but the Prime Minister and the Liberal-National Country Party coalition.

* Women, migrants and the unskilled are the major beneficiaries.

* likely increased pressures on technical training facilities arising from demands of such schemes as retraining of married **women** and retraining of farmers displaced under the rural reconstruction scheme and from the public service and industry for higher technician courses .

* He specifies married **women** and farmers.

* It would be inappropriate to let the discussion on these estimates go by without acknowledging the contribution which has been made to the affairs of this nation by the **women**'s section of the Prime Minister's Department.

* It would be inappropriate to let these Estimates go by without acknowledging the work of the special adviser of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  on **women**'s affairs, Elizabeth Reid.

* Nobody who had the opportunity to attend the recent Women in Politics conference in Canberra and who at the same time followed the coverage of that conference in the Australian media would doubt that **women**'s aspirations face formidable opposition in this country.

* There we have the authentic attitude of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party to the aspirations and the needs of **women** in this country.

* The work of the **women**'s section of the Prime Minister's Department, which has been fostered and systematised by Elizabeth Reid, has come an enormous distance over the last 3 years.

* It now seems scarcely believable that as late as 1973 it was still necessary for this Government to introduce equal pay for **women** in the Australian Public Service.

* It seems scarcely believable that as late as 1973 it was necessary for this Government to introduce maternity leave for **women** in the Australian Public Service.

* It seems scarcely believable that fundamental, basic arrangements in the working hours of the Public Service, such as flexitime, should have had to be introduced so late in order to give **women** equal employment opportunities in the Public Service.

* Just those 3 changes- the introduction of equal pay, the introduction of flexitime and the introduction of maternity leave- have created a profound change not only in the opportunities that are open to **women** but also to the aspirations which they can realistically entertain for themselves.

* This is not all that the Government has done for **women**.

* I refer to the work of the Australian Assistance Plan and the work of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission in making sure that **women** are able to establish for themselves the community faculties which are required to meet their special needs- the **women**'s health centres which are springing up in the various States of Australia under the Hospitals and Health Services Commission program, the halfway houses which have been established in a couple of State capitals under the same auspices and the drop-in social centres which are growing up under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Facilities which had never previously appeared on the horizon for **women** in this country are now realities being used by **women** day in and day out.

* The work of inquiry, investigation and research which lead up to the establishment of the committees against discrimination in employment represent yet another major step forward in opening up a true equality of opportunity for all the **women** of this country.

* Another important single step forward has yet to pay off for the **women** of our community.

* It is that Royal Commission which is inquiring into the basic social relationships which define and confine, in many cases, the openings which are available to **women**.

* The important task ahead of the **women**'s section of the Prime Minister's Department is to work in harmony with the Schools Commission on the Schools Commission's recommendations that in the triennium immediately ahead special attention should be given to the education of **women**.

* The Schools Commission has recognised that the present arrangements for education in this country confine the vision that **women** have of the career opportunities which are open to them.

* It is very necessary that **women** should be made fully conscious of the wide variety of options which are open to them in a country like Australia.

* But that is not the sort of consciousness which she is likely to get at the present time from an overwhelming majority of schools in this country where the material in the textbooks which are used, the social attitudes of the teachers to whom instruction is entrusted and the guidance offered by vocational guidance staff all combine to impose on **women** a most narrow and confining definition of their role and potential for self development.

* The second false premise which explains so many wrong decisions of the past 21 months is that it is necessary to reduce real wages of men and **women** of Australia, the real living standards of Australian people, in order to transfer more profits to the business, particularly the corporate sector- which to them, wrongly, is another  sine qua non  of economic recovery.

* But it is still an historical fact that, throughout the centuries, men and **women** who were eligible to serve their country in a military capacity were also regarded as being adult enough to do many other things in the community.

* I congratulate him on his submissions in the Grievance Day debate in which he put stress on inequality between men and **women**.

* 1 ) Did he say, in his speech on 1 1 September 1 974 on International Women's Year, that Australia is not a party to the Convention on the Political Rights of Women because there is still legislation in two States, South Australia and Tasmania, that does not yet fully conform with the requirements of that Convention.

* It has' not been possible to distribute the cost of $32 million between persons in different age groups; consequently it represents the total for all persons' of age pension age, excluding service pensioners but including **women** aged 60-64 years.

* We are dealing with a matter which touches the very heart, soul and integrity of government, and that is the capacity of men and **women** who sit in Parliament to tell the truth.

* I should like to say, however, that the issue of tax on contraceptives has gained a symbolic significance in the cause of **women** which it did not deserve.

* It became a focus for protest and was being represented as being of much more significance to the **women**'s issue than in fact it was.

* A far more significant issue exists in relation to **women**, about which I shall speak in a moment.

* The lack of any great breakthrough for **women** by virtue of the removal of the sales tax is testimony to its lack of significance.

* The removal of the sales tax has not changed that about which **women** in the community are anxious to achieve for themselves and about which many are campaigning.

* Women are fighting a great battle of attitudes in present day social mores.

* Much has been achieved by **women** and for **women** to overthrow patronising and discriminatory attitudes aimed at providing full equality for **women** in our community.

* Women are becoming increasingly important in our public and economic life.

* This is proper because **women** possess half of this country's intellect and they have unique contributions to make in the public and the economic field.

* The question of **women** in employment is a most complex social issue and still requires the attention of us all when considering these matters.

* The technological revolution has freed most **women** from the heaviest of domestic work, and while most - not all - feel they ought still to be home with their families while they are young, many have been well educated for a non-domestic vocation or, in fact, for a career occupation.

* Five to 10 years spent in a stimulating environment with job satisfaction leads many **women** to have expectations which did not exist with prior generations.

* Government studies have shown that just as many married **women** give the attainment of personal satisfaction as their reason for working as give the reason of the earning of money.

* The relative boredom of a daytime suburban home has thrown up the serious problem of suburban neurosis among young married **women** with young families and of **women** whose families no longer require the full time care which formerly, when they were younger, the mother gave to them.

* We need, as a matter of urgency, to more actively consider the status and role of **women**.

* We need to consider the problems of **women** in employment, **women** in the home, **women** in relation to their role as mother and **women** in relation to the community in a broader sense.

* Apart from the very lowest income families the removal of sales tax on contraceptives will have very little impact on the status role and quality of life of **women** and very little impact on the net disposable income that remains.

* It has been unfortunate that this single and marginal taxation issue has been so confused with the very deep issue surrounding **women**.

* I should not like the removal of sales tax from contraceptives to in any way be seen as the end of the process of elevating **women** to their proper role of equality in our community.

* It was open to her to go to the Royal Women's Hospital where there was a family planning clinic.

* To adopt an attitude that In some way we must assume a propensity on the part of young **women** to do this and to make sure that they do not have unwanted children is totally unreal.

* Another aspect is that many of these young **women** have a natural motherly instinct and want to keep their children.

* When I was Minister for Labour and National Service I initiated the concept of child care centres, a concept which showed our concern for the role of **women** in the work force.

* He has also indicated that these publications are being expanded to provide more detail on the employment of **women** in the Public Service.

* In other words, the scheme will provide for full cover for **women** who want their own general practitioner to attend them in hospital.

* I suppose it is true to say that these figures have increased because we now have more **women** in the work force.

* Maybe this would lead to the development of a climate wherein married **women** would leave the work force because of the advantages that would accrue to the splitting of income and the attaching of a lower taxation rate to that one income.

* The article says that the authors interviewed 200 **women** in clinics during what the **women** thought was part of the normal pre-abortion counselling.

* It seems that regardless of the moral judgment this Parliament makes, pregnant **women**, having consulted their doctor or doctors and wanting an abortion, while such an abortion is legally available to them, will in fact undertake that course if they can possibly do so.

* If **women** continue to exercise their legal rights to have abortions and some find that they cannot afford their own doctor or a private hospital without the assistance of the scheduled Commonwealth medical benefits, then, as many speakers have said, including the mover of the motion, they would have access to a public hospital.

* I believe that this could lead to delays, and for many **women** who are demanding an abortion certainly it will be a less satisfactory situation.

* If the motion has any effect, it will force lower income **women** into public hospitals where this Government, together with the State government, picks up the whole bill.

* In my opinion, while these operations are legally available in the States, the practical effect, if any, will be marginally to disadvantage low income **women** by forcing them into public hospitals.

* Because of the significance of female participation for the future of the Australian labour force, there will be a growing need to come to terms with the apparent disparity between **women**'s aspirations and the existing realities of the labour market.

* These new provisions are designed specifically to protect the job security, safety, health or welfare of Australian men and **women** and their families.

* Governments can ensure that whilst **women** who want to work can work an economic and social framework can be established whereby those mothers who do not want to work should not be forced to do so.

* This system would have the effect of not acting as a disincentive for those married **women** with children who choose to enter the work force.

* One of the changes to be encouraged is in the relative roles of **women** and men in society.

* Historically, men have been the breadwinners and **women** have stayed at home as unpaid servants for the menfolk.

* At present about one-third of the work force are **women** and the female component of the work force is growing at about twice the male rate.

* These figures reflect not only the improvements in the employment situation which have taken place in the past 18 months but also a growing acceptance of the equality of men and **women** in society.

* Women and men should be free to seek employment with equal opportunities in all occupations, or to stay at home if they wish.

* The situation of **women** in the employment field and the provision of child care facilities are only one part of the social question of the relative roles of the 2 sexes in the society.

* However, if we are to give any meaning to talk of equality of opportunity and status in society for men and **women**, the change must come in the schools and even before.

* It is no wonder that **women** in their 40s have the highest rate of consumption of drugs in the society.

* This is no reflection on the **women**; it is a reflection on the society which has kept them captive in a 13-square prison to minister to the every need of their male masters.

* Statistics relating to the number of **women** using oral contraceptives in each of the last 5 years are not available.

* It has been estimated, on the basis of information gathered by my Department, that prior to the listing of oral contraceptives as a benefit on 1st February, 1973, between 725,000 and 750,000 **women** were using them and this is estimated to represent approximately 30 per cent of the population of those aged 18 to 45 years at 31st December 1972.

* It is estimated by my Department that about 1,000,000 **women** will be using oral contraceptives at 31st December, 1973, and that this will represent approximately 40 per cent of all **women** who will be aged 18 to 45 years at that date.

* On the basis of 725,000-750,000 **women** using oral contraceptives, my Department has estimated that revenue from sales tax under pre-benefit arrangements would have been in the vicinity of $2m for the period of 12 months preceding the existing arrangements.

* On the basis of 1,000,000 **women**, it is estimated that the cost to the government of making oral contraceptives available as a pharmaceutical benefit for a full year will be of the order of $8.4m.

* I join the Prime Minister, too, in his tribute to all those men and **women** who make it possible for this Parliament to function at all - those concerned with the comings and goings of members to and from the city and to and from the House; those concerned with the replenishment, the refreshment, the encouragement and the inspiration that honourable members have to call upon.

* A very great number - hundreds of men and **women** - provide these services.

* Like all of us who have staff - Ministers and Opposition office bearers - we are immensely assisted by the men and **women** who are prepared to work for us on our staffs.

* I also commend to the House the work of the Hansard and Parliamentary Library staffs, the secretaries and stenographers and the hundreds of men and **women** who work in this building.

* He will be speaking on the same platform as  Mrs Freda  Brown, who claims to have visited North Vietnam recently and who is  president  of the Union of Australian Women and a publicly declared ticket holding member of the Communist Party.

* Accordingly, on 26 February 1973, I established a working party to examine and report on the problems of homeless men and **women** in Australia.

* On that occasion he said that the Government had decided to introduce a program to help meet the material needs and raise the dignity of homeless men and **women**.

* I described the homeless men and **women** we would assist as being in poverty in the sense of having few independent resources and lacking a conventional home with most of the social or economic supports a home normally provides.

* The purpose of this Bill is to assist eligible organisations engaged in providing temporary accommodation and personal services for homeless men and **women** and, in one-parent family situations, their children.

* Many of the men and **women** who will benefit from the improved services for the homeless are now receiving income security benefits at rates and under conditions which, in accordance with the Government's enlightened and progressive policy, have been liberalised dramatically since the end of 1972.

* The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems of homeless men and **women** and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair.

* Then he blamed the married **women**.

* He also got stuck into the married **women**.

* Somehow, if married **women** were not in the work force it would all be better.

* Thousands of young people, married **women** and men approaching retiring age have simply dropped out of the labour force.

* Although it will not be substantial enough to constitute a mother's wage, as advocated by a number of **women**'s groups, it will at least allow those **women** including migrant **women** who are presently forced to work because of inadequate income, to choose more freely whether or not to work.

* Her  job is to find **women** willing to look after the children of working mothers.

* Generally such **women** find her.

* This person finds in the community **women** who are not working and who will care for the children of the mothers who work.

* The 2 **women** are introduced.

* The second point that should be clearly understood is that the Government is not at all opposed to- indeed, it advances- the cause of the working men and **women** of Australia.

* There are hundreds of thousands of ordinary working men and **women** in Australia who have voted for the Liberal and National Country parties and will continue to vote for them because they know that their interests are furthered and better served than they would be by the rabble that holds itself out as being the true representatives of the workers of Australia.

* They know that with business confidence, expansion of industry, commerce and business and with the prospect of investors obtaining some rewards from their investments, that jobs will be secure, that more jobs will be created and that the standard of living of the working men and **women** of Australia will be advanced.

* The working men and **women** of Australia know only too well that their interests are identical with the interests of an expanding and developing free enterprise society.

* It follows from that that the working men and **women** of Australia do not support the Labor Party which holds itself out as being their great advocate.

* The ordinary men and **women** of Australia know that if the Labor Party were returned to government, it would do nothing more than take this country down the same path as the Labour Party in the United Kingdom took, a path that was littered with the monuments of higher taxation, penalties on incentive, endorsement of union extremism, stand-over tactics and the dead hand of government which destroys job opportunities.

* The ordinary men and **women** of Australia know that of the Australian Labor Party.

* It wants to intrude into the private employment and contractual arrangements of men and **women** of Australia in a way that Australia has never seen before.

* This is the policy of the party that holds itself out as the advocate for the working men and **women** of Australia.

* am asked the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Women's Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1 977: 
1 ) On what dates and to what extent has the Australian Government assisted the Women's Trade Union Commission in Sydney, the Queensland Women's Trade Union Committee and the Working Women's Centres in Adelaide.

* -The Lusher motion is derisive of **women** and of this Parliament.

* He wants abortions restricted so that **women** cannot receive benefits except if the abortion is made to protect the life of the mother from a physical or pathological condition.

* No consideration at all is given to a woman 's mental health: The suicidal tendencies to which pregnant **women** are prone and the extreme mental anguish perpetrated on a woman by social or economic circumstances.

* He now says that the motion does not force **women** to go to back yard abortionists; nor does it disadvantage low income **women**.

* The Royal Women's Hospital of Victoria has already expressed concern about this matter.

* So desperate **women** will be forced to seek out back yard abortionists.

* It is not for any religious or political group to determine what a **women** does with her own body.

* I have heard much from correspondents about their objections to health funds distributing their contributions as benefits to **women** who have undergone termination of pregnancy.

* I indicate to the feminists, the **women** who are getting all excited about the fact that their members will not be paid for the termination of a pregnancy if they belong to a fund which bans payments for such terminations, that if they want to terminate a pregnancy all they have to do is indicate quite clearly that they are no longer financial members of a particular fund which excludes payments for the operation.

* The **women** who are excited about not being able to get paid will be able to get paid by just dropping their membership of a private fund.

* The Minister said that we must remove barriers discouraging adults from further education and we must have particular regard for the needs of **women**, of country students, of migrants and of handicapped persons.

* Access to technical and further education by **women** can be enhanced by providing more in the way of appropriate physical and child care facilities, by arranging flexible timetables and by eliminating prejudice against their entry into manual trades.

* At the same time there should be no pressuresin fact by taxation and other policies we should be reducing the pressures- which lead **women** to want to enter the work force when they have children to look after, particularly children under the age of five.

* This Government has indicated it will no longer tolerate the differences in the equality of life and opportunities between black and white, between town and country, between men and **women** or between rich and poor.

* Members of the Moonie cult have succeeded in enticing fine young men and **women** from their family life and have brainwashed them in such a way that their parents no longer have any influence over them.

* And in cold figures - as well as in cold stone in mediaevaltimes - the statistics demontrate quite clearly that over the last 100 years men and **women** have been maturing at a younger age.

* By any standards men and **women** are as mature at 18 years now as they were at 21 only a generation ago.

* They practise a knowledge of the performing andplastic arts at a much younger age than men and **women** did a generation ago.

* In 1968 approximately 52,000 of this age - 15,000 males and 37,000 **women** - entered into matrimony.

* I know that there can always be arguments for saving that it is not appropriate or not proper to give **women** the vote, to give negroes the vote or to give Aboriginals the vote.

* Whether we think that they are right or wrong, the fact is that the young people, men and **women** of 18, 19 and 20, are much more critical these days.

* A solid core of homeless men and **women** are suffering unnecessary hardship because of the refusal of this Government to cater for their fundamental needs.

* The Gill figures reveal the situation only with regard to males but in the past few weeks a project conducted by four Melbourne students under the control of a professional social worker entitled 'A Study of Homeless Women in Melbourne' has unveiled a crisis in Melbourne that the nature of the homeless **women** problem generally has hidden from society.

* One is the lack of facilities for homeless **women**, by comparison with the limited facilities available for men, and the second is the tendency of **women** to make accommodation their prime concern.

* In other words, many **women** who could be classified homeless live in dingy, filthy rooms on which they spend all their minimal incomes or live in de facto relationships, mostly in squalid conditions simply to guarantee a roof for themselves.

* Since the establishment of a homeless persons' section within the Federal Depanment of Social Security there has been some activity in the area for men, but **women** have received limited assistance.

* One of the disturbing aspects of the study is that a number of **women**, or girls in this case, who were interviewed were as young as 1 5 years of age.

* Yet the greatest need these people saw for homeless girls and **women** was flats or community houses where they could establish personal or general relationships.

* Household money is often spent almost entirely on alcohol and the **women** and children have to go without food.

* These ladies are the **women** whose husbands gave their lives for their country in various conflicts in the defence not only of their country but also of freedom around the world, and widows of ex-servicemen who suffered some illness or injury, broadly speaking, which was judged or assessed as being caused by war service and from which they subsequently died.

* There is great concern among the 800,000 surviving ex-servicemen and **women**, the returned soldiers' organisations and the ex-servicemen's organisations that the Repatriation Department, as it was known, is starting to disappear.

* Calling it the Department of Repatriation and Compensation could be the thin edge of the wedge that will eventually mean the disappearance of the Repatriation Department and those 800,000 surviving ex-servicemen and **women** will see the disappearance of their specialised department which devotes itself entirely to the welfare and treatment of these ex-servicemen and **women**.

* I refer to cancer being automatically accepted for medical and hospital treatment for any ex-servicemen or **women** who served in a theatre of war.

* This is a grossly unjust decision to the many hundreds of thousands of ex-servicemen and **women** who volunteered for service overseas but, through no fault of their own, did not serve in a theatre of war.

* I assure the ex-servicemen and **women** of Australia that we in the Country Party and the Liberal Party will continue to show a vital interest in the future welfare of the exservicemen and **women** of Australia.

* I am pleased to see in the Country Party 2 distinguished ex-servicemen - the honourable member for Wide Bay  (Mr Millar)  and the honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Sullivan)  - who I know will be of great benefit to the ex-servicemen and **women** in their advocacy on their behalf in this chamber.

* Women's refuges are being forced to close.

* Women's health centres and services are being reduced clearly and unequivocally.

* I am amused to hear the honourable member for Kingston  (Mr Chapman)  say that as a Liberal he is interested in **women**'s rights, particularly as just 2 nights ago the Liberal Party had a woman jumping out of a cake in Parliament House, demeaning not only the status of **women** in this country but also the status of the Ministers and members who were there.

* Let us find out from the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  and the Liberal Party which Ministers and members were at the party so that we can know which Ministers and members of the Liberal Party are interested in the rights, dignity and status of Australian **women**.

* Perhaps the Australian **women**'s movement and **women** in Australia generally would like to know which Liberal Ministers and members approve of the concept of naked **women** jumping out of cakes for their pleasure.

* We now find that, with the appointment of a Minister specially involved with **women**'s rights and with the Prime Minister's glib talk about bis interest in the dignity of **women**, senior Ministers are party to this kind of charade in Parliament House.

* We on this side regard this behaviour as being unacceptable in Parliament House particularly as it is a massive sleight to the **women** of this country.

* How many **women** who have commenced training under the training scheme for widow pensioners have completed the course since its inception in 1968.

* What has been the age distribution of **women** involved in the scheme.

* What has been the number of **women** supporting (a) one child, (b) two children, (c) three children and (d) four or more children while undertaking the course.

* In respect of the **women** completing the course in each year, what has been the length of time those **women** remained in continuous or relatively continuous employment following completion of training.

* 4205 **women** have completed training.

* I left untouched the rule which gave the **women**, as well as the men, a vote in the annual election of the Chief Magistrate.

* That was in 1857; so perhaps we should allow the Islanders the right to run their own affairs because, obviously, any island which in 1857 allowed **women** to vote must be a fair way forward in development.

* Representations were made by the Returned Services League, the Partially Blinded Soldiers Association of Australia, the Federated TO Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Association, the Australian Legion of Exservicemen and Women, and the Korea and South East Asia Forces Association of Australia.

* More men than **women** are unemployed, but proportionate to their numbers in the work force, **women**'s rate of unemployment is higher.

* But while this Government is busy hounding unemployed young people, vilifying young people, because they are getting benefits, 836 young **women** in my electorate are out of work.

* The Government can tell the 83 1 young **women** in my electorate who cannot get a job what its campaign is and what its policy towards young people is.

* There is an inference in that remark in respect of the young **women** of Australia being on the streets.

* The other important factor about this issue is that State parliaments which have made the laws which the Lusher motion now calls on us to condemn are made up a little differently from this House: Most of those parliaments have some **women** members.

* It is men and **women**- people like ourselves- who are making these laws.

* I believe from the thousands of letters I have received, mostly from **women**, that the vast majority of people in my electorate also are morally opposed to abortion.

* There can be no doubt that 60,000 medical benefit funded abortions indicate how many unfortunate **women** are reading the present attitude of this Parliament or Government to abortion.

* The present message to both these unfortunate **women** is: We have left you an escape; you have an abortion and we will pay the medical or surgical bill'.

* We have no right to offer abortion as the only solution to these unfortunate **women**.

* I am pleased to say from thousands of letters I have received that the vast majority of **women** do not want the termination of pregnancy to be something they should have to decide on their own.

* Many of these **women** feel that society is saying to them: 'If you cannot alford the confinement or if you do not think you can keep the child after birth, we have given you a way out.

* When it is all boiled down the manufacturing industry, particularly the textile industry, employs a greater number of **women** than any other industry.

* I mention these changes and these challenges because it is to the teachers, to responsible professionally trained young men and **women**, that the future course of the lives of our young children will be moulded.

* Women, migrants, the aged, the young, the poor and the handicapped are victims of inadequacies in the information delivery system.

* There has been a big decline in participation in the work force as people have given up hope of getting a job and clearly those people are mainly **women** or working wives.

* Later I said that the number of **women** in the total work force fell from 43.8 per cent in November 1975 to 42.2 per cent by November 1976.

* 1 concluded the paragraph by saying: 
In other words, **women**'s role in the workforce has declined under the Fraser Government.

* The Treasurer also asserted that I had made no new commitments in the speech that I made to the Women's Conference.

* In the basic course 12 scholarships will be provided tenable for 12 months, open in general to young men and **women** from any part of Australia, who have passed the higher school certificate or its equivalent, and who show evidence of being likely to profit from the training provided.

* It should be within the knowledge of honourable members that, in the aftermath of the dropping of atom bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japanese **women** were giving birth to malformed children, as the statistics of the Japanese Government show.

* I have some degree of respect for the Women's Electoral Lobby, which has dedicated itself to expressing concern about the reckless mining of uranium being allowed to continue.

* At least 2 of the Commissioners shall be **women**.

* History has proven quite clearly that there is no dearth of **women** of capability, but the instinctive inclination is to overlook them.

* Proposed new sub-section 31(2) is not a condescending accommodation of woman's aspirations but is a very practical device to ensure that when people address themselves to electing commissioners they do not by oversight miss the essential qualifications of **women** for appointment to the Commission.

* Rather than denigrating the role of the female the proposed subsection ensures that people are required to take pause and to consider the undeniable qualifications of **women** for the job.

* There are to be at least 2 **women** commissioners.

* The proposed sub-section does not necessarily preclude the possibility that all commissioners will be **women**.

* It is a very practical approach to the problem and realises that in their zeal the people concerned with the appointment of an efficient Commission might out of traditional practice overlook the unquestioned merit of the **women** candidates for the position.

* Our immigration and ethnic affairs policies and programs are based on Australia's interests, compassion for our fellow men and **women** and playing a responsible role in the international arena.

* Northern Territory generally, I would like to express my deep appreciation for the contribution made by the Darwin Reconstruction Commission and all those people, men and **women** alike, who have been associated with it.

* It was tied very strictly and very exclusively to the idea that more and more **women** should be encouraged to go back into the work force.

* While we recognise on the one hand that there is an enormous number of mothers in this community who are obliged to go out to work by economic circumstances and who have a pressing need for child care centres, equally there is an enormous number of **women** in the community who would simply welcome an occasional break away from their families.

* Increased work force participation by married **women** is another important factor.

* Employers often prefer married **women** to young people because married **women** are already trained, more stable and likely to stay in a job longer.

* How the **women** will love you for that.

* I find it most difficult to equate in my mind the earnestness of a Prime Minister who will give $100,000 to Germaine Greer, waste $ 164,000 in a week of socialist propaganda in Canberra for the **women** of Australia, pay $ 1.25m for  Blue Poles  which displeases everyone and pleases no one, with a Prime Minister who agrees to increase the cost of  Hansard  from $1.20 a year to $63.10 a year.

* I think the honourable member for Moreton, the Minister for Defence, would agree that a woman some day could become the Minister for Defence, and that **women** should be given - 
I do not want to be the cause of starting another rumour.

* It is true that the Government has a basic policy of equality of opportunity for **women**.

* I am sure that we can envisage **women** in the Defence Force performing tasks such as those of a pilot, as well as others.

* Today, in accordance with the Government's policy on equality of opportunity for **women**, in Canberra we opened a shopfront facility for the Office of Women's Affairs.

* Its purpose is to give **women** an opportunity to have a voice in government.

* That shopfront will enable **women** not only from Canberra but also from elsewhere in Australia to go to the office to express their views on policies relating to **women** that the Government is implementing, to make suggestions and to obtain access to documents that have been published by the Government in relation to matters relating to **women**.

* It will provide also an opportunity, which I think is important, for members of the staff of the Office of Women's Affairs to have a relationship with the public so that they do not get out of touch.

* There is a general provision in the taxation law which covers both men and **women** without discrimination as to sex.

* We will give the vote to men and **women** at 18 years of age, as is already done in all other federal systems and most English-speaking countries.

* After listening to the speech of the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock),  which represented a welcome nod in the direction of the Women's Electoral Lobby, I feel that I should fill in with more care and precision than that honourable member some of the background against which this Bill is set.

* President  Nixon's Commission on Population Growth and the American Future reported last year that 21.1 per cent of America's unmarried **women** were sexually active before their seventeenth birthday, 26.6 per cent before their eighteenth birthday, 37.1 per cent before their nineteenth birthday and 46.1 per cent before their twentieth birthday.

* The Commission pointed out that most of the **women** concerned seldom or never used birth control techniques.

* It is significant in the light of the figures I have just quoted that whereas about one in every 10 marriages ends in a divorce court, a symposium sponsored in Brisbane by the Australian Medical Association was told that half of Queensland's divorces involved **women** who married under age.

* Ninety per cent of Australia's married **women** of child-bearing age practise family planning but only 63 per cent of those who do so use reliable methods such as oral contraceptives and intra-uterine devices, or exercise an informed preference for the ovulation method associated with the Catholic faith.

* One per cent of the married **women** who practise family planning rely upon douching, which has a failure rate of 31 per cent; 2 per cent upon spermicides, with a failure rate of 20 per cent; 5 per cent upon diaphragms, with a failure rate of 12 per cent; 9 per cent upon condoms, with a failure rate of 14 per cent; and 19 per cent upon withdrawal, with a failure rate of 18 per cent.

* In all, 37 per cent of these **women** are dependent for protection against unwanted pregnancies upon techniques which are known to be unreliable.

* Whereas only 7 per cent of married **women** with 13 or more years of formal education have never practised family planning, 11 per cent of those with 10 to 12 years of education, 13 per cent of those with 7 to 9 years of education, 19 per cent of those with 1 to 6 years of education and 22 per cent of those who are devoid of formal education - they are a significant group within our community - have never done so.

* Up to 37 per cent of **women** from professional, managerial or white collar occupational backgrounds use oral contraceptives or intra-uterine devices, but only 15 per cent from unskilled occupations do so.

* Conversely 36 per cent of **women** from unskilled occupational backgrounds rely upon withdrawal, but only about 2 per cent of professional, managerial and white collar **women** do so.

* Less educated **women** are more likely to use unreliable family planning methods and to adopt them without the guidance of doctors.

* Only half a sample of **women** who were interviewed recently at the Royal Brisbane Hospital had ever consulted a doctor about family planning, although 85 per cent of them thought family planning was a good idea.

* We are faced not only with **women** who cannot afford to buy reliable contraceptives but also with **women** who have no idea which contraceptives to buy.

* We need better policies to minimise the frequency with which **women** are aborted and to ensure that abortion is regarded as a last resort.

* Health authorities expect that as a result of that single initiative, the number of **women** reliably protected against unwanted pregnancy by oral contraceptives will rise from 750,000 to lm.

* The increasing frequency with which **women** are being aborted, unwanted children are being brought into the world and couples are marrying for no other reason than to legitimatise a pregnancy confronts Australians with a challenge.

* We must provide **women** who choose to practise family planning with reliable means of doing so at a price they can afford to pay.

* How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1 972.

* Have steps been taken to preserve by magnetic tape the many other oral historical records of the many ageing Aboriginal men and **women** who live in the Northern Territory, which would otherwise be lost if not recorded.

* The first and most readily available remedy would be to make such fathers eligible for widow pensions on the same basis as **women** with dependent children are thus eligible.

* I think this could be supported as an interim measure for 2 reasons: Firstly, it is logical in these days of **women**'s lib that we should not have discrimination against men.

* For that reason, I believe that here and now we could make widowers and deserted husbands with dependent children eligible for pensions on the same basis as **women** who are widowed or deserted.

* Are we talking about a  Women's Weekly  view of marriage, a church view of marriage or a civil celebrant's view of marriage?

* Employers feel confident in being able to put men and **women** on their payrolls and to keep them on their payrolls.

* Five **women** were giving out leaflets in a building in Melbourne.

* The matter came before the court and the magistrate, as I understand it, had the power either to fine those **women** up to $500 or order them to serve 6 months in prison.

* This motion, if it is passed, means a restriction on the availability of medical services to **women**.

* It means a restriction on the availability of abortion services to **women** on low incomes.

* A survey of 1,000 **women** who had obtained abortions at the Preterm Foundation Clinic in Sydney in 1975 showed that 55 per cent of **women** nominated their religion as Protestant and 3 1 per cent as Catholic; that is, among Christians, attitudes to abortion are not clear-cut.

* This House should be aware of the fires that have occurred at  Dr Bertram  Wainer 's clinic in Melbourne and of the intimidation of some doctors, nurses and patients at **women**'s health clinics.

* Overseas there have been cases of petrol bombs exploding in the faces of **women** answering the door at abortion clinics.

* It attempts to restrict the medical benefits available to **women** who have abortions.

* The withdrawal of the Medibank rebate would reduce access to abortion, especially low risk abortion, particularly for **women** on low incomes.

* The removal of Medibank benefits for **women** seeking abortions will mean that more and more **women** from lower income groups, or those who are just plain afraid to get money from their husbands or families, will be compelled to take greater risks with cheaper and more dangerous abortions.

* There is evidence to support the view that back-door abortions are unsafe and that they cause a higher death rate among **women** having abortions.

* The Commission concluded that the death rate was even higher in public hospitals than in private clinics as a result of: 
The situation is that almost 60 per cent of **women** seeking abortions do so for financial reasons.

* By removing the medical benefits for abortion, **women** on low incomes will suffer most.

* There are already enough restrictions on these **women**.

* underprivileged **women** are much more exposed to traumatic experiences and to dangerous delays when seeking an abortion than middle-class **women** who have both the sophistication and the finance to be selective.

* Women seeking abortions fall into two main groups.

* The first group comprises young, single **women**, frequently without a stable partner.

* The second group comprises married **women** with families which cannot be enlarged.

* At the pre-term clime, 1 1 per cent of **women** having abortions were students.

* Sixty per cent of the **women** had attended four or fewer years of high school.

* Fifty seven per cent were **women** employed as unskilled factory workers, operative, **women** with trade skills and clerical workers.

* These are the **women** who will be placed most at risk if this motion is passed.

* These are the **women** who are disadvantaged by lack of information about contraception and lack of child care.

* These are the **women** who are most heavily oppressed by sexism, by fear and by guilt that this society loads on them.

* Women pay equally with men for medical benefit coverage.

* Yet a surgical procedure that affects **women** only, which is prescribed by doctors, and charged for, is to be deleted.

* The fact that abortion is available to **women** does not force **women** to have abortions.

* The restricted availability of abortions forces **women** to be unable to exercise the choice of avoiding a situation where an unwanted child is brought into being.

* It forces **women** into a specific position of oppression in this society in that they are denied their rights to control their own bodies.

* No **women** enjoy having an abortion.

* The Medibank rebate for abortion does not encourage **women** to have abortions.

* Few **women** take the decision to have an abortion lightly.

* But outside this House, countless **women** will suffer, especially working class **women** and **women** on low incomes.

* Women have a variety of responsible reasons for wanting an abortion such as the inability to manage financially; inability to cope emotionally; completion of a family or a recent child; no wish to be forced into a marriage; avoidance of family strife or parental awareness; ill health; worry about the deformity of a child; and rape or incest.

* That in itself reflects a broader set of problems facing **women**.

* Women are doubly disadvantaged.

* It is true that in many areas **women** are excluded.

* Too often decisions concerning **women** are made by men and too often these decisions reflect a lack of understanding of the real situation of **women**.

* For the most part **women** are treated unfairly in a domestic role where they are not only responsible for bearing a child but also for rearing the child and caring for the home.

* Clearly many **women** from a variety of backgrounds and for a variety of reasons obtain abortions.

* There will continue to be many **women** who believe that they must have the right to have an abortion.

* It is our responsibility, as elected representatives, to ensure that those **women** can have safe abortions.

* It is our responsibility to ensure financial and psychological security for those **women**.

* It is our responsibility to provide safe and supportive medical services for all **women** who seek abortions, regardless of their capacity to pay.

* What gives this House of men the right to take away from **women**, and to take away from families under economic pressure, a civilised provision to which they have every right?

* Surely we have passed the stage where men hypocritically think that **women** should pay a penalty for their promiscuity.

* If we are not hypocritical and if we are not narrow-minded, surely we can see this motion only as an attack on **women** in general and an attack on **women** with low incomes in particular.

Handbook on Employment for Women (Question No.

* 921) 
When does his Department expect to publish the handbook dealing with aspects of employment for **women**  (Hansard,  8 September 1976, page 789 and 24 May 1977, page 1774).

* In the brave new world in which we live and in which **women** are, in their estimation, being elevated quite frequently to a position of equality, and the right to go out to work is not a choice but a necessity, we find that it is now being said to them: 'You are equal- equal in the right to pay your bills and equal in the right to go to work'.

* When I became involved in the great political party which has made such a contribution to the development of Australia over the years- the Australian Labor Party- I was reared on the credo, on the thought and on the belief that what we were trying to do for **women** was to take them out of industry- take them from the mines and from the workshops- and give them a position of dignity in their own home in which they could care for their children, be greatly respected and preside over the moulding of the character and human quality of our people and the building of our nation.

* About half of the recipients of widows' pensions are not widows in the technical sense at all; they are divorced and separated **women**, etc.

* The question of extending eligibility for Defence Service Homes benefits to persons who served in Australia during the 1939-45 War in the Citizen Military Forces or Women's Services was fully considered by the Government last year.

* H undreds of teenage **women** fall pregnant because of the inadequacy of existing sex education.

* On some committees we tend to examine closely and to criticise, but let us not forget that underlying all this is a huge body of professional men and **women** who are serving this country very well.

* The Pharmacy Guild has men and **women** with great expertise in this field who could combine with the Government and officials of the Department of Health as a working party on restructuring the scheme.

* I have in mind the Paroo Shire Council at Cunnamulla and also the Country Women's Association which conducts hostels in different areas.

* The fourth category consists of the underemployed; those who are in part-time work but who would like to be in full-time work, particularly **women**.

* The previous section was not meant to argue that employers have taken kindly to wage gains made by **women** workers in the period since 1972.

* The savings employers gain through parttime work are greater if **women** part-timers are employed.

* Part-time work is seen as an ideal opportunity for many married **women** whose commitment to home and children makes it difficult for them to work full-time.

* For many **women**, parttime work amounts to involuntary unemployment or underemployment.

* Because part-time work suits married **women** and because almost all young **women** are looking for full-time work, it seems likely that in that small number of industries where married **women** have replaced young **women** in jobs, the acceptance by married **women** of part-time work has been a significant factor.

* In addition to underemployment through part-time work, the phenomenon of hidden unemployment is also characteristic of **women**.

* The CES figures are the most unreliable for **women**.

* Women living with men who have jobs are ineligible for unemployment benefits.

* This acts to discourage **women** from registering with the agency.

* Further, because many **women**'s jobs are handled by private agencies, particularly in office work, cleaning, and entertainment and recreation jobs, **women** tend not to register.

* Finally, most **women** are simply not in the habit of registering with the CES for employment.

* In March 1976, for instance, despite a collapse of employment in the manufacturing industry, only 327 **women**, compared to 34 987 men, registered for unskilled manual jobs.

* A survey of **women**'s work for the Royal Commission on Human Relationships found that in Melbourne in 1975-6, only 1 per cent of a sample of working **women** found jobs through the CES.

* Women are highly likely to be such discouraged workers, particularly those with children.

* However, other surveys have indicated that the number of discouraged **women** workers is very large indeed.

* A Morgan Gallup Poll conducted in 1973 found 32 per cent of **women** interviewed would go out to work if there was a convenient child-care centre available.

* Surveys by the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments found that in six New South Wales regional centres an average of 24 per cent of **women** contacted who were not registered as unemployed would have sought work were it available.

* This data indicates that between one-quarter and one-third of **women** regarded as housewives and thus outside the workforce should be counted as among the hidden unemployed.

* Taking the mean of the two above figures of 28 per cent and applying it to the number of **women** listed by ABS as not in the labour force at February 1978, there were 829,304 **women** who could be regarded as among the hidden unemployed.

* Most discussion of the proportion of married **women** who work takes the ABS figure of 41 per cent as its guide.

* The assumed pattern is that most **women** work until they are about 24 years old, leave work to bear children and then, at about 35 years old, a smaller proportion re-enter the workforce and stay until they retire.

* In a sample of Melbourne married **women** with children under 12, Jan Harper and Diane Worrell found that the most common pattern of work experience was that of intermittent employment- moving in and out of the workforce at intervals.

* Harper and Worrell found that about 70 per cent of their married **women** had worked at some time when they had a pre-school child and more than 40 per cent worked at some time when they had a baby less than twelve months old.

* This sort of picture makes the ABS figure of 4 1 per cent of married **women** in the workforce rather misleading.

* It is true at any one time but does not portray the range of **women**'s experience.

* It is a definition that neutralises the impact of hidden unemployment among **women**.

* Lacking a social definition of their status as 'unemployed', **women** at home who want jobs do not regard themselves as truly unemployed.

* While the definition of the status of these **women** thus contributes to social stability it has other consequences as well.

* It diminishes the possibility that married **women** will act the way the 'reserve army' thesis suggests.

* The existence of large numbers of hidden unemployed does not mean there are a great many desperate **women** willing to undercut the pay rates of their sisters.

* Hidden unemployment probably accounts for part of the gap that exists between male and female pay rates but it is not a strong force, or **women**'s wages could not have increased as they did between 1972 and 1975.

* Be in it' Norm- rather than the 50-year model which is still regarded as typical for working class males, although not for **women** or the tertiary educated.

* The November 1973 Labour Force Survey showed that 39 per cent of married **women** were in the civilian labour force.

* A sample survey carried out in May 1973 revealed that 27 per cent of married **women** with at least one child under six years of age were in the civilian labour force.

* The percentage for married **women** with children under five years of age is not available.

* He implies that he does not believe in the **women** of this country; he does not believe in the kiddies except one whom he got promoted in an electoral division with the help of  Mr Fred  Daly.

* But there is one point in particular on which 1 would like to comment and that is the chapter on married **women**.

* If that chapter is studied it will be seen to constitute a contribution to a subject that is very difficult, that is, the need to provide diversity in employment opportunities for married **women**.

* The Committee unanimously adopted certain findings of the Canadian Royal Commission on the Status of Women and made 5 recommendations.

* These related to the need for child care facilities at a cost to parents which would not impose hardship; vacation centres for the care of children of working mothers; the provision of a much extended system of occupational training for **women** whose employment has been interrupted by the raising of a family; the provision of incentives to private employers able and willing to employ **women** on a part time and/ or tandem basis.

* Finally the Committee referred to the need for an immediate and detailed study by the Department of Labour and National Service to ensure that the foregoing provisions are sufficient to enable **women** in Canberra to exercise effective choice of employment opportunities.

* Men and **women** of good will in both Houses of the Parliament are saying: Let us look at the matter in more detail'.

* It is the attitude and conviction of men and **women** who look upon the Senate as a chamber of frustration and who misunderstand its historic role and its purpose.

* Mention was made also of the International Women's Year conference that was held in Mexico City in 1975, which promulgated the foul principle that international peace requires, amongst other things, the elimination of Zionism.

* In 1 972 there were 1 ,092,000 married **women** in the work force.

* More **women** are having to work out of economic necessity.

* There is also the view that **women** have a more viable place in society and a role that will add to the work force many **women** who wish to work for the personal satisfaction of using their education, their skills and their creativity.

* I mention these 2 factors because this influx of **women** into the work force has made the child care problem visible in our society.

* The motion deplores the callous manner in which the Government has seen fit to sacrifice the interests of **women** and their children.

* He should have said the same thing to the **women** who had voted for him in the hope that the preferred new deal might be theirs too.

* The Prime Minister's adviser on **women**'s affairs said on the radio program 'AM' before the last election: 
That is what the Prime Minister's adviser on **women**'s affairs had to say before the election and following the election.

* The Government by its actions and its promises has let down the Australian people generally and our **women** and children in particular.

* -This evening I wish to raise a matter of discrimination against **women**.

* In these enlightened days the opportunities for **women** have been greatly expanded.

* Most of us, of course, reject the extremist position of some feminists who, like all extremists who jump on a particular bandwagon, are seeking to use the **women**'s movement purely to pursue their own extreme left wing political and economic ends.

* Nevertheless there is a strong case for continuing to pursue the elimination of discrimination against **women** where it exists.

* Then, 2 days before her final medical test the Adelaide recruiting office was advised by the authorities in Canberra that they were not taking **women** into the band corps and her application was therefore refused.

* The Minister advised me in July that a review of the employment of **women** in the armed forces was being undertaken with the aim of evolving common corps for each Service with like conditions and responsibility for male and female members.

* The aim was to redress areas identified as discriminatory to **women**.

* Women are already employed in the Army in at least 14 areas- in the survey trades, signal trades, as linguists, in the transport trades, in the nursing corps, in the dental area, in the ordinance trades, in catering, as military police, psychologists, publication illustrators, physical training instructors, as quartermasters and air traffic controllers.

* There would therefore seem to be no justifiable reason for excluding **women** from the army band corps.

* Paragraph 15 of chapter 5 of the Defence White Paper recently tabled in this House states that the Government intends that **women** in the Services should now have greater job opportunities and closer equality with men in training and conditions of service.

* It was also accepted that **women** would be permitted to serve in areas where hostilities were in progress but that they would not be employed as combatants or at sea.

* Certainly, the Army band corps must be accepted as a noncombatant role and should therefore definitely be open to **women**.

* Opportunities for **women** in the Australian Army are severely restricted by comparison with the United States Army where, of course,  President  Ford in October signed a Bill authorising **women** to attend Service academies, and that was a major step forward.

* Women hold senior positions right through the Armed forces in that country.

* I therefore urge the Minister to have this review of **women**'s role in the Army completed as quickly as possible and to implement policies which will broaden opportunities for **women** in the armed forces.

* On the question of confidentiality, the AMA has pointed out its general position that the confidential relationship between the patient and the doctor should not be broken by disclosing details of this nature to a third party, and that  Mr Lusher's  proposal would mainly affect **women** not seeking a termination of pregnancy.

* Thus every year thousands of **women** who have no intention of seeking to end a pregnancy would be faced with the embarrassment of having to produce a certificate to that effect before being able to obtain benefits.

* In particular, I address these remarks to those honourable members who are supporting the motion in the mistaken belief that it will simply stop some **women** from having legal abortions.

* Imagine the embarrassment in either case for the **women** concerned.

* For many **women** this is so, and the problems are often specifically related to their sexual physiology and anatomy; their sex organs and how they function.

* In giving these examples I am not saying that I believe in the assumptions on which far too many **women** and men make judgments which give rise to these fears.

* Even if I think they are wrong, the fears, the anxiety, the destructive effects on the **women** and their family relationships are all too real all too often.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 December 1972.

* I have another document which is beaded 'Liberal Women's Rally, Brisbane, Queensland, 30th July 1969.

* Women, migrants and Aboriginals are all among the first to be retrenched and the last to be employed under the Fraser-Lynch recession.

* And among those seeking work are many of the best qualified and best trained graduates of our universities and tertiary institutionsmen and **women** whose valued skills are lost to the community.

* It seeks to persuade the Australian people that by throwing men and **women** out of work all our economic problems will be cured.

* 1 ) How many **women** have volunteered to be trained as home tutors assisting migrant **women** with the national language?

* How many migrant **women** are receiving such assistance in each State?

* Extension of wife's pension to **women** who are in approved benevolent homes.

* Extension of wife's pension to **women** who have no child in their care, or who are under 50 years of age where their husbands are in benevolent homes.

* Information on the percentage of married **women** among employed persons in the workforce is available, in respect of 10 of the 24 OECD countries (including Australia), from the OECD publication Labour Force Statistics, 1963-1974 (Paris, 1976), and is presented below.

* It can be seen that most of the countries for which information is available have a higher proportion of married **women** among their employed workforce than does Australia.

* We want a consumer-led recovery so that the men and **women** who are unemployed can get back to work and so that the under-employed resources can be used more.

* Those funds, which were investment funds, would have resulted in men and **women** in this country getting back into employment.

* Another matter with which the Commonwealth Employment Service will have to come to grips is the issue of the increasing role of **women** in the workforce.

* I would hope that the Commonwealth Employment Service is not guided by the Government's silence into believing that **women** are only of secondary importance.

* Mr Whitlam  pointed out in a speech given recently: 
It is time we recognised that **women** not only have a right to work if they want to but in most cases they need to work to support themselves and their families.

* Hundreds and thousands of **women** get jobs to make ends meet.

* It is in the area of the employment of married **women** that the most dramatic change in the work force has taken place.

* In fact, as one can observe from the rapid growth of married **women** in the work force, reaching over 22 per cent of the total work force as of November 1977, they play an extremely important role in the country's economy.

* The fact that in 1947 **women** as a whole made up 22 per cent of the work force and that today they make up approximately 36 per cent of the work force is a clear indication to the Commonwealth Employment Service of the general acceptance of **women** in the work force.

* It is also worth noting another problem when talking of **women** in the work force- here again the Commonwealth Employment Service should be the instrument for measuring this problemand that is the hidden unemployment among **women**.

* I do not wish to raise now the old argument of the payment of unemployment benefit to married **women**; that can wait until another day.

* But the fact that to a very large extent unemployed married **women** are not entitled to unemployment benefit is an action by which **women** are sent scurrying back to their homes and discouraged from actively seeking new employment.

* One study done in the United States of America revealed that, in a period of rising unemployment, for every 100 **women** laid off 30 joined the unemployed and the remaining 70 dropped out of the labour force as discouraged workers.

* The rapid increase of employment of **women** also refutes the argument on the wage rate question.

* All measures shall be taken to guarantee **women** 's right to work as the inalienable right of other **women** doing and to refuse as necessary existing mass collective agreements, practices or customs which limit the integration of **women** in the work force on a footing of equality with men.

* The mandatory retiring age of 65 years for men and 60 years for **women** is a social rule that we inherited but have never questioned.

* 1 ) What are the terms of reference of the National Advisory Committee that has been established to develop a program for Australia's contribution to International Women's Year 1975.

* What is the Australian Government's projected expenditure for programs related to International Women's Year.

* What recognised **women**'s organisations are represented on the Committee.

* I am absolutely staggered at the thought that the honourable member for Scullin is querying the appointment of 2 **women** to the Australian Broadcasting Commission under the provisions of clause 9 of this Bill 
It is not altogether misrepresentation because, after all, if honourable members recall, the honourable member for Scullin did interject when I was speaking on this very subject yesterday.

* The reason I query this is that it would appear to me that members of the Opposition want to have it both ways: they do not want to upset the **women** of Australia but they do not want to see provisions concerning their representation on the Commission included in the BUI.

* My reply on that occasion was that the representation could be such that there would be no men if we could find sufficient suitable **women** for the position.

* So I am a little puzzled as to just where the Opposition stands on the appointment of **women** members to the Commission.

* I compliment the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson)  and the Government for making absolutely certain that there will be at least 2 **women** members on the Commission.

* From a study of 825 employed **women**, it appears that oral contraceptives enable **women** to work better.

* In 1971 a preliminary study was carried out to determine the factors influencing the use of family planning by **women** from a lower social group in Melbourne.

* By far the most common reason for employing birth control was financial - 2 out of every 3 **women** in this group gave this reason.

* It would be difficult to know exactly how many **women** have been penalised for following a doctor's prescription in paying this sales tax because it is classified only as a contraceptive.

* A study of working **women** in Sydney in 1969 gives a clue.

* Of the 43 per cent of married **women** in the sample, 13.5 per cent were taking the pill for gynaeological reasons, and of the single **women** 60 per cent were taking the pill for medical reasons.

* These **women** were obviously discriminated against by the previous Government.

* Despite an ever-increasing number of **women** taking oral contraceptives, now exceeding 30 per cent of **women** in the reproductive age group, the birth rate has actually risen from 19 per thousand in 1966 to 20 per thousand in 1968 and has continued to increase until just recently.

* Women should have a right to plan a family and space their children.

* To retain the sales tax on contraceptives is an unjustified discrimination and penalty against Australian **women** wishing to practice responsible methods of family planning.

* The Bill is designed to make contraceptives cheaper and to remove the discrimination against free choice exercised by **women**.

* It is estimated that a further 824,000 Australian **women** would use oral contraceptives if they were available completely free.

* sales tax from contraceptives is because the tax discriminates against **women** and their choice to bear a child.

* They have been trying to cover up their total inability to come to grips with all of the basic issues confronting the working men and **women** of Australia.

* It is a sad commentary on their perverted perception of politics to see them rating the men and **women** of this country so low.

* When was the Women's Bureau in his Department established, and what was its initial staffing establishment.

* How many of the officers currently employed in the Bureau are **women**.

* A second great criticism is that **women** would be disadvantaged by the proposed maintenance provisions.

* 1 ) The number of Class A and Class B widows' pensions payable to **women** classified as deserted wives as at 30 June of each year from 1 972 to 1 977 is as follows: 
Now 1 turn to the effect the closure of the goldmines would have on the cities of Kalgoorlie and Boulder where at present there is a population of well over 20,000 people, lt would be very difficult to arrive at a reasonably reliable estimate of what the population drop could be unless one had access to what were the family responsibilities of the men and **women** working for the goldmining industry and elsewhere in those towns.

* However, it is a positive move by the Government to assist small organisations in building up the attitude and the training facilities of Australian sportsmen and **women**.

* One would hope that private enterprise and the organisations which sponsor sporting bodies will continue to provide more and more assistance so that Australia can take its place in the international sporting arena and we can be proud of the efforts of our sportsmen and **women**.

* Will the Minister act immediately to protect these **women**, who are acting only in accordance with their legal rights, by issuing appropriate directions to prevent the union secretary and other unionists from intimidating these **women**?

* Will the Minister assure these **women** that their jobs are secure and that they will not be dismissed if they do not join the union?

* He can go through excessive bouts of gambling, other **women**, alcoholism, drenching work, stay away for a year and then divorce his wife.

* The Bill enhances the status of **women**.

* Moreover, other citizens have an interest in the matter, for it is of general concern that children should be equipped to become reasonably social and useful men and **women**.

* The legal rights of married **women** against their husbands were considerably extended in this country in the 19th century as part of a general emancipation of **women**, in custom as well as in law.

* There would seem to be less reason today, then, for legal protection for married **women** than there was 100 years ago.

* Of the 1067 New South Wales cruelty dissolutions in that year, excluding joint petitions 49 were granted to men and 1010 were granted to **women**, making the New South Wales husband appear to be 20 times more cruel than the New South Wales wife.

* My Government is determined that the men and **women** of the Australian workforce will share fairly and fully in the nation's prosperity and productivity.

* My Government intends to place that democracy on a wider, fairer and firmer basis by granting the vote to men and **women** at 18 and by removing malapportionment of the electorates for the House of Representatives.

* How many **women** have applied to join Australian expeditions to the Antarctic in each of the last 3 years.

* Who were the **women**.

* Does he intend to upgrade conditions and facilities at Australian stations in the Antarctic and at Macquarie Island so that they will be suitable for **women** who wish to spend the winter in the Antarctic as part of an official expedition; if so, when.

* Is it considered that **women** can make a contribution to expedition work in the Antarctic or at Macquarie Island.

* If so, why should shortage of ship berths for summer visits restrict **women** undertaking projects at these places.

* What are the names of the **women** who have visited Macquarie Island in summer to undertake short term projects in each of the last 5 years.

* In his speech to the New South Wales Labor Women's Committee he suggested massive Federal funding for State police forces.

* The election will be a contest between foreign dollars and Australian votes, the votes of men and **women** who want to keep Australia Australian and who want parliamentary democracy to remain democratic.

* It is hardly worth mentioning that many of these people do not respect local tribal laws, which results in fights and abuse of **women**.

* It is hardly worth mentioning that many of these people do not respect local tribal laws, which results in fights and abuse of **women**.

* 1 ) How many **women** have been appointed to senior positions in his Department since 2 Decemer 1972.

* The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) No **women** have been appointed or promoted to senior positions in my Department since 2 December 1972.

* The Department does not discriminate against **women**; they rarely apply for senior positions.

* For less senior positions **women** are applying and being engaged.

* Of University  Graduates  recruited during the past two yean about one third are **women**.

* In presenting this amendment, a couple of honourable members have done **women** a grave disservice.

* One honourable member earlier this evening described **women** as not being equal to men.

* Another suggestion, which I think was made by an honourable member from my home State, included references to 'tom cats' and casanovas' but did not even mention the case of what he privately called 'alley cat **women**'.

* I acknowledge the point raised by some previous speakers in the debate that after 20 years of marriage many **women** are virtually incapable of returning to the work force.

* We believe that **women** ought to know precisely what the situation is.

* Because of the high mortality rate of **women** involved in abortions it was found necessary to pass this particular Act.

* Unfortunately the situation in practice means that those **women** who are well informed about the necessary procedures and/ or have sufficient money are more likely to be able to obtain a termination of pregnancy than a woman less well informed and/ or who does not have sufficient funds.

* People who have enough money can get an abortion on request, but what about other **women**?

* I do not believe that **women** ought to have to go through a series of legal and medical gymnastics in order to obtain something that they have chosen to obtain.

* The critical issue defined by the California Supreme Court was whether the state had any legitimate interest in the regulation of abortion which would justify so deep an infringement of the fundamental rights of **women**.

* Again people who have 50,000 units, such as **women**'s dresses, skirts, blouses and shirts, are in the situation, with a $3 rental on their particular quota, of having in the vicinity of $300,000 at the end of one year.

* Some six million units will flood this country, particularly **women**'s blouses, **women**'s shirts, dresses and skirts.

* As honourable members will be aware, the war service homes scheme was originally introduced as a repatriative measure to provide homes for returned men and **women** from the 1914-18 War.

* Also included in this bracket are a large number of married **women**.

* These **women** have had jobs and should be entitled to have jobs.

* But I do not suggest, and I do not think it can be suggested, that overall these **women** are the breadwinners of Australia.

* Th':se are things that the people of Australia should be thinking about at present 
Finally,  I  should like to express the Government's respect and admiration of the work of the voluntary organisations in the pre-school field, There is a tradition throughout Australia of community involvement in this area of education, not only of parents interested in having a kindergarten available for their own children but also of many men and **women** giving freely time and money so that kindergartens are available in areas where need is great.

* These people- men and **women**, young and old- were not callously used as ammunition to try to smash the trade union movement.

* After all, how can you whip up the men and **women** unable to obtain work to accept work at lower rates of pay, then work extra hours at ordinary rates of pay?

* In December, the largest groups of unemployed men were unskilled or semi-skilled, while the largest group of unemployed **women** were accustomed to or were seeking clerical and administrative work.

* The report of the Working Party on Homeless Men and Women was received too late for inclusion in Budgetary considerations for the current financial year.

* Further evidence in the report from the WHO Expert Committee on Smoking Control Project refers to surveys and research carried out in relation to **women** who smoke.

* For example, between 1958 and 1971, the death rate of **women** aged between 35 and 44 years increased by one-third.

* During this period, cigarette consumption by **women** in the United Kingdom increased by 35 per cent.

* A large prospective study of 46,000 **women** of child bearing age showed a death rate from circulatory diseases among those who used oral contraceptives S times greater than those who did not.

* In a paper presented to the Fourth World Conference on Smoking and Health by  Dr John  Donovan, Senior Adviser in Epidemiology in the Commonwealth Department of Health, a reference was made to the increased incidence of smoking among pregnant **women**.

* In a simple cartoon form, an accompanying message to pregnant mothers was clearly spelt out in these terms: 

 Dr Donovan points out that 33 per cent of **women** in Australia are risking the lives and development of their children by smoking during pregnancy.

* -On Saturday next we will be celebrating International Women's Day.

* It is a day set aside every year to commemorate a courageous group of **women** in the United States of America who campaigned in the streets, many years before it was accepted that one could campaign in the streets, for the rights of **women**.

* I thought it fitting to draw the attention of the House tonight to International Women's Day as it is particularly significant in 1975, designated International Women's Year by the United Nations and to be celebrated throughout the world as we will celebrate it here in Australia.

* International Women's Year may be boring to the Australian Country Party but it will not bore most of the people who are taking part in it.

* People are ready for change and in this important year, International Women's Year, the most important single contribution of lasting value that we can make is to try to broaden the minds of those who have closed their minds to change.

* It could be a tribute to International Women's Year that we took the year to help in changing entrenched attitudes of some people within our community, that we took the year to broaden the minds of those who have closed their minds to change, of those who cling to old prejudices, old accepted attitudes, old accepted roles.

* International Women's Year should be a year when we accelerate change, a year to look back on, a year of commencement and a year to start the long revolution to whittle away old prejudices.

* It will even be a battle to make clear that it is fundamentally a people's battle and not just a battle for **women**'s rights, but a struggle to proclaim that every section of society, all men, **women** and children born and unborn will benefit from sweeping changes in attitudes to **women**'s rights.

* International Women's Year will not mean a thing if it consists only of meetings, seminars, conferences and celebrations dotted around the country completely unrelated and completely finished when the lights go out and everyone goes home after a successful function.

* Do not let us fall for the trap of saying that all **women**, for instance, want to carve a career for themselves or to take jobs.

* That way one simply leaves **women** with the same narrow choice but in a different area.

* We should investigate conditions leading to discrimination against **women** in education, in the work force and certainly in the credit facilities available to them.

* I am pleased to see some of the moves that this Government has made since coming into office towards eliminating the discrimination against **women** in the fields of pay and opportunity of employment.

* But these are still peripheral changes and it is the community acceptance of roles of men and **women** that has to be changed.

* As an example I point to the establishment of Halfway House in Melbourne, which has recognised the need for refuge for **women** and children forced to leave their homes.

* As well, I would cite the inquiries being carried out by the rape committee and the excellent counselling and referral work done by the Women's Health Collective at Collingwood.

* If International Women's Year raises **women**'s consciousness into working towards equality, development and peace this year will be a vanguard for a new way of life.

* In this year let there be concentration on statistical evidence so that sociologists may evaluate the areas where **women** most need help.

* I have a real fear that lip service could be paramount this year and that many will parade their involvement in International Women's Year recognising that there is some political benefit in doing so.

* Women cannot isolate themselves and their problems.

* We cannot survive as people and we cannot proudly claim success in the campaign to remove discrimination against **women** unless we remember too all other groups similarly disadvantaged.

* There are all too many people, both men and **women**, who are still unaware of their vital responsibility to other people- people whose right to eat, breathe clean air, have shelter and freedom of choice and a future for their children is as valid as yours and mine.

* Peace should have a place in International Women's Year.

* To achieve peace in our time may be a gigantic task, but this year it is hoped that men and **women** will join forces against repression and work towards the liberation of all oppressed groups throughout the world.

* If International Women's Year leads the way democratically, shaking us a" UP and prodding those who resist change, to lay the guidelines for dialogue for other needy areas both locally and internationally, it will be worthwhile.

* To **women** I say: Retain a sense of humour, you will certainly need it.

* Perhaps this message should go to men and **women**.

* There must be a constant, continual challenge to the conservative institutions and the reactionary factions which hinder the progress of so many human beings in this International Women's Year.

* I heard him say that  Mr Allen,  the Regional Director, and 2 other members of the staff said that they explained to me the full circumstances of what the **women** did.

* 1 do not know what the term full circumstances' means, but I say without fear of contradiction that no-one referred to anything that the **women** did when I was in  Mr Allen's  office - not  Mr Allen  nor any of the other members of his staff.

* At no stage did he ever suggest that the **women** had been responsible for any offensive or insulting behaviour.

* Indeed, I asked him whether he had any complaints to make about the **women** and he said: 'No.'

* But that was the only reference which he made to the **women**.

* In respect of other inquiries I have made, I find that the only time when any of these **women** were on the floor is when they were being dragged out or lifted out of the Department of Labour and National Service into the hallway where they could be arrested legally.

* I think an interesting development the other day was the emergence of the Aboriginal **women** here in Canberra.

* In my comments I do not intend to demean the sentiments contained in  Senator Gair's  motion by indulging in political dogmas and so attempting to obtain some cheap political advantage out of what is a sincerely expressed tribute to the men and **women** of our fighting forces for their efforts in Vietnam.

* As Minister for Repatriation I have the ministerial responsibility for the Department which over the last SO years has administered the legislation covering the whole spectrum of the entitlements, including medical treatment, of ex-servicemen and **women** who have served Australia in various conflicts.

* I appreciate being able to join with others in paying a tribute to the men and **women** of our armed Services who have fought in Vietnam.

* Without wishing to be offensive to anyone, I suggest that the Bill in its present form is pretty much a playboy's Bill and does not pay much concern at all to the welfare of **women**.

* Today I received a letter from a **women**'s group urging me to support the Bill in its present form but, on the question of maintenance, urging me to consider an amendment to the Social Services Act to dispense with the 6 weeks waiting period for social services in the event that a husband turfs his wife out of their house.

* It is not espousing the interests of **women** today to say of a conscientious woman who is trying to preserve a marriage and is doing the right thing by her husband and family that because her husband does not want her companionship any longer and she is forced from the house she must go to the Government and receive social services.

* It is time many of these trendy **women**'s groups had a good look at themselves.

* It is curious that in the House of Representatives, where there is only one woman member, it falls to the lot of most male members of the House to protect **women**'s rights against the wishes of many **women**'s organisations.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: this House is of opinion that a royal commission, of which the  Chairman  shall be a Supreme Court Justice and a majority of members shall be **women**, should enquire into and report within 12 months upon: 
How many abortions are performed each year in Australia and what are the characteristics of the **women** who are aborted and the circumstances in which abortions occur.

* What are the consequences of abortion for **women** who are aborted, practitioners performing abortion procedures, police enforcing the laws on abortion and the community as a whole.

* What are the courses open to **women** who carry through unwanted pregnancies and what are the consequences of each course for the mother and for the child.

* Available information about contraception, abortion and the risks of abortion, to which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition made very proper reference, and about alternatives to abortion is unfamiliar to the **women** upon whom ignorance can impose such heavy penalties.

* It is only by supporting this amendment that honourable members can be true to themselves, to the electorates they represent in this House and in particular to the **women** in those electorates who will bear the burden of whatever decision is reached in this place.

* I  have said that experts estimate up to 120,000 **women** are aborted each year in Australia.

* Seventy-seven per cent of all the **women** who were aborted in South Australia in 1971 had not used any form of contraception on the occasion on which they became pregnant, and 90 per cent of the **women** under 20 years of age - a good deal of attention has been focused on them - had not used any form of conception on the occasion on which they became pregnant.

* As the Leader of the Australian Country Party said, there is an appalling irresponsibility involved on the part not only of the **women** concerned but also of the community to which they belong.

* The 'Medical Journal of Australia' - and I will quote frequently from this publication because it has gone into the matter in some depth over a number of issues - pointed out on 3rd February: 
Is it any wonder that in these circumstances the proportion of **women** seeking abortions in South Australia who were under 20 years of age increased between 1970 and 1971 from 20 per cent to 30 per cent?

* As Professor Wood has pointed out: 
Women, married and unmarried, religious and  irrelegious,  rich and poor, young and old, will risk death and legal penalty to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy.

* A quarter of the **women** who were aborted legally in South Australia in 1971 gave their religion as Roman Catholic, although only 20 per cent of the population of that State are members of the Catholic Church.

* One in every 3 of the **women** who applied for and were refused abortions in that State was subsequently aborted on an illegal basis.

* In Britain where abortion laws are relatively permissive and in Sweden where abortion laws are relatively strict, widespread use of family planning keeps the rate at which **women** are aborted to between 12 and 15 abortions for every 100 live births.

* We will not begin to reduce the frequency with which **women** are aborted until we establish clearly in the public mind that there is a connection between abortion and the inadequacy of arrangements under which sex education is provided in our schools; between abortion and our shortage of family planning clinics, pregnancy support agencies and adoption agencies; and between abortion and our tradition of treating as outcasts from society the unmarried mother and her child.

* Following a working party on homeless men and **women** set up in February 1973 by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party,  Mr Bill  Hayden, which reported later in the year on the feasibility of the program to assist them, legislation was foreshadowed by the then Prime Minister in the 1974 election campaign and was introduced by Bill Hayden in November 1974.

* In his second reading speech the Leader of the Opposition,  Mr Bill  Hayden, said: 
The measures proposed within the Bill are based on a compassionate understanding of the needs and very real problems of homeless men and **women** and of their alienation, their loneliness and their despair .

* According to a survey approximately one in four of the **women** in the Sydney electorate are in need of someone to look after them.

* The article reads: 
Since the Second World War all over the world and in Australia, industry and commerce has relied on an increasing rate of participation by **women** in the work force.

* Now approximately 2.2 million **women** are in the Australian work force.

* The participation rate by **women** has risen from 29 per cent in 1960 to 44 per cent in 1978.

* During this period **women** have been confronted with a deeply ingrained bias against their being allowed to compete on equal terms in the labour market.

* How often have members of this House heard the arguments in their own electorates that the current atrocious rates of unemployment are caused by married **women** occupying jobs that rightfully belong to young people, especially single females.

* This concept seems to have been deeply instilled even in the working **women** themselves, that is, that they are somehow extremely lucky to be working and that they should be grateful to society for allowing them to work.

* The result has been to make Australia's working **women** rather fearful of pushing for their legitimate rights as working contributors to our society.

* In a sense our working **women** remain second class workers.

* We need to accept that many married **women** work because their husband's wages are too low to support their family.

* Perhaps there is something to the argument of" those who say that we should pay such **women** to stay at home by increasing tax concessions for the dependent spouse of a working male.

* But even this argument ignores the genuine and pressing desire of modern **women** who find self-fulfilment in active careers outside the family unit.

* There can be natural reluctance on the part of **women** to insist upon the application of equal pay for equal work.

* There is a tendency for factory workers, especially migrant **women**, to accept without protest the extremely low wages they receive.

* Similarly, in the private sector working **women** have avoided seeking better conditions in the general labour market such as the extension of maternity leave benefits which have applied up to now in the Public Service.

* They would warn **women** that they must not be too demanding lest they price themselves out of the labour market.

* If that is so, it is a shocking indictment of Australia's attitude towards **women**.

* It states: 
The situation of young families has changed considerably since the mid-1960s, above all due to a steady rise in the numbers of gainfully employed **women**.

* The greatest relative increase in this respect has occurred among **women** with children of pre-school age.

* This seems to imply that pregnant **women** might deliberately seek to join the Public Service to enjoy 12 weeks maternity leave.

* What a poor opinion this Government has of Australia's **women**, particularly those **women** who seek to serve in Commonwealth employment.

* Perhaps these senior public servants think that **women** might seek jobs with them simply so that they can have a child on paid time at public expense.

* Since the original legislation was implemented only 2.7 per cent of **women** commencing maternity leave had less than one year's service with the Public Service; 88.8 per cent had between two and 10 years' service; and 8.3 per cent had 10 or more years' service.

* I believe that even the Australian medical profession under the circumstances would not deny those **women** their sick leave certificates which would enable them to obtain their rightful entitlement to leave.

* If the Minister looked at the statistics instead of casting aspersions on the Public Service he would see that 70 per cent of the **women** who have taken maternity leave took exactly 12 weeks paid leave.

* They are anti-female and they are in the same vein as the much vaunted Lusher motion on abortion that would use a Federal health law to deny medical benefits to **women** who have operations which are legal under the law of the State in which they live.

* It aims at **women** as well as men because both **women** and men should have equal responsibility towards their children.

* This Parliament itself provides a salient example of a major structure of society in which **women** have had a minimal involvement and therefore is seen by many **women** to represent a narrow and unsympathetic legislative authority.

* The needs of **women** in the Australian community are too important to be treated in isolation.

* They must be subject to a concerted program by the Government and which will place the needs of pregnant **women** in what must be the Government's response to the total needs of **women** everywhere in Australian society.

* Where are its attempts to implement this concerted program which will provide policies to meet the needs of pregnant **women** everywhere in Australian society?

* This Bill will be rated by the men and **women** in the Public Service as another of the 
Government's broken promises.

* There is no doubt that, in the spring of 1980, these men and **women** in the Australian Public Service will remember these attacks on their working conditions.

* I am concerned that this statement could be used by an unsympathetic Minister- for example, the previous Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who is now Minister for Finance  (Mr Eric Robinson)-  to reduce any pressure on the commercial stations in the first category to diversify programs or to provide any stimulating programs for ethnic groups, **women**, children and young people.

* On 25 November 1975 the Women's Trade Union Commission and the Queensland Women's Trade Union Committee received grants of $40,000 and $500 respectively from the International Women's Year allocation, to undertake activities which would assist **women** unionists and would work towards the elimination of discrimination against **women** in trade unions.

* The Women's Trade Union Commission has since received $22,400 for the 1977 calendar year from the Office of Child Care for a child care needs investigator: this covers salary assistance, rent and administrative expenses.

* The Queensland Women's Trade Union Committee has not as yet made a further application for financial assistance.

* The Working Women's Centre in Footscray received $39,000 in June 1976 through the Western Regional Council of the Australian Assistance Program.

* During International Women 's Year the Federal Government purchased a building in Newcastle which was leased to the Hunter Region Working Women's Group as permanent premises for the Centre.

* Grants for purchase and renovations came from the Children's Commission, the Hospital and Health Services Commission, and the International Women 's Year appropriation, totalling $ 1 36, 1 77.

* In Canberra, a **women**'s union committee has been established, but as yet has not requested financial support for a working **women** 's centre.

* In Adelaide, a working **women**'s centre has not yet been established.

* Trades and Labour Council 1WY Women's Committee received $1,500 during IWY for a working **women**'s seminar.

* As yet, no working **women**'s centre has been established and no requests have been made for further financial support 
Any future applications for working **women**'s centres will be considered for financial assistance in the light of this 
I would like to know what the Minister intends to do to see that more trade unions remove unnecessary bans against the employment of **women**.

* The policy states: 
Entrenched traditions and attitudes against equal employment opportunities for **women** in certain 0:CUpations are out of place in today's society.

* We wish to establish true equality of opportunity which involves equal opportunity for training, advancement and the abolition of wage disparities between men and **women** doing similar work.

* Ensuring that vocational guidance is given without bias between men and **women**.

* That refers to migrant groups in the community, Aboriginal groups in the community and **women**.

* We would strengthen the resources of the Department of Labor - a policy which the Minister has now adopted - to enable adequate research and advisory facilities to be established to identify obstacles to equal opportunity, especially for **women** and for migrants, and advise methods to overcome them.

* In that examination we would have as an objective the encouragement of more young men and **women** to enter appropriate trades.

* In any development of adult apprenticeship, the existing entry of young men and **women** into trades would be safeguarded.

* How does one make a judgment between a man who has lost a job, a man who wants to upgrade his skills, a **women** who has a low grade job because there has never been an opportunity for training, somebody not yet in the work force such as a single mother who wants to join the work force, if there is only one place available for people from all these different categories?

* -Is the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs aware of the reports of statements made at the Women and Politics Conference by 
Aboriginal **women** from Queensland?

* Can he say whether he intends to take any action to prevent the discriminatory practices under the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Act which those Aboriginal **women** criticised?

* applauded by those **women** in government employment wishing to reconcile domestic responsibilities with a career in the Commonwealth Service or other government instrumentalities.

* All **women** are likely to be affected.

* Does the honourable member want to know how many **women** are affected right now?

* In Great Britain the United Kingdom Civil Service has arrangements for paid leave, but of course this does not apply to privately employed **women**, as the honourable member probably knows.

* The International Labour Organisation Convention is concerned that the existence of maternity benefits should not result in discrimination against **women** in employment.

* It therefore provides that the individual employer shall not be individually liable for the cost of such benefits due to **women** employed by him.

* The Government recognises that it has a role and responsibility, as Australia's largest employer, in promoting the status of **women**.

* The Bill will also help **women** endeavouring to pursue their careers on the same terms as men.

* I conclude by reminding the House that this Bill not only provides improved conditions of employment for Australian government employees but also facilitates the retention of **women** in the work force.

* Many of these **women** are.

* -Tonight I want to speak about the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs, which deals with the problems of **women** in Australia.

* Before I deal with the actual estimates themselves, I want to say something about discrimination against **women** in this country.

* Much has been said about discrimination in recent years and many people are in favour of eliminating discrimination against **women**.

* I would like to suggest that, if we are really serious about ending discrimination against **women**, we ought to start right here in Parliament House.

* In 77 years of this Parliament only four **women**- Joan Child, Kay Brownbill, Doris Blackburn and Dame Enid Lyons- have served.

* More than 1,000 members have been elected to this place, yet we have had only four **women** members.

* Yet, countries like India, Israel and Sri Lanka which, supposedly, do not give the same status to **women** as we do, in recent years have had **women** Prime Ministers.

* I have the greatest respect for the Clerks in this Parliament-  Mr Blake, Mr Pettifer  and othersbut is it not about time that perhaps the SerjeantatArms or the Usher of the Black Rod were **women**?

* I know that there are Clerks of Houses of Parliament who are **women**.

* The **women** who do work in this House usually serve the tea in the dining room.

* Quite frankly, it is about time we did more than just pay lip service to **women**.

* Before the suspension of the sitting I was saying that this chamber is the last bastion of male chauvinism and I called upon the political parties to change their attitudes and have **women** preselected to contest the next election.

* I want to talk now about the Estimates and to point out that during the last election campaign, this Government made a commitment to equal opportunity for **women**.

* I have no illusions regarding this Government's attitude to **women**'s affairs; it was made quite clear by the downgrading of the Women's Affairs Section by its removal from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to the ragbag' Department of Home Affairs which is near the bottom of the list of ministries.

* Women particularly will suffer from higher unemployment and reduced health, education and child care services.

* The greatest problem confronting **women** at the moment- they share this problem with the community at large- is unemployment.

* The latest Commonwealth Employment Service figures show that in August there were 122,221 registered female unemployed but this does not account for the massive, hidden unemployment among **women**.

* All honourable members are aware that many **women** who were in the work force and whose husbands are working do not bother to register for work when they learn that they are not eligible for the unemployment benefit.

* Although it has been argued by the Government that there are many people who should not be registered for the unemployment benefit, there are thousands upon thousands of **women** who do not bother to register for work even though they want employment.

* Nothing has been done to overcome the factors which restrict the participation of **women** in the work force.

* There is no provision for the payment of unemployment benefits when married **women** lose their jobs.

* Worse, there has been an unfortunate, and at time bitter, conservative reaction to the move by **women** into the paid work force.

* Married **women** have taken the brunt of that attack which challenges their right to paid employment.

* **women** workers are treated like guests, lured from the kitchen stove into the economy during war and boom times, only to be cast off again when peace returns or the economy falters, as today.

* The demand for permanent part-time work as distinct from casual employment has increased considerably, especially among men and **women** with family responsibilities, single parents, people with health or domestic problems, and those wishing to update their knowledge, skills, and so on.

* In the few minutes remaining to me I draw attention to the serious problems facing **women**'s refuges.

* Refuges provide essential services for **women** and children in crisis; they are an alternative to a home situation that has become intolerable.

* The need for refuges is increasing, along with the need for rape crisis centres and **women**'s health centres.

* Does the Minister for Labour and National Service agree with those who argue that **women** are relegated to a second class role in the management and administration of commerce, industry, the arts and sciences and the government of Australia?

* What initiatives have he and his Department taken to upgrade the status of **women** in our community so that they may play a role commensurate with their intelligence, capacity and ability?

* In July 1969 the then Liberal Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Higgins  (Mr Gorton),  told a Liberal **women**'s rally in Brisbane that the means test should not be abolished and would not be abolished and that he could see no reason why it should be abolished.

* Due to the fact that the previous Government has treated these **women** as second or third class citizens and paid them at a rate of $2.75 a week less than the class A widow, the rate of $21.50 provided in this Bill will mean an actual increase to them of $4.25 a week.

* In particular it provides employment for **women**.

* Around 60 per cent of employees in hotels and restaurants are **women** compared with the approximately one-third female component of the work force as a whole.

* Coloured television sets have gone to Hong Kong; **women**'s underwear to Japan and saddles, which have been manufactured in Brisbane, to Germany and Europe.

* The Public Works Committee has generally recommended the construction of these works with the exception of proposed recreation and common room and living accommodation for 24 Women's Royal Australian Air Force personnel.

* In regard to these areas the Committee recommended that the living accomodation for the 24 Women's Royal Australian Air Force personnel be redesigned to provide a common entry/living room for each four-bedroom unit.

* The Committee also recommended that the policy for providing Women's Royal Australian Air Force recreation buildings separate from airmen's and airwomen's recreation centres be reviewed in the light of the new type of living accommodation which will be provided for the Women's Royal Australian Air Force in future.

* -I ask the Minister for Home Affairs whether he is aware of a recent Press report that the Chief of the Air Staff, when asked whether **women** would be allowed to train as pilots in the Royal Australian Air Force, stated: ' Do you want me to spend $ 1 m of your money to train a Mirage pilot who will leave in a couple of years?'

* Does this indicate Government policy towards **women**?

* Is the Minister's Department doing anything to widen understanding of the expanding opportunities for **women** in the community?

* That is a very cynical, heartless approach which has no respect whatsoever, as I said earlier, for the right of a man or a woman to work or for the dignity of men and **women**.

* That is why I say it is a thimble and pea trick which the Fraser Government played upon the ordinary family men and **women** of this country.

* I did say that there were now in the work force many more **women** than there had been some years ago and that the structure of the work force had changed completely.

* I went on to say that some jobs which normally would have been available to males were now occupied by **women** in the work force.

* I further said that **women** have a right to work, for whatever reason.

* To suggest that I blamed **women** in the work force for the loss of job opportunities for males is utterly inaccurate.

* For 23 years the Liberal-National Country parties were in government and they did nothing to provide paid maternity leave for the **women** of Australia either in the public or private sector.

* When the coalition was in opposition it was very grudging in accepting the maternity leave legislation and once it got back into government it started cutting back the small privileges won by the working men and **women** of this country.

* Government members have put themselves on record as supporting **women**'s rights, the equality of **women**, giving **women** opportunity and a decent go.

* This Bill makes a mockery of the policy statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  about his Government's commitment to complete equality of opportunity for **women**.

* When the provisions were introduced initially by the honourable member for Hindmarsh,  (Mr Clyde Cameron),  they were hailed as a significant, if long overdue, step in the right direction toward equality of opportunity for **women**.

* It means job security to **women** at a time when child rearing is occupying less time of **women**'s lives on a full-time basis and is frequently combined with careers.

* This figure has risen gradually to four **women** in 1974; 12 in 1976 and 19 in 1978, representing 1.51 per cent of the Division.

* We have all complained about the fact that **women** do not have a decent go in the work force, that not enough of them reach top management.

* Gradually the number of **women** in the higher positions is rising, albeit very slowly.

* Women employees represent an investment to the Public Service in terms of skills and training.

* 1 than it is when we are thinking about the **women** in the Public Service.

* It is particularly important at a time when there is a changing malefemale relationship, in which young men and **women** are working out different attitudes than those that prevailed in the past about their role vis-a-vis the home and vis-a-vis the work place.

* By abolishing paternity leave the Government does nothing to assist the new relationships that young men and **women** are working out.

* This fact was brought to light by statistics provided in 1977 by the Australian Government Joint Council following a survey of **women** returning to work after maternity leave.

* For example, it has been alleged that many pregnant **women** join the Public Service just to receive maternity benefits.

* In regard to the criticism that only- I emphasise the word 'only'- 50 per cent of **women** return to work after maternity leave, the fact is that a return rate of 50 per cent is much higher than might be expected from the normal work force participation pattern of **women** responsible for children.

* Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that only 30 per cent of Australian **women** who are responsible for children aged 0 to five years in fact work.

* Thus it would seem that provision for a woman to return to her previous job at the same salary and seniority level, with accrued entitlements, for example long service leave and superannuation, has given some **women** a choice of returning to the paid work force or not.

* The aim of such leave is not to force back into the work force those **women** who want, and can afford, to stay at home to care for young children.

* It is to protect the jobs and career entitlements of the 50 per cent of **women** who choose, whether from economic necessity or reasons related to personal fulfilment, to return to their jobs.

* In other words, it seeks to ensure that **women** who interrupt their careers to have children will not be unduly disadvantaged.

* It is also likely that many **women** are prevented from returning to work because of inadequate child care facilities, lack of part-time work, restriction of the period of unpaid leave, or a combination of those factors.

* Instead of withdrawing provisions which certainly were not generous when compared with those operating in other countries, the Government should be facilitating the establishment of maternity and paternity leave provisions in the private sector; providing adequate child care facilities instead of reversing advances made by the Labor Government in this area; exploring ways of providing adequate permanent part-time work for government employees with young families, and encouraging the private sector to follow suit; and, finally, investigating the effects of making provision for easier re-entry or retention of career rights for **women** who stay out of the work force longer to look after children.

* We are sick and tired of this Government's unspoken policy of kicking public servants and **women**, to mention just two categories.

* Are married **women** to be discharged from the Citizen's Military Forces.

* Are **women** members of the CMF to be denied re-enlistment.

* I think the proposed amendment is a useless platitude to offer the **women** of Australia.
