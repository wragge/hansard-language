## Contexts in which the word "welfare" was used in the hofreps during the 1970s

* If the Leader of the Opposition saves only 1 life by his actions, he will have made a magnificent contribution to the **welfare** of this country.

* The in-depth evaluation of these sites which will involve also a study of offshore and inland concepts, will then go forward embracing, of course, all the technical needs of a new airport, the economic implication of the investment of money and resources needed, the implications in respect of the natural, cultural and social environments, and not least of all, the implications which this very large investment will have for the future development of Australia's largest city and the **welfare** of its citizens.

* Also, the Australian Council of Churches and hosts of other **welfare** organisations have drawn the attention of the Government to the inadequacies of these amounts.

* The Commonwealth has the luxury .of being able to choose freely what it can and cannot do in respect of ' what are essential projects, looked at on a national scale, but the States find increasingly that their revenues, both ordinary and loan funds, are taken up more and more in providing essential services like education, health, upkeep of roads, public transport, social **welfare** and so forth.

* In these days it has become more important than ever for there to be both public involvement - certainly significant public involvement - and private involvement in this area of **welfare**.

* Is is non-violent to deny a human being the right to vote, the right to free choice of employment or the rights to equal wages, equal justice, education, health and social **welfare**, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, equal participation in cultural activities, freedom to choose his own spouse, the right to strike, freedom of movement, of religion, of political views, and the hundred other rights enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights?

* On the face of it and on the face of the criteria which are proposed, there clearly would have been no justification for assistance, except perhaps **welfare** assistance and vast reconstruction and dismantling of the industry.

* This is illogical because a scheme of this nature is primarily a **welfare** measure.

* In any case for the future health and **welfare** of this community in terms of its intellectual and emotional development it is vital that we should develop this new form of communication.

* When the merger takes place - it will not happen next week, of course, but it will happen as quickly as possible because there is a need to take into account the **welfare** of the employees - it is likely that the amalgamated department will be called the Department of Construction and Housing.

* But in my view the Government has to adopt a basic position, and that is to ensure, firstly, that the system provides drugs essential to life and the **welfare** of every person regardless of his financial position, secondly, that pharmaceutical items are of the highest quality- I am sure that the Department of Health has done a tremendous job in that area- thirdly, that they are available at a reasonable price- nobody can claim that the Department of Health has not done a good job in that area- and, fourthly, there is also the necessity for the maintenance of a viable pharmaceutical manufacturing industry which has sufficient resources to carry out research and to keep pace with the needs of the community.

* this and because child **welfare** is something which requires more individual application than the granting of the adult invalid pension it is reasonable to consider that this is primarily a State function.

* In the long run, if we removed these barriers- physical, social and economic- that exist, perhaps we would have far less need to have defence expenditure as the biggest item in our Budget after social **welfare** expenditure.

* Value in terms of potentially improved **welfare** services, improved education and improved environmental conditions will be lost and will never be achieved again no matter how much the performance of the economy is improved in subsequent years.

* The Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** tabled a report on 5th May 1971 - nearly 12 months ago - in which it indicated the needs of the schools catering for the handicapped.

* He simply said that there were 36 social workers and **welfare** officers employed by the Department whose services were available to all members of the community.

* He is much better at chasing Corns on this issue, I would imagine, than he is at administering social **welfare**.

* - Let me state briefly lo the Committee that the plight of the pensioners, of the sick and the needy, is to be dealt with by what is termed social **welfare**.

* For the sake of the **welfare** of Australia, this Government has no right to place itself at electoral risk.

* What a magnificent contribution that is to the **welfare** of Australia.

* It is the government's job to control these developments and to direct them towards the social **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* Among the numerous advances in the field of health care and social **welfare** provided for is the amount of $7,675,000 in grants for the school dental scheme in 1973-74.

* Discussion with any of the non-government **welfare** agencies confirms that it is single parents supporting children who are most deeply in poverty in Australia at present.

* Results of such decisions will deviate more and more from true human **welfare**.

* The committee of the parliamentary Labor Party in September 1972- again before the Labor Party was in government- made certain proposals on schools commissions, for which we had agitated for some years, to provide equality of opportunity, to investigate inequalities, to recommend programs, to advise the Government, to be the organ of intelligence and insight, to sponsor and conduct research into all aspects of education, and indeed into all aspects of child care and **welfare**, including the economic, mental and moral well being of children, to sponsor experimental schools and programs, to educate teachers, assist student teachers, foster in-service and continuing education, to consult pre-school authorities, town planners, pediatricians, child psychiatrists, to provide for child minding and pre-school centres and so on.

* Any suggestions to that effect from the gallant  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  or the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Hughes, would be slightly unfair and perhaps reveal that they are not as informed on the matter of the **welfare** of the ex-servicemen of this country as they might well be.

* Those reservations principally relate to the **welfare** of officers who will be transferred out of the Commonwealth Public Service into the Northern Territory Public Service.

* In New Zealand any contribution that is made towards the **welfare** of children at school, thus saving the Government money, is an allowable deduction.

* Furthermore, many of the specific purpose grants in relation to **welfare** merely made the States the disbursing agents for areas of activity in which the States have long had an interest, or which resulted from State requests.

* I would prefer to save my remarks on the future of Aboriginal **welfare** until that later debate.

* Already these things are becoming apparent and they are a warning to the rest of the medical people and the patients in this nation that Labor is determined to upset the present scheme, with all the efficiency that is built into it and the proper care and concern given by doctors for the **welfare** of their patients.

* I am requesting that this Government appoint a joint CommonwealthState Committee to ensure we are fully qualified and informed so that eventually we will be able to set up this industry which today I can visualise as being of vital necessity to the **welfare** of this nation.

* We have the situation that the Housing Department, the Department responsible for **welfare** housing in our State, had to spend $4m in the last month of the financial year.

* Australia has one of the highest nursing home bed to population ratios in the world and the domiciliary nursing care program is probably one of the best social **welfare** initiatives that the Government is pursuing to try to deinstitutionalise the care of aged people.

* The honourable member quoted at great length from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** which investigated the Repatriation Act, in particular the provisions of the Repatriation Act relating to the payment of pensions.

* Less will have to be spent on education and more on the social **welfare** system.

* This legislation is directed at those unscrupulous operators and not at their victims who are being actively assisted by government programs in health, education and **welfare**.

* This is another example of the Government's concern for the most seriously disabled TPI and intermediate rate pensioners and its concern for the widows of deceased ex-servicemen as well as its interest in the **welfare** of that small and very wonderful band of women who served overseas as nurses during World War I.

* Let us turn for a moment from **welfare** policies to industrial planning policy.

* Certainly the $70m-odd could be well used in social **welfare** payments because the needs are great, but the concept does not bear close study.

* I hope that with this most generous increase in subsidy the **welfare** of tenants is safeguarded.

* If the Government is fair dinkum in its expressed concern for the **welfare** of these exservice pensioners it would have that joint committee on the job now.

* This expression of deep concern by the Minister for the **welfare** of employers is intriguing to hear and must be gratifying to the employers in Australia.

* That is an important initiative which has been welcomed by those who have a genuine interest in the **welfare** of Tasmania.

* It is very important for the social **welfare** and benefit of those people.

* New fields have been opened up, whether they be in the provision of **welfare**, social services or paramedical services, or in the field of recreation.

* We have the responsibility for exports and an overriding responsibility for the social **welfare** of Australia.

* What a heartless, callous attitude by a party which professes to be concerned about people's **welfare**.

* Local government undertakes an impressive range of activities in the fields of social **welfare** and cultural activity.

* As the Professor points out, the Committee believes that the membership of the Advisory Council should consist of an independent  Chairman,  the Statistician, 2 members of the Statisticians Conference- the body of all the  Deputy  Statisticians in Australia- a member appointed from within local government, 3 members from industry, commerce and finance, 3 members from employee unions, associations or councils, a member from a primary producing section of society, a member appointed from organised consumer interests, a member appointed from non-official social **welfare** organisations, somebody with statistical knowledge from within civil liberties organisations, somebody with a capacity for research in economic and social sciences, and another member with knowledge in research on communications, sciences and technologies.

* I repeat: Which proposition would the electorate choose: Selling $4 billion of Australian assets or printing $ 1,700m in order to make sure that the economy is maintained at a reasonably productive level in order to ensure that the facilities so long denied education, child **welfare**- one can go on- are supplied to the community?

* If we can bring these people under notice very early and not put them away behind bars in prisons but restore them to the work force, under surveillance, with the necessary support from **welfare** societies and educationalists, it would save an enormous amount of money and a lot of human material.

* The fact that the Australian community is now barely reproducing itself must recommend an effective immigration policy and program to all persons who genuinely have the future **welfare** of this nation in mind.

* What sums were paid by the Commonwealth in grants in the Electoral Divisions of (I) the Northern Territory, (2) Canberra, (3) Kalgoorlie, (4) Perth, (5) Swan, (6) Sturt, (7) Kingston, (8) Ballarat, (9) Bendigo, (10) Deakin, (II) McMillan, (12) Isaacs, (13) Henty, (14) Holt, (15) La Trobe, ( 16) Hotham, ( 17) Bass, ( 18) Franklin, ( 19) Braddon, (20) Wilmot (21) Denison, (22) Wide Bay, (23) Herbert, (24) Fadden, (25) Dawson, (26) Lilley, (27) Bowman, (28) Brisbane, (29) Leichhardt, (30) Calare, (31) Eden Monaro, (32) Cook, (33) Lowe, (34) Barton, (35) Macquarie, (36) St George, (37) Phillip and (38) Macarthur under the (a) Child Care Act and children's services program, (b) Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, (c) Aged Persons Hostels Act, (d) Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, (e) Homeless Persons Assistance Act, (0 State Grants (Home Care) Act, (g) delivered meals program, (h) **welfare** rights program, (j) personal care subsidy scheme and (k) Australian Assistance Plan during (i) 1975-76, (ii) 1976-77, (iii) 1977-78, (iv) 1978-79 and (v) 1 July 1979 to date.

* I have seen a number of reports of a scheme such as that which has been outlined by the right honourable member for Fisher and I must say that from looking at this scheme it is quite clearly an economic and social abomination because it offends against every decent **welfare** principle appropriate to home ownership and housing that has been operative in Australia for many decades.

* But what is the good of magnificent hospitals, schools, universities and **welfare** programs if we are at war and have nothing with which to fight that war?

* They know full well that the philosophy of this Government is founded on a floor of **welfare** and that our every effort is towards guaranteeing them the right to a living income that has regard to the cost of living.

* As honourable gentlemen will be aware, the States can spend those funds as they wish to increase their Public Service or to provide additional funds for **welfare** housing, sewerage or for whatever purpose they like.

* We have the situation now - I am not saying that it is wrong - that the wife of an employee aged over 60 years who is dragging in $100 a week becomes entitled to a form of social **welfare** pension.

* They are the very simple things to which aged people who are the recipients of these programs and whose **welfare** will be affected by the implementation of this clause can relate and they are the things they cannot understand.

* I put it to the Committee- 
In contrast we have seen the present Government produce policies which have almost a complete disregard for the **welfare** of the people in northern Australia.

* In conclusion I would just make a plea for the social **welfare** of these people.

* That just shows the deplorable ignorance of the Minister for Social **Welfare** of the procedures now available, yet he aspires to the Treasury portfolio.

* It includes general medical practice and aspects of geriatric and rehabilitation services, counselling programs concerned with drugs, alcohol and family **welfare**, community mental health and maternal and child health services, again outside of hospitals.

* It is almost as much as total government spending on **welfare**.

* I am reliably informed that the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  the only man in the Government ranks who really understands the issue of health insurance and health services, has washed his hands of any association with debate on **welfare** and health because of the unfortunate experiences he has had at the rather ruthless hands of the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser).

* The Cocos (Keeling) Islands will obtain revenue from these operations, primarily from philatelic sales, and the revenue so derived will be retained on the islands for the **welfare** of the inhabitants.

* The appropriations for the child care program do not appear in the Budget Speech under 'Education' but under the functional classification of Social Security and **Welfare**'.

* Nor should I have to spell out again that a referendum in 1967 overwhelmingly gave the Commonwealth the responsibility of ensuring the **welfare** and rights of Aboriginal Australians by giving it power to make laws concerning those rights- a responsibility which this Governnent continues to evade, with the excuse that the States also retain such legislative powers.

* It will be recollected that when an Act was passed in this House last year which has enabled interest rates on **welfare** housing, even in their own State of New South Wales, to come down to levels such as Si per cent and 5) per cent they voted against such proposals.

* We have seen too the splendid endeavours by many organisations and service clubs to make a contribution to their **welfare**.

* Expenditure from the National **Welfare** Fund has amounted to $107,827,000.

* I submit that the methods we have before us, whilst they go part of the way, will not relieve this situation that resulted from the Government's own actions, which were designed to bring to fruition in the Treasurer's words the Government's aims in the field of **welfare** housing- that is, by stifling private building in Australia.

* Senator Baume,  the  chairman  of the Government supporters **welfare** committee, or whatever it is called, gave an assurance that none of the Government senators would cross the floor.

* There was less spent on health, social security and **welfare** in real terms.

* I say  to the  Minister in all seriousness that one of the sources of major concern in Australia today is the **welfare** and the improvement of the lot of the Aborigine.

* Are they concerned about the **welfare** of the workers or are they engaged in a political confrontation with the Federal Government?

* Admittedly, most of them will not be much worse off but there has not been an increase in their **welfare**.

* If he were to appreciate that in the view, of the Opposition in this Parliament there is no substantial threat to the **welfare**, survival and development of Australia it might be easier for him to understand Labor's position.

* I believe the Department of Immigration is aware of these problems and by the provision of migrant educational services, social workers, **welfare** officers, trained contact workers, together with a host of voluntary workers, it does much to reduce the problems of migrants in this country.

* Those organisations are the Central Council of Croatian Associations in Australia, the Italian **Welfare** Centre Co. As.

* It does not matter whether this Government is concerned with the **welfare** of primary industry or not, it should have the courtesy to reply to a telegram sent to one of its Ministers.

* A far better method of increasing individual participation in the community would be via the Labor Government's community **welfare** centre program- the Australian Assistance Plan.

* By a vote of 197 to 163 the conference also decided to repudiate its Premier  Mr Hamer,  the  Deputy  Premier,  Mr Thompson,  the Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Dixon,  and call for the restoration of the death penalty.

* Even with adjustment assistance, the Government has laid down such stringent criteria that it will be virtually impossible for any industry, except the fruit industry, to qualify and that is virtually a once only **welfare** payment.

* and the Government - this is what the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  and others were speaking about - never considered the interests and **welfare** of the people generally.

* Honourable members in this Parliament have been entrusted to look after the **welfare** of the people of this nation.

* His  motion provides no machinery and no intent for a really comprehensive inquiry into social, economic, medical and social **welfare** problems of families.

* We did not give those concessions to the industry because we liked the insurance companies; we gave them because we wanted to encourage saving and to encourage people to make provision for their own cover and for their own protection in order to relieve the Government of the need to make available some of the **welfare** provisions it would otherwise have to make available and to assist in the raising of loan funds for government, commerce and industry.

* This allowance is not taxable and is designed to assist with the education, training and general **welfare** of all handicapped children.

* When on 7 August the Queensland Cabinet made critical decisions to the effect that local government functions in the two communities should be funded through the Department of Local Government, that health functions should be funded and be the responsibility of the Department of Health, that education likewise should be the responsibility of the Department of Education and that **welfare** should be the responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, it appeared that at last these difficulties had been overcome.

* In the past it has relied on gaining the consent of the people through the use of a range of **welfare** services, the education system, the media, the churches, the arbitration system, the law and the Parliament.

* It is an unusual government instrumentality because it handles such diverse matters as local transport, garbage, housing, kerbing and guttering, nature paths, adoption of children, **welfare**, agricultural services, animal and bird protection, architects' registration, boiler inspection, bush fire control, the Canberra Tourist Bureau, registration of dogs, civil defence, drivers' licences, electoral offices, forest management, fruit inspection, registration of hawkers, lake administration, meteorology, testing and registration of motor vehicles, the News and Information Bureau, the police, scaffolding and lifts, street cleaning, the War Memorial, weights and measures, and workers compensation.

* We increased government spending by about 3 per cent to accommodate more people and in addition we greatly extended the social **welfare** programs, including pensions, education and so on.

* Indonesia is having to face up to problems of making genuine improvement in the **welfare** of the vast island country's huge and fast growing population- some 123 million people.

* The Minister's method was to combine in one Bill these measures related to voluntary health insurance with certain **welfare** measures which have a strong emotive content, including provisions for benefits for handicapped children and for the sufferers of kidney disease.

* Thirdly, the Leader of the Opposition claims that the Budget produced no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* As we know selfless generosity of individuals and **welfare** organisations all over Australia was overwhelming.

* We may some day reach the stage in Australia- we are certainly not there yet- when we have all the schools, hospitals and **welfare** institutions we want.

* By a large majority in the 1967 referendum the Australian people gave power to the Commonwealth to legislate for the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* Throughout the 1972 election campaign and again in  His Excellency  the GovernorGeneral's address at the opening of this Parliament the present Government has strongly emphasised the needs of social **welfare**, and in this field possibly one of the greatest needs .s the need to provide adequate care for aged people.

* The expenditure for this year for Aboriginal advancement is: Education, $4,600,000; health $9,il 34,000; social security and **welfare**, $3,230,000; housing and amenities, $14,786,000 - a total of $31,750,000.

* It proposes to cut **welfare** and education expenditure; it would encourage Australia to be involved in another war in South-East Asia; and it would destroy national government by referring national responsibilities to the States.

* It is probably true, as the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** said recently, that it is not just limited to narcotics and amphetamines.

* Last week in this House the Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare** matters questioned the accuracy of a reference in the White Paper on our health insurance program.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission's report in August 1975 adopted certain approaches.

* The greatest difficulty that the industry could face would be if it were under a government the great majority of whose members lived in the metropolitan areas and had no sympathy for or interest in the **welfare** of wool growers.

* As I said earlier, honourable members on both sides of the House have had quite numerous representations made to them recently by local governing authorities suggesting that payments should be made directly from the Commonwealth to the local authorities to assist them in such works as the abatement of rates to people in receipt of age pen sions, the provision of certain social **welfare** services such as child minding centres and baby health centres, and the various kinds of relief work that local authorities are called upon to perform in the nature of social services but for which no direct payment is made to the local authorities and which has to be met out of their rates.

* It found that of all levels of government, local government was least able to hit back so it thrust upon local government all sorts of social and **welfare** services, things for which local government is geared neither to administer nor to provide in terms of finance.

* action  of  those people and their disregard for the **welfare** of the people in that area.

* The greatest decreases in interest rates on housing have occurred with respect to **welfare** housing in the three fields of housing under the responsibility of State authorities, both for rental and for purchase, and housing which is financed through the home builders account of the cooperative terminating societies.

* I hope that when legislation in respect of social **welfare** benefits is before this Parliament the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  will remind his colleagues that those who can well afford to put up with the hardship of living on the salaries that they receive today are being granted huge increases which are to be backdated.

* Job vacancies filled by migrant workers with little regard for vocational qualifications, language disabilities, housing and accommodation, **welfare** provisions and adequate eduational facilities for their families, is to create such additional problems as would far outweigh the temporary stopgap policy of manning the assembly lines and filling the less-popular and often lower income vacancies available.

* <para pgwide="yes">What is the (a) membership, (b) time-table and (c) charter of each of the following interdepartmental committees : (i) Arrangements for provisions of advice on ionising radiation, (ii) Assistance to Industries, (iii) Australian Government Office Space, (iv) Australian Investment Overseas, (v) Australian Participation in NASA Post-Apollo Program, (vi) Australian Trade with Developing Countries, (vii) Brussels Definition of Value for Duty and GATT Anti-Dumping Code, (viii) Consideration of First Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, (ix) Environmental Impact Studies, (x) Freedom of Information Legislation, (xi) GATT Trade Negotiations, (xii) Human Rights, (xiii) Metric Conversion Co-ordination, (xiv) Motor Vehicle Industry, (xv) National Archives Legislation (xvi) National Housing Policy, (xvii) Revaluation Adjustment Assistance for Rural Industries, (xviii) Shipbuilding Industry, (xix) Social Indicators - (Social **Welfare**), (xx) Soil Conservation, (xxi) Structural Adjustment - (Tariff), (xxii) The Production of Educational Publications, (xxiii) Unified Aid Administration, (xxiv) Urban and Regional Development, (xxv) Urban Transport and (xxvi) Purari River Project.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission's report on the matter will be tabled in due course and we would expect a good deal of public discussion thereafter.

* This in turn provides a major component of government revenue so that government can provide services in the areas of education, health and **welfare** and the other multitude of services that a government is expected to provide.

* It can deal with matters relating to housing, health, sewerage, water supply, electricity supply, communications, educational training, relief work for unemployed persons, roads and associated works, garbage collection and disposal, and **welfare** and community amenities.

* All parties should be concerned about the future health and **welfare** of our people.

* Yet when it comes to the opportunity to show the Asian people and the world that we as a country in the Asian region really care about the **welfare** of Asians, we can squeeze out but $5.

* If inflation hits people receiving **welfare** payments, the Government says: 'Increase those payments but do nothing about the basic rate of inflation which erodes those same payments and makes them worth less than the lesser amount a year or two earlier'.

* Every time we give massive increases in pensions and benefits under Medibank and other social **welfare** programswhich it is our bounden duty to do- we are in fact depriving ourselves of the capacity to help underdeveloped nations.

* The broad objective of the dairy research scheme is to raise productivity and improve and advance the **welfare** of the industry.

* So far 1 have been speaking about the patient with whose **welfare** the Government states it is primarily concerned as a taxpayer, but the patient is also a contributor to insurance and as such he must pay an additional $24m.

* If this is the Government's view - a government that proclaims an interest for people and their **welfare** - then its policy and approach to the problems of the people that I have talked about this morning are bankrupt.

* I want to raise a matter before the House concerning a voluntary group carrying out effective social **welfare** work in my electorate which has been thwarted in its progress by the inability of 2 government departments to decide on a definition.

* If we look at the amount of money provided to a man with 2 children- the figures have been frequently quoted by various people in this place- and at the amount of money which it is claimed by various people in this place is the cost of protection, we find that it is far more expensive to pay a person unemployment benefit, service his family with the $7.50 allowance per child, and supply the free services which are provided under the social **welfare** program than it is to have a protected industry.

* I remind the Government and the honourable members here that whatever criticism they may like to make of resource allocation in this country - the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  talks of resource allocation with great frequency - and whatever new policies they think ought to be implemented, the wealth of this country today that they have to use to implement their **welfare** and other policies was created under the climate of Liberal-Country Party governments which were in power, as the House knows, for many years.

* All reports which the Government has commissioned have been tabled; for example, the Coombs Task Force report; the Priorities Review Committee report; the Green and White Papers on Health Insurance; the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission - First Report; the Protection Commission Inquiry; a report from the Social **Welfare** Commission concerning Aged Person's Housing; the First Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Land Tenures; the Re-organisation of the Defence Group of Departments; the Care and Education of Young Children - a report of the Australian Pre-schools Committee; report of the Advisory Committee on CES Employment Statistics, and many others.

* But because we are accustomed to the subdued attitude of the population we become alarmed when people express their displeasure at our ineptitude in foreign policy or social **welfare** programmes or salary provisions.

* Whilst we are aware of the fact that the trade union control within the Department is very profound and very significant, whilst we are aware of the fact that that great Department is absolutely vital to the economy and to the **welfare** of the Australian nation, and whilst we are absolutely sure that we know that this great Department can be strangled by industrial action, we must admit that over these next 9 months the most likely scene in Australia will be that of further disruption and further effects of the inflationary process upon the Postmaster-General's Department.

* They could be described as the rejects of a **welfare** system supposedly set up to care for them.

* ; of others and of meeting the requirements of morality, public order and the general **welfare** in a democratic society.

* The honourable member's accusation that the Government is not interested in the **welfare** of the workers at Evans Deakin shipyard is typical of the accusations he made during the last Parliament but, of course, then he was criticising his own Government.

* Other information required is the source of the water supply, the place of residence one year ago in addition to the place of residence 5 years ago, whether the person has been away on a holiday for one week or more in the last year, the languages he uses, the range of his weekly or annual income, the effect of any physical handicap, the age at which he left school, the means by which his child is regularly minded during the day, whether he is a member of any retirement or benefits scheme or the recipient of any social **welfare** benefits, whether he is covered by a life insurance policy, whether he is licensed to drive a motor vehicle or motor cycle, and the method of travel to work.

* I draw the attention of the House to these figures to indicate the enormity of the burden of the cost of social **welfare** to the community.

* That is based on clear statements made by men engaged in **welfare** services in this country.

* That sector is producing quality of life things such as education, information, health and **welfare** services and so on.

* To use the term 'primary' is to misunderstand Australia's national objectives, its future path and the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* It is typical of the ruthless approach of this Government and its disregard for the **welfare** of the small individual of whom it so often talks so glibly.

* Will members of the Opposition never learn that they are here in this place not as an official Opposition to the Governor-General but as duly elected representatives of the people, to make some significant contribution to their **welfare** and prosperity?

* The economy cannot recover only by the stripping down of funds provided by Government for basic services such as transport, sewerage and **welfare** housing.

* I think that when the investigation is carried out it will be found that the health situation of the child and the actual feelings of the parents for the child at the time were discussed between the foster parents and the **Welfare** Branch as it then was, of the Northern Territory Administration.

* This Government has always held the view that the administration of social **welfare** schemes has been too fragmented and that their operation should be controlled by the one department.

* It will link all levels of government with local communities in the provision of a greater range of **welfare** services.

* At the same time we have maintained an overall program of social **welfare**.

* We are all in this chamber because we are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of our State.

* It will have to get a handout- a food parcel- from the **welfare** agency in the State in which its members live.

* I would recognise, although I do not agree with the Australian presence in South Vietnam, that our forces over there have carried out their duties in the best traditions of the Australian armed forces and I believe very sincerely that they have endeavoured to make a contribution to the **welfare** of those people in the province for which they have had a measure of responsibility.

* It affects the living standards, the savings and the **welfare** of Australians everywhere and the fact that the Government will not allow a vote on this issue is something about which the people should be enlightened.

* In my view, the Treasurer in the Budget presented on the Tuesday before last introduced the most wide ranging and humanitarian series of policy changes relating to social **welfare** for the removal of poverty, assistance in nursing homes and similar matters that I can remember for many years.

* He has not been prepared to show that he is concerned for the **welfare** of these people.

* Obviously, a significant number of people in Australia today live on **welfare** payments rather than choose to work.

* He gave no direct answer to that very great problem which confronts a large number of the elderly sick in our community, and the families who have a concern for their **welfare**.

* Its attitude on this occasion indicates that its words have had but a hollow ring, that me quality of life as judged by the Labor Party is something that is measured more by the capacity of a particular area to produce votes and win seats in this House than by a concern for the **welfare** of the people of that area.

* The problems facing my constituents are common throughout Australia: The care and attention of the aged; the handicapped and the under privileged; a reduction and review of crippling taxes; a reduction of inflation; a return to full employment; a transfer of emphasis from the public to the private sector; the opportunity to own a home; a return to a society based upon freedom in all respects, not a socialist **welfare** state.

* His  consideration for the **welfare** of the people, as far as this legislation is concerned, is nil.

* It is clear from discussions that I have had with many of the councillors in the McMillan electorate and with representatives of the Municipal Association of Victoria that there is a belief that local government will take on greater responsibilities in the areas of social **welfare** and community planning provided it has the necessary financial resources properly to administer and implement such programs.

* When we consider that 25 per cent of our Budget goes to health and **welfare** and that another $2,000m goes to education- all these areas are pressing, probably quite rightly, for more and more Government expenditure- we must be conscious of some responsibility for austerity or certainly there must be a lack of extravagance in doing ail that we would like to do.

* The share of Budget outlays spent on the urban sector has fallen from almost  71h  per cent in the last Australian Labor Party Government's Budget to 5 per cent in this Budget In this Budget **welfare** housing payments to the States have been cut by  Vh  per cent in real terms.

* I think that success in the areas of inflation, of general recovery and of dealing sympathetically with some of the problems of unemployment, but at the same time having regard for social **welfare** and the aspirations of individuals who cannot help themselves, has been recognised by the electorate.

* The **welfare** agencies in Queensland will have to hand out the food and clothes needed by the people who are stood down and not paid the unemployment benefit.

* Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) ( 1 1.30)- It is a sad state of affairs when an important mining Bill such as this is brought on for debate in this House at this hour of the night, particularly when one considers that the **welfare** of the nation depends to a large degree upon the successful development and extraction of our minerals.

* Finance for State **welfare** housing programs has been reduced in real terms by 13 per cent in this Budget.

* If therefore the Government proceeds to act on the basis of an agreement made under duress, by the Northern Land Council or by an arbitrator, without it being subjected to the processes required to develop a consensus, the Government and its partners in the ventures are likely to encounter situations in which individual Aborigines or groups of Aborigines who feel their rights are being infringed will, in all good conscience, act in conflict with the terms of that agreement Such situations can be productive of grievance, hostility, and, potentially, violence and will damage further the already eroded confidence of Aborigines and their friends among white Australians in the Government's expressed concern for Aboriginal **welfare** and undertakings to protect their interests.

* It would seem that despite the action of the previous Government to solve the problem of **welfare** housing, that was impossible.

* Something about which I am concerned and about which I know the Minister for Social Security is concerned is the **welfare** of those pensioners who are at the very bottom of the rung - for instance, the ones who do not own their own homes.

* In the run-up to the last Budget we were informed in no uncertain terms that the business community of this country wanted drastic cuts made in social security payments, health and **welfare**.

* We are going to continue that straight path into the future, bearing in mind our responsibility for the **welfare** of the Australian people as a whole.

* My colleagues have already pointed out other areas of great need - housing, urban renewal, social services at the Federal level as compared with social **welfare** at the State level, the Matrimonial Causes Act and the legal aid that surrounds that Act, public transport and so on.

* 1 do not argue about the relative merits of one kind of brew compared with another, but t suggest that as far as the future **welfare** of Papua New Guinea is concerned, if it is to have a local brewing industry I am not too sure that there should not be some barriers set against the import of the product from outside Papua New Guinea.

* I should also like to congratulate the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  on his tremendous efforts to reform the social service or **welfare** area dealt with by the Budget.

* Indeed in the honourable member's speech on the second reading he has shown the reasons why, in broad outline, the Opposition is opposing various measures where it is felt that these will inhibit the role of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in its conciliation and arbitration functions and inhibit the **welfare** of individual unionists and the employer.

* Citizens in South Australia are entitled to ask, as they have done, and as newspaper editorials have done so eloquently in expressing their condemnation of that action which has been taken, whether the law of the land and the **welfare** of the community can be safely entrusted to a Premier and a Government who treat law with such contempt as honourable gentlemen opposite would have that law treated.

* It seems to me that members of the Australian Labor Party claim that they are the only ones who have an option on a social conscience; that they are the only ones who would make a contribution to the **welfare** of our community and the way we live in Australia.

* Is it the intention of the Attorney-General to hand the legal **welfare** of Victoria to the legal society there which has, if I may say so, an appalling track record when it comes to legal aid, selfinterest being the main motivation?

* I think that eventually we will have to move to a system of proper **welfare** based on need.

* This Government is responsible for at least five major housing problems that are causing increasing hardship for low and middle income earners; that is, the two out of three workers who receive below average weekly earnings, those on pensions and **welfare** payments and the unemployed who receive the miserable pittance that this Government calls an unemployment benefit.

* We should put our principles, we should put the **welfare** of the people in our region ahead of the demands of corporate trade.

* It is a Budget for the average man; it is a **welfare** Budget.

* In other words, within the profession itself there is a feeling towards medical services and the practice of medicine in the community which is preventive and which gives continuing care and makes use of all the ancillary services such as social workers, infant and **welfare** workers, marriage guidance counsellors and the various therapists to whom I could refer.

* An amount of $185,000 is included for the establishment, development and conduct of an associate diploma course in **welfare** studies at North Brisbane College of Advanced Education, Caulfield Institute of Technology and the South Australian Institute of Technology.

* I do not think that the Keynesian approach would apply today because it is obvious that the author of that approach never anticipated in his time that we would have spending by governments on such a massive scale on **welfare** projects and other areas that might be for the good of the people but were not productive as such.

* Both areas covered by this Department are critical, now and in the long term, for the planning of any government and for the **welfare** of the community at large.

* All decision makers, legislators and administrators, as well as citizens, are coming to recognise the importance of these interrelationships between economic policies, social policies, social security policies and **welfare** programs and those decisions which appear to have a direct spatial implication.

* As the report says, we raised that matter with some trepidation because inevitably when the issue of facilities for members of Parliament is raised in any context the accusation, of course, is made that members of Parliament are interested only in their own comfort, **welfare** or convenience.

* I do so with a great deal of concern for the **welfare** of the community.

* So such wage rises do not benefit the working people, those on wages, and they certainly do not benefit the Australian economy upon which, in the final analysis, the **welfare** and prosperity of every Australian must depend.

* This is a matter that I have taken up in deputations on a number of occasions and through many social **welfare** organisations.

* It is not for me to allocate priorities for the Government between one social **welfare** expenditure against another.

* We have had the Fry report, the Social **Welfare** Commission report and now, of course, the Priorities Review Staff has recommended that the commencement of the program be postponed so that the Government and the community would have time to prepare for its implementation.

* They are so heartrendingly attached to the gospel of State rightism and so viciously opposed to this Federal Government that they put party politics before the **welfare** of the nation and refuse to give us the powers we need.

* Australia's social and economic objectives- rising living standards and adequate provision of proper **welfare** services for the disadvantaged and the poor- together with the acceptance of our responsibilities on the world scene, in terms of aid to developing countries and fair trade in their products, and in respect of defence- we have to pull our weight in these matters and not just look to our friends for help- require a sound economy with inflation under control.

* The Liberal Party attempted to discredit Labor's estimate of costs and all of Labor's social **welfare** proposals are answered by the oft repeated cry: 'Where's the money coming from?'

* Even the Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare**, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  has said - and I have the statement here if anyone wishes to contest it - that our scheme is not nationalisation.

* It is all there in the newspaper cuttings - education, health, **welfare** and social advancement.

* It is where we speak in terms of national **welfare**.

* Of course, the latest step which we announced last night towards the abolition of the means test will be a substantial contribution to their **welfare**.

* It did not introduce family allowances as a **welfare** program.

* Clearly, any such moves cannot put at risk the proper concern for the safety and **welfare** of the patients.

* For example, it would be a higher priority to spend money on school dental health services and on the development of community health services- a whole range of community health and **welfare** services and other areas of responsibility of public office- rather than plugging benefits into a system which will just incite more utilisation because of the nature of the fee for service system and the sort of benefits that can be derived from that system because of the absence of adequate restraint on it.

* The purpose of the hostels is, rightly, to provide services to assist new arrivals to settle into the community with the minimum of heartbreak and in the quickest possible time, to provide **welfare** officers to assist them with their problems of education and social services, to provide housing advisory officers and employment services.

* The major increases in expenditure have been in the field of education and in the field of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* On pensions, social **welfare** or defence?

* The economies of the islands and the **welfare** of their people depend on reliable shipping facilities at reasonable freight charges.

* I could go on giving examples of this, but the fact is that this Bill contributes nothing to the **welfare** of Australia.

* Mr 
If there is one area in which this Government can at least claim to be consistent in its policies, it is in its disregard for the **welfare** of those who are unable to obtain employment.

* Whilst we agree with the Minister's comment that Australia's airlines are making a significant contribution to the development and **welfare** of our nation and have an air safety record equal to the world's best, there are fundamental differences between the approach of the Opposition to civil aviation and the approach of the Government.

* The economies of the islands and the **welfare** of their people depend on reliable shipping facilities at reasonable freight charges.

* The Australian Government is making greatly increased sums available to Western Australia for education, health and **welfare**, the cities and other areas in line with its national policies in these fields.

* It would have no pensions and no **welfare** of any kind, perhaps just a small defence force and a police force as well, which is being just slightly socialist.

* Great initiatives were taken in rehabilitation training allowance, supplementary rent pension, abolition of the means test, assistance to the handicapped, home care for the elderly, support for senior citizen centres and subsidies for the **welfare** officers who service them, Meals on Wheels, assistance for homeless men and matters of that kind.

* They are concerned about the **welfare** of the industry.

* All I can say is that it is an ostrich attitude for people to bury their heads in the sand if they really believe in the **welfare** of South Australia and the development of opportunities in that State.

* It is trying to cut back expenditure in the same way as it did with every other subject which was dealt with in the Budget, including **welfare**.

* Accordingly, I arranged for a professional **welfare** person from an outside organisation to approach this centre to request a breakdown of the reasons why women visit the centre.

* We must look to co-operation with the States to ensure the proper use of federal money given to the States for the **welfare** of the Aborigines.

* When will the Government accept the recommendation made to the Commonwealth in 1968 by the State Health Ministers, who said that there was no justification for discrimination between the physically ill and the mentally ill in relation to health and **welfare** benefits?

* I draw attention to this because it must be remembered that the States themselves bear a great deal of responsibility for the **welfare** of aged people.

* Honourable members will realise from reading our amendment very carefully that Aboriginal **welfare** is very much the concern of the Australian Labor Party.

* It has promised social **welfare** schemes and improvements in housing, urban development and transport.

* Up to this point of time I have taken the view that it is far better to centralise the Federal Government's support for **welfare** housing.

* He won because the people of his electorate recognised that he was a strong man, a man who had a lot to give and a man who would represent his electorate and build for himself a career in the national Parliament where he could contribute to the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* It will bring the people, the community, into the planning stages for **welfare** programs.

* In fact the Government's policies as they affect the social and economic **welfare** of persons on new land farms make a laughing stock of the Green Paper recommendations that the aim of policy should be to reduce disparities in public services and amenities as between rural and urban areas.

* These conciliation and arbitration measures are vital to the **welfare** of employees.

* If a company's shares stand at close at their par value on the marketshareholders, like investors, are loath to pay 50c for an item if they can get it for 45c- both the company's **welfare** and even possibly the directors job may require that shares stand at a healthy premium on the market if the new issue of capital is to be raised.

* I believe that the Committee served a very useful function in the previous Parliament and I believe that it can contribute a great deal towards the **welfare** of our Aboriginal people in the future.

* I wish him well with the new social **welfare** policy secretariat.

* Of course, the Government reached the situation where it felt that unless something drastic was done in these matters, as in the social **welfare** programme, whatever possibility - it is a very remote possibility indeed - it had of recovering its lost ground would have gone completely.

* Vietnamisation has tended to become the sort of catchcry that is used for the justification of many activities, but in governmental action, in the capacity of the South Vietnamese forces to defend themselves and in the field of assistance and social **welfare** policies this Government in South Vietnam is beginning to reach out to the people to an extent that it never had before.

* I point out that when I speak on these matters I realise very fully that the measures I am asking for will not affect a great number of people, but they are a section of the community which is helping to promote the **welfare** of Australia generally, and they are utilising for the benefit of the community areas which are very difficult to utilise.

* Until that happens, there can be no confidence in the industry, there can be no advance in the employment opportunities and there can be no reversal of the present trend towards the dismantling of one of the industries which is basic to the **welfare** of this country.

* It also provides a very important **welfare** function especially for people who live outside the capital cities.

* The administration of the Territory covers complex matters such as the **welfare** of Aboriginals, development and the administration functions of the Legislative Council.

* They make a tremendous contribution to the **welfare** of the country and to the interests of the people.

* In fact, all that has come out of this debate from the Opposition side is a clear certainty that what is really worrying Opposition members is not the **welfare** of the rural industry and the people engaged in it, but the fact that the Government by its well planned, sympathetic and realistic policy on rural matters will further weaken the chances of the Opposition Parties of holding the seats that they now hold.

* This matter is supposed to be one of those social **welfare** needs about which honourable members opposite skite that they wish to take some action.

* The vast improvements to the lives of so many Australians brought about by the intervention of government in Health schemes, social security programs, **welfare** housing and so on are ignored.

* In our situation profits of course contribute very greatly to all aspects of our government expenditure and, through it, to areas such as health, education and social **welfare**.

* As a citizen of the oldest State of the Commonwealth of Australia, I make it quite clear that I am gravely concerned about the future economic and social **welfare** of that State.

* The penalties are not too great for people who jeopardise the **welfare** of the Australian nation by this sort of action.

* For example, excessive attention to the doctor-patient relationship has led, I believe, to treatment of problems which may be psycho-social rather than medical, such treatment being by completely inappropriate means by doctors who do not have training in social **welfare** counselling.

* I hope that the amendment is carried because I believe it will represent a landmark in regard to these things in respect of our country's approach to the **welfare** of people who live or who will live in proximity to large airports.

* No-one has suggested that Western Australia should not have a naval base, but thoughts are centred on an investigation to arrive at the best possible site in relation to the effect that such a site would have on the **welfare** of the community in time of war rather than to select a site to meet the convenience of the Navy.

* This is a glaring example of failure to give justice in the social **welfare** field.

* This means social security and **welfare**, and public health.

* Unfortunately for the **welfare** of Australia as a whole, the Labor Party does not appear to agree with the Minister for Services and Property in regard to this matter.

* Thirdly, the figure includes 1,511 Aboriginals in the Northern Territory identified in the Census as being employed by the Commonwealth Government on **welfare** services.

* Doctors are losing the goodwill of the patients- the goodwill that used to exist between them- because, so far as the patients can see, the doctors or, to give them their due, the doctors represented by these associations are much more concerned with their own position and how much money they can earn than with the **welfare** of their patients.

* Of course, the Government has some obligation to any people anywhere in Australia on **welfare** grounds to see that they and those who depend on them do not suffer too greatly because of market crises or through circumstances which are no fault of their own.

* It may be that some form of income support scheme would be preferable, both on economic and **welfare** grounds, to a subsidy on one input such as superphosphate.

* They are churned through the National **Welfare** Account, I believe it is called.

* I ask the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  who will follow me whether he would care to explain how as a government they would increase dramatically spending on education, social **welfare**, housing, local government, and grants to the States, and how they would give indirect and direct tax cuts.

* The philosophy of taxation is based on how much incentive a person has to earn income in order to produce the revenue that government- the Labor Government particularly, and this Government proceeds to follow suit- needs to pay for fairly lavish **welfare** and social programs.

* Instead of playing a role in using Australian resources in manufacture, they become part of the pool of unemployed, depending on the support of social **welfare** payments.

* The growing alienation of the young from the community, increases in vandalism, the increasing incidence of unemployment, related health problems and the associated pressures on health and **welfare** services must also be taken into account.

* The recently publicised proposal of the Government's health and **welfare** committee is one such possibility.

* Health and **welfare** payments alone account for almost 40c in every dollar of Federal spending.

* In such countries there is a considerable obligation of offspring to take some part in the **welfare** of their parents.

* I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  which reads in part:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres'.

* As with other measures, this Bill cannot be viewed in isolation; it cannot be divorced from overall budgetary considerations in spite of the Prime Minister's extraordinary statement in his policy speech that social **welfare** and social security as a whole no longer would be subject to financial or budgetary considerations.

* I have clearly indicated that I believe people should be encouraged to use small motor cars and that motor vehicle manufacturers should be required to build into small cars safety features that are necessary to protect the life and **welfare** of the people who travel in them.

* We also had to take account of our commitments to other programs of high priority such as education, health and social **welfare** and above all of the general state of the economy.

* I believe the Commission's approach will leave the Government free to deal with questions of long term assistance in a way which promotes the long term **welfare** of the community.

* In the social **welfare** field pensioners have been deprived of several million dollars because of delay and refusal to pay a benefit which they had been receiving for some time.

* How the House must miss the former honourable member for Perth,  Mr Joe  Berinson, who was steeped in a genuine understanding of social **welfare** and social security matters and who worked assiduously to formulate Labor's policy in these areas which the honourable member for Perth had the temerity to disparage.

* It is only through trying to develop that level of co-operation that we can effectively as a nation safeguard our national interests and the **welfare** of our people.

* This man was tearing around the country saying that the Government was doing absolutely nothing about the health and **welfare** of Aboriginal children.

* I suppose that would be a hope that many of us here would share because if he read the article and understood it he would realise that it dramatised and pointed out the significant and magnificent social **welfare** reforms that this Government has introduced.

* Under those regulations it is possible for the Minister- in this case the State Minister for Community **Welfare**- to amend regulations of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act to allow for all classes of people to go on to reserves with or without the consent of the local Aboriginal community.

* The Government believes that, in order to make decisions about such matters as the Island's revenue potential and the nature and level of social **welfare** benefits, it is necessary to have much more information on the economic strengths, weaknesses and potential of the Norfolk Island economy.

* Where are the decisions that have been so vital to the industrial **welfare** or the economy of this country which have so upset the Government that it has to introduce such a draconian measure?

* We recognise that for the **welfare** of the industry inevitably there has to be a change.

* On 1st June 1970 in Malta  Dr Vincent  Tabone, Minister of Labour, Employment and **Welfare** on behalf of the Maltese Government and I on behalf of the Australian Government initialled agreed draft texts of the proposed new Migration and Settlement Agreement and related Arrangement dealing with assisted passage provisions.

* I believe if this approach could be adopted in Australia we would see a national water authority established which would be of tremendous and vital importance to the future planning and **welfare** of this nation.

* This factor, coupled with the inability of the various State associations to reach agreement on matters affecting the **welfare** of the industry as a whole, has resulted in a deadlock on some issues.

* Will the Prime Minister cause an investigation to be made into the anomaly to which I have referred so that at least some sort of justice may at last come to the very oldest of Australian citizens who are being denied their proper entitlement to social **welfare**?

* Australians as a whole will see the response of these corporations as a real test of how much they are concerned about the **welfare** and the stability of the Australian economy and the Australian community.

* The Housing Agreement Bill is designed to obtain parliamentary approval for the Commonwealth to enter into agreement with each State so that the Commonwealth, for the next 5 years from 1 July 1973, will be able to make advances at low rates of interest for **welfare** housing purposes.

* This attitude jeopardises the patients' **welfare**, according to any principles of medical practice.

* The Opposition's system would lead to duplication and waste and to no advance at all in the **welfare** of local government.

* Economically, the export of uranium is of great importance to the future prosperity and social **welfare** of this country.

* The Government must not be trapped into deferring decisions which are necessary for the long-term **welfare** of the motor vehicle industry and for the growth of the Australian economy by short-term problems and immediate decisions which are needed to overcome those short-term problems.

* Yet for two years- for the life of a parliament- the Committee was steered off into inquiring into that very important but only sectional facet of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The modern laissez faire economy - that is monetary and fiscal policy, wage freeze and the **welfare** state - cannot get the allocation of resources needed for a great national effort or for any other purpose.

* With all the major questions facing this nation - fiscal matters, international matters and matters of great concern on the domestic front such as housing, education and social **welfare** - the Parliament has wasted more than an hour this afternoon discussing this question.

* Members of the Opposition seemed to become terribly upset, irate and indignant when a document containing the policy recommendations of the Liberal Party's Committee on Social Security, Health and **Welfare**, which they regard as confidential, was produced in the House today.

* The last thing that motivates it is the **welfare** of the patient.

* The Government has a solemn duty to fund part of any communications deficit because those who pay taxes and live outside the metropolitan areas can in all justice expect the national government to contribute to their **welfare**.

* If the Premier of South Australia chooses not to spend his much greater amounts of money on specific things like **welfare**, that is his responsibility and the voters can judge him on his performance.

* They sit on committees- more often than not they are unpaid for this- which deal with employeremployee relations and on countless other organisations in the community that are interested in the social and economic **welfare** of our society.

* That means that ultimately if anything goes wrong the blame, broadly speaking, will not be taken by public servants who are guaranteed protection through the Public Service Act and other social **welfare** benefits.

* If the Australian Labor Party said that it was going to spend half that amount of money in improvements in social **welfare**, perhaps by eliminating university fees - I think the figure we recommended was only about $12m - the Government would express alarm.

* Can we take it that the Minister's rebuff is the sole product of the trumpeted review to improve social **welfare** promised by the Prime Minister in March this year?

* I am sure that many people in the country cities and towns would be very pleased to hear of that lack of concern by the Labor Party for their **welfare**.

* It indicates the concern of the Government for the **welfare** of soldier settlers in general and particularly soldier settlers in trouble in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.

* Did the South Australian Premier write to the Prime Minister on 27th September 1972 in connection with the Alice Springs-Tarcoola railway, agreeing to a grant of Crown land for the railway without reservations concerning mineral rights and requesting the Commonwealth to keep the existing line from Port Augusta to Marree open whilst necessary for the general **welfare** of the State of South Australia, subject to arbitration if a dispute arose as to economic viability?

* He has now moved a motion which, in effect, states that Australia should be solicitous of the **welfare** of its citizens everywhere and at all times.

* At that meeting the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  stated quite specifically that when a Labor government came to power in this country donations to **welfare** agencies of this sort would be tax deductible.

* We hear them talk about the Budget being a social justice and **welfare** Budget.

* -A Darwin trust fund has been set up consisting of the Administrator of the Northern Territory,  His  Honour J. N. Nelson; Harold Brennan, the Mayor of Darwin; Paul Everingham, the  Deputy  Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly;  Mr McDonell,  who is an executive member of that body;  Dr Stack,  representing the women of Darwin; Bishop O 'Loughlin of the Roman Catholic Church;  Mr Trower  of the Red Cross; Reverend Bence of the United Churches of Darwin;  Mr Robertson  of the **welfare** organisation;  Mr Alec  Fong Lim representing the business sector; and Bernard Valadian representing the Aboriginal community.

* Moreover, I am convinced from the experience of **welfare** workers that it is far better for children to a broken marriage to be reasonably content with one parent and to see the other occasionally than to be tormented by the strain of living with 2 parents who find that they are not compatible.

* I should like the honourable member and the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry to know that the Government is concerned for the **welfare** of that industry.

* Not one Opposition spokesman has mentioned those policy measures of the last 9 months which have done more to restore economic stability and to improve equity and **welfare** in Australia than any other government has achieved in a full term of office for very many years.

* Dr Sax's  ability, expertise and great capacity have been acknowledged by his increasing involvement in the field and he has now been appointed to a completely new policy secretariat dealing with health and **welfare**.

* Over a number of years, the Victorian Government, through its Department of Social **Welfare**, has given assistance to families receiving Commonwealth pensions, such as widow's pensions and so on.

* It is less relevant today because of the increased scope of government expenditure which is directed at assisting individuals or organisations; for example, health, education, social security and **welfare** programs.

* It has to maximise the **welfare** of the people.

* So the strategy is to dampen down Australia's economic growth - already one of the lowest among the advanced nations of the Western world - ignore the needs for upgrading education, health and **welfare** services and to take no effective remedial action to end the rural slump.

* I will deal with economic and social **welfare** matters during the debate on the Estimates.

* This Government and the people of this country, our trade, our prosperity and our future **welfare** will be determined by the diktat issued from Washington; make no mistake about that.

* The 3 projects which we are asked to approve tonight, in addition to a number of other projects for the Northern territory, indicate the interest of the Commonwealth Government in the promotion and **welfare** of that area.

* This Administration has had almost 6 months to have this legislation drafted but it has shown its obvious neglect for the **welfare** of our defence forces.

* The allocation of at least $3 18m to the States for **welfare** housing- an increase of $ 1 50m over the amount actually spent in 1973-74- will have a great stimulatory effect.

* The returns which are coming in from the various States indicate that the number of housing commencements to be undertaken in the current financial year will represent the highest level in any year since any Australian Government assisted States with the public or **welfare** housing program.

* Our responsibility for the **welfare** of the new nation changes after independence on 16 September.

* Of course it should involve people who are concerned at the social **welfare** aspects of legal aid and who have had experience in the needs of people in the legal aid area.

* In some States we find that local authorities take a particular interest in social **welfare** programs; in other States they do not.

* I realise that in a Liberal-National Country Party Government, social **welfare** does not always enjoy the highest priorities.

* Furthermore, even if the reason for this policy stands up to scrutiny, it is my hope that all members of this House who have the **welfare** of migrants at heart will demand that the state of affairs which necessitates this callous policy be rectified forthwith.

* Her  next of kin in Australia have been kept informed on her **welfare**.

* Discussions with **welfare** officers and unemployment officers suggest that the actual number of unemployed in the electorate totals at least 5,000.

* Certainly the Royal Flying Doctor Service does a marvellous job, but if that service can be added to by this form of communication, when a government of this nature is concerned with the **welfare** and the health of the people of the outback areas, so be it.

* He will then learn about specialists who believe that the socially disadvantaged should be treated only in hospitals; of doctors who pry out the embarrassing details of poverty from those who seek to be treated as socially disadvantaged; and of the doctor who will recognise no one as socially disadvantaged unless he has some kind of social **welfare** certificate.

* In the last financial year 86c out of every $1 collected by means of personal income tax from the Australian people was spent to meet the cost of health and social **welfare** at the Commonwealth level.

* There is an amount, of $400tn in the National **Welfare** Fund.

* It has the power to intervene in general wage cases to put logical arguments and economic realities to arbitration tribunals so that when they give their decisions - for it is the tribunals that give the decisions - they can have in mind all these factors which are so important to the economic **welfare** of this country and therefore to the social wellbeing of the Australian people.

* In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on English language training and both the migrant education and the migrant **welfare** services in Australia will be expanded.

* However, I would like to assure the House, as well as those interested in the **welfare** of the Australian tourist industry, that these examples may be handicaps but they are not absolute deterrents.

* He was saying this in the days after the Second World War when the **welfare** state was proposed around the world and was being discovered in the United Kingdom and in Australia.

* Now it is sour because the Labor Government makes positive decisions and has made more positive decisions for the benefit and **welfare** of the wool industry in 2 years than the Country Party-dominated coalition government did in 23 years.

* The spokesman for the Opposition on health and **welfare** services,  Mr Chipp,  has been roundly rebuked and disowned by the Leader of the Opposition for suggesting that Medibank would be dismantled.

* What a ruthless, callous, abandonment of interest and responsibility for the health and **welfare** of urban dwellers!

* When there is some sort of all-consuming monster, like we believe Medibank will be, which will take that much of the **welfare** cake it may well pre-empt a government from doing anything for other people in the community who are poor, sick or injured.

* These extreme left wing union leaders - many are professed Communists - are not interested in the **welfare** of the people whom they purport to represent.

* Also one would never contest the case that there was a special obligation on members of Parliament, whatever their Party, and on any other members of those parties to protest in a way which is most likely to conduce to the **welfare** of the country.

* That Bill promised home care services for pensioners; capital subsidies for senior citizens centres; the provision of **welfare** officers in senior citizens centres; the provision of paramedical services by way of chiropody, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech therapy and so on.

* Section 10 of the Reserve Bank Act states that the Board has the duty within its powers to operate its own policies- I will not go through this in detail- and to operate them in such a way that they contribute to 3 matters, the first of which is the stability of the currency of Australia and the third of which is the economic prosperity and **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* These tribunals normally consist of two independent members, usually a lawyer and somebody qualified in the social **welfare** field, and a person seconded from but not acting for the Department of Social Security.

* Under this Scheme, now administered by the Department of Social Security, a voluntary **welfare** agency may, if it meets certain criteria, be given a direct grant for the employment of a social worker to work among immigrants.

* One concerns what goes into the National **Welfare** Fund, mainly for the payment of social services, which aggregate nearly $6 billion.

* Nowadays, child endowment or family allowances are part of general **welfare** expenditure and payroll tax is just another revenue item.

* At the 
We all know, whether it be in respect of tax laws, social **welfare** legislation or whatever, that there will always be a small minority that will abuse the system.

* An estimated 4000 people in my electorate are waiting for **welfare** housing.

* The Government has made a great point of increasing low interest Commonwealth funds for **welfare** housing or for those types of dwellings.

* But it forgets entirely that having taken this H per cent it will have to take an enormous sum out of revenue to build up the deficiency in the national **welfare** account if that is all it is to be credited with.

* It is true that in other countries - particularly the overcrowded countries, many of which are in our part of the world - the standard of living and of **welfare** generally is bound to fall if there is no limitation of the population; but that is not true of Australia.

* It could be any issue - national or local, trade, commerce, social **welfare** or something of the kind.

* Apart from the payments which the Commonwealth makes to the States the provision under the National **Welfare** Fund is the greatest single item in the Commonwealth Budget.

* I believe that the permanent building societies have mushroomed far too fast for the general **welfare** of housing in Australia.

* As I indicated yesterday during the debate on a matter of public importance, we are concerned that **welfare** housing is not receiving the attention that it should receive and we are hopeful this year that we will be able also to remedy that situation.

* They are: **Welfare** housing, changes in the Defence Service Homes scheme, housing for the aged, indicative planning, the Australian Housing Corporation, the Australian Housing Research Council, the housing information and advisory service, modern housing techniques, uniform housing standards and housing tax relief.

* Prior to the previous Federal election the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  outlined the policy in respect of social **welfare** in the community.

* Many community services are under-utilised in the fields of law, consumer protection, public service and social **welfare** simply because of ignorance by individuals who have to use this machinery to enable them to get the best out of the society of which they must form a part.

* If we get that sort of co-operation, with the Government acting as a catalyst, I think it can make a massive contribution to national **welfare** and development.

* The Labor Government endeavoured to pursue its economic policies in such a way that wellintentioned and idealistic plans for a **welfare** state resulted in a political and economic catastrophe.

* No one doubts the intense interest of the honourable member for Oxley in social security and the **welfare** of pensioners and disadvantaged people.

* This fall in living standards- this slide in personal incomes and individual **welfare** and security- is so novel and dramatic a phenomenon that the Australian people have yet to grasp its implications.

* -Recent express decisions by the Government have callously disregarded the **welfare** of rural people and rural producers.

* I am not one of those who suggest that we should keep a social **welfare** benefit simply because it is there and has been there for some time, but I am not compelled to think otherwise by the arguments of the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt).

* When I talked with the Maltese Minister for Labour, **Welfare** and Culture, Miss Agatha Barbara in May of this year, she stressed that Malta does not want cash grants.

* The Committee believes that the solution is a matter of comprehensive urban planning to ensure continued benefit from a thriving air transport industry whilst still having due regard to the well being and **welfare** of the community which it serves.

* I do point out that this country is very often compared with countries whose figures include such items as the following in their educational expenses: school meals, free milk, the nation's cultural activities, scientific research, sport, youth activities, child **welfare**, armed services colleges, radio and television and so on.

* By conscripting Australians to fight in Vietnam and now by reducing the period of service to 18 months one would think that they had made a major contribution to the **welfare** of the nation.

* In addition, I have instructed my Department to examine more effective means of inducing eligible persons to avail themselves of the assistance under the Plan and it is proposed that this examination will encompass greater utilisation of social workers, charitable organisations and other appropriate **welfare** groups in the community.

* We on this side of the House will constantly keep in mind the need for the promotion of the **welfare** and the progress and development of both government and independent schools.

* It is a matter which, in the ultimate, is what this Parliament is all about because every action we take, however important in the national field, has one ultimate justification - the **welfare** of the individual citizen of Australia.

* I take this opportunity to place on record my respect for a man wise in the affairs of men and genuine in his continuing and active concern for this country's **welfare**.

* The United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, France and Canada are countries which paid more in terms of **welfare** payments than Australia.

* It also includes responsibility for the **welfare**, morale, and discipline of personnel under command.'

* There is need for a reallocation of the work of parliamentarians, for more committees of the Parliament and less social **welfare** and diplomatic work in the community by parliamentarians unless further aid is forthcoming.

* So it is very important for the whole **welfare** of Australia that these industries be kept on a sound basis.

* Mr Justice  Woodward said, in effect, of these people- I will not quote all the provisions because I do not have time- that their problems were urgent and important and that they related to social **welfare** and urban development issues.

* Instead we are asked to believe that a Government that runs down the aid program, that fails to spend even the meagre funds on foreign aid allocated in its own Budget and dismantles the expert, independent body set up to administer foreign aid is somehow committed to the **welfare** of our neighbours and the needy countries of the world.

* The Commonwealth 's general support for the aims and philosophies expounded in the article is further demonstrated by the Government's continued funding, under the Community Health Program, of the national secretariat of the Association for the **Welfare** of Children in Hospital which prepared the document and has, with the aid of the Commonwealth's financial assistance, vigorously promoted these principles and philosophies.

* These were two of the factors which prompted me to initiate the establishment of a committee of officials, under the chairmanship of  Dr S.  Sax,  Chairman  of the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat, from the Departments of Education, Health, Employment and Youth Affairs and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Tertiary Education Commission.

* I think that the election is fast approaching when the people of Australia will single out unemployment, job security, care, **welfare** and the opportunities that Australia should be giving to all its citizens.

* Although my Department has no direct responsibility in the matter, officers assisted the three seamen concerned with money from the Merchant Navy **Welfare** Society, Brisbane and drew the attention of the Papua New Guinea Consul and the Department of Transport and Civil Aviation in Papua New Guinea to the living conditions on board the vessel.

* In other circumstances it might be desirable for him to be absent, and with the sort of Prime Ministerial leadership we are getting it might be better if he stayed absent, but the facts are that at this moment the Parliament is meeting and I doubt if his contribution to the nation's **welfare** by his absence overseas warrants his being away from the Parliament when it is meeting.

* They are mindful of the fact, for instance, that child endowment, maternity allowances, child allowances, wife's allowances and certain other benefits are very important and necessary for the **welfare** and reasonable living standard of a large number of families.

* There is not a person on this side of the House who would not prefer, if we lived in the kind of a world in which it would be practicable, to spend all our resources on national development, **welfare**, health and education which are matters of great concern to all honourable members in this Parliament.

* Also, $l,473m is provided for **welfare** payments.

* So provision for the **welfare** of 78 per cent of Australia's children has to wait.

* I have tried to trace through something of the impact of this lack of trust and the pervading presence of outside influence on Cabinet on one important sector of public policy, that is the defence of this country and the **welfare** of members of the forces.

* I can imagine the honourable member's susceptibility on petitions because day after day he and some of his colleagues and the Ministers are subjected to a lot of embarrassment as the national constituency continues to barrage them with its demands for electoral reform and reform in' respect of many matters affecting the **welfare** of the people.

* The final consequences of this situation can only be the diminishing capacity of the economy to pay for higher real wages and the diminishing real benefits derived from social **welfare** programs.

* The worst way, the method adopted in this Bill, is to destroy the AUS, to make it less representative by interfering with the tradition of academic freedom and to prohibit the councils of tertiary institutions from enabling fees to be paid except for very narrow- one might say, almost selfishpurposes confined to 'student **welfare**', narrowly defined.

* The Government's opponents say that if the Government wants to have a decent **welfare** state it will have to encourage increased productivity.

* No doubt when that scheme was first thought up it was a very desirable initiative, but at that stage when I was not in this House but was an ordinary member of the community it seemed to me that a large number of people at public expense were learning macrame work, attending pottery classes and social **welfare** courses and a few other things which no doubt in an ideal society might be desirable things for them to pursue.

* No government can meet the great clamour from the people for better services, better education, better **welfare** services, better defence, better roads and all the rest of it, while it does so many things to damage the nation's productive capacity, to discourage people from investing their earnings and their savings in producing industries, and to persuade people that they are wrong, if not stupid, to seek to advance themselves and their families through hard work and thrift.

* But that fruit has now gone bad and the people of Australia at last have woken up to the fact that we cannot buy for example, better education simply by spending more money; we cannot buy all the other social **welfare** programs, which of course we want to have and which any government would want to give to the people, unless the people, through their taxation, are able to carry the cost and the economy is able to carry the expenses involved in such policies.

* However, there is community **welfare** as well and that means the **welfare** of the man in the street.

* I ask the Minister: What will he do about the **welfare** of the men in the street?

* There is a lot to be done for Aborigines but there are a lot of other people living up there as well and we should also see about their **welfare**.

* 4 reveals that the increase in personal income tax is comprised practically wholly of these 3 items: A rise in the work force of  VA.  per cent; higher incomes of 12 per cent provided by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commissionthe honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  who is interjecting encouraged the Arbitration Commission on, a number of notable occasions to grant larger increases- and, of course, as is well known, a dramatic increase this year in child endowment rates in response to those many private **welfare** agencies which have been advocating that as the greatest area of need.

* Also, it is no coincidence that the Minister for Environment Control,  Mr Beale,  was sacked from that office because of his ineptitude in looking after conservation matters as they affect the **welfare** of the New South Wales people.

* The care of the aged involves providing a wide range of accommodation and ensuring integration with health and **welfare** services.

* Certain local government areas in Australia dc provide housing and we now have a situation where voluntary **welfare** bodies can participate in the allocation of funds.

* -Every honourable member in the House will be aware that the employment and development opportunities and the general **welfare** of regional centres are largely dependent on a few of the most vulnerable manufacturing industries and the general wellbeing of the national economy.

* We must give incentives to production and development and we must protect our social security, educate our children and guard our national security and **welfare**.

* We have done that but even these measures have not been sufficient for the State governments to be able to cope with the tremendously increased demands on their services - services which I think should have the highest priority, those that happen to fall within the responsibility of the State governments, namely health, many aspects of social **welfare**, and, most particularly, education.

* I believe that the idea that somebody else is crucial to our defence, our **welfare** and our strength is an abdication of our sense of self-reliance.

* A working party of top social **welfare** administrators and other experts has been appointed by this Government to investigate and report on a suitable programme.

* The Government could be given a greater degree of flexibility, not only in social **welfare** payments but also in other developmental projects in which the State governments are unable to participate because they are beyond their capacity, and greater capacity to finance projects to which private enterprise cannot or will not commit itself.

* There was an opportunity to say to the unions, 'We are prepared to do many things, for example, to alleviate pressure in the area in **welfare** and to help with other areas if you will moderate your demands' but it threw it away and it will not come again as easily as it did before.

* Such action would not duplicate Australian Government **welfare** housing assistance which is presently provided under the housing agreement with the States.

* Did the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** recommend overall planning of rehabilitation for the handicapped to increase efficiency.

* &gt;  &gt; 
If so, will the Minister take steps to set up a semi-governmental authority for this purpose, including representatives of Departments concerned with education, social **welfare** and vocational matters, and voluntary organisations.

* It will certainly deserve the most serious consideration not only by the Commonwealth Government but also by this Parliament and by other people involved in the delivery of **welfare** services.

* It has been prepared to sacrifice important community programs such as housing, **welfare**, urban affairs and employment.

* The Congress will bring from 1500 to 2000 visitors to Australia, including Ministers, judges, academic and other leading figures in the field of law, criminology, police, corrections, social **welfare**, mental health, sociology, education and related areas and disciplines.

* The former  Chairman  of the Commission,  Dr Sidney  Sax, has taken control of the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat which is to coordinate and absorb most of the functions of the Commission and its relationship to the Department of Social Security.

* Because the motion and many of the amendments fail to take account of the long term physical and mental **welfare** of the potential mother I can support only the Baume and Simon amendments and nothing else.

* The **welfare** and settlement prospects of the individual migrant will take priority over the immediate needs of the employment market.

* Special arrangements within the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be made by a Liberal/ National Country Party government to provide both a reference point for individual migrants problems and assist the many migrant **welfare** organisations.

* A Liberal/National Country Party government will actively support and encourage the activities of regionalised Good Neighbour Councils and other migrant **welfare** organisations.

* A Liberal/National Country Party government will assist and encourage industry to provide migrant advisory services and assistance schemes within their own structure and generally take a greater responsibility for the **welfare** of migrant workers.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Mr Hayden,  the Minister for Social Security, in answer to a question a little while ago about pensions, referred to what was obviously a report in the 'Australian Financial Review' last week of an interview with me concerning social **welfare**.

* The Industries Assistance Commission recently said that wheat stabilisation could not be justified on either efficiency or **welfare** grounds.

* Lest I be accused of caring only for the wealthy, let me say this: The competition for the available funds directed to **welfare** each year is well known in this place.

* If we are to kill the will, the incentive and the ability of the more fortunate in our community, in the future they will be putting their hands out to share in the restricted availability of **welfare** funds.

* I passionately believe that a government of my Party's persuasion has a very deep obligation to ensure that the stage is set not to allow people to dodge tax obligations but to ensure that the better off look after themselves so that when they reach old age their investments are caring for them and they do not become competitors for the restricted amount of money available for **welfare**.

* Almost $9,000m is being set aside for social **welfare**.

* Without trying to cover too many more subjects, I conclude with the observation that here we have well over 38 per cent of the nation 's Budget spent on social **welfare** and health.

* I advise the Opposition to get its feet on the ground and recognise the fact that the working man wants to take home as much of what he earns as possible while at the same time recognising he does have to make a contribution to the **welfare** of the nation.

* It is an essential element in the totality of measures that is being taken for the improvement of an industry whose **welfare** is significant to major regions in all States.

* In contrast, SAASSO caters for the **welfare** of children in all government schools in South Australia.

* The reality of the situation is that the Government is expected to provide certain services for its citizens- things like education, health services, **welfare**, payments to the States, cash transfer payment to citizens and so on.

* In some countries the proportion goes nearly as high as 40 per cent when the different provisioning of **welfare** arrangements is taken into account.

* We stand committed to the development of this nation in every way and to the **welfare** of the people whom we were elected to serve.

* However, they have overlooked the fact that this finance is required for industries which are vital to the **welfare** of Australia as a nation and that it could do much to encourage people to remain in areas other than the capital cities.

* Whenever he is tackled about it, he bleats in an injured way about how much he has done for the material **welfare** of the servicemen - most of it, I might add in passing, initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government.

* The Government is not prepared to vary its previous decision and allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programmes in the fields of education, **welfare** and health.

* Under the Chifley amendment to the Constitutionsection 51 placitum(xxiii) and placitum (xxiiiA)- there is no doubt that responsibility lies with this Government to initiate this type of legislation which is one of the greatest **welfare** proposals that has ever been introduced by this or any government for the people for which it is responsible.

* The legitimacy of the proposition that **welfare** is a right for everyone is, in my opinion, a theme of paramount importance.

* Clause 64 ( 1 ) of the Bill requires that, in regard to custody or guardianship of or access to a child of a marriage, the court shall regard the **welfare** of the child as the paramount consideration.

* Funds that could have been spent on so many other aspects of community **welfare** and administration have been sunk into this project, which could have been undertaken by private enterprise.

* Those reports cover a whole range of activities- health, social **welfare**, the environment, law and government and so on.

* Timely government intervention can provide **welfare** assistance to seriously affected farmers as well as providing the financial means to ensure that resources continue to be used in those industries where their earning power is greatest.

* It is important for us, through our **welfare** programs, to develop crime prevention.

* The Fraser Government, after almost completing its first year in office, appears to have set a strategic course designed to make **welfare** a dirty word in the community.

* The fact of the matter is that there has been a multi-pronged assault against the concept of **welfare** since this Government has been in office.

* Any government which does not seek to inform itself as fully as possible in areas affecting the nation's **welfare** is obviously decreasing its chances or possibilities of acting in the most effective manner.

* The necessity to restrain **welfare** abuse and wastage so that those in greatest need receive a more equitable share of the **welfare** dollar.

* This Bill marks another instalment in the implementation of the Whitlam Government's progressive policy in the social **welfare** area and will be followed by many other measures designed to ensure that we resume our rightful place as a pioneer and leader in this field.

* (Quorum formed) 
We must provide country residents, wherever possible, with basic services (education, **welfare**, health, culture and recreation).

* In other words, whilst the provision of glasses does not happen to be a traditional medical service in the way in which one might view a surgical procedure, the need for glasses often can be more vital for the **welfare** of the patient than many other medical services.

* Couples with young families are struggling to raise their families and I know that their main demand in social **welfare** is an increase in child endowment.

* The importance of these 2 Bills should be looked at in relationship to the Government's total **welfare** program- schemes such as the Australian Assistance Plan, community health centres, child care, recreation and the like.

* He seems to take the attitude that whereas Australian people generally accept the proposition that many things that are important to individuals and to the nation at large should be financed on a capacity to pay principle- I am referring to such matters as social **welfare** benefits, child endowment, widow pensions, age pensions, even the defence of the country and many others that come under the administration of State governmentswhen it comes to health we ought to depart from that principle and revert to a philosophy whereby people have to look after themselves and whereby a levy ought to be paid.

* Foreign policy concerns of the Holy See under Pope Paul included: Disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons; improvement of social **welfare**; assisting the development of the poorer countries; evolution of relations with Marxist regimes; and a desire to expand official communications with the communist, Islamic and Asian world to ensure maintenance of freedom of Christian observance.

* This is an important question and essentially I am one in this Parliament who, on matters relating to Aboriginals, seeks to develop to the broadest possible extent the consensus that I believe is possible in matters relating to the **welfare** and advancement of our Aboriginal people.

* The motion reads: 
I come back to the situation of **welfare** housing.

* Nor is he really concerned about cuts in **welfare** programs.

* He talked about **welfare** programs but he did not analyse where there had been cuts in expenditure.

* I want to take up one matter raised by the Minister for External Territories  (Mr Morrison)  and to compliment him on one portion of his speech in which he said it is time - to use his words I think - that we should measure the effectiveness of aid as it relates to people and their **welfare** and not merely by statistics.

* He remains, I understand, as Minister for Science and will be looking after Papua New Guinea's **welfare** on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

* How has this Government conducted its affairs in relation to Aboriginal **welfare**?

* We have now uncovered where the honourable member for Dundas stands in relation to the **welfare** of Aboriginal families in the Northern Territory.

* The greatest contribution that any government can make to the **welfare** of the average Australian at present in the economic area is to create a more stable, more predictable and less inflationary economic climate.

* Essentially in a debate about the **welfare** of the average Australian and comparative economic policies, we have to compare fundamentals.

* In general, the Bill ensures that the Wheat Board and, through it, the wheat industry, sustain no extra costs through undertaking alternative financing arrangements for the 1978-79 crop and so contributing to the economic **welfare** of the nation as a whole.

* In consultation with the New South Wales Minister for Child **Welfare** and Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Hewitt,  I arranged for the Army to make available emergency tentage especially for the relief of these Aboriginals.

* Australia's minerals, its industries and laws and its social **welfare** are involved in the relationships between the Commonwealth and State governments.

* The reforms in the area of social **welfare** introduced by that Labor Government make a long list.

* Firstly, **welfare** has become a matter of politics, rather than humanity.

* This is the second of 2 Bills designed to open the way for local governing bodies to make a greater contribution to the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* In spite of this, I notice that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and now the Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare** matters are trying to beat up an angle on this action of mine.

* Is the Minister aware that there is a widespread distrust - rightly or wrongly - in the Services of the part played by civil servants in matters affecting the **welfare** of servicemen?

* His  concern for poverty is gratifying and T am sure that we can look forward to his support for our **welfare** and low income housing policies which have been outlined in the Governor-General's Speech.

* On that basis,  Mr Justice  Woodhouse met IS members of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party **Welfare** Committee some time ago.

* What is more important- good roads or the arts, the alleviation of poverty or increasing the bureaucracy, **welfare** housing or payments of $120 a week to unemployed Regional Employment Development scheme workers?

* None of us can treat this matter lightly, because the **welfare** and well-being of this nation depend very much on sustaining a strong export performance.

* 1 believe it is important that at the very commencement of the proceedings it should be the duty of any judge, if he were satisfied that even the slightest possibility of reconciliation existed, to forthwith bring into operation the relevant section, as a good, permanent marriage and the security and the **welfare** of the children thereof is paramount to the wellbeing of any State.

* There should be a co-ordinated approach to the **welfare** of the working people in terms of jobs which may be lost as a result of lowering protection.

* I am thinking of the social **welfare** area, the health areas and goodness knows what other areas.

* I believe that apart from conducting that review we should ask the new social **welfare** policy secretariat, under  Dr Sax,  as its first and most urgent job as part of an overall review of income security, to look at this great gap which exists in our income security net for all self-employed people and, particularly in this case, for farmers.

* It can cover civil rights, environment, **welfare**, consumer protection, anti-trust, security law and the like.

* For the mining companies to launch the massive public relations campaign that they have is not only dishonest but also must be treated by this Parliament and by the people of Australia as indicating that their major concern is not the **welfare** of the people and the interests of the Northern Territory, and least of all their concern for the traditional Aboriginal occupants of the Territory, but their main concern in this situation is to make profit.

* It is obvious that **welfare** payments of this nature must be coupled to a means test of some order so that the people who really need the assistance in fact really get the assistance.

* It is also of considerable interest to the members of the Australian Capital Territory electorate to find social **welfare** and community interests high amongst their own priorities.

* Of course, it is in that area that one of the most significant changes is to be made to the social **welfare** area, but probably a more important change is the extension of Commonwealth fringe benefits.

* In the meantime however, it means that in the field of science, at any rate, we can get the degree of co-operation between nations which is so desirable and for the **welfare** of all.

* States for approved **welfare** officer and home care services.

* So far as **welfare** officers' salaries were concerned, $900,000 was allocated in 1977-78 and $ 1.1m was allocated in 1978-79.

* Honourable members will recall that when the honourable member for Murray  (Mr Lloyd)  was speaking to this measure he mentioned that the Government was now in a position to lift the embargo on approvals of new **welfare** officer positions in home care services which has been in force since October 1975.

* I recall his very great concern about aged people and it was in the area of social **welfare** that Joe Sexton made a real contribution to the debates and discussions of this Parliament.

* It is the intention of my Department and, in fact, of the Government to ensure that money made available for **welfare** housing produces the best possible result and is used effectively to provide housing for low income people.

* One thing is certain, namely, that there is prima facie evidence which enables me to say that some of the land acquired from these companies is to be used for **welfare** housing under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.

* The Community Youth Support scheme may have some benefits as a social **welfare** scheme because it is designed to provide unemployed young people with an orientation to work and make them more acceptable to employers but it will have absolutely no benefit in combatting unemployment.

* In the speech on the 1973 Budget I identified inflation as being the product of deliberate policy by the Government because this was a government which was feeding off inflation, financing its **welfare** out of inflation.

* What we have then is a conversion from dependence on public **welfare** to individual responsibility for private **welfare**.

* When one looks at the anatomy of the Budget one finds that over two-thirds of total Federal expenditure is accounted for by education, which takes 8.9 per cent; health, which takes 10.6 per cent; social security and **welfare**, which take 27.2 per cent, and payments to the 
If local government is to play the greater and more effective role that the people of Australia require it to play, the effective influence local government exercises in relation to the fundamental decision making affecting its activities must be increased.

* Under the Australian Assistance Plan, special aid will be made available to local government authorities to enable them more effectively to provide **welfare** and health services to their communities.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* It seems that the Commonwealth Parliament has insufficient legislative power to make proper provision for the protection of the health and **welfare** of the community as a whole from dangers which can arise from the use of radioactive materials and isotopes.

* We all know from experience the uneven standards which will result from that and the neglect that will occur in the non-Labor States where **welfare** rates a poor priority by State governments.

* The Government did that because it had to pay for another **welfare** benefit, the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty- a bounty to subsidise the wealthy graziers like the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  at the expense of the aged in the community.

* The Queensland Sub-normal Children's **Welfare** Association operates a school for sub-normal children at Ipswich where I live, in a very old building called Claremont, an historic building, a building totally unsuitable for use as a school for sub- normal children.

* The money provided from the purchase would enable the Queensland Sub-normal Children's **Welfare** Association to build a new school suitable for subnormal children, who are probably the most disabled and most disadvantaged children in our community.

* Now that the subsidy has been reduced to $2 for $1, the Ipswich committee of the Queensland Sub-normal Children's **Welfare** Association cannot afford to erect a school building.

* It helps Liberals obscure the truth that government expenditure is, or should be and could be, the community's own investment in its own prosperity and its own **welfare**.

* Social **Welfare** 
One of the most striking illustrations of this point is in that very field of expenditure which is regarded by orthodox Liberals as a deadweight on the community - as a straightout unproductive cost to the revenue.

* I refer to social **welfare**.

* This Budget highlights the impossibility, not to say the immorality, of clinging to the present system of sole reliance on cash payments to meet the requirements of **welfare** in a modern society - a society which claims to be enlightened and progressive.

* Under this system those who depend on social **welfare** payments - the aged, the widows, the sick, the handicapped, the veterans - are not only the victims of Liberal economic policies; they become an instrument in that policy.

* In his first year of office we had from the Prime Minister what was to be a **welfare** Budget.

* Without committing himself to any attitude, will he undertake to have the question of Commonwealth responsibility for the **welfare** of a single mother and her child included on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of State and Commonwealth Ministers for Social Services and **Welfare**.

* If we were able to study the accounts of a separate corporation dealing with postal services as closely as we should, we would note that the reasons for the deficit relate not only to interest charges but also to the fact that the Post Office provides **welfare** services and other very necessary services for the community generally.

* For the last 15 months this Government has had before it the report of a Senate inquiry into the **welfare** of mentally and physically handicapped children.

* The third social **welfare** objective that these measures will achieve is for these desirable developments to take place at less cost to the Government than would be the case if the alternative development of more and more nursing home beds were adopted.

* States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Act 1972  -  This Act which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, provides for financial assistance by way of grants in connection with the **welfare** and advancement of the Aboriginal people living in the States.

* Where can we find anywhere in this document at all a comprehensive, internally consistent and effective series of remedies which are likely over the whole field of activities- that is the Budget, exchange rates, monetary and interest rate policies, wages policy and a psychology that can be designed to ensure that all the ingredients are there and are brought together consistently- to ensure the better **welfare** of the people of this country?

* Therefore it cannot be either virtually social **welfare** or education.

* For all this time the city has waited for an answer because it is in dire need of the funds so that it can maintain its program and continue its employment of its employees, let alone provide all those **welfare** services for which the people of Stirling are clamouring.

* It seems to me that all we are doing is taking into consideration the **welfare** and working conditions of those people we are employing in the polling booths and in the electoral offices throughout the country.

* I speak with some sorrow and some unabated anger on this occasion: Sorrow at the decision, but determined to accept it, and unabated anger at the cant and hypocrisy that we have seen from honourable members opposite who, once again, turn the **welfare** of the pensioners of Australia, which I regard as a most serious matter, into yet another debate which has been prostituted by their treating the pensioners of this country as a political football.

* - Mr Acting Speaker, education has joined the long list of broken promises by the Fraser Government, but unlike the broken pledges about employment, Medibank, hospitals, wage indexation, growth centres, water projects, Aborigines, legal aid, migrant **welfare**, urban transport, which were given under the pressures of the last election campaign, education has suffered a double breach of undertaking.

* In addition, Field Officers perform a **welfare** role in advising departmental clients on payments and services to which they are entitled and concerning which they may be unaware.

* There are a number of other factors, particularly in the social **welfare** area, to which it is more related.

* What is the estimated cost of these proposals as a percentage of total current expenditure (a) from the National **Welfare** Fund and (b) by the Commonwealth Government from consolidated revenue.

* It is not reasonable to expect that gross returns to primary producers should remain static and I hope that the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  and the Government will give consideration to examining the position of the wheat growers to ensure that they too receive their share of the prosperity of this country and that they are contributing generally to the **welfare** of the community.

* The Opposition's Health and **Welfare** Committee considered ways in which we could most expeditiously handle the proposed amendments but the time allotted is altogether too short.

* To have such a cavalier attitude towards the rights of those who have earned their Australian pensions and have received less than justice all their lives is surely the mark of one who has scant regard for the **welfare** of migrants or pensioners.

* But we do not intend to depend on moral force alone, strong though that may be in the new context of a Government concerned with the **welfare** of the community.

* There are numerous social **welfare**, economic and industrial problems that cry out for urgent remedy.

* It is my intention to send a proposal to the National Commission on Social **Welfare** and to ask it for a complete review of the basis on which the programs so far operated have been established and asking it to consider whether there are in fact better ways of providing such a program of accommodation for the aged.

* I am very pleased with the attitude that has been adopted by the Government to the **welfare** of these people.

* I submit that to oppose this Bill at this time and to frustrate the introduction of this Bill is to consolidate further the position of monopolies and cartels within our community at a time when it has long since become apparent that they militate against the general **welfare** of the community.

* Those who do not need compensation very often would be afforded assistance that would in fact be to their detriment, not to their **welfare**.

* The Minister for Social Security, through the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Australian Assistance Plan, also is assisting local government.

* It was a political decision; it was not even an economic decision nor a decision in favour of social **welfare**.

* Social **welfare** is here and will stay, but no one has invented a way in which it does not have to be paid for.

* I preface my question to the Treasurer by saying that he would be aware that in the last year of the McMahon Government $167m was made available to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and that over the last 2 years of the Whitlam Government the average amount for **welfare** housing was $375m.

* I repeat to all Australians, but particularly to the Western Australians in whose State there has been a determined effort to confuse and frighten, that the Commonwealth has no aim other than to ensure that **welfare** housing is provided for all those who need it, and as well that all Australians, regardless of means, should have a real chance of owning their own homes.

* I shall talk further on the estimates for health, **welfare** and social security, but I make the point that much still has to be done by this Government for country people.

* In common with, I suppose, other honourable members, I rose to take part in the debate in order to give servicemen an assurance that this House and the Parliament are concerned about their **welfare**.

* Today they have to meet the needs of their ratepayers in the field of community activities and social **welfare**.

* This new Parliament, the old and new members, have the huge burden in all issues of national responsibility from defence, social **welfare** to education in plotting the course for the future.

* Our social **welfare** system must be further expanded to meet all areas of need while not creating a bigger problem where people can and do live in the city whereby initiative is sapped and productivity is reduced.

* Political expediency is the real danger in developing satisfactory and successful social **welfare** programmes.

* When the sitting was suspended I was pointing out that our social **welfare** system must be further expanded if we are to meet all areas of need in our community.

* Political expediency is the real danger in developing satisfactory and successful **welfare** programmes.

* It is born of the relationship between electors and their representatives, the availability of representation, the flow of information and ideas, and response in understanding the interests of the people and relating them to the national **welfare**.

* We on this side of the House regard ourselves as having an equal right at least - and I say that with some reservations - to debate the measures which affect the community and the **welfare** of this country which is so sadly and shockingly neglected by those who sit on the Government benches.

* I would need  21/2  hours to point out to honouraoble members opposite how dismally they have failed in regard to social **welfare**, education and defence, you name it.

* Working Party on Social **Welfare** Manpower  (Question No.

* 1697) 
There are many dedicated public servants working in the field of unemployment and **welfare** benefit payments.

* It will make a very real contribution to the economy of Queensland and to the **welfare** and the betterment of the people of Brisbane.

* They struck fear into the heart and they stuck a skewer into the body of every Australian as far as the economic **welfare** of this nation is concerned.

* The increases in pensions and the concern with the means test and with social **welfare** are greater increases obsolutely and proportionately than have ever been sustained in a previous Budget.

* Apart from Tom Burke's political work he was active in many fields of community **welfare** and, in particular, played a major part in, and for many years was the guiding light of the slow learning children's group of Western Australia.

* But to confine one's thinking to this single absolutist principle is to ignore the many other rights inherent in the situation, such as the rights to health and **welfare** of the mother and her existing family, the rights to choose whether to bear children or not and the right of the child to be wanted.

* But the honourable member said: Let the rest of the community look after them; fix it up with social **welfare** payments or let them go without; do not worry about them.

* There are also possibilities of using beef in domestic **welfare** programs.

* The reform that was introduced last year, to change the basis of family allowances, I believe, was probably the most significant single social **welfare** reform since Federation especially to help women.

* Those countries seem to be moving as fast as they can towards the development of nuclear industries and they do not seem to be very concerned about the **welfare** of their citizens during that process.

* The Government, the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stand condemned for their absolute disinterest in migrant **welfare** and services.

* The disgraceful conditions in **welfare** matters and the inexcusable destruction of the migrant English classes are condemnatory evidence of their neglect.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9,000,000 East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* In addition, appropriations amounting to $225,260,000 are sought to give effect to the arrangements agreed upon at the Premier's Conference on 14 February for the provision of additional funds to the States to assist employment and to meet certain other commitments for financial assistance to the States, particularly in respect of **welfare** housing, the Tasman Bridge and other disasters.

* We should have such a provision for 2 reasons: In the first place, tax avoidance would result in a loss of dutv to the revenue, which is important enough in itself; but secondly, and of interest to everyone interested in the **welfare** of those in rural areas, as we all ought to be, it would create a more artificial demand for rural land.

* Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, funds are provided to State Governments to assist towards housekeeping services for the aged, senior citizens' centres and the salaries of **welfare** officers employed in association with senior citizens' centres.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure that, as far as possible, passports are not issued to persons who are likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country, or the rights and **welfare** of its citizens.

* They are good at advocating things like the picketing of ships loading sheep at the cost of the **welfare** of thousands of unionists and non-unionists.

* It is not interested in the **welfare** of the working people of Australia or in sound Budget planning or in the interests of the aged, the young, the business people, the people who make the money so that we as a government can afford the programs we are trying to implement as regards greater social justice.

* Then with the increase in these interest rates we saw a growing demand for **welfare** housing.

* These measures are designed to bring to fruition our aims in the field of **welfare** housing .

* The Government intends to bring to fruition policies in the field of **welfare** housing.

* The Treasurer said in his Budget Speech: 
Adjustments to the personal income tan system which ostensibly gives individuals greater ' independence ' in spending power to meet their own needs do nothing to assist those who are not wage earners and those whose income (be it wages or a pension) is inadequate to enable them to live decently and disguises the fact that important **welfare** and human services are either not available or become effectively inaccessible to the public who need them.

* As the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  pointed out, if some honourable gentlemen were to take the trouble to talk to some of the deserted wives and supporting mothers who are being covered by our social **welfare** system, they would find that a lot of marriages break down through pressure of economic circumstances and through other pressures which have nothing to do with the period for which couples knew each other before they were married.

* The second aspect of a complete package of agricultural policies is **welfare** policy.

* In the past, Liberal and National Country Party governments have not placed sufficient emphasis on **welfare** policy, and I acknowledge the criticism that has come from Labor spokesmen in this regard.

* But, even though the Labor Party said that it would do more in regard to **welfare** policy in agriculture, it did not do it.

* In our 12 months in government we have introduced 2 significant policy proposals for **welfare** in agriculture.

* Those who live in rural communities, whether they live on farms or in country towns, need such things as communications, telephones, transport, fuel prices equalisation, reasonable educational opportunities and special health and **welfare** services.

* Household support is one of the major **welfare** innovations- it does not matter whether it is agricultural or non-agricultural- of this country.

* As such it is an innovation of major importance to general social **welfare** policy not only in this country but also in the Western world generally.

* I compliment the Minister and the Government for putting together what I consider to be a great improvement in adjustment measures for the agricultural sector of our society and for some very important innovations and developments in social **welfare** policy.

* Probably the most devastating effect of the mini-Budget proposals in that rentals on government **welfare** housing will be increased to the level of rental charges in the private sector.

* There are still many thousands of people in Canberra waiting for adequate housing and there is no justification whatever for cutting back on the **welfare** housing program or on funds available for Commissioner for Housing loans.

* Sir, it  is quite clear from the remarks of all of them that they arc concerned with preserving the special position which the lending institutions now enjoy in this country and with preserving the special position enjoyed by the interests which show little regard for Australia's **welfare**.

* As you are doubtless aware, I am vitally interested in any matter relating to the farming community and look very sympathetically on any proposal made to me for its **welfare**.

* That rapid growth in terms of orthodox Western theory does not necessarily produce, and has so far not produced, increased **welfare** or justice is by now widely recognised.

* If money is used excessively and unjustifiably in one area, we deprive other areas of need - education, other areas of health, **welfare** services, community services, environmental factors and so forth.

* If there is one source in this country which has more information about our nation, our people, our national resources and our economic **welfare** at any moment of time that source is the Bureau of Statistics.

* No nation can operate efficiently or develop high standards in commerce, industry or **welfare** without a speedy and efficient communications system.

* If the OECD experience is to be followed- I recommend that it should be followed- what we will need and will see over the next year or so is an increased number of community-based schemes which would have incorporated in them a close affinity with community groups, social **welfare** organisations, local government, et cetera.

* Fundamentally, unless we can assist communities to have sufficient capacity to create employment opportunities it is no good sitting in Canberra and somehow being able to say that the rest of 
The Government has now recognised the significant contribution made by the people concerned towards the **welfare** of younger patients with similar long term nursing care by extending the eligibility for the domiciliary care benefit for eligible patients over 16 years of age.

* It is a social **welfare** problem; it is a matter of educating or reeducating the families of wool growers and taking social **welfare** measures.

* We have to do something about Aboriginal **welfare**, the problems of cities and pollution and all the other problems that face us.

* Members were discussing election policy items and 1 had brought to the notice of Caucus an anomaly in the social **welfare** regulations in that aged widow and widower pensioners who had either a child or children living at home caring for their parent were being refused the Postmaster-General's Department's fringe benefits in those cases where the child was earning in excess of the permissible supplementary income a pensioner was allowed to have.

* What is needed in Hobart now are not ferries, terminals, new telephones and social **welfare** services which the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Sherry)  so proudly enumerated, but a bridgeeither a temporary bridge, repairs to the old bridge or a newly constructed bridge.

* This provision reflects the fact that responsibility for the **welfare** of Australians of Aboriginal origin has rested since 1967 with the Australian Parliament.

* The **welfare** officer to whom the Fund entrusts its centre said in the course of that meeting: 
We are all in favour of research, but in East Gippsland there is a desperate need for health services of the most elementary kind.

* It was to the **welfare** officer of the Save the Children Fund and not to local representatives of the Victorian Department of Aboriginal Affairs that the Aboriginal children of Nowa Nowa turned yesterday when they were refused admission to school.

* The **welfare** officer last term was cleaning up the sores of up to 14 pre-school children in a day so that they could go on receiving the benefit of a pre-school education.

* The attitude of the **welfare** officer is that a vital part of tha process of educating Aboriginal children is beeping them well enough to attend school.

* They have been contributing to the National **Welfare** Fund in the form of taxation and they have been getting shrunken benefits in return.

* There has been a great slashing of migrant services in terms of education, **welfare**, health and language training.

* We are being asked to believe that the Country Party is not just a mouthpiece of the big grazing and farming interests but has always been concerned with the health, education, housing and social **welfare** of Australians and is dedicated to solving the growing problems of the environment, namely urban congestion pollution, conservation and decentralisation.

* I am pleased, however, to !earn that migrant education and **welfare** will not be restricted for financial reasons.

* One was the failure of the Government to provide programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* These actions include the lowering of interest rates, providing additional funds for the States, restoring the investment allowance for manufacturers, reducing personal income taxation and increasing **welfare** payments.

* They would have been my first **welfare** priority in the Budget had I remained the Minister.

* Yet the Government merely continues along its bumbling and arrogant way, caring nothing for the **welfare** of the people who elected it.

* When I mention a debate it reminds me of the fact that the honourable member for Hotham, who is the Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare** matters and who has followed these matters so closely in the last 18 months, would be well enough versed to enter into a debate of this subject without having a copy of what I might happen to say.

* What a decline in the philosophy of a once proud Party that its members are more concerned with enabling 2 men to get into bed together than with the profound issues which affect the **welfare** of the workers.

* Now they place the **welfare** of deviants above the **welfare** of the workers.

* It is incredible that no State or Federal government, or indeed the present Federal Government, has a special section of a department which is responsible for the **welfare** of small business in this country.

* In the area of housing we have introduced a policy which has a fundamental **welfare** orientation which no one who believes in assisting those in real need could ever object to.

* We are currently reviewing the whole health insurance system to see whether there are other ways to ensure that the rate of acceleration of health cost in this country does not crowd out our capacity to spend essential resources on other important areas in the economy such as social **welfare**, the need for job creation, the need to assist industry to employ people and so on.

* Let us bring some common sense, some ordinary commercial nous to the business of supplying houses for people and forget such terms- I hope I am not offending anybody when I say this- as **welfare** housing and things like that.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine - million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* The very real concern in the social **welfare** field was expressed and translated in the actions of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden).

* This Government has taken a number of new initiatives in the health and **welfare** sector, involving payments to the States.

* By its action the Australian Government prevented the closure of this vital industry on 30 September last and the **welfare** of hundreds of people was sustained and maintained.

* Along with social security, pensions, benefits and allowances, the tax structure forms part of the **welfare** transfer system.

* The social impact of both the tax structure and the **welfare** transfer system must be looked at to find out the extent to which families need more support.

* When was the States Grants (Home Care) Act amended to change the funding basis for approved housekeeping or other domestic activities and for the salary of **welfare** officers employed in conjunction with a senior citizens' centre from a $2:$ 1 to a $ 1 : $ 1 basis with the States.

* The amount payable to New South Wales for **welfare** housing is $96.41 lm, not $46.41 lm, the figure shown in the Hansard report on page 3041.

* What is iniquitous is that a system of taxation, devised for limited means, is now expected to finance, on an equalityofquality basis, social, health and **welfare** needs for everyone from all areas, irrespective of their capacity to pay.

* That obviously means that there will need to be a cutback on the present increase which this Government has budgeted for and, if necessary, of course that will mean a cutback of 8 per cent across the board, but necessarily there will be very high preference and priority given to programmes in the fields of health, education, social **welfare** and urban and regional development.

* I commend the Government generally on the increase in social **welfare** expenditure, including repatriation expenditure which this year will reach a record figure of $2,095m, some $268m more than last year.

* Even though the total amount spent on social **welfare** is the largest single item in Government expenditure, few people will disagree with the Government's determination to give this increased assistance to people who need and deserve it.

* Responsible people, including ministers of religion and people who have interested themselves in the **welfare** of those who deserve consideration, have urged me that this should be done so that people may have greater access to departmental representatives.

* In December 1976 the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace published a report expressing grave concern for the **welfare** of over 500,000 East Timorese.

* Today I want to make a plea for a broader national outlook with an earnest desire to promote the **welfare** of all and attention to the social needs of all Australians.

* Surely the **welfare** of a community requires such amenities and necessities and their provision should not be based upon economics alone.

* It states: 
-The affluent and uncaring honourable member for La Trobe  (Mr Baillieu)  has demonstrated his complete indifference about the needs of **welfare** housing in Australia.

* I think he should be reminded of the fact that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Uren)  moved an amendment, the purpose of which was to indicate that there was a deficiency in funds for **welfare** housing.

* When one takes into account the fact that something like 106 000 people around Australia comprise the waiting lists of the various State housing authorities and that many more would be added to that list if people thought they had a chance of getting a house in a reasonable time, one does not need much more evidence of the need for additional funds for **welfare** housing.

* The third point stated that the distribution does not pay due regard to the nature and extent of the **welfare** housing needs as between the various States.

* It is not possible to package and compartment the population of the Northern Territory into Aborigines and non-Aborigines and to say that these are the health, education, **welfare**, transport and other services for Aboriginal people, and those are the services for nonAboriginals.

* 1 am informed that various matters relating to maternity leave in respect of employees of the Commonwealth have been the subject of representations to the Government and that they are under review in relation to other employees in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, in the latter case as part of a general review of legislation on health, safety and **welfare** in work places.

* The only way that people can gain information as to what the Government is doing in the field of **welfare** for the coloured people is by reading the newspapers, and one reads that so much money has been allocated for this purpose and so much for that purpose.

* Their efforts are directed towards communal activities, with special emphasis on the **welfare** of their children and their aged.

* The primary aim of any government is to assist these people, but in my opinion the methods employed to do so must be clearly denned in every area of **welfare**.

* Another area which could be explored to assist the coloured people is the establishment of community centres, complete with trained **welfare** staff, again comprising coloured people, who would run these centres and be available for advice on matters dealing with health, hygiene, social **welfare** and job opportunities.

* Will he open either an office or an agency of his Department in every community centre throughout Australia so that all people, especially those in rural areas not already served by such facilities, will have easy access to information concerning their social **welfare** entitlements?

* As far as I can see, the **welfare** of the child is of paramount importance but we must make sure that this sort of thing does not happen again.

* The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has been particularly critical of the standards of nursing homes and has also claimed that the Government, in announcing its intention to provide higher patient benefits, has been concerned with the **welfare** not of patients but of nursing home proprietors.

* It will be essential for the development of the economy and the **welfare** of all Australians that it should do so.

* It will be required to conduct its operations in a proper and workmanlike manner and, in accordance with good industrial practices, to look after the safety, health and **welfare** of persons engaged in its operation, to interfere as little as possible with navigation, to have regard to conservation of the reserves of the sea and the sea bed, to have regard to operations being carried on by other persons engaged in similar activities and to consider in the exercise of its functions, factors connected with the ecology and the environment.

* In view of the fact that the Australian Automobile Association considers that the proceeds of the 22.3c a gallon tax on petrol should be allocated solely for the use of highways and roads, will he consider an extra tax for motorists to pay for the deaths of 3500 Australians killed on Australian roads and for the costs that some 90 000 Australians injured on our roads each year impose upon public hospitals, workers compensation and social **welfare** benefits?

* Medibank, pensions, education and social **welfare** will all be strengthened by honest responsible government.

* Mr Fraser  said that education and social **welfare** would be strengthened.

* When asked by a puzzled interviewer how the Government could so readily abandon quite firm promises to the Australian people  Mr Fraser  said: 
-On occasions such as this when we have a general debate before the House, I always try to make some constructive suggestions to the Government about the direction of its economic policies or its social **welfare** policies.

* The Committee, under the chairmanship of  Dr Sidney  Sax,  Chairman  of the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat, included representatives from my Department and from the departments of Education, Employment and Youth Affairs, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and from the Tertiary Education Commission.

* I saw one Press release from a major rural organisation saying that it is fair enough at this point to impose this levy for that gives the Government a good reason to be able to get stuck into the social **welfare** area in the Budget to be presented in a couple of months.

* The collapse of the Government's subsidised scheme shows clearly that its interest was not in the **welfare** of the poor but in the continuation of its health insurance scheme.

* As a result, we know very little about the following: Firstly, the distribution and accessibility of general practitioners in poorer areas; secondly, the extent to which the poor are forced to use outpatients departments of public hospitals which are not designed to meet such needs; thirdly, the efficiency and economy of the use of outpatients departments by the poor; fourthly, the incidence of illness among the poor and the nature of this illness, especially chronic illness; fifthly, the connection between the ill health of the poor and the general pattern of their life style such as diet, hygiene, social and psychiatric problems and their promptness in seeking medical care; and, sixthly, the need to link health, education and social **welfare** services.

* Nothing in the field of human relations could be so calculated to damage what residue of good feeling remains between the marriage partners or to jeopardise the future **welfare** of their children.

* Have honourable members opposite ever stopped to think of the needs of most people in our community, to consider what could have been provided for them with the money which has been wasted on the Fill aircraft, how many schools could have been built, how many pre-schools might have been constructed or what burden could have been lifted from the pensioners, to refer to one narrow field of **welfare**?

* The present system operates in an uncoordinated fashion with the Minister for the Interior prevailing on the one hand over so many matters concerning the Northern Territory and with, on the other hand, the Northern Territory Administration and the Director of Native **Welfare** and his personnel infiltrating into certain spheres of operation there.

* More particularly related to this Bill is the fact that the area is deprived of a great number of other community facilities such as roads, libraries, child care centres, recreational centres, social **welfare** services and all the facilities which are provided by local governments.

* If this matter is placed on a low priority drafting because it may be thought that the introduction of the present Bill may satisfy our servicemen, the Minister will be regarded as having no concern whatever for the serviceman's **welfare**.

* A lack of response now surely brings into question whether we should continue to subordinate our aims regarding the **welfare** of the people to big business priorities.

* The health, **welfare** and comfort of the  Vh  million people in this country who depend on pensions and benefits could have been enhanced if we did not have to hold the hand of big business.

* Treasurer has modified or ignored well presented and reasonable submissions from teachers, parents, social **welfare** groups and pensioner organisations.

* Business must be aware of the fact that many hold it responsible for what they see as the castration of Labor's social **welfare** program.

* It is apparent to all that the program has been controlled by the motive of securing an affluent economy for the nation and virtually nothing has been done towards securing the **welfare** of migrant families.

* I appreciate the fact that the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has acknowledged my representations to him on this matter and has pointed out that a report from his Department on the current maximum subsidy limits has been referred to the Social **Welfare** Commission for consideration.

* Initiatives of this Government in the fields of health, education and **welfare** are making heavy demands on the Commission which is actively involved both in the formulation of policy concerning the education of professionals in the areas mentioned, and in the implementation of other decisions and initiatives supported by the Government in respect of the colleges of advanced education.

* The preservation of the security of Australia as a free and democratic nation and the **welfare** of the Australian people, promoted through a sound economic policy with justice to all sections, are the paramount responsibilities of this national Parliament.

* Further to that the Government has established offices of the Department of Social Security, offices of the Department of Labor and Immigration, **welfare** offices and community centres.

* Of course the Minister made other points in relation to the sorts of services which can be contributed to the community in health, **welfare** and a range of other areas.

* This Labor Government will not take the same callous attitude to the **welfare** of the people of Australia which the Opposition has already demonstrated.

* The Leader of the Opposition only a fortnight ago said: 
There are some who see the objective as not one of self-management, of the ability of people to make decisions for their own benefit and **welfare**, but rather of land rights.

* Education, social **welfare** and hospitalisation are all top priorities in any country similarly situated to Australia.

* Users include government agencies at the Federal, State and local level; **welfare** and social service organisations; research institutions; bodies undertaking regional, manpower and educational studies; demographers; business organisations; and private individuals.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* We all know that this Government does not give any thought at all to the vital role which exports play in the nation's economic **welfare**.

* In my view the function of the Commonwealth should be to formulate national policy and what might be termed 'social and economic priorities' such as how education will be used as an instrument of social and economic **welfare**.

* This includes the effects on woolgrowers of the high rates of economic growth which have been achieved elsewhere in the economy whether due to tariffs or to other measures of government policy; the effects of government policies which assist the industry; as well as other domestic and overseas matters important to their **welfare**.

* Whether one examines the fields of health, housing, education, social **welfare**, conservation, urban development or repatriation, one will have little trouble detecting evidence of our ambition and aim to improve the lot of our people not just in material terms but in every way.

* I have raised this matter on the adjournment debate not as a matter of party politics or to seek to score any political points whatsoever but to use it as the forum to bring before the Minister what I personally believe to be one of the most glaring areas of need in the whole field of social **welfare** in Australia.

* Built in to that system is a second tier which is **welfare** housing.

* This is appropriate because in many cases these are **welfare** funds and they are designed to go to the area where they are needed most.

* The Minister has informed me that the Australian Telecommunications Commission intends approaching the various social **welfare** departments- the Department of Social Security, the Department of Health and the Department of Veterans' Affairs- to investigate whether or not they will be prepared to assist possible users financially by subsidising purchases or rentals of these devices.

* They are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the **welfare** and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator River region, and of all other people living in the region and working on the development projects.

* Has the Minister considered widening the scope of national service to include matters of civil defence such as natural disaster relief and a coastguard service which would at once constitute a constructive contribution to the national **welfare** and obviate the protests of those who oppose national service as a means by which they can be involved in a particular war?

* Some areas are still subject to examination- for example, by the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* This action did malicious damage to the wine industry and has placed the future viability of wine makers and the **welfare** of many producers at risk.

* I would like to challenge the Opposition to state exactly what is its pension policy and exactly what areas of social **welfare** would be savagely cut back under its proposals consistent with its statement.

* The Government should be required to say whether it considers there is a satisfactory future demand for rural products to maintain rural industry at its present level or whether it will bring forward a plan to transfer farmers out of production for their own **welfare**.

* The Government's understanding of the needs of the serviceman under today's conditions, and deep concern for the **welfare** of members of the Services, are reflected in the many improvements already made in conditions of service, as well as the further improvements which are under active study.

* Very often Australian industry has been accorded too much attention in the changes that have to take place in a world where we have a responsibility to have regard to the **welfare** of our own people and also to make our contribution to the development of peoples in other countries, especially the lesser developed countries.

* 1 ) What decisions have been made on assistance for projects submitted to the Southern Regional Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department, in respect of (a) Boddington Tennis Club, (b) Mandurah Soccer Club, (c) Broome Hill Cricket Club, (d).

* One immediate direct result of the meeting is that we expect shortly to welcome to Australia the Maltese Minister of Labour, Culture and **Welfare**.

* In addition, the Bill clarifies certain provisions of the principal Act- the Family Law Act- relating to maintenance and custody where the child or children concerned are in the care of State **welfare** authorities.

* The people of Australia must understand that it is not to their **welfare** that they should have coming in to the parliaments more people from the country areas than from the city.

* This has been compounded by the fact that under the Labor Government's program not only were funds provided via the Grants Commission but also funds were provided directly to local government for specific projects, such as employment generating initiatives, **welfare** assistance programs and so on.

* As a consequence, those municipalities which have the greatest need for **welfare** services, child care services and employment projects have been affected, in Western Australia at least, in two ways.

* Why is the Government showing such sudden interest in the **welfare** of the ethnic communities after two years of consistent and distressing cutbacks by his Government in migrant programs?

* We will implement our policy of preventing the exploitation of Australian uranium while its use poses unsolved threats to the environment, human health and **welfare** and to international security.

* It is one of the absurdities of our society that representatives of an industry which is exposing its workers and the community to the risks of asbestos-caused diseases are advising governments on issues of public health and **welfare**.

* When in Canada a few weeks ago 1 checked on this claim with top officials of the Canadian Department of National Health and **Welfare**.

* 2 on the Australian Assistance Plan, a report prepared by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* We are sorry that Opposition members have so little real interest in health insurance and health care that they have been unable to do more in this debate than to reiterate unproven - and unproveable - assertions that health care will suffer if the means of financing it is rationalised and to demonstrate that they are more concerned about the material self-interest and the private ambitions of a small clique of people than they are about the **welfare** of Australians generally.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* for instance, a cardiac problem, and some apprehension exists about his **welfare**, he would go into hospital for that sort of treatment.

* In my view- I have to admit that I do not have a degree in biology, but I have a great interest in the **welfare** of my electorate- the present regeneration of our native forests is being very well managed, especially in the area of wildlife and some of the areas mentioned in the report of the Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.

* In regard to the recommendation concerning an inquiry into the problems associated with the special care and treatment of the physically and mentally handicapped of all ages, this recommendation is closely related to the series of recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in its Report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia which was tabled on 5th May 1971.

* 1 just want to point out to the House and to the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  that members of the armed services stationed at Butterworth near Penang have mentioned to me lately that they feel that their **welfare** could be improved considerably if on humanitarian grounds the Government were to organise periodic charter flights so that the relations of those people who are up there for a long term could visit the serving personnel in those areas.

* He will have read in the Press, as I did, the statement of the Australian Country Party's spokesman on social **welfare** that his Party will oppose the Bill.

* There would be clear **welfare** implications as a result of such a change, especially in the housing area.

* An urgency motion was moved in this House and in the Senate by honourable members and senators concerned with the **welfare** of the people of Tasmania.

* The Cocos (Keeling) Islands will obtain revenue from these operations, primarily from philatelic sales, and the revenue so derived will be retained on the Islands for the **welfare** of the inhabitants.

* None of these is contemplated within our present ASIO Bill although I am firmly of the belief that all Australians should be possessed of some form of identification or social security number, as is the situation in the United States, in order to prevent the abuses under our Government's **welfare** and national health programs, but that is not related to the security of our country.

* Mr Weir was one of the early appointments to the Legislative Research Service where he was in charge of education and **welfare** research from early 1968 to mid- 1973.

* In the three years before that he was an Assistant 
Whilst the Opposition strongly supports the decisions taken to protect the **welfare** of wine grape growers, and I understand and recognise your interest in this measure,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  I assert that the Government has not gone far enough.

* With the knowledge also that all Slates are screaming for more revenue from the Commonwealth Government to meet their commitments, local councils, voluntary organisations, parents organisations and the parents and families of these unfortunate people whose **welfare** we are.

* This national Government has a responsibility to ensure that every level of government will be in a position better to perform its assigned duties for the better **welfare** of citizens wherever they live.

* These groups are normally involved with charitable, educational, health, **welfare** or like activities.

* The main features are that the Minister- and I stress that it is the Minister- may apply to the Full Bench of the Commission for a declaration that industrial action by an organisation, or a group of its members, has had, is having, or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of the community or a part of the community.

* A review of the existing maximum subsidy limits is one of the matters being considered by  a  Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* the need for a comprehensive health and **welfare** service for the ACT.

* Let me say in rebuttal of what has been said by the honourable member for Angas that there is not a redundancy problem insofar as the sulphuric acid plant is concerned which is affecting the social **welfare** of some members of families both at Nairne in the honourable member's electorate or in the Largs North area.

* By introducing this measure, the Government wishes to assist Australian woolgrowers further in their efforts to advance the **welfare** of their industry.

* A Cabinet **welfare** committee report came before my predecessors in 1970 suggesting that it be phased out in Australia.

* The Opposition is just a little late on that because we have put that up, and this is part of our proposals which the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) and others have acclaimed as one of the good features of our scheme - more than I can say, unfortunately, for the Federal  President  of the Australian Medical Association who informed us at a meeting of the Caucus **Welfare** Committee in Canberra some months ago that he could see no good thing in the scheme and there was no point in discussing it.

* I have found that they are in the main - there are probably exceptions to the general rule - completely dedicated to trying to promote the **welfare** of primary industry and that they do not spare themselves when there is need for a special effort in that direction.

* Whilst I believe that the medical profession is entitled to consideration in the formation of a new health scheme, it seems to me that it is one thing to afford consideration but that it is another thing to go overboard and to bc led by the nose to such an extent that the **welfare** of the community of this country has to take second place.

* Perhaps a more equitable approach is to finance health services from taxation just as we finance education, social **welfare** and most other public services in this country.

* It is concerned not simply with financing a health scheme but with ensuring that there is quality in medical care and regard for the patient's **welfare**.

* As a representative of a large number of wool growers, I am very deeply concerned about the claim that was made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  that 3 members of the Australian Wool Corporation had stooped to the level of completelydisregarding their responsibilities as members of the Corporation by conspiring with the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony)  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Sinclair),  and thereby placing in jeopardy the **welfare** of the people engaged in the wool industry, in order to promote an attitude within the Corporation in regard to price levels for wool that was designed only to embarrass the Government.

* Good Neighbour Councils, ethnic organisations, schools, legal aid, Consulates, State libraries, information and inquiry centres, bank and church migrant services, courts, national groups in the National Groups Directory, Councils of Social Service, voluntary **welfare** organisations, State and Federal Government Departments.

* The Bureau is not asked to consider comparisons between transportation, education, health, **welfare** and other priorities of government.

* The conservative government which followed watered down the great **welfare** scheme and scrapped the other proposals designed to reinforce it.

* The provision of **welfare** housing was thrust upon the States.

* The end result has been the gradual collapse of **welfare** housing and the serious plight of the housing industry which is revealed by an analysis of the measure before the House.

* The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  would like us to believe that the Government is maintaining the level of spending on **welfare** housing.

* The Government is going to the people confident that it has achieved the first stage of new policies and new directions for the **welfare** of Australia.

* The provision of these services in a **welfare** state through public spending is motivated by a desire to reduce inequalities in our community.

* We also want to ensure that proper provision is made for the **welfare** and interests of Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region and of all other people living in the region and working on the development projects.

* **Welfare** housing, to use that general term, has probably nowhere else in Australia been promoted as successfully as it has been in South Australia.

* It is unfortunate, however, that some of the matters raised by you don't seem to have been properly answered by the Social **Welfare** Commission's 'Green Paper'.

* The Western Adelaide Regional Council for Social Development has at its disposal $456,000 to be given to the community in grants to support community **welfare** activities.

* 1.3 The AAP should be seen as complementing other planning mechanisms which may be established between the Commonwealth Government and State Governments within the social **welfare** sector.

* 1.8 The AAP provides some financial resources to be allocated by the Regional Councils for Social Development by way of grants for community **welfare** activities.

* However, this is not the major source of **welfare** grants.

* Other specific Commonwealth Government programs such as Community Health, Child Care, Community Arts, Tourism and Recreation, and the Aged and Handicapped Persons programs, for example, are the main source of funds for particular aspects of community **welfare**.

* The Western Adelaide Regional Council of Social Development is fortunate to have amongst its members such notable people as 3 local Mayors, a number of Aldermen, several medical practitioners, a Regional Director of the Department of Community **Welfare**, a member of Parliament, Chairman of Community Councils for Social Development, a Superintendent of Police, a Baptist Minister and other activists in the community.

* May I quote further from the same statement: 'The Liberal and National Country Parties reiterate their commitment to supporting and enlarging participation in the decision-making structures relating to the AAP and reaffirm their commitment to the on-going nature of the Plan as a means of assisting individuals, groups and areas in greatest need of social **welfare** assistance at the community level .

* 'We are in favour of increased funds for social **welfare** projects and agree that the AAP is, basically, a suitable vehicle through which social **welfare** funds may be channelled to the community .

* May I on this occasion also quote from the official Liberal and National Country Parties Social **Welfare** Policy Document: 'We welcomed the introduction of the Australian Assistance Plan, because we believed that provision of some Commonwealth funds and assistance would act as a catalyst for citizen involvement in positive community service.

* Let me stress once more that due to the representation of all three levels of government and non-government voluntary community **welfare** agencies the Western Adelaide Regional Council for Social Development serves very well the role of a co-operating and liaising body which does not impose its views on the community but is representative of community opinion.

* On behalf of actual beneficiaries, involved individuals, agencies and organisations, such as the Commonwealth Employment Service offices at Preston and Heidelberg, Preston Employment Action Group, Program for Unemployed SelfHelp (West Heidelberg), the 2 community health centres situated in the large Housing Commission estates of Preston/Reservoir and West Heidelberg, Preston and Northcote Community Hospital, Austin Hospital and North Eastern Suburbs Regional Office (Social **Welfare** Department), we request that you give your most urgent consideration to the relocation of an unemployment and sickness benefit component at the Preston regional office.

* He is about more unemployment; he is about imposing sacrifices on people; and he is about cutting back on important **welfare** programs and neglecting many areas of need.

* That shows that the Labor Government is concerned about the **welfare** of exservicemen and their dependants.

* He is an appointed spokesman for the Australian Labor Party on health matters but I would like to draw his attention as a fell'ow Queenslander and somebody who I would like to believe is interested in the **welfare** of the people of my State to a statement made by his leader during the last election campaign.

* For example, at present the following programs are among those being evaluated: the Family Day Care Scheme of the Children 's Services Program the role of the Aged Persons Hostels in the Aged Persons **Welfare** Program the pilot **Welfare** Rights Program the pilot Citizens Information Centre Program.

* This is another reason why there would be interference to something that is already contributing greatly to the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* But the overriding concern of governments should be the interest and **welfare** of the disabled worker or employee, not the establishment of fault in the causation of the injury which has caused disability.

* Since the present Government came into office on 2 December it has provided grants of $225,000 for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, $125,000 for the International Planned Parenthood Federation, $200,000 for the Family Planning Association of Australia and $100,000 for the National Catholic **Welfare** Committee of Australia which will be repeated as an annual commitment.

* It occurs to me that the way to demonstrate real concern for social **welfare** recipients is not by advancing the implementation of a single increase by a fortnight, hut by ensuring that increases are in fact adequate to the need and directed as quickly and effectively as can be done to areas of maximum need.

* First of all, there is the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement which has recently been renegotiated and which will offer the States the most generous terms ever offered for **welfare** housing.

* Because the Victorian Attorney-General has claimed that the activities of the Australian Government contravened the law, will the Minister tell this House in what areas the Australian Government's initiatives are contrary to the Constitution and whether he expects a High Court challenge by the Victorian Government to Australian Government policies relating to education, health, **welfare**, legal aid and/or financial assistance for municipalities?

* They should think twice because when they want them next year they may find that some other employer, who has had a little more concern for the **welfare** of such persons, may have them and their former employers may have to go without.

* Under the existing eligibility test for pensions, which applies to all pensioners under 70 years of age except blind pensioners, it is obvious that the 'means as assessed' system of combining income and assets or property into a single figure for means test purposes involves anomalies and the Liberal-National Country Parties social **welfare** policy provides for this to be altered to an 'income only' eligibility test.

* -The honourable gentleman is well known in this House and in his electorate for the particular interest that he takes in social **welfare** matters generally and I welcome the interest which he has again expressed in the taxation position of elderly citizens, particularly age pensioners, throughout the Australian community and especially in the electorate of La Trobe.

* It sees equity as reducing everyone to a base level, all subservient to a massive, inefficient, money gorging **welfare** bureaucracy.

* He says that in Japan the employers virtually regard their employees as people whose **welfare** has to be safeguarded, people to whom there is to be a continuing and enduring obligation.

* These are the trends: Commonwealth expenditure on social security and **welfare** programs has increased from less than 1 7 per cent of the total outlay in 1 967-68 to more than 27 per cent today, 10 years later.

* This Government believes in encouraging people in the community to try to help those less fortunate than themselves rather than leave all **welfare** on the shoulders of big brother government.

* I do see in this a possible danger - I do not say that it is an actual danger; it is a danger against which we have to guard - that the proposed Social **Welfare** Commission will cut into the field of the voluntary bodies and to some extent impair their successful operation.

* I am a little bit worried by sub-clause (vi) of clause 14 (b) of the Bill which states: 
... for avoiding the duplication of social **welfare** programs .

* The advance of a social **welfare** program depends on experiment.

* I would be worried that in the interpretation of the recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social **welfare** programs there might not be inherent some kind of brake and construction upon voluntary bodies and we might even find the position where worthwhile experiments are not being pursued because they may not commend themselves to the Commission.

* Unless the Government fully accepts that responsibility we will have problems not only in employment in the rural industry but also in the provision of export income which is vitally important to the economic **welfare** of this country.

* How ridiculous it is to suggest, as some of them have done, that States' rights and the people's **welfare** will be threatened if this Bill is passed by this Parliament.

* The Press report stated: 
 During the time available to me I intend, naturally, to concern myself with Aboriginal **welfare** and with the way in which Aboriginals will benefit this year from the estimates of the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts.

* I remember having lengthy discussions with the matron of a hospital which was dealing with maternal and child **welfare** in the Alice Springs area.

* The Aboriginal women had a natural ability to learn maternal and child **welfare**.

* Are they telling us that they are so lacking in interest and concern for Australia's **welfare** - 
The 1974-75 Budget is predicted on an assumption of 20 per cent inflation- a complete abrogation of the Prime Minister's pre-election assurance, repeated in this Parliament, that inflation would be reduced to 8 per cent by the end of this year.

* In short, it is a Budget which has attempted to purchase a **welfare** program at the expense of the economy required to sustain it.

* I believe that the report fully justifies the stand taken by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs,  Senator Cavanagh,  who, against great odds and despite the reluctance of the Western Australian Premier, despite the reluctance of the Minister for Community **Welfare** in the Western Australian Government and despite the opposition of the Police Commissioner and the  Deputy  Police Commissioner, persisted with the idea of probing this unfortunate incident.

* Indeed, since there has been large scale evidence of bad treatment of Aboriginal people by the courts, the police, institutional people and many others associated with justice, I sought at the request of the Aboriginal Legal Service and a large number of other legal people and persons involved with social **welfare** organisations to extend the terms of that inquiry past the Northern Territory on to a Australia wide basis.

* It is clearly related to the quality of services that the community wants to see provided by governments; in other words the standards of community health, education and **welfare**.

* It could be argued that those countries within the OECD group that have higher percentages of their gross domestic product absorbed in taxation very often have higher standards of community and **welfare** services.

* What they did was shift the burden of community and **welfare** services in this community from the people who can damned well afford to pay for them to the backs of the people who cannot, to the people who need and ought to live in a community which is able to provide the full range and quality of services.

* Whereas the cost is important, the health and the **welfare** of the nation are of paramount importance.

* Because social **welfare** responsibilities involve all levels of Government and a large variety of voluntary organisations, the development of the pilot stage of the programme has sought to involve representation from all of these sources.

* Frequently, the major initiative in preparing a submission for funding under the Australian Assistance Plan has come from municipal social workers or from social **welfare** advisory committees attached to municipal bodies.

* Regional councils for Social Development are expected to relate to other regional planning bodies but will require the capacity to undertake independent examination of social **welfare** proposals and to make recommendations on such proposals for the allocation of funds under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* I fully support the presumption that both partners to a marriage are equally responsible for the physical **welfare** of the children of the marriage.

* I make this point because those Aborigines had been saying to **welfare** officers for 16 years that they had not been paid.

* They have the main meal of the day in a **welfare** centre.

* Did he note the claim of  Mr Alan  Hayes, a **welfare** officer of the Civilian Maimed and Limbless Association, on the "This Day Tonight' program last night that sheltered workshops employees receiving the invalid pension plus supplementary assistance totalling $24 a week have their benefits reduced by $1 for each $1 earned over $24 weekly?

* If these women need help, we should give it to them; if the babies require medical, social or **welfare** assistance, they are entitled to it.

* We have had four years of slashing of public expenditure and of cuts in education, **welfare**, health care, urban development and almost every area of human endeavour.

* It reads: 
Let us never forget that the introduction of indexation of pensions was a major **welfare** breakthrough by the Whitlam Government.

* In addition the Department administers payments to the States for housing, education, health, **welfare** and employment responsibilities.

* Appeals Regulations, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Trade Practices Act, the Family Law Act, the Social **Welfare** Ordinance, the Legal Assistance Ordinance and the Racial Discrimination Act.

* The second point I make is in regard to the National **Welfare** Fund which was mentioned by my friend the honourable member for Lilley  (Mr Kevin Cairns).

* This area has now been covered by the present Government, which is determined to look after the **welfare** not only of the building industry but of the young home builders and the industrial builders of this nation.

* They will accumulate all of the funds and leave the rest of the community to struggle along on social **welfare**.

* The second way in which we look after ex-servicemen is in regard to their medical **welfare**.

* I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard details of achievements, which I have summarised; details of legislation resulting from recommendations of parliamentary committees, Government established committees and commissions of inquiry, as an additional feature to those I have had leave to incorporate in Hansard at the end of the earlier sessional periods in the middle of 1973 and at the end of 1973 and 1974; a list of committees, commissions of inquiry and task forces established between 5 December 1974- when I made the last statement- and 31 May this year to report to the Government; a list of reports tabled in the Parliament between 5 December 1974 and 31 May 1975 on inquiries instituted by (a) the present Government and (b) the previous Government; a list of statements arising from meetings of Australian Government and State government Ministers, tabled in the Parliament between 5 December 1974 and31 May 1975; a list of treaties tabled in the Parliament between 4 December 1974 and 4 June 1975; details of the Australian Government's **welfare** reforms; and the Government's legislation program for the 29th Parliament to 4 June 1975.

* I would have thought that that council should include people such as those interested in social **welfare** who would know the needs and the wants of people who at this time in Australia do not appreciate the niceties of a classical painting or a classical graphic drawing but who can be stimulated to satisfy their minds more in a way in which would add to their enjoyment of life.

* I reflect the concern that was expressed for my **welfare** in a number of speeches from honourable members opposite because at the moment I am on the receiving end of lobbyists who exert enormous pressure.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land- Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* It was popular once to pour money into education firmly in the belief that money would solve all problems but I think that we have found in this area and in a number of other areas such as **welfare** and health- in fact, just about any field we have had anything to do with recentlythat money is not the answer.

* That is why they have this incredible paranoia about the Prime Minister, the man who brought this country out of the mire into which the Labor Government had plunged it and the man who has ensured its economic future and the **welfare**.

* I do not think we will ever get to the stage when we will be able to eliminate all areas in which people will be able wrongfully to take revenue from the **welfare** system.

* I think everybody who is interested in **welfare** would agree that those pensioners who have essentially no other income than the pension and who pay rent are the people for whom we should feel most compassion and to whom we should give most help.

* This is the whole sad story of the **welfare** picture of the Labor Party.

* The honourable member for Mitchell has had a long and enduring interest in the **welfare** of ex-servicemen.

* Uniform laws regarding the survey of these vessels would contribute much to the **welfare** of the fishing industry.

* The effective development of Australia's natural resources of minerals, forests, water and energy is, I believe, of crucial importance to the **welfare** of our country.

* Medibank will gallop away with such a proportion of gross national product that there will not be sufficient funds available for the other important health and **welfare** services that the people need.

* Perhaps some well-meaning Fabians believe that we should spend the money on **welfare** and other matters.

* The Minister for Social **Welfare** in the Liberal Government in Victoria reacted critically to this proposal and said that all that the Government - his colleagues here in the Liberal Federal Government - was seeking to do was to have an inquiry which would shift the responsibility from the Federal Government to State Government authorities because of the imminent Federal election.

* I said that we would set up a wide-ranging committee of inquiry with open terms of reference to inquire into the broad aspect of social **welfare** that would have special emphasis on the subject of poverty and would progressively report to a Labor government and that we would establish this inquiry, announce its terms of reference and announce the personnel of such an inquiry within 3 months of being elected to the government.

* If it was possible, as in fact it was, with a national campaign to reduce tuberculosis rates among the non-Aboriginal population from 52 per 100,000 in 1947 to 15 per 100,000 by 1970, why have we not shown similar initiatives and resourcefulness and a similar moral commitment to the **welfare** of Aborigines.

* The Government believes however that it has a responsibility to assist the adjustment process by providing the financial means to ensure that resources continue to be used in those industries, where their earning power is greatest and, at the same time, provide **welfare** assistance to those farmers so seriously affected by circumstances that they are unable to remain in the industry.

* Those who seek to share the nation's resources should clearly indicate the priorities of government expenditure in the fields of roads, transport, communication, social security, **welfare**, health, defence and education.

* This Bill sets out in detail to cover the various aspects of petroleum and minerals and assures the Australian people that the **welfare** of this nation will not be neglected and that we will not sell out our resources to foreign powers merely for a mess of pottage to meet a current situation.

* It would seem to me to be reasonable to expect an honourable gentleman, so critical of his own Government, so mindful of the **welfare** and the safety of his own people, to point out that these industries have been developed to a great degree by potential adversary governments.

* A vocal spokesman in America recently said: 'In America we tax work, growth, investment, employment, savings and productivity, while subsidising non-work, consumption, **welfare** and debt.'

* The student is usually selected by the sponsoring organisation in his own country and the Australian organisation accepts responsibility for his **welfare** in Australia.

* In recent years the greatest pressure has been for increased expenditure in the areas of health, **welfare** and education, for example.

* On **welfare**,., we have a concern for the people.

* Firstly, we have to understand that the worth of the Government's social **welfare** programs is being largely negated by the inflation they intensify.

* There is little point in spending heavily on social **welfare** if that spending is simply going to generate inflation that takes away the increased benefits.

* This clause of the Bill is merely further evidence of the Government's determination to put the riches of our country at the mercy of foreign enterprise and comes as no surprise from the Liberal Party which sees any national effort, be it the Snowy Mountains Authority or the Australian Industry Development Corporation, as a threat to its friends who could not care less about the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* Without that there is no way in which they can learn what their working conditions should be, what **welfare** conditions there are and what health conditions there are.

* The amendments will give a Minister the right to start deregistration of a union or part of one engaging in any industrial action harming community safety, health or **welfare**.

* It is a demonstration that the Labor Party believes that the interests of the people lie not in the **welfare** of the people but in their organisation of power for their own aggrandisement.

* The first is that people who have skills and connections in Australia and who would contribute to the **welfare** and development of this country are no longer attracted to it.

* In the past, it could have been said that Australia had made great innovations in the field of **welfare**.

* There is scarcley a European country which is not more generous than Australia in determining eligibility for **welfare** benefits and in the extent of those **welfare** benefits.

* Members of the Australian Labor Party are particularly aware of the deficiencies of our **welfare** services as they affect migrants because most migrants live in electorates represented by members of the Australian Labor Party in this House.

* There could scarcely be anything more begrudging than this in any social **welfare** legislation.

* However, the honourable member may be interested to know that an interdepartmental committee has been set up to study and report on the recommendations of the Report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia made by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**.

* We must never ignore from now on the **welfare** and security of the South Pacific, to which area the Minister for Foreign Affairs very properly devoted a large part of his statement.

* Purchase, modification and running costs of a media van to be made available for use throughout the region to communicate to the community in the area on social and community **welfare** services.

* The post-arrival **welfare** of migrants is no longer the resonsibility of the Minister for Labor and Immigration.

* But I think it is a little more than ironic for members of the Opposition to start lecturing this Government about the **welfare** of pensioners.

* Henty in the work of  Dr Kalokerinos  in the field of the **welfare** of Aboriginal children, particularly in parts of the central north west of New South Wales, and of his views on the importance of vitamin C.  Dr Kalokerinos  has recently been in parts of the Northern Territory and has been examining what are in his view the causes of infant mortality there, particularly in Alice Springs.

* Overall unemployment has been brought about by the August Budget of the McMahon Government and it is a tragic thing that without any thought to the **welfare** of the people unemployment should be created like it has been.

* A subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at one of the centres will also be provided.

* We have better government, social, **welfare** and education services through the whole Australian community.

* Firstly, I share with him his concern for the **welfare** of the needy.

* It is absolutely essential to us to have viable export industries if we are to import the capital equipment that we need for our continued economic **welfare**.

* The Government health scheme would benefit only pensioners, migrants, indolents, no-hopers and alcoholics, the Liberal Party **welfare** spokesman,  Mr Chipp,  said yesterday'.

* If revenue constraints are to be respected- as they will be by a responsible Government- gainers and losers will emerge whenever substantial changes are made to major **welfare** programs: it is not practicable for the law to take account of each and every variant in personal or domestic circumstances.

* I believe the Bill will provide in the future the vehicle by which environmental protection and conservation of our natural resources can all be achieved in balance with our needs for productivity and for the nation's economic **welfare**.

* It has tailored health and social **welfare** policies so that they cater for the needy rather than for those who can more easily provide for themselves.

* It was with these humanitarian problems in mind that I announced on 22 March that a shipment of canned meat that had already been sent to Lebanon for special **welfare** programs was being diverted to emergency programs established by the Lebanese Government to feed people who had fled from southern Lebanon.

* The agencies give support and material assistance in general **welfare** activities, hosting and friendship schemes and the movement of the refugees from the hostels to private accommodation.

* It has also been able to make some very worthwhile improvements to the social security and **welfare** system.

* It has been calculated that in 1967 there was one Aboriginal **welfare** worker for every 70 Aboriginals.

* One of us (Lovejoy) has estimated that, if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** of $1 1 7.4m had been given directly to Aboriginals (estimated to be 140 000), there would have been about $838.00 for every man, woman and child.

* In the process, it is becoming a lucrative business- for professional **welfare** workers, administrators, researchers and consultants.

* He had a deep concern for **welfare**, equality and the rights of individuals and he had a great vision of Australia.

* In it they will find that in real money terms the money allocated to the States for housing assistance- that is, for low cost or **welfare** housing for people on low incomes- this year has been reduced by $22.5m.

* There are 6,000 people on the waiting list of the Housing Commission of Victoria anxiously waiting for **welfare** housing, and this Government has cut back funds to that extent.

* Even more important - 
In visiting various offices of the DSS, the Inquiry noted that the standard of accommodation provided for the delivery of **welfare** services is, in general, second rate in comparison with accommodation occupied by organisations such as 
Medibank.

* The Inquiry finds that the standard accommodation which greets DSS clients is depressing and believes that persons seeking **welfare** support should be provided with facilities equal to those provided by private enterprise.

* This newspaper has drawn to my attention, and I am sure to the attention of many other people, matters that are vitally important to the **welfare** and livelihood of the citizens in that area.

* The States now have the capacity to choose their own priorities, be they **welfare** housing, sewerage or other services.

* We reject any suggestion that less could be spent on social **welfare**.

* Those who rely on pensions and social **welfare** payments would not survive if their payments were reduced or were not increased with increased living costs.

* More money is now being given to more charities because people carrying out the obligation of social **welfare** work or working with Lifeline do not work within the definition of relief of the poor or afflicted and therefore in the past did not receive the benefit.

* There is the Willoughby Community Aid and Information Centre, which provides counselling service on social **welfare**.

* In commercial terms social **welfare** is the largest service industry in Australia.

* Expenditure by State and local governments and voluntary agencies adds another $400m to the nation's health and **welfare** bill.

* t Social **Welfare** Claims and Payments  (Question No.

* 4120 (Hansard, 2nd November 1971, pages 2880-1) regarding social **welfare** claims received and payments made in Canberra during the last 5 years, was the increase in the number of claims received between 1966-67 and 1970-71 attributable to the increase in population during the period or was it due to other reasons.

* Can he give details of how the sum of $53,226 paid out as **Welfare** benefits in Canberra in 1970-71 was spent.

* Huge government spending in Great Britain in socialist **welfare** experimentation and interference in supply and demand through buying into industry have left huge deficits and enormous industrial losses.

* I think the  Australian  newspaper, with which I do not always agree, summed up the situation pretty well on Tuesday of this week, It said: 
Financial assistance has been granted for travel by rural workers under certain circumstances; subsidies have been paid to employers taking more than the normal number of apprentices; goods and services have been provided in decentralised areas by the Commonwealth in the areas of cultural and recreational facilities, public health, **welfare** and housing.

* This raises a major consideration, namely, the additional burden which would be placed on the Australian taxpayer who, in 1971-72, is expected to provide some $510m from the National **Welfare** Fund for health services.

* In the present we require a very large degree of it, and in the future it will be equally indispensable for the **welfare** and the growth of this young Australian nation.

* Firstly, I wish to take up some of the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who spoke about the subject of Aboriginal affairs in general and about how in many areas and in many ways one would hope - this is as I understood him - that Aboriginal **welfare**, Aboriginal advancement and Aboriginal affairs will be treated as non-party issues.

* In my view he has very little interest in their **welfare** and is merely using them as a means of attracting attention to himself.

* The Government acknowledges that those who have put forward these views have been motivated by genuine feelings of concern for the **welfare** of the Timorese.

* The speech of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in response to the Budget Speech proposed the lifting of these levies and the payment of **welfare** payments to beef producers in critical financial situations.

* There are already certain limitations upon the right of entry on to Aboriginal land which are administered through the Social **Welfare** Ordinance of the Northern Territory.

* It has also been pointed out to me that when it comes to the implementation of programs to fund community health centres, Aboriginal **welfare** programs and the like, the Labor Government had full consultation with the States.

* Furthermore, the Committee noted that there was a lack of the appropriate data required to assess the need for greater passenger **welfare** generally.

* 1 ) Did the Minister receive advice from the former Minister for Immigration that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Depanment of Immigration to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant **welfare**, information, education and the issue of passports.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* They too have spent their lives in an endeavour to promote the **welfare** of Australia and its people and they must be given consideration.

* Is the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development aware that under the direction of the former Federal Labor Government 70 per cent of **welfare** houses built by the States and funded by the Commonwealth were available on only a rental basis?

* All we have to take into consideration is, firstly, that there would be a federal income tax levy; secondly, there would be a State income tax levy, the amount of which the States would determine; thirdly, there would be another tax for local government; and fourthly, if we can place any credence on the suggestions of the Opposition spokesman on social **welfare** matters, there would be a separate tax for Medibank.

* The result was that the demand for **welfare** services grew and the taxable or revenue capacity of the city dropped.

* I have a respect for the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  for what he has done in the field of social **welfare**.

* But concerned as they are with the high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security, they provide the essential framework for the attainment of those national goals.

* I say that because it is the private sector which generates the wealth on which the public sector relies for its growth and the funding of social **welfare** programs.

* What steps have been taken to implement recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** concerning drug abuse, in particular the adjustment of excise to ensure that the cost of beverage alcohol does not decrease relative to average consumer costs or incomes.

* The Melbourne-Centre will employ: 1 Sessional Psychiatrist 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Social Worker (number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load) 1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 **Welfare** Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 1 Liaison Officer 1 Clerical Assistant 2 Typists 1 Labourer 
In the calculations that I have made in regard to particular councils it would seem that the situation that has been found by Victorian local authorities will be duplicated within New South Wales.

* A budget that sets out to achieve the **welfare** and the best objectives for the individual will be a budget which proves that at a government level the security of those individuals has best been effected.

* The Task Group comprises representatives from the Departments of Employment and Youth Affairs, Education, Finance, Health, Industry and Commerce, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Social Security (Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat).

* Honourable members may recall that the Home Savings Grant Act 1964 provides that grants under that Act are paid from the National **Welfare** Fund under a special appropriation.

* There is a range of justifiable reasons for abortions- matters like the physical and mental health of the person involved and their social **welfare**, which is not unimportant.

* Last week my Party's **welfare** committee had a lengthy and very interesting discussion with  Mr Justice  Toose and  Mr Kingsland,  who is Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

* But a healthy and growing economy is a necessary condition for an effective social **welfare** program.

* I think the record of this Government over the past three and a half years in paying regard to the **welfare** of Australian families in its Budget decision-making and in looking to the interests of Australian families compares very favourably with the record of any government since Federation.

* He knows that 
We have heard much about grants-in-aid and money for housing, health, education, employment, **welfare** and so on for Aborigines.

* The Minister has also broken his promise to the State governments that this year they would receive for **welfare** housing not less than they received last year.

* The social **welfare** agencies in Launceston, such as the Salvation Army and the City Mission, report that each week more and more destitute families are seeking relief.

* The cut-back in what are called **welfare** housing grants to the States will further enlarge the ever-growing number of homeless Australian families.

* He told the States that they would receive the same money for **welfare** housing as before.

* In fact he is on public record in 2 speeches as having guaranteed the States that their allocations for **welfare** housing would not be cut back.

* The report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons is very  far  reaching  in  its implications for both the Commonwealth and the States, and the recommendations of the report cover  a  wide range of issues which could affect questions of major policy in several Commonwealth Departments.

* We have heard only in the last few days that as a result of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions these expectations can no longer be realised because it is believed there has been a block and that that block will mean, of course, that international trade will not be generated at the predicted figure of 7.5 per cent but will fall to an ever much lower figure with a consequent impact on commodity prices and the **welfare** of the people of this country.

* By doing this we will not only be able to produce more resources and provide more services to the community but also we will be able to provide for the **welfare** of pensioners and those who might be regarded as being in the disadvantaged sections of the community.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:  'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.'

* I might mention also at the outset that the appropriations for the child care program appear in the Budget not under education but under the functional classification of social security and **welfare**.

* Under the Australian assistance plan special aid is being made available to local government authorities to enable them more effectively to provide health and **welfare** services in their communities.

* What evidence exists that States have so restricted their social **welfare** budgets that in order to obtain revenue they have to rob children who have been deprived of their parents?

* The fellow who lives in rented accommodation and who for environmental reasons- say, for the sake of argument, the presence of a noxious industry or an airport, which is affecting his family-and who can obtain alternative rental accommodation only in an area where, in the opinion of the Commonwealth Employment Service, there are little or no employment prospects is rewarded for caring for his family's **welfare** by having his umployment benefit terminated.

* Some other social **welfare** benefits are indexed.

* The State insists that by thus guaranteeing the general public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence, it is exercising its power to promote the general **welfare**.

* The Senate was conceived as a House where men of experience could contribute to the national **welfare** without too rigid adherence to 1&gt;arty lines.

* There is a growing realisation in our community that if spending on health, **welfare** and other areas continues to grow at recent rates the nation will be crippled economically.

* Interest paid on money lent to purchasers for the purchase of **welfare** housing will increase by half of one per cent a year until it reaches one per cent below the long term bond rate.

* This is a question of social **welfare**, and in fact we have all expressed concern about this situation.

* 1 remember making a speech in this place about an unmarried mother who was paid a social **welfare** benefit of 35/- a week.

* It is a waste if a government, in building **welfare** housing- in all cases when building **welfare** housing the value of the land has to be taken into account; it cannot be excluded- spends sums in excess of that required for the type of home for which one would reasonably expect to provide as **welfare** housing.

* When governments are building **welfare** housing they do not have a responsibility to provide luxury waterfront accommodation at a **welfare** rate at the expense of other Australian people.

* If honourable gentlemen opposite would like to take the sort of approach they are taking now, to provide half the accommodation for the same amount of money, let them come and see some of the people in my electorate who are on waiting lists for **welfare** housing and tell them what they are saying tonight.

* I am ashamed that those people who say they care about the **welfare** of other people want to be so extravagant about spending the money that they raise from Australian taxpayers.

* The prosperity of the country and the **welfare** of its people should be the concern of the Government.

* We have grown up with the notion that somehow work is related to participation in a particular kind of economic system, that it is related to working in organisations that are primarily devoted to a profit rather than being related essentially to making some sort of contribution to community **welfare**.

* I wish to warn the people in those local areas of what they could expect, in the light of the statement by the spokesman for the Opposition on **welfare** matters, if the Opposition were to become the Government.

* Quite clearly the Opposition has now changed its attitude towards this very worthwhile community based program of social **welfare** services, and if the Opposition were to be the government it would cut back that program.

* Labor's **welfare** programs were meant to be on a continuing basis.

* The Council will advise the Government on responsibility and revenue sharing as well as provide a medium for consultation and co-operation between Federal, State and local governments in vital areas such as health, **welfare**, education and community services.

* Regarding social services, I think that the House sometimes has been inclined to overlook that payments this year from our National **Welfare** Fund will reach the all-time level of $ 1,473m, which is an increase of SI 31m over last year or an increase of almost 10 per cent.

* Except for 1969-70 this is the largest increase in the whole history of the National **Welfare** Fund.

* Behind this increase in expenditure from the National **Welfare** Fund there are several factors, and I should like to list three of them.

* However, I would suggest that the House might consider that one reason for this is that in this **welfare** field 1970-71 is the year of health services.

* That all words after That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place  thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security'.

* While he was in Australia his  4  children were under the care of the Child **Welfare** Department; so government departments had some knowledge of him.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security'.

* He has also said that to relate assistance more closely to needs the annual determination of the amount to be allocated to the Housing Commission for **welfare** housing could no longer be left entirely to the individual States.

* Perhaps one day the principle will be extended to repatriation so that no longer from a social **welfare** point of view will there be the costly and sometimes unfair situation which now prevails.

* I have interpreted it to include only those bodies involved in social, charitable or **welfare** work.

* Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (8.21)- At the opening of the second session of the 28th Parliament  Her  Majesty the Queen referred to many measures that her Government intended to introduce for the **welfare** of our Aboriginal population.

* In fairness to the Aboriginal population, I do not think that I would have to go outside my own electorate to see things which would make any Aboriginal want to protest if he was genuinely interested in the **welfare** of his own people.

* They seem to indicate to me that the elected parliamentarians, in the discharge of their duties, should have regard to the people of Australia as a whole and at all times endeavour to secure the advancement of the national **welfare**, including that of our Aborigines.

* Although the purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $364.6m for **welfare** housing, in fact those who have contributed to the debate have ranged right across the spectrum of housing and those aspects applying to it.

* Recent litigation has thrown some doubt on the extent of the provision enabling a court, in special circumstances, to make a maintenance or custody order in respect of a chile who has been put into care under State **welfare** legislation.

* Without wishing to be offensive to anyone, I suggest that the Bill in its present form is pretty much a playboy's Bill and does not pay much concern at all to the **welfare** of women.

* This is something which is long overdue, which the Australian Labor Party never even thought of doing but which this Government has done as a result of its consideration for the **welfare** and health of people who live in areas such as that which the honourable member for Riverina represents.

* If he imagines that that sort of approach to taxation is going to produce sufficient wealth for the vast social **welfare** progams that no doubt a Labor government would want to perpetuate and increase, I think he has another think coming.

* This Act details provision to be made in **welfare** and housing, premises open to the public, university and school buildings, to ensure the representation of the disabled in a wide range of activities, and it covers special cases of deaf, blind and autistic persons.

* -There should, of course, be preference for programs in the fields of health, social **welfare**, education and urban improvement.

* The community health programs, the community information bureaus, the **welfare** rights and the area improvement programs all directly  affect our ethnic communities.

* I want to make it quite plain that this meeting was a proper meeting, that it is proper for the people of the south coast - trade unionists and othersto be concerned with the **welfare** of their old people and to be concerned also with the consequences of industrial accidents, and that if they wish to say something about the Budget at the same time then I am perfectly happy and willing to receive their proper representations.

* This is a matter in which I hope that the real things to be considered - namely, the **welfare** of the old people on the south coast and the **welfare** of people who may be the victims of industrial accidents - will not be made a political football, as would seem to have been the consequence of the published statement of  Mr Nixon  which he said was a misreport of what his words were.

* I was urged to be brief but I want to close by making a considered statement and I do so as one whose only interest in this exercise is the **welfare** of his State.

* If I take random headings from the Treasurer's speech, I see: 'Defence', 'Payments to the States', Social **Welfare**', 'Sheltered Workshops', Repatriation Benefits', 'Mental Health Institutions', 'External Aid', 'Assistance to Woolgrowers' and 'Aboriginal Advancement'.

* They are not interested in the **welfare** of those particular people.

* the matters which I have mentioned we can now in this Parliament, thanks to last Friday's historic decision by the High Court, at last achieve national codes in matters which concern the **welfare** of all Australians.

* That amendment expresses the concern of the Australian people for our future and our **welfare**.

* The amendment states: this House is of the opinion that the Budget fails to tackle Australia's economic crisis, in that: 
1 ) Grants are available to Aboriginal communities and groups from funds voted to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs by the Parliament for a variety of purposes, including **Welfare**, Housing, Education, Health, Community Amenities, Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, Loans Commission and Legal Aid.

* system does not result in a minimisation of social costs there will be a **welfare** loss to the community.

* Quite apart from the procedural amendments which I have described, another part of the legislationthis was referred to briefly by the Leader of the Opposition- provides for accelerated deregistration procedures for unions or sections of unions whose actions are substantially adversely affecting the safety, health or **welfare** of the community.

* If people in the community see that their safety, health and **welfare** are being affected, they naturally expect their government to take action to protect them.

* But their attitude towards the **welfare** of this country and mine are I hope in a state of utter coincidence.

* There is also in the Bill the extension of benefits to members of the regular forces, and there is an indication of the interlocking of repatriation benefits with general health and social **welfare** services in the community.

* I can only assume that this matter of interlocking repatriation services with other health and social **welfare** services gave rise to that rumour.

* But there is considerable expertise in the Repatriation Department which has much to add to community health and social **welfare** services, and I do not .think those with that expertise should be prevented from giving that assistance.

* The very fact of having an artificial limb enabled this man to carry out his normal everyday occupation and therefore he was not claiming any social **welfare** benefits.

* The issue is the safety of the consumer and the **welfare** of the community.

* As for those who need social security and **welfare** payments, it is interesting to note that the Budget provides $8 billion to help the family, the handicapped and the aged.

* It would be quite wrong if I did not say that I was deeply impressed with the work of the principal of the High School,  Mr Ronald  Knox, and his staff, particularly the Aboriginal teaching aides, and the sisters and nurses from the Queensland Government who work in the hospital as well as those in charge of **welfare**.

* The defence vote this year is estimated to be $l,323m and social **welfare** and repatriation are estimated to be $2,529m, making a total of $7,30 lm or about 70 per cent of the total Budget.

* For instance, the social **welfare** measures will be of tremendous assistance to many people in more ways than one.

* As a first principle, it should say how much the scheme will cost the Australian people and what it will mean for their health **welfare**.

* The Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  contained a great many items concerned with this country's **welfare** services.

* We support the suggestion made to the Minister by that group and by the Regular Defence Forces **Welfare** Association that a new committee be constituted to make recommendations in relation to servicemen who retired prior to October 1972.

* Last Tuesday, I think it was, the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Antony Whitlam)  and I, as members of the Opposition's **welfare** committee, met with delegates of the Australian Hospitals Association.

* 1 ) The assistance provided under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act is not payable direct to homeless men and women, but to the eligible organisations that provide assistance to homeless persons by way of food, accommodation or a social **welfare** service.

* My authority is a volume publised by the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** which I obtained from the Parliamentary Library.

* The volume states clearly: 
-I refer the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to the fact that the Western Australian Government intends to provide for the Minister for Community **Welfare** in that State to override the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning and, by extension, the Aboriginal Land 
In the light of these recommendations one would expect that a government which for the time being was custodian of the great social **welfare** powers of this Commonwealth and which was formed by a Party which has claimed to be the traditional guardian of the poor would have committed itself immediately and irrevocably to a program to rescue them from their worsening plight.

* The social **welfare** program which the Government has unfolded is one that gives to the haves - albeit in part - at the expense of those who now have more.

* Of course the Government has adorned the Governor-General's Speech with the old familiar phrases - 'protection for the weaker section of the community', **welfare** housing will be provided 'as soon as circumstances permit', the next Budget will make further increases in social security, and it will also provide for increased assistance for the handicapped and disabled.

* Unless the people are to be taxed to an inordinate extent the community just cannot afford the social **welfare** program, however attractive it may seem to some, which the Government urges upon us and at the same time adopt an effective program against poverty.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission is not a satisfactory vehicle.

* There is another broad aspect of the Government's social **welfare** program to which I would like to refer.

* Let me however make it quite clear that I am not talking about cities, housing, education, nor am I criticising the abolition of the means test or suggesting that there is no need for reform in the social **welfare** area.

* It is not so much the areas in which the Government's program seeks to give assistance - such as health, pensions, general **welfare** and amenities - about which I speak, but the extent to which it would embrace the life of every Australian.

* So I ask sincerely: What does the average Australian who is not poor require in times of economic stability by way of social **welfare** of his Government?

* I realise that these are basic and perennial questions, but I believe we have to answer them now in this Parliament because of the nature of the Government's social **welfare** program.

* Much of the Government's projected social **welfare** program offends not only because it affords our poor nothing like effective social justice but also because it threatens to turn us into a dependent people coddled and propped up by the state at every turn.

* Let us not be deluded into thinking that all the Government's **welfare** program is humanism at work.

* I ask honourable gentlemen on the other side of this House to reconsider their social **welfare** program not only because in substance it ignores the poor for the affluent, but because it threatens to set us on a path which, if followed to its logical conclusion, will significantly dehumanise our people.

* Both economically and in **welfare** terms then I think transferable quotas would be beneficial.

* In all our actions, therefore, the overall objective must be the healthy continuation of an industry capable of competing on world markets; an industry which has contributed, and will continue to contribute, provided sound and realistic policies are pursued, to the nation's economic **welfare**.

* I know that there are few members of the Liberal Party now who are prepared to acknowledge the services to this country, including services in matters of **welfare**, of their last successful leader.

* I am sure that honourable members will agree with me that the Australian airlines have made a very significant contribution to the development and **welfare** of this country, with an air safety record equal to the world's best.

* The ban on saccharin in the United States and Canada is based on toxicological investigations carried out by the Health Protection Branch of the Canadian Ministry of Health and **Welfare**.

* At the time the Government took the opportunity to say to the Premiers that the position in **welfare** housing is very much derivative from the stop-go policies which were pursued by the previous Labor Administration.

* As I recall the figures, subject to checking after question time, the amount of money provided for **welfare** housing some 3 years ago under the Labor Administration was $ 169.8m.

* The taxpayer gains through increased social **welfare** benefits, education, roads, sewerage, and so on.

* Even today, those of us who have been concerned with migrant **welfare** and have achieved some assistance for family reunions, find that there is discrimination continuing in the matter of the issue of visas.

* If the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable gentlemen were to read the report of the committee of inquiry into preschool education by Miss Fry which was tabled about 8 months ago, the report by the Australian Social **Welfare** Commission which was tabled yesterday and the report by the Priorities Review Staff which also was tabled yesterday, they would see that this is a very complex matter; that in fact there are very great difficulties in carrying out a program of care and education of children before they go to primary school, particularly in the light of the varied circumstances in the different States.

* But in this particular industry in the last few months, what we have seen has been an almost co-ordinated approach by members of various unions to sabotage the future **welfare** of the entire Australian people.

* This Government has come in for a great deal of unfair criticism because of its **welfare** policies.

* The amount paid by this Government for **welfare** - that is, for social services, repatriation and health - represents a much higher percentage of the total Budget than that paid by Labor in its last year of office.

* Of all the criticisms which (he Labor Party could have offered against the Liberal-Country Party Government those relating to social **welfare** are by far the weakest.

* I want to draw the attention of honourable members to just some of the very great improvements in social **welfare** which have been introduced by this Government during the past 2 to 3 years.

* 1 chose to speak on **welfare** because the Government has been unfairly criticised by uninformed people and by the Opposition for its **welfare** policies.

* I presume that in representing the Aborigines of Australia he is looking after their **welfare**.

* We are interested in the **welfare** of the countries of South East Asia and our neighbours.

* This Government seeks to give effect to its policies of greater social justice, more expenditure of money on education and increased spending on **welfare** and social services, within the constitutional framework.

* If effective government, geared to the needs of the 1980s and beyond, is to be achieved ... if the great issues of national and local concern such as education, health, social **welfare**, housing and urban development are to receive maximum intelligent attention ... if all our resources including human talents and local knowledge are to be effectively harnessed ... if innovation, diversity and imaginative reforms are to be encouraged .

* These are the need to reduce the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; and the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the **welfare** and interests of the Aboriginal people and all other people working on development projects.

* I believe the Government's action in this matter has again shown its concern for the **welfare** of the Australian communities suffering adverse effects from international economic conditions.

* The first interest of any government must be the **welfare** of its own people.

* By and large, it was my clear impression from comments of people in the voluntary **welfare** area who were committed to the provision of accommodation for the aged, that they believed that we had been a particularly generous government in the provision of assistance in this area.

* It states that the Family Court, which I concede may need looking at from time to time, shall have regard to the need to protect the institution of marriage and family life generally, the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their **welfare**, and the means available to assist parties to the marriage to consider reconciliation and the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage.

* Mrs Justice  Wiratmo visited Australia from 5th July to 26th July to exchange views with Australian jurists and officials, particularly about social **welfare** legislation, juvenile courts and systems of appointment to the judiciary.

* Beyond the substantial improvements to **welfare** services many areas of expenditure are specifically geared to maximise benefits for low income earners.

* This is the principle for the allocation of funds for schools under the Schools Commission program, for child care, for local government under the Grants Commission, for community health centres and hospitals, for **welfare** housing, for area improvement programs, for the Australian assistance plan and for Aboriginal advancement.

* What possible basis for national cooperation would there be if we were to punish the vast majority of Australians who will benefit under our community and **welfare** program?

* Our national **welfare** expenditure is to be increased by $148m and expenditure on capital works by $78m.

* If so, did section 1 of the Bill declare that it is the public policy of the State that, in order to safeguard the life, health, property, and public **welfare** of its citizens, the production sales and use of motor fuels and the pollution caused by the additives in motor fuels is a matter affecting the public interest, and that a reduced tax on motor fuels containing grain alcohol as a substitute for lead additives is necessary for the reduction of pollution and will further serve as an incentive for the agricultural economy in the State.

* The States Grants (Home Care) Act provides for the Commonwealth to, first, pay to a participating State an amount equal to half its expenditure for approved home care services; secondly, to contribute up to one-third of the capital cost of a senior citizens' centre, on a matching basis with a participating State or a local governing body in a participating State; thirdly to pay half the salary of a **welfare** officer employed at, or in conjunction with, a senior citizens' centre.

* I was particularly pleased to hear the Governor-General say that the overriding consideration must be the **welfare** of the patient.

* The House of Representatives should have the courage and the power to make decisions on these matters which are so vital to the **welfare** of the people we represent.

* I believe there is a real and pressing case for decentralisation of authority and that local governments will best perform many governmental functions in such critical areas as **welfare**, culture and the environment.

* During his period in Parliament, the Minister has been active in many areas of social reform including housing, health, social **welfare** and education.

* Their propaganda was so effective that many of the small businessmen did not stop to ask what was going to replace the sudden stoppage of public works when hospitals, schools, preschools, aged persons accommodation, **welfare** housing, growth centres, sewerage works and employment creation schemes were stopped or cut back.

* 1 ) Is it a fact that many religious, service, **welfare** and country-based organisations are unable to continue publication and distribution of essential literature as a result of postal increases effective at the beginning of 1 979.

* The subjects of these committees will be foreign affairs and defence; finance and trade; health and **welfare**; primary industry and national development; transport and communications; education, science and arts; and legal, home and internal territory affairs.

* Those categories included the personnel of the Australian Comforts Fund, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Salvation Army and similar **welfare** organisations whose personnel served after 3 September 1939.

* Then, of course, there are provisions for the **welfare** and custody of children and the general requirement that proper arrangements in all the circumstances have to be made for the **welfare** of the children before the decree nisi becomes absolute.

* Yet, members of the Labor Party go home and say that they have increased **welfare** benefits and that the people should be happy about that The people will realise, as the months roll on, just what a disaster this Budget has been.

* Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health  (Question No.

* Let Government supporters tell us what the position is today in Phuoc Tuy Province and those areas where Australian blood was shed, where Australian money was spent and where we devoted a great proportion of our resources to help establish the sort of administration that we believed should be established in South Vietnam - an honest, forthright administration working for the **welfare** of the people of South Vietnam.

* The Child Care Standards Committee has five educationists qualified as pre-school teachers, an authority on child psychology who was a principal of a Kindergarten Teachers Training College, one eminent psychiatrist, one social worker with special experience in child care and a senior administrator in a State **welfare** depanment.

* Ohe of the greatest difficulties in improving **welfare** payments has been what was described in the Budget speech as the erosion of the tax base.

* This Budget gives great emphasis to the areas of education, health, social security and **welfare**, housing and community amenities, culture and recreation, Aboriginal advancement, sport, tourism, aid for States, transport and communications.

* I ask: Will the  Deputy  Prime Minister now give the House an unequivocal assurance- as his predecessor, I understand, did- that when he does become the Treasurer he will not recommend the withdrawal of taxation deductibility of donations to voluntary **welfare** organisations?

* The issues are vast and the **welfare** and prosperity of most of the Australian people one way or another is involved.

* It has become clear that the Arab bloc- the greatest beneficiaries, along with the Third World nations, of UN aid and expertise- is willing to risk destruction of the specialised agencies even if this means depriving millions of people, including its own, of health, **welfare**, educational and other direct assistance.

* The Waterside Workers Federation in particular saw it as an additional hindrance to its aim of improving the **welfare** of its members and were, indeed still are, particularly resentful at the role the ASAI played in inflicting penalties on wharfies that were harsher than any that applied to other workers throughout the nation under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

* Can the Minister confirm or deny widely published reports that his Government intends to renegotiate the Commonwealth and States Housing Agreement with a view to increasing interest rates for **welfare** housing, raising interest rates for defence service homes, selling off land for defence service homes estates and doubling the period of service to establish eligibility for defence service homes?

* It certainly concerns the **welfare** of ex-servicemen.

* Accordingly, on Thursday, 27th September, 1979, I telephoned the prison and spoke to the acting **Welfare** Officer.

* The Government decided that improvements must be effected in all aspects of our aid endeavours- in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the **welfare** and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various programs, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the Government's aid efforts.

* The humble petition of citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1, It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Unfortunately, the areas in which the standard of service declined most dramatically were those which were concerned most closely with dispensing **welfare** to people in most need such as pensioners, the sick, the handicapped people and, above all, the people who were made unemployed by the Government's ill-advised economic policy of cutting back government expenditure.

* The field services and counselling services of the child **welfare** branch have been delayed.

* He said that all Territory residents eventually would have sufficient income to live without work or **welfare** if they so chose.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for building extensions and purchase of equipment for the Mandurah Girl Guides Association submitted by the Mandurah Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commissioner to his Department.

* This will be used for grants to non-governmental organisations for a wide range of purposes - for **welfare** work, adult education, the provision and running of hostels, support of the arts, crafts and cultural activities, support of youth and sporting activities, Aboriginal housing societies and for pre-schooling provided by private organisations.

* The effectiveness of these policies will be measured by the rate at which progress over the coming years justifies the elimination of measures of social **welfare** assistance directed at Aboriginal Australians as such, by the increasing contribution to the national product by Aboriginal Australians, and also by the increasing contribution to the varied pattern of Australian social life made by their traditions and culture.

* Greater capital advances for large companies operating in Australia do not mean a thing for the **welfare** of the people of Australia unless we have humane manpower policies running parallel with the sort of assistance that is being given to industry.

* I am concerned about the **welfare** of this constituent of mine.

* What we ought to do is to see that all the health and **welfare** facilities of the Repatriation Department and the facilities of the War Service Homes Division are made available for people who are already serving, and they should be made available at least to those who have received an honourable discharge.

* That is where all the money to provide all the social **welfare** programs comes from.

* Without company profit and profitability there would be no tax by which programs of social **welfare**, health and education can be provided.

* Human **welfare** and real people are involved iri this.

* But there has never been an advance in social **welfare**, or in public economic management that such members have ever received in any other way.

* It assumes that NEAT is some kind of **welfare** scheme in which the beneficiaries receives a little extra for doing some retraining instead of just waiting for a job to turn up.

* It was conceived not as a **welfare** program but rather as a crucial part of an active manpower program in which the principal aim is to ensure that the labour market is well balanced; that is, that the numbers offering for employment in each occupation are as nearly as possible equal to the job opportunities available for each occupation.

* Given that the scheme's objective is to overcome structural imbalances in the labour force, it is far more appropriate to set the allowances on criteria that reflect the labour market nature of the program rather than on an irrelevant **welfare** concept.

* In doing so, it observed that allowances payable in some of the then existing training schemes were based on the appropriate **welfare** benefit plus a supplementary training allowance.

* In view of what is now happening, it is extraordinarily interesting to note that the Committee decided nevertheless to reject the **welfare** approach and did so on the advice of then Department of Labor, which Department recommended not only abandonment of the **welfare** approach but also that the allowance be based on the average adult male award wage.

* Even though my financial interest in the industry and in the company is not very great, I will admit, I do feel a great degree of commitment to the **welfare** of the Australian beef industry.

* The Bill is an integral part of the Government's comprehensive program for the advancement and **welfare** of the Cocos people.

* I know there are difficulties within the social **welfare** section of my Department.

* I would like to inform the member for the Australian Capital Territory and the House that the Department of tie Interior has been undertaking a review of the general structure of the administration of the social **welfare** section of the Department.

* But the plain fact is that if the Government wants those who have the responsibility of governing the RSL in every State and at the Federal level to become less interested in the matters that affect the **welfare** of exservicemen obviously it has to distract the attention from the paucity of the Government's attitude to the payment of compensation to those who have served this country in 2 world wars and in Korea and who are now serving Australia in Vietnam.

* This is a completely unwarranted procedure in terms of **welfare** criteria.

* This imposes unwarranted demands on the **welfare** services and resources of these devoted organisations.

* The amendment merely supports the contention of those who have responsibility to attend to matters affecting the **welfare** of servicemen of this country.

* That the Commissioners have access to all Federal authorities' records relating to health, social security, matrimonial causes and income tax and have power to seek the co-operation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions and including the State Law Enforcement and Child **Welfare** agencies.

* As far as practicable the Commissioners to comprise a mother experienced in social **welfare**, a medical practitioner, and a criminologist.

* As a nation we have far to go and we have much to do in areas such as education, health, **welfare** and the development of human and natural resources.

* What (a) interest, (b) redemptions, (c) revenue, (d) grants, (e) gifts and loan moneys has the Commonwealth (including its banks) in the last financial year (i) paid to and (ii) received from (A) State, local or semi-government authorities, (B) autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations and overseas aid recipients and (C) private interests, including interest paid to overseas lenders less Australian tax thereon.

* Contrary to continuing and unfounded rumours, the Bill confirms the Government's continuing and vital interest in the **welfare** of those who have served their country.

* However, the Department arranged, on behalf of the Social **Welfare** Commission, for  Mr R.  Myers of the University of New South Wales to plan and conduct a training course for Social Planners.

* I am glad to see that the Opposition spokesman for social **welfare** and related matters is at the table because I believe he would agree wholeheartedly with this view.

* Finally, would he be prepared to receive some members of the deputation of the **Welfare** Committee for Refugees from Indo-China who I understand are in Canberra today?

* Nobody could criticise the **welfare** payments which are being made to people who are in need.

* In supporting it I personally hope that a continuing review is maintained so that the scheme can be further improved with the objective of assisting not only the migrants in Australia in a personal sense but also improving the whole **welfare** of this country.

* The Government had desired on the one hand to maintain its program to increase social **welfare** and on the other hand to meet the urgent need to curb inflation and unemployment and at the same time to stabilise the economy.

* These are the acts of genuine **welfare** that the people of the Territories are entitled to expect.

* Extension of **welfare** payments to beef producers.

* They include public works and services, recreation facilities, council properties, car parking, health and **welfare**, fire prevention, town planning, inspection licensing, tourist promotion, libraries, et cetera.

* Sir Billy  Snedden who is not exactly an unimportant authority said at a  meeting  of local government councillors in Melbourne in 1974: 
3 ) Any current or future planning for the further development of Commonwealth rehabilitation services and facilities on a regional basis would have regard to the existence of all health, education and **welfare** services and facilities within the region.

* The Australian Labor Government established the Social **Welfare** Commission in 1973 with a broad range of responsibilities in the social **welfare** area.

* The Commission, in turn, set up on 12 November 1973, a Working Party on Social **Welfare** Manpower under Section 1 4 (f) of its Act- to consider and report to the Minister on measures designed to provide skilled staff for the successful implementation of social **welfare** programs.

* The right honourable member's questions are being considered within the general context of the Working Party's examination of **welfare** manpower issues.

* Various studies have been undertaken on particular aspects of **welfare** manpower, e.g.

* The use of the term 'social **welfare** workers' can be interpreted as inclusive or exclusive of many occupations depending on the parameters one cares to accept.

* In the 1971 Census the occupational classification of social worker included, for example, counsellor, moral re-armament worker, **welfare** officer, refuge worker, youth worker and social worker.

* In general, the Bill ensures that the Wheat Board, and through it the wheat industry, sustains no extra costs through undertaking alternative financing arrangements for the 1978-79 season's crop and so contributing to the economic **welfare** of the nation as a whole.

* Again, this will enable the States to devote more of their housing funds to **welfare** housing programmes.

* Secondly, there is the rental assistance grant, which is an entirely new **welfare** proposal, and one which is designed to help those in the greatest need.

* Thirdly, there is the new provision regarding Service housing, which is intended to assist the States to allocate more funds to **welfare** housing proposals.

* 1 give an undertaking to the honourable member for Sturt that the report on his proposal will be available as quickly as possible and on the Treasurer's return this weekend I will put to him for consideration the suggestion that the proposal should go to the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat.

* It is true also that there have been discussions over a couple of years now about a series of multi-lingual **welfare** officers to help in the attack on the problems which have been created by the unplanned movement of people into the cities.

* Similarly, expenditure on health, hospitals and **welfare** is the lowest for any State.

* The Albury-Wodonga Interim Regional Working Committee for **Welfare** Education and **Welfare** Coordination is the body initially funded under the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Quite clearly it is designed to achieve a political aim and not to contribute to the **welfare** of the people the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  claims to support, namely the professional engineers of Australia.

* There are the side effects from the fact that the family is financially overcommitted, and of course this is when the Government has to do something about social **welfare**, social services, health or in some other field.

* Research into these and many other fields is being undertaken in universities, in government departments and agencies, in voluntary health and **welfare** agencies, and by private individuals.

* The amendment seeks to insert the following words:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres.

* That all words after 'That* be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: "The House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres'.

* The Government also looked at the 6 official members of the Legislative Council and, against the backdrop that it thought the Northern Territory should have a much greater degree of attention than it has been given before, the Government decided that rather than have the 6 official members from the Department of the Northern Territory, and as the new approach is specialisation with special attention being given to health, education and Aboriginal **welfare**, that each of those specialised departments should be represented on the Legislative Council.

* These include State National Fitness Councils, youth and community services organisations, sporting groups, local authorities, **welfare** agencies, schools and churches.

* 1 ) There have been eight meetings held between Federal and State officials to discuss the possible implementation of recommendations in the first report of the Task Force on Coordination in **Welfare** and Health and the report of the Committee on the Care of the Aged and the Infirm.

* I believe the Government's action in this matter has again shown its concern for the **welfare** of the Australian communities suffering adverse effects from international economic conditions.

* Bearing in mind that impartiality between the communities in Lebanon is very important, but that humane and timely aid to the people is even more important, will the Australian Government encourage and even support nonGovernment **welfare** organisations to dispatch medical teams to Lebanon, to work in any areas where they are needed and welcomed, as recommended in the report entitled 'The Lebanon Crisis- Humanitarian Aspects' tabled in December 1976 by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.

* I hope that this Parliament will look at the matter from a moral point of view and from the point of view of the **welfare** of the Australian community and the moral standing and future of this nation.

* It promised to set up under a particular Act in 1969 a **welfare** system that would help to keep these kinds of patients in their own homes.

* Since the Army establishment at Holsworthy, New South Wales, was added to my electorate in 1977, I have naturally taken an interest in the **welfare** of serving members of the forces.

* We know that the Health Bills are designed to bring about the nationalisation of medicine in Australia - to bring about a more expensive and less efficient system of looking after the health and **welfare** of the Australian people.

* Governments have increased social **welfare** payments, they have become more heavily committed to education, and they have provided services in those areas where free enterprise showed no interest or have taken over those services where free enterprise was unable to make a profit.

* 1 ) While my Department does not undertake or commission opinion polls, considerable survey work is undertaken in conjunction with its evaluation of ongoing programs, internal administrative arrangements and overall assessment of the **welfare** needs of the community.

* The Research Information System maintained by my Department indicates that since 1975 the Department has been involved in 87 research projects, excluding Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and Social **Welfare** Commission undertakings.

* It has cut back on education, on **welfare** housing for Aborigines, on child minding centres and on a host of other things on which it cannot properly justify cutting back.

* The main thrust of my argument will be directed at showing that inflation and inadequate increases in **welfare** benefits are causing intolerable hardships for people in these groupings.

* I rise to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden)  not only because I believe in the amendment fervently but because I happen to represent an electorate which has more people who are concerned with social **welfare** than any other electorate in Australia.

* I believe that both sides of this House ought to try to stop scoring political points on the question of social **welfare**.

* Let me quote again from 'Health and **Welfare** in Canada 1969*.

* This publication states: 
It extends federal sharing to include the following costs, which were not shared under the Unemployment Assistance Act: The cost of assistance to needy mothers with dependent children, maintenance of children in the care of provincially approved child **welfare** agencies, health care services to needy persons, and the extension of **welfare** services to prevent or remove causes of  dependency or to assist recipients in achieving self-support.

* **Welfare** services may include rehabilitation services; casework; counselling and assessment services; adoption services and homemaker, day-care and similar services supplied to persons in need or  to  persons to whom the service is essential if they are to remain selfsupporting.

* I would hope that a longer term effect will be to cause all registered organisations to attempt to manage their operations with greater economy and efficiency and to be mindful of their principal objective which must be the **welfare** of their contributors.

* It provides for the **welfare**, over a short period, of thousands of people and it involves tremendous sums of money.

* One of the better services provided by the Parramatta City Council- a similar situation applies in almost every other local government area- is a mealsonwheels setup which is of course organised through the old people's **welfare** establishments.

* In the last 12 months the Council has been continuing to exchange correspondence with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  protesting about the fact that the subsidy which has traditionally been paid by the Commonwealth Government towards the salary of the **welfare** officers has been reduced from twothirds to one half, which seems to me to be a fairly penny-pinching sort of operation, anyhow.

* I would think that there would be a reasonable argument that could be made out to try to coerce the Minister for Health to do something about his sister department, the Department of Social Security, seeing whether some good sense could be brought to bear to ensure that subsidies- as low as they were before with two-thirds of the salary of **welfare** officers being found by the Government- were restored to a reasonable level and also with a view to seeing that the 50c a day pittance paid to Meals on Wheels was increased to a figure more in line with the actual cost.

* The final report of the Committee will be submitted to the Social **Welfare** Commission and it is expected that a report and recommendations will be presented to the Government before the end of May.

* It does seem though, as honourable members from this side have pointed out, that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  with all his great talk about social justice and what he would do for the people of Australia, has proved that he is a bits and pieces and patch up man in respect of social **welfare**.

* The Minister is very critical of members of the Opposition when we talk of social **welfare**.

* This real social **welfare** scheme was pioneered by people from this side of the Parliament.

* The fact of the matter is, as the honourable member for Scullin  (Dr Jenkins)  said, that this Government has never made a survey of what is required in the field of social **welfare** in respect of Meals on Wheels.

* The fact of the matter is that the Minister will not admit that, instead of accepting his responsibility under the Constitution for the **welfare** of the aged, he is passing the buck onto voluntary institutions from one end of this country to the other.

* He is always boasting about what has been done by this Government in the field of social **welfare**.

* Another factor which should be considered in relation to this Bill is this: Why does not the Government subsidise meals which are served in the **welfare** centres conducted by various councils throughout the Commonwealth?

* When all is said and done, these meals are being served to the aged in **welfare** centres.

* Commendable as it is to subsidise even in the minimum way that the Government has done in respect of those people who will be served meals in their own homes, these organisations that conduct these services to which people come, such as **welfare** centres, also should be entitled to the benefits of the legislation.

* If this is the best contribution that the present Minister for Social Services can make to the **welfare** of aged people it is a long, long way to that haven of security that they have all longed for.

* I hope that members on the Government side will be as extravagant with money for social **welfare** purposes as they are in other fields.

* The final point I wish to make is that the relationship of one country to another in an exchange sense is vital to its economic and trading interests and when we do take our decision we will, as the Prime Minister said in his statement, take a decision that is in the best interests of the country's economy and the **welfare** of its people.

* I think it would be a highly desirable development for the Commonwealth, in expansion of its current interest in the further **welfare** of these homes, not simply to require that the financial position of the homes should be made available on demand to the Director-General, but that it should be made available annually as a matter of course to the Director-General, and also that any information appearing therein should automatically be available to the residents of the homes themselves.

* Members of the Opposition said as recently as yesterday that the Government shows little interest in matters such as Aboriginal **welfare** and education.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* I believe that this Bill, which is designed to grant financial assistance to the States in connection with the **welfare** and advancement of the Aboriginal people of Australia, is an anachronism in anybody's language.

* Their confidence must be sapped and it would scarcely be surprising if they became rather bitter and anti-social, particularly when the Government that is doing nothing to alleviate their position also adopts a suspicious, if not hostile attitude to them and treats them as bludgers on the **welfare** rolls rather than as people in need of help.

* I quote the following from a booklet entitled,  Towards a New Australia,  containing an article attributed to the honourable member for Oxley and entitled  New Horizons in Health and **Welfare** Services: 
There has been a severe restriction and scrutiny of government expenditure.

* Despite these cuts in revenue, the funding of health, education, transport, defence and **welfare** has been maintained at very adequate levels.

* Indeed, the principle that in the health and **welfare** area those who can afford to pay should do so, and that public funds should be reserved for those in need, and only those in need, I submit is a valid one.

* They have used the pensioners and social **welfare** purely and simply as a political football.

* The Combined Pensioners Association has attested constantly to the inadequacy of existing provisions for those who through infirmity, ill fortune or old age have been forced to rely for extended periods on the benefits of our so-called **welfare** state.

* Although the goals and principles of Labor's social **welfare** policy have been set out, the necessary administrative flexibility will only be possible if all involved recognised that the content of social **welfare** is the process of interaction of all involved.

* The success of Labor's approach to planning for the future in this field will depend on the willingness of both social security and social service agencies to work together for the social and political goals involved, and on the co-operation achieved among social, medical, vocational and other members of the **welfare** establishment.

* The real danger facing the Australia of the future is that we could retain the post-depression neurosis as the basis for our thinking about **welfare**.

* It is essential for Labor to be aware of the rationalisations behind this relegation of **welfare** to the bottom of the priority list.

* For example, it is often argued that the development of adequate **welfare** programmes would reduce the will to work or reduce the competitive struggle which keeps society going.

* One need only look at those countries which have highly developed **welfare**- services - such as Canada and Scandanavia - to see that productivity continues to remain high, and improves as the standard of living improves.

* Labor is aware that the wrong questions have been asked about **welfare** expenditure over the post-war period.

* The needlessly expensive consequences of inadequate social **welfare** provision can be well illustrated by considering the immediate cost of the breakdown of a single large family.

* The result is the reverse of the pattern predicted by the knockers of **welfare** programming.

* The most important item of the **welfare** programme must therefore be the development of a new spirit in this country - a spirit of human fellowship which will create a collective national effort for better conditions for all members of the community.

* In determining the appropriate content for the social **welfare** programme one of the greatest difficulties is to decide how much emphasis should be placed on meeting the needs of individuals and families in trouble and how much to place on overall schemes which improve the standard of living of the whole community.

* He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general **welfare**, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived.

* I remind the honourable member that **welfare** housing is for those who need it- the low income group.

* He said himself that it is the responsibility of the Australian Government to fund adequately the social **welfare** services throughout Australia.

* Provides for cuts in real terms in expenditure for traditional federal areas such as **welfare** housing, hospital and health services, pre-school and child care centres, legal aid, school dental schemes, growth centres, sewerage and other programs; 
I consider, moreover, that the aspects to which I have referred represent only the 'tip of the iceberg' and that there is a need for a complete re-assessment of the whole concept of this aged persons homes program.

* I have accordingly referred the matter to the National Commission on Social **Welfare**, which in turn has appointed a Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing Policies.

* I appeal to people involved in local government to submit their views on measures that could be taken to stimulate the interest of councils, because I consider them to be uniquely situated to play a leading role in this field of social **welfare**.

* As I explained at the outset, in the context of the Government's comprehensive **welfare** plans this Bill represents only a small interim measure, designed to maintain the value, in terms of purchasing power, of the assistance being given to aged persons hostels.

* Finally, does this policy being pursued by the Victorian Government endanger the **welfare** of migrant school children and does the Minister's failure to prevent it represent a dereliction of bis responsibilities?

* I know that the general practitioner groups who have criticised the scheme and have offered alternatives have done so honourably and with the **welfare** of the public and the type of medical service available to the public as their prime motivation.

* The income test on unemployment benefit will be subject to review as part of the Government's overall Budget examination of social **welfare** programs and policies.

* Yet this Government has for so long turned its eye away from that obvious approach to the social **welfare** structure.

* The following is a list of the Army and Air Force **welfare** and amenities programs which have been assisted by the disbursement of ASCO profits since 1959: 
It is foolish to ignore the very real problems of the poor people in Bourke and to think that they are as close to attention and to social **welfare** as the poor people in Bondi are.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* I was interested in this regard in an observation made a few weeks ago by the Premier of Queensland when talking about the difficulties which he and his Government face in recruiting sufficient people to work in the field of **welfare** for Aborigines, lt has often seemed to me that those who demonstrate, whatever the form of demonstration, might well look to more beneficial and fruitful form in displaying their concern than simply to seek publicity, whatever the form of search might be.

* Information has been provided by the New South Wales Directorate of Aboriginal **Welfare**: 
It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people .of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* We saw that happen last week in the debate on the concessional rate for what is called the 'low income earner' in relation to the **welfare** housing agreement.

* At the moment we have a concessional rate of  5V6  per cent on the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement - 
My concern- I repeat this because it is an important factor which I want to stress- is that in an endeavour to get a balanced budget, or close to a balanced budget, the Commissions will reduce those services which are not profitable to them without regard to the contribution made by the less densely populated areas; and without regard to the national prosperity through increases in gross domestic product and the increase in national export earnings which, in themselves, are essential to the **welfare** and the prosperity of Australia and, through that, to all Australians.

* He tells us he is going to put value back in the **welfare** dollar, whatever that may mean.

* However, research is continuing under the auspices of the Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** in the United States of America.

* The question of promotion of dairy products is one which must be pursued vigorously by the Australian Dairy Corporation and by anybody who has any interest in the **welfare** of dairy farmers in Australia.

* If they do not, then I have to say that, despite the requirements laid down under conventions for us to check on their **welfare** from time to time, the blunt reality is that they must bear the consequences of their own behaviour.

* He tried to say that this Government had no interest in the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people in Queensland and to suggest that the Government had taken no part in the action that was brought by the people of Aurukun to challenge the exercise of the position of trustee by the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement in Queensland.

* The honourable member for Leichhardt put the matter into perspective when he discussed the **welfare** of the people involved and the need for them to be consulted.

* I repeat that that was a most important contribution to Australia's **welfare**.

* Under the arrangements of the Queensland Government some royalties are payable into a **welfare** fund for all the Aborigines of Queensland as a result of mining at Aurukun.

* When it was pointed out to the Minister (a) that nobody would regard it as compensation for the owner of a property if that owner were European to inform him that his property was being disposed of for the benefit of all the people of Queensland and he would have his share in that, and (b) that it would be perfectly easy to use the royalties in a **welfare** fund as a means of reducing the payment of other consolidated revenue into the fund, to no ultimate real benefit to Aborigines, the Minister made a priceless reply.

* The authors also wish to pay tribute to Sister A. Cameron of Aurukun mission and Sister I. C. Black of Doomadgee mission, the results of whose dedicated work in health and infant **welfare** over many years are recorded in this paper.

* This has been of serious concern to those interested in the **welfare** of migrants.

* The **welfare** waiting lists around Australia have been reduced.

* So we are having some success in reducing **welfare** housing lists.

* I can well remember that in the first couple of weeks of holding the post of Minister for Repatriation I raised with senior officers of the Department this matter of the **welfare** of people who had been prisoners of war.

* Now it is finding that it is caught with these promises and will have to make huge increases in repatriation and other social **welfare** votes in order to meet those promises.

* Where and when have there been meetings of Ministers concerned with child **welfare** since March 1970 (Hansard, 13th October 1970, page 2082, 9th March 1971, page 750 and 29th September 1971 page 1698).

* In most cases this category of centre is required lo register wilh State **welfare** authorities, who exercise some measure of supervision over the physical but not necessarily the educational standards of these centres.

* However, it surely is valid economics to provide increased subsidies in relation to increased costs in favour of those citizens whose voluntary contribution to the nation's **welfare** provides education for 22 per cent of Australian youth.

* It provides data for economic and social planning and for assessing the need for and the impact of housing, education, **welfare** and taxation policies.

* Will the Prime Minister invite Archbishop Loane to supply him with a report on the degree and nature of hardship suffered by certain sections of the community in the Sydney diocese, derived from the information available through the **welfare** and pastoral services of his church, with a view to providing appropriate and more adequate aid to those who are suffering hardship?

* If it involved further cutbacks in areas like education and social **welfare**, this would mean there would be more unemployment in those areas as well.

* It can be seen from the statement that the transfer covers a wide range of important functions such as primary industry, child, family and community **welfare**, payroll tax and stamp duties.

* This Government basically would like to return to the pre- 19 72 days which are characterised in this country by public squalor, by the failure to provide adequate public provision in schools, in health and in social **welfare**.

* I wish to make the point constructively and sincerely that much of the administration of areas of our social **welfare** services, be it unemployment benefits, NEAT applications or other forms of pensions, is in a mess.

* I think that the average person feels that damage is being done in social **welfare** areas particularly in a time of need.

* Generally people in country areas are of a higher average age than elsewhere and it has been pointed out that unemployment and other problems in relation to **welfare** are generally greater in the country than in the city.

* The major argument against the Government, its attitude to **welfare** and its so-called concern with the ordinary Australian is none of the points that I have made, valid though they are.

* No matter what this Government does by this Bill or any other piece of legislation, the overall result of the Government's actions to ordinary Australians is a dangerous reduction in the **welfare** of the people of this country.

* Indeed, I go further than that and acknowledge that the Bill presently before the House, even unamended, represents an important advance in our social **welfare** thinking.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for establishing facilities at the Pinjarra Methodist Youth Club submitted by the Murray Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated that a reassessment of the aged persons homes program is being undertaken at the moment by the National Commission on Social **Welfare** and pending the receipt of the Commission's report no major changes are contemplated.

* As I said in my second reading speech, there are a number of people outside the scope of the present **welfare** housing assistance programs run by the States who are unable to make satisfactory financial arrangements to purchase a dwelling.

* Second there is a tendency for even the most representative organisation to become inward-looking and to get out of touch with the people whose **welfare** it is supposed to serve.

* In addition, within the **welfare** society, we needed to establish the circumstances, particularly in relation to health, in which people would do for themselves what they could properly do for themselves, pay what they could be expected to pay for themselves and be protected by government only when the situation was likely to get beyond an individual's or a family's resources.

* The Treasurer used the argument that if we are to have this payment system we should have it on a **welfare** basis.

* The one time that this Government has put this policy of **welfare** into play in agriculture it has been disastrous.

* That was with one of its fruit compensation schemes because of currency revaluation whereby it paid $12 a ton up to the **welfare** cutoff point on the one hand, and on the other hand took away $10 a ton right across the board.

* Nobody in the fruit industry wants a repeat of that **welfare** performance.

* The records of the Aborigines **Welfare** Boa id relating to Crown Land reserved for the use of Aborigines were incomplete and at present action is in hand to bring those records up to date.

* In 1952, the then Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, introducing the Fisheries Bill, informed the House that the intention of the legislation was to provide for conservation of the fishery resources of Australia, The Government now believes that the Act should be broadened to provide not only for conservation but also for the orderly conduct and general **welfare** of the fishing industry, including the rational utilisation of the living marine resources and the rational development of the fishing industry at all levels.

* Under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, financial assistance may be granted by the Commonwealth to the States in relation to the provision of Home Care Services and Senior Citizens' Centres, and **welfare** officers employed in connection with Senior Citizens' Centres.

* Mr CHIPP (Hotham)- by leave - When the Minister for Health  (Dr Everingham)  is replying will he also answer the question asked by the honourable member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer)  as to whether between now and the passage of this Bill through the Senate he will give consideration to amending the Bill to allow for reports under this Bill to be treated in the same way as are reports that are submitted to the Minister under the Social **Welfare** Commission Bill?

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House congratulates the Government on its continuing action to restrict inflation and its effects on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving **welfare** payments and condemns the Opposition for placing in jeopardy the improvement in living standards of all Australians since 2 December 1972 by its action to defer the passage of the Budget.'.

* The breach of our promises to continue the Australian Assistance Plan, wage indexation, the value of the currency, the Social **Welfare** Commission, increased research on solar energy, are matters which have disturbed me greatly.

* Pursuant to section 34 of the Services Trust Funds Act 1947 I present the annual report of the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund, the Austraiian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund for the year ended 31 December 1977, together with financial statements and the report of the AuditorGeneral on these statements.

* It will destroy once and for all the right of the trade unions to organise their own affairs and to work fearlessly for the **welfare** of their union members.

* Above all, it is an ideology which strikes at the economic **welfare** of the Australian workers and one which we must resist.

* If not, can we forecast possible future  problems for the health and **welfare** of the Australian people?

* Somebody else has been charged with effectively cheating social **welfare** benefits and it is suggested that the overwhelming public interest is in ensuring that we deal not with the former matter because it is more important that we concentrate on the latter.

* It should be distributed for the **welfare** of the whole community through general wage adjustments, by lower prices or improved standards of service.

* I welcome the increase in pensions and the opportunity to speak on the Social Services Bill because it allows me to emphasise the Opposition's recognition of the importance of social **welfare** measures.

* It is, in fact, a matter of public record that the most effective and farreaching social **welfare** initiatives introduced in Australia have been the result of LiberalCountry Party governments.

* The record of the Government is yet to be established but it should note that the Opposition parties will be carefully analysing its initiatives and proposals in the field of social **welfare**.

* The problem is that this Government has allowed its ideological obsessions with this problem and with many others completely to obscure its view of the Australian community and its overall **welfare**.

* In this financial year $750,000 has been allocated to the States for the family planning associations within the States, including the Australian Catholic Social **Welfare** Commission for educational programs.

* Severe cutbacks in areas vital to the realisation of equal opportunity- education, child care, retraining, health, **welfare**, legal aid, et ceterahave been the order of the day under the Fraser administration.

* Was the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** in 1976 informed of the intelligence, surveillance and legal enforcement work carried out by the preventative section of his Department; if not, why not.

* Shops (to provide day-to-day needs); play areas, infant health and pre-school child **welfare** centres; meeting hall; and schools.

* The absence of both parents from the home leads to increased demands for child care facilities and **welfare** services which are provided as a matter of course in the traditional one income family.

* The family allowance system introduced last year was a significant social reform but many of the social **welfare** activists in our community have not given sufficient credit to the Government for that reform.

* However, the Commonwealth in the administration of the Children's Services Program recognises that the basic responsibility for the regulation, licensing and provision of child **welfare** lies with State governments.

* There are more and more parents who are concerned about the direction of education, about the fact that some of the basic skills which we in Australia for many years have taken for granted as part of the education system are not being taught and that some of the other factors to which I have referred tonight are being stressed to the detriment of the **welfare** of the students of Australia.

* I quote from an article headed 'Benefits Paid Abroad Under OASDHI' which is a publication of the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare**.

* The experience to which this article refers is as follows: 
to (6) A suitably qualified worker was appointed to conduct research into community **welfare** needs in the Mount Morgan area but was unable to take up the appointment.

* (a) and (b), (i) and (ii), (A) and (B) The following tables show enrolments in Northern Territory Community Schools operated by my Department and enrolments in ' schools operated by the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration.

* In view of his address to the Victorian State Council of the Liberal Party in which he foreshadowed further reductions in expenditure on health and **welfare** services in this year's Budget, I ask: Will he assure the House that the Government will not restore the means test on pensions for persons over the age of 70 years or reintroduce university fees and loans in breach of the 1975 election commitments?

* It is also influenced by the priorities which Aboriginals in different communities and regions attach to the provision of housing as compared with programs to meet other needs and by the extent to which State Governments through their housing authorites give priority to the housing needs of Aboriginals eligible for **welfare** housing.

* Is the Minister able to state what percentage of annual budget appropriations are committed to Social Security and **welfare** outlays by national governments in (a) the United States of America, (b) the United Kingdom, (c) Canada, (d) Australia, (e) New Zealand, (0 Sweden, (g) Denmark, (h) the Netherlands, (j) France, (k) West Germany and (1) Japan.

* It was agreed that the Commonwealth pay money to the States, to be allocated through the child **welfare** departments to provide some assistance to women with children born Outside marriage.

* At a time when unemployment is expected to climb dramatically unemployment benefits are to be cut by nearly $34m; Aboriginal **welfare** is to be cut by $33m; migrant education by $ 10m; urban and environmental improvement programs by $ 142m; while wealthy mining corporations are given rich bounty.

* The principal threat to the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people, and the one they most fear, is constituted by the large numbers of people who can be expected to enter the area.

* Let me comment on one particular category of Budget expenditure, namely, social security and **welfare**.

* Again, despite the cries that we have heard about cutbacks in social **welfare** expenditure, it must be pointed out that this area of the Budget has been the subject of a 7 per cent increase in expenditure in this financial year.

* We people who are given by our colleagues in the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party shadow ministerial responsibilities in the economic area have few opportunities to follow our interests in social **welfare**.

* In addition charges are made for rubbish removal, for the attendance of a **welfare** sister and for a community centre.

* The only reason for this is that the Commonwealth Government - this Government which claims to have some sort of a social **welfare** policy - has an absolute contempt for people who are psychiatric patients.

* Because it arises in such a vital area of community **welfare** a number of competing interests come into play.

* The purpose of the embassy was to bring to the attention of members of Parliament and others, matters of complaint concerning the **welfare** of the Aboriginal race and in particular their land rights.

* It is designed both to clear the decks for progress in the years ahead and to ensure that in major areas of concern- social **welfare**, education, the quality of urban life- real forward moves are made immediately.

* On 2 December 1972, the Government established the Department of Aboriginal Affairs incorporating the former Office of Aboriginal Affairs with a large part of the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration.

* The Council for Aboriginal Affairs advised the government on all 
The decision to reorganise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be effected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours - in the machinery for formulating policy,, in ensuring greater attention to the **welfare** and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program.

* In company with my friend from Lilley I hold the view that the problems which are coming up and which must be dealt with in the Budget for 1975-76 are problems which will affect the **welfare** of all Australians, and in their direct capacities they must be able to withstand the impact of the policies that will be introduced.

* The other projects were received too late to be considered within the 1974-75 capital assistance program for recreation facilities but have been referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to the Community Recreation Council of Western Australia and will be considered for assistance in the context of the 1975-76 program.

* Members of the Labor Opposition are always mouthing platitudes about social priorities in **welfare**, education, urban renewal and so on, but from the way they talk one would think that they want to dissipate the recovery in a consumer boom.

* The Opposition believes that a proper immigration programme must have a basis of and work towards ensuring Australia's national and economic security, the **welfare** and integration of all its citizens and the balanced development of our nation.

* Chain migration enables the base families to act as **welfare** officers to migrants.

* The view that I have just expressed on the basis of the recommendations of the Poverty Commission was further supported in the paper by that Commission entitled  The **Welfare** of Migrants.

* In other words, that sector of the economy which does not produce wealth but tends to consume it took an increasing proportion of this nation's capacity to refill the pool from which **welfare** payments must be drawn.

* Unless we have a prosperous nation, we cannot afford the levels of **welfare** that honourable gentlemen opposite, in many cases quite rightly, sought to achieve.

* It is absolutely vital to the **welfare** of this country and when a political party states that it has an answer to the industrial problems of the day this Parliament should want to hear that answer.

* In **welfare**, I commend decisions on Aboriginal advancement, road safety, the increased subsidy to senior citizens centres and Meals on Wheels organisation and assistance to handicapped children.

* The bases of this Government's policies are our rejection of the use of force as a proper means of solving international problems; our belief in the democratic process and the rights of people to determine their own institutions; and our deep concern for the **welfare** of the underprivileged anywhere in the world.

* In turn this would be a great saving to the nation and would be of great benefit to us socially as well as being in the interests of the **welfare** of aged people.

* So apart from my concern for the **welfare** and well being of all these people, the problems of the migrant community are now of special significance to me.

* Melbourne 'Age' in July of this year which slated: 
10) What alternative source of **welfare** funds for servicemen will replace the distributed profits of the Organisation.

* 1 1 ) On what occasions has he withheld the distribution of profits to servicemen 's **welfare** and for what reasons.

* 1 7) Is he able to say whether the equivalent organisations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom make a contribution to service staff **welfare** funds; if so, what provision is made for this purpose.

* In the Department of Social Security they include the Australian Assistance Plan funds, which I have already mentioned: the grants to organisations under the Disabled Persons Homes Act, the Handicapped Persons As:sistance Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act: and funds for various community **welfare** organisations such as the Australian Council for Social Service and the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled.

* Yet the Opposition claims to be concerned about the **welfare** of the disadvantaged groups in our community.

* I urge the Government, in its assessment and reexamination of the social **welfare** system, to get a co-ordinated plan to ensure that retention rates for people on low incomes are increased, that the tax system and the social security system are harmonised, that one department is used to administer the test to be applied, and that the heavy burden placed on low income earners is removed.

* I mention a few -  Mr James  Oswin in the Department of the Media -  Dr Don  McMichael in the new Department of Environment and Conservation -  Mrs Marie  Coleman as head of the new Social **Welfare** Commission -  Mr Charles  Halton in the amalgamated Department of Transport.

* Some of the organisations have been given permanent statutory form, such as the Schools Commission, the Social **Welfare** Commission, the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, the Prices Justification Tribunal and the Pipeline Authority; others have had their statutory charter utterly transformed, such as the Grants Commission, the Cities Commission and the Industries Assistance Commission.

* No Government has done more for the **welfare** of women - and I do not mean simply women in need or women in obvious hardship.

* The Government accepts its basic responsibility to create for the people of Australia a secure environment in which they can maintain and develop their **welfare** free from fear, threats or artificial constraints whether internally or externally inspired or contrived.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* It will affect directly up to perhaps a quarter of a million rural producers and, indirectly, perhaps, one million people, lt is tremen dously important, not only in economic terms in connection with balance of payments but also in social terms from the point of view of human **welfare** and the suffering of individuals.

* At present there is a very great shortage of trained professional social **welfare** workers.

* I hope that in the future there will be professional social **welfare**, workers whose services will be an ordinary, natural, normal addition to the services which will be available to people living in a community.

* I hope these professional social **welfare** workers will be able to do what they can to relieve the pressures that build up which cannot be handled by some people in the complex industrial community that we live in today, and in which the complexity continues to grow.

* These people, I believe, under professional supervision by the professional social **welfare** workers and a local professionally qualified medical practitioner should involve themselves with advice on family planning.

* Families who adopt children are screened by profes sional social **welfare** workers and in most cases are more adequately equipped for parenthood than the natural mother and father.

* Nevertheless, I congratulate the Government on dropping everything contained on page 22 of the Budget Speech, which dealt with the proposed taxation of social **welfare** payments.

* 1 ) What was the Commonwealth Government's (a) appropriation for and (b) expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** in respect of (i) grants to each State and (ii) grants-in-aid during 1977-78.

* What is the Commonwealth Government's appropriation for Aboriginal **welfare** in each of these categories for 1978-79.

* The Committee has made a comprehensive examination of legal aid and has sought submissions from and has had discussions with legal professional bodies and **welfare** organisations throughout Australia.

* The Bill is an extension of the policy propounded by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and an extension of the policy outlined by the then Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon),  in his well known Australia Day address on Aboriginal **welfare**.

* Under the sub-heading 'Land Off Reserves' he said: 
The Research Advisory Committee assesses all research proposed under the aegis of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* It is a kick in the teeth for all those groups of concerned people, the people who set up the child minding collectives, the members of the residents associations, the people working in the area of social **welfare**, the Aboriginal groups with their legal and medical services and their housing projects.

* Commonwealth and State Ministers with responsibilities for health and **welfare** matters are currently being consulted on appropriate terms of reference for such an inquiry.

* Putting that to one side, at least we could agree that if uranium is to be mined the best possible codes governing the safety and **welfare** of workers in the industry ought to be produced.

* At the same time as this Government has given massive handouts to companies in the form of industry assistance totalling around $5,000m, it has reduced savagely social **welfare** spending in the last three Budgets.

* It is prepared to cut back ruthlessly on social **welfare** spending such as health, education, housing and protection of the environment, to make room for greater handouts to the corporate sector.

* We saw the cutting back even further of social **welfare** spending.

* The Fraser Government has continued to give a high priority to income security and social **welfare**.

* I suggest to the honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  that any government, insofar as social **welfare** benefits are concerned, should sharpen up where the handouts are made.

* Factors to be considered in this regard go well beyond the grant of assisted passages to Australia and include placement in employment in Australia which is significantly difficult at present and an assessment of the degree of reliance which any group may have on continuing social **welfare** payments and services.

* They should not be adjusted for the benefit of financial speculators who indulge in transactions which have nothing whatever to do with the **welfare** of people but have a great deal to do with their own speculamania'.

* It has to be realised that there is little the Australian Government can do, other than to check on the **welfare** of these people and their well-being within the prisons or wherever they may be incarcerated, when Australian citizens are apprehended overseas on drug charges; just as there is little that foreign governments can do within Australia if any of their nationals are arrested in Australia on similar charges.

* Regional Councils for Social Development are required to ensure that where any of the organisations funded by them are dissolved at some future date, or are unable for any reason to continue to apply the assets for purposes for which and in accordance with the terms upon which they were provided, the property, in any capital assets, funded under the Australian Assistance Plan should revert to the Council concerned so that, subject to the Australian Government approval, it may be recycled for other **welfare** purposes, within the region.

* One would think that all the initiatives in the health and **welfare** field had come in actual fact from the Australian Labor Party Government.

* So these social **welfare** benefits- pensions to the aged, the disabled, deserted mothers and their dependants, unemployment benefits and sickness benefits- were increased in proportion to what the nation could actually afford.

* I want to stress this point: The Opposition in government has intentions to provide for those people who are in need not to create a giant **welfare** state.

* One of the dangers of the massive **welfare** programs that are, as I see them, the aims of the Labor Government, is that they will tend to create in this nation people who do not care or who do not have any incentive.

* What requests or suggestions were made by the Ministers concerned with child **welfare** at their meeting in March 1970 for legislative or administrative action by (a) the Commonwealth, (b) the Territories and (c) the States.

* Staff to comprise of a full-time Project **Welfare** Officer and total budgetary requirements are for administrative purposes.

* They must be integrated with related economic and social policies in the areas of industry development, social **welfare** and education.

* The precise level of each grant will depend in part on the classification of the social worker or **welfare** officer employed.

* Does the Minister agree that the Navy has a special responsibility for the **welfare** of its sailors, some of whom are as young as 16 years and are far from their homes?

* 2326  (Hansard,  17 October 1978, page 1982), will he provide a detailed list of the **welfare** and amenities programs of both the Army and Air Force, which have been assisted by the $10m profit made by the Australian Services Canteens Organisation since 1959.

* Let us face the facts: The more difficult the Act, the greater is the collusion to defeat its provisions between the larger unions in the interests of their members and the employers with whom they are dealing, who co-operate in the interests of common sense and the **welfare** of their employees, who are associated with the unions.

* The Government is placing increasing emphasis on migrant counselling and selection, and also on English language training and migrant **welfare** services.

* The honourable member for Mackellar was Minister for Social Services and has taken a tremendous interest in social **welfare** over a long time.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has appointed 6 independent evaluators of the Australian Assistance Plan who will be producing separate reports evaluating the AAP in the 6 States.

* We are strongly and resolutely opposed to the Labor Party's preference for social **welfare** and wealth redistribution instead of production and productivity, and to its preference for irresponsible Government spending instead of the meaningful and rewarding jobs which we plan to give to the Australian people.

* I point out to honourable members that the Government has responded to the wishes of the Government of a small country whose **welfare** was formerly a special responsibility of Australia.

* The Australian Labor Party, on the other hand, is concerned about the **welfare** of the people and the families involved in this section of the horticultural industry.

* It has been the Australian Labor Party only which has made significant contributions to the long term **welfare** of Australian agriculture.

* While many problems have faced fruit growers in the areas where their industry is dependent upon export markets, other **welfare** problems have become evident in non-export areas due to the fact that stabilisation schemes distort the pattern of production.

* Whatever its defects, it has consistently and courageously defended the long-run interests of the system, and the **welfare** of the Australian community, against sectional interests and propagandists.

* Whilst the Constitution makes specific provisions for the **welfare** and benefit of Aboriginals to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth there are many matters of a constitutional nature which have not been determined and there are many aspects of this matter which, if pursued to the final point of confrontation, would end with us in litigation in the High Court of Australia from which there would be no solution and no worthwhile result for the Aboriginal people involved.

* Despite laws regarding compulsory education and threats from social **welfare** agencies that children who could not be fitted into schools were truants, it was some time before 25 forlorn kids at Enterprise were permitted to go to Springvale South High School, and then the school council had to pay $550 for one term 's bus fares.

* As the convention says in its preamble, it is a convention concerned with the health and **welfare** of mankind.

* Money that has been given to support mothers and to all other people receiving **welfare** benefits and who need that money is money well spent.

* Does he not find it strange that those in our society who consistently complain of inadequate government expenditure in social **welfare** areas have found this unessential expenditure unworthy of protest?

* It is extraordinary that a Minister who began her career in the Ministry speaking about the need to fine down bureaucracy has moved to add further and further to that bureaucracy by adding thousands of additional employees and increasing the emphasis on surveillance powers while, doing little to make any contribution towards solving the fundamental problems which are giving rise to an ever-increasing social **welfare** bill.

* We need to give all Australians access to adequate **welfare** services, on the assumption that they contribute to people's real income.

* I want also to congratulate the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry on showing the same courage in taking what were no doubt in some quarters - and this has been proved - unpopular decisions, but they were the right decisions for the **welfare** of the Australian wheat grower and the Australian community.

* Clearly, the needs of the cities, education, health and **welfare** will suffer through these programmes.

* Collections of duty on petrol form part of the Commonwealth's general revenues from which its commitments are financed, including expenditure on defence, education, social **welfare** and assistance to rural industry.

* It needs to examine decisions that are taken for the allocation of funds, whether they be in **welfare** payments, in tax rebate systems or in the provision of capital grants.

* I beg the Minister to examine this criticism, as it comes from a person who has had an active interest not only in the Northern Territory but also in the health and **welfare** of the committee system.

* The Government's insistence on exploiting inflation to finance its extravagant social **welfare** programs will lead inevitably to the movement of income earners to high tax brackets.

* For many years, previous governments treated the education of migrant children like so many other aspects of migrant **welfare** - it was ignored.

* However, for almost 20 years the Liberals stuck to this balance, ignoring the fact that gradually over the years the circumstances that originally warranted a target of one per cent had changed drastically and, consequently, in the minds of many economists and others actively concerned with the **welfare** of migrants and their assimilation into the Australian way of life, the target became economically unjustifiable.

* Social Security seen a statement alleged to have been made by the Canadian Deputy Minister for Health and **Welfare** and used by the Australian Medical Association, the General Practitioners Society and professional letter writers employed by Messrs Turner and Cade of the hospitals contribution fund and medical benefits funds who quoted the Canadian Deputy Minister as saying: 
 The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) In my Social **Welfare** policy speech on behalf of the Australian Government at Melbourne on 1 May 1974, I said 'the actual time of the introduction of this program will be a policy decision and accordingly will be announced once that decision has taken place.'

* **Welfare** and counselling services are attached to the family court created by the legislation under debate.

* and the work they perform, in order that he can make a better assessment of the adequacy of the number of social workers that have been allocated to his Department, and whether there is unnecessary duplication in the work undertaken by Government employee social **welfare** workers and those employed by other organisations in the A.C.T.

* For the information of honourable members I present the final report of the Darwin Disaster **Welfare** Council dated March 1976, together with the text of a statement by the Minister for Social Security relating to that report.

* But, corresponding to what I have been saying about capital works, if one looks at the particular areas of spending, such as health, education and **welfare**, one will see that the cutbacks are much more obvious and one will see the implications of the Government's strategy much more clearly displayed.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Having regard to his announcement of 22 August 1 979 listing available funds for (a) community, (b) **welfare**, (c) arts and (d) sporting grants by his Department within the Australian Capital Territory what grants in each of these categories were made by his Department or any other Federal Government Department disbursing funds for the same purposes in each of the last 5 financial years.

* It also includes the responsibility for the **welfare**, morale and discipline of personnel under command.

* 1 ) Did the Minister receive advice from the former Minister for Immigration that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of Immigration to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant **welfare**, information, education and the issue of passports.

* by leave - It gives me great pleasure to announce that the Commonwealth Department of Social Services with the full support and cooperation of the State departments concerned with social and child **welfare** has commissioned a family research project.

* The need for such a research project was discussed and agreed upon at the annual meeting of State **welfare** Ministers and myself held in Brisbane last June.

* Social Services,  Mr W.  C. Langshaw, Under Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare**, who will also be representing equivalent departments from other States, and  Mr A.  S. Colliver, senior lecturer, School of Social Work in the University of New South Wales.

* The study will have great significance for the long term development of Australian social **welfare**.

* In that case, the Prime Minister does not think that States should choose between spending the money on **welfare** housing or on rural roads.

* The Northern Territory regulations provided for the vote for serving or former defence force members but not for wards declared under the **Welfare** Ordinance, which was another paternalistic provision.

* The Statistician has advised that he is examining the practicability of obtaining separate classifications of 'certified nurses', 'probationers or trainees' and 'nursing personnel not elsewhere classified', for purposes of both the next Census and the annual returns from health and **welfare** institutions.

* I should like to outline the municipalities that are sufficiently concerned with the **welfare** of their citizens to combine voluntarily with their neighbours to form regions.

* According to the Ranger Inquiry's report 'the principal threat to the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people, and the one they most fear, is constituted by the large numbers of people who can be expected to enter the area'.

* But at the same time our task would be very much easier if we could be sure that there was a degree of cooperation from the State government which should have some interest in the **welfare** of its people.

* The only result will be the betterment of the **welfare** of all Australian people.

* Proposed Multi-purpose **Welfare** Clinics (Question No.

* One of these was our social services and **welfare** programme which has to be looked at in a complementary way.

* I said then that the Government felt that so far as **welfare** was concerned it was 'unfinished business', to quote my words.

* So, too, in the **welfare** services do we believe the same.

* It accords also with the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare**.

* I have no doubt that the previous Government would have liked to introduce such a grandiose budget - a budget to advance the **welfare**, standard of living, education and quality of life of the average Australian.

* Last year Australian Government grants to Queensland for primary and secondary education were up 145 per cent on the year before; for tertiary education they were up 165 per cent on the year before; for technical education they were up 1 10 per cent on the year before; for **welfare** housing they were 20 per cent above the previous year and for Aboriginal advancement they were nearly 30 per cent above the previous year.

* For **welfare** housing the Queensland Government was assured of a blank cheque by me on 7 June last, as all State governments were.

* Health and **welfare**, roads and urban and rural development in Queensland are.

* The Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare**, Health and Community Development has produced an interim report only and a full examination of its implications is still being undertaken.

* I should say,  Sir, that  alcohol is banned from native reserves unless there is a special dispensation by the Social **Welfare** Department in the Northern Territory.

* We have the extraordinary situation that on the one hand the Government, by means of this measure, is spending money in providing these benefits- I do not know how much; the Minister did not put any cost on the proposals- but, on the other hand, in the interests of economy and in order to find money to finance the vast **welfare** proposals which this Government has it is ruthlessly cutting back on defence expenditure as a whole.

* These sorts of considerations lead me to believe that the motivation of the Government is highly suspect and that it is not really interested in the **welfare** of servicemen at all.

* It is now clear in the total picture that I have presented why he gave these particular undertakings, all wrapped up in the guise of the suggestion that the Labor Party is interested in the **welfare** of servicemen and in the defence of the country.

* We do not oppose the Bill because we are genuinely interested in defence and the **welfare** of servicemen.

* Anything that is done to improve the conditions of service and the **welfare** of servicemen will receive our support but we condemn the Government for its overall approach to defence.

* More than a quarter of the money allocated for the Migrant Social **Welfare** Advisory Council-$4,000 out of $14,000-has been cut.

* Grants to organisations for **welfare** rights services have been cut by one-fifth.

* A cut of $127,000 is to be made in the allocation of $437,000 for research on special projects for the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* The Canadian Minister for National Health and **Welfare** announced an increase in the budget for the 'Smoking and Health Programme'.

* I should have thought that any measures the Government might want to introduce or announce which would improve post-arrival services for migrants in Australia would have had the support of the honourable gentleman if he were concerned with the real **welfare** of migrants.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* 1 ) The honourable member will be aware that the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health recommended that negotiations be commenced for the transfer of the laboratory at Port Pirie to South Australian administration.

* The Western Australian Minister for Community **Welfare** has communicated with me about proposals to amend the Regulations made under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act in relation to the authorisation of entry to Aboriginal reserves in Western Australia.

* The approvals have been the subject of joint press releases by the Minister for Social Security and the former Victorian Minister for Community **Welfare** Services, the  Hon.

* There is a **welfare** problem concerning very low income groups; I grant that.

* Along with other **welfare** policy questions, invalid pension conditions will be considered when social service benefits are being reviewed.

* However, it should be noted that not all meetings that have been held on the Australian Assistance Plan are necessarily recorded on the Social **Welfare** Commission's files, or known about by the Commission as meetings are convened by local groups, which may not advise the Commission of their action.

* Families throughout the country will be greatly helped by the provisions of this Budget not only in regard to taxation but in the whole field of social **welfare**.

* When we come to the 48 special project grants, which were offered to encourage self help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing **welfare** services to migrants, with a total expenditure of $ 1 50,000, this sounds good.

* Housing is vital to the **welfare** and happiness of individuals and thus to our future development as a nation.

* For social security and **welfare**, government expenditure has increased by 13 per cent.

* It is obvious that a community of some 14 million people cannot be expected to support such a **welfare** state indefinitely.

* With that objective in mind, we have ensured that all essential social **welfare** programs have been continued.

* All **welfare** programs have been linked in with indexation so that when the consumer price index increases due to inflation people in receipt of the **welfare** dollar lose nothing.

* This is because we believe it is fundamentally important, even in these difficult times, that the people of Australia should be made to believe that this Government is concerned for their **welfare**.

* Mr Snedden  is on record from the last election as giving an assurance that growth of spending would be maintained in key areas such as health, education, urban improvement and social **welfare**.

* There is no way he can cut back on the growth of public spending without hacking into education, **welfare** payments, allocations to the States, urban and regional development.

* The **welfare** cuts, the tax changes and the Government expenditure cuts all have as a basic element a redistribution of income from those who are not well off to those who are.

* Can he state what is the estimated additional cost which each additional migrant imposes on State, semi-government and local government instrumentalities for the provision of (a) water supply, (b) sewerage and drainage, (c) road, (d) education, (e) health and (f) **welfare** services in each major urban area in Australia.

* But it is in the registered publications section, which affects newspapers and periodicals, that the biggest slug will come because the abolition of the various categories over 3 years will seriously affect all publications from charitable, **welfare** and religious organisations as well as from scientific, educational and technical organisations.

* Finally, do his Government's policies in favour of the big cities mean that the **welfare** of the small States which export much more than they import is to be sacrificed in favour of the most populous States?

* What sums were expended on Aboriginal **welfare** from the day the previous Minister took office to 31 August 1973 in each of the following categories: (a) projects, (b) housing, (c) land, (d) sporting associations, (e) sporting activities, (f) education, (g) health, (h) personal loans or grants and (i) other.

* Under the 1973 Housing Agreement the Australian Government provides substantial financial assistance to the States for **welfare** housing and the Agreement specifically provides that the advances may be used for the purpose of providing accommodation for couples of which the main breadwinner is an invalid, and for single invalid persons as well as for families in receipt of low incomes.

* Pursuant to section 34 of the Service Trust Fund Act 1947, I present the annual reports of the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund, the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund for the calendar year 1975.

* I draw the Minister's attention to the remarks of the Liberal Victorian Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Brian  Dixon, on 30 July last.

* He went on to say: 
Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the film Warm Blood on White Ice and the book  Seal Song  produced by Brian Davies, Executive Director of the International Fund for Animal **Welfare**, to direct attention to the annual slaughter of adult and baby harp and hood seals in the north and north east of Canada.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to a report on page 7 of the  Australian  of 8 May 1979 that the United States of America Secretary of Health, Education and **Welfare**,  Mr Joseph  Califano, has launched a national campaign against alcohol abuse with a counselling and referral service in his own department which has about one problem drinker for every 1 8 staff members.

* I know that the Minister for Social Security is most concerned about the overpayment of benefits to social **welfare** beneficiaries.

* This legislation is further evidence of his desire to bring about major changes in our **welfare** system.

* This is yet further evidence of the very real concern that this Government shows for all aspects of migrant **welfare**.

* In conclusion, I want to state once again that this Bill represents a remarkable advance in terms both of our national social **welfare** system and in the special regard which we pay to the interests of our migrants.

* Has the Government received the interim report of the Bailey task force on co-ordination in **welfare** and health which was due at the end of last month?

* Will he table the report in the Parliament so that State governments, local government bodies and the many organisations engaged in federally funded health and **welfare** programs are given the opportunity to examine its recommendations prior to any action the Government takes upon it and, in case the recommendations in the report do not command universal support, make representations upon them?

* Has the Minister for Social Security seen a report of a statement by  Mr Justin  Fleming, the  President  of the Australian Association of Surgeons, in which he associated himself or expressed agreement of his association with the Liberal Party spokesman on health and social **welfare**, the honourable member for Hotham, who had accused doctors' organisations of deplorable taste in their attacks on the Federal Government's proposed national health scheme?

* It consolidates and expands the programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic **welfare** of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not possible for a government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people.

* I feel that there is not a member on either side of this House who would not desire to assist in providing **welfare** for handicapped people.

* Was the Office of Aboriginal Affairs or the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration consulted before the licence was granted?

* Has action been taken to appoint the long discussed and long prom ised multi-lingual **welfare** officers to assist migrant integration and settlement?

* Has the Minister for Social Security noted in the Press recently reports that Aborigines in Western Australia were alleged to be spending their money on taxis, liquor and in other ways rather' than on family **welfare**?

* Schooling for Aboriginal children at Yirrkala, or at any of the schools formerly administered by the **Welfare** Branch of the Department of the Interior, was not compulsory until December 1973, when by amendment to the Northern Territory Education Ordinance, compulsory education was extended to all Northern Territory children between the ages of 6 and 15, subject to accessibility to school facilities.

* The Government is constantly re-assessing its priorities in the social **welfare** field.

* **Welfare** services catering for the aged could be put out of business because of Federal Government financial restrictions, the director of aged services at Melbourne's Brotherhood of St Laurence,  Mr N.  Brooke, said yesterday.

* I am aware of the situation at Indulkana and recently discussed it with the South Australian Minister for Community **Welfare** in the context of the application of the principle behind the recommmendations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission to South Australia.

* On the broader issues, I would hate anybody to think that this is a **welfare** program.

* Has he replied to a letter of 4 May 1978, from the Western Australian Minister for Community **Welfare** indicating an intention of the State Government to remove from the Commission under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act, the final authority to approve Aboriginal reserve entry permits and to confer this authority by regulation on the Minister.

* Clause 8 stands as pan of that general pattern and that general principle which has been enunciated right throughout the Bill and which limits the existing standards and conditions of those who are receiving social **welfare** payments.

* Is it a fact, as estimated by the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** in its report on Drug Problems in Australia, that in the 6 years prior to 1 979 the tobacco industry in Australia spent close to $ 100m on advertising whereas expenditure on anti-smoking campaigns over the same period was of the order of $ 1.5m.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* I had a deputation in Sydney just a couple of days ago from the Turkish **Welfare** Association which has been newly established.

* I want to remind the honourable member that we are in the course of appointing 48 multilingual **welfare** officers which will act as liaison officers.

* They must work in conjunction with the **welfare** bodies.

* If there are any members of the Treasury here tonight, particularly, as I said earlier, those who are interested in economic affairs, they would know of the report that was released yesterday by the Australian Institute of Applied Economics and Social **Welfare**, located in Melbourne.

* I had hoped today that I would have been able to ask the Treasurer  (Dr J. F. Cairns)  how he could explain the inconsistency between the answer the Prime Minister gave to me in answer to a question I asked in the House on Monday and the report today of the Australian Institute of Applied Economics and Social **Welfare** in Melbourne.

* The committee specifically points to health and **welfare** benefits.

* We can see that this particular committee, of which the honourable member for Perth is a member, is not interested in maintaining the indexation of **welfare** benefits, or else it is not interested in maintaining the indexation of personal taxation.

* This indicates to the Australian people that this Government has long-ranging and far-reaching concern for the **welfare** of all sections of the community.

* These concession rates represent, in effect,  a  substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and **welfare** organisations to social and recreational clubs.

* I have long been aware of the valuable contributions of ICEM to the **welfare** of thousands of persons who have been displaced over the years, and I wish to thank Member Governments for their active support for the important humanitarian contributions of ICEM.

* Incomes have risen, not only in terms of real personal disposable incomes but in terms of facilities provided to the whole community in health, in education, in social **welfare**.

* As part of the Commonwealth Government's review into health, **welfare** and community development programs, including sport, I reconvened members of the former Sports Council Tor a meeting in Melbourne on 16 August 1976.

* My Department is currently assessing applications for further grants for social **welfare** workers for fiscal year 1978- 79 and others for commencement in fiscal year 1979- 80.

* We did much to decentralise health and **welfare** services.

* over and above what the Government itself appropriates for recreational, cultural and **welfare** disbursements in the ACT.

* The present Minister for Finance was then saying to the Assembly that the Fraser Government intended to take control of domestic Australian Capital Territory revenues raised from poker machines and the TAB and these revenues would not be used to increase the level of **welfare** services enjoyed by the people of Canberra.

* We are once more assuming our proper role as a leader in the development of social **welfare** programs and as a responsible and forward looking member of the world economy.

* In the Australian Capital Territory and to a lesser extent in the Northern Territory, the Australian Government has the power to act directly for the **welfare** of its citizens.

* There will be increased expenditure on social, cultural and **welfare** undertakings.

* Expenditure on social **welfare** will rise by 30 per cent from $518,000 last financial year to $649,000 this financial year.

* In the area of social **welfare** and culture expenditure is up $166,9 15 or 15 per cent.

* We have budgeted for a record expenditure of more than $l92m this year - clear evidence of our concern for the **welfare** and development of the Territory.

* Does he realise that vast population increase, once considered highly desirable, is now being questioned due to the pressures it places on education, health and social **welfare** services, housing and land prices and the consequent diminution in the quality of life that over-crowded cities have on our environment?

* He should have talked about the **welfare** of Victorian people rather than the Victorian elections.

* Flat accommodation was freely available at competitive and relatively low rentals and housing commissions were able to make a positive contribution in the so-called **welfare** housing section of the community.

* The integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social **welfare** policies in such a way as to ensure that every family can secure accommodation of its own choosing, appropriate to its own needs.

* I would have hoped that at the end of the 1960s we had succeeded in removing charity as the basis of health, **welfare** and social security in this country.

* This matter will be dealt with as soon as the national commission on social **welfare** is established and this should be announced quite soon.

* This application is before the Social **Welfare** Commission for consideration and recommendation.

* The decision to recognise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be affected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours- in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the **welfare** and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program.

* The very structure of modern society with giant firms on the one hand and, on the other, big unions (and if the Government's legislation fostering union amalgamation goes through, there will be still bigger unions) and with neither side necessarily or primarily concerned with the public **welfare** - this very structure of modern society makes government oversight of the economy and government intervention in the economy in some measure essential.

* Yet the major and unrestrained thrust of Government policy is in the field of social **welfare**.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of a new ambulance for the Ravensthorpe St John Ambulance Association submitted by the Ravensthorpe Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* -Mr Chairman, you will notice that the provision for the appointment of Director of Counselling and **Welfare** does not appear until clause 37 of the Bill whereas reference to him is made in clauses 14 and 15 of the Bill.

* The only time the Opposition gives a thought for the **welfare** of those who have fought for Australia or who are currently fighting for this country is when it thinks it can achieve some political end.

* Over many years in this place honourable members opposite have been completely dishonest in their approach to the **welfare** of ex-servicemen except when they have seen some political advantage in espousing an interest in ex-servicemen.

* The **welfare** problems created by these peculiar features of Vietnam have produced immense problems in the United States.

* After consultation with the State Ministers on the requirements of the States for **welfare** housing, during which regard shall be taken, among other relevant matters, of the numbers seeking assistance, the cost of land and of dwelling construction and the capacity of the State to use advances, the Minister shall determine the amount to be advanced to the State in respect to the financial year as Housing Authority advances and as Home Builders' Account advances in accordance with clause 9.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of a projector for use at Lake King, Western Australia, submitted by the Lake Grace Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* 1 ) Has any ( a ) financial or ( b ) other assistance under the Australian Assistance Plan been received by (i) Australian Red Cross Society, (ii) Catholic Family **Welfare** Bureau (Victoria), (iii) Salvation Army, (iv) The Childrens Protection Society (Victoria ) and (v) International Social Service.

* This followed growing concern by people working in **welfare** agencies, and local community groups, that many elderly people were either being forced to live in squalid conditions or placed in Nursing Homes because of the lack of flexibility in the types of services being offered to the residents of the Inner city area.

* The very recent establishment of this Department is evidence of the Government's interest in the **welfare** of those who have served this country in the armed Services.

* They say that the Government's import parity fuel policy has added a most significant indirect tax to the Government's income armoury which has allowed the Government to reduce the deficit and to hand out some well deserved improvements in the **welfare** sector.

* If there is a decline in commencement, approvals or anything else they rub their hands in glee because they are more concerned about their declining electoral prospects than they are about the **welfare** of the people of this country.

* The new provisions of the Bill seek to deter the activities of people who may prejudice the security and **welfare** of other countries.

* That social problem is one of a **welfare** society.

* That is getting back to the **welfare** society to which I referred earlier.

* The Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health sought submissions from persons or organisations willing to contribute to its work.

* Is it a fact that the Government has responded to its social **welfare** commitment by increasing pension payments twice since last December?

* I know it is unusual for members of this House to speak in the third reading stage of a Bill, but I want to express my pleasure at the fact that the Bill has reached this stage and that shortly there will be an increase in the amount of the nation's wealth which is expended on caring for those in need of social **welfare**.

* Following the heated debate which has ensued this afternoon, I wish to make the point that the Liberal-National Country Party Government has greatly increased the amount of money available for social **welfare**.

* Last year in the Hayden Labor Budget a total of $5,0 12m was outlaid on social security and **welfare**.

* During this initial period of  6  months, assistance is  a  State matter and is also closely related to child **welfare** responsibilities and functions which are solely  a  prerogative of the States.

* The House condemns the Budget because (a)  lt  breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for  1971-72 a  fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security'.

* The right honourable gentleman will have read the submission by the Australian Council of Social Service - the acknowledged professional body - that the inquiry should be held into social **welfare** and not confined to poverty and should be held by persons with skills and knowledge from Commonwealth, State, local government and voluntary agency fields though not acting as representatives, experts in social **welfare** and user and citizen members and that the issues are too complex and the skills required too diverse for one man or woman alone.

* I am not decrying their importance but I am yet to hear any member of the National Country Party rise to his feet and take an interest in technical education, immigration or social **welfare**.

* I ask them: Which of these priorities that we have so far chosen in the social **welfare** area would they argue should not have been chosen so that some other action could have replaced what we did?

* The Social **Welfare** Committee of the Government under the distinguished and inspiring leadership of the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  has a working party thoroughly researching a system of guaranteed income.

* We will hold our record in social **welfare** up against the record of any previous government.

* Finally, to establish beyond any doubt the credentials of this Government, I point out that in the 1 972-73 Budget the previous Liberal-Country Party Government increased expenditure on social security and **welfare** by 15.8 per cent.

* Mr Les  Johnson said:   the vast substantial increase in the national **welfare** which could be derived from development of the Ranger project could not lightly be overlooked.

* I have had the records checked, but no letter has been found from the Premiers written either to me or my predecessor as a result of discussions by the State Ministers concerned with child **welfare** at their meetings in March 1970.

* As explained in the answer to the previous question asked by the Honourable Member, the admin istration of education by the Commonwealth in the Northern Territory is shared by the Department of Education and Science and the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration.

* The Government announced its desire to introduce a scheme to assist with child-care centres in November last year against a background of concern that the care and **welfare** of the children of working parents should be adequately safeguarded and that such children should have every opportunity for the fullest development, intellectually, socially and physically.

* The Department of Social Security has recently conducted a staff utilisation review of its social **welfare** division.

* That division has been decimated by the Government's abandonment of the Australian assistance plan and the remnants of the Social **Welfare** Commission, and further changes are mooted.

* Yet, incredibly, the staff utilisation review of the Social **Welfare** Division of the Department of Social Security is in the process of recommending that the branch be disbanded and absorbed into a new structure not recognising a specifically migrant oriented branch.

* As tomorrow's  Hansard  will show,  Senator Guilfoyle,  in answer to a question from  Senator Mulvihill  in another place, today expressed her unqualified opinion that an identifiable migrant-oriented **welfare** service needs to be maintained.

* I can think of no reason for it, unless migrant **welfare** is deemed a less important consideration than minor administrative convenience.

* Is this really a ploy to take migrant **welfare** out of that Department without the Minister's knowledge, so that the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, with its four or five relevant officers, can establish a monopoly over ethnic affairs?

* It is based on offering the Australian people more and more in the way of **welfare** and making them more and more dependent upon government.

* They do not understand that this strategy has led to the weakening and undermining of the whole private enterprise structure on which our prosperity and all our **welfare** programs are based.

* They do not realise that if we allow the productive base of our society to be damaged by this Government, we are allowing our chances of a better standard of living and real advances in social **welfare** to be damaged also.

* Has a decision been made on assistance for improvements to be made to the Murray Music and Drama Club submitted by the Murray Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to the Australia Council for the Arts.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of equipment for the Mandurah Emergency Water Rescue Organisation submitted by the Manudurah Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* I too have felt that the withdrawal of this benefit may cast doubts on our overall aims in social **welfare** policy, but I know that the Government faces severe economic problems.

* In studies sponsored by the United States Department of Health Education and **Welfare**, comparisons between Federal employees who are covered by Blue Cross (where doctors receive a fee for service) and those enrolled in a prepaid group health plan (where the physicians are paid the same amount whether they operate or not) showed that - 
What new grants for 1976-77 will the Australian Government now make under the program for Capital Assistance for Leisure Facilities as a result of its examination of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health  (Hansard,  6 October 1 976, page 1611).

* I refer to reports that the Government is considering cutbacks in social **welfare** expenditure.

* Faced with the problem of trying to promote their own ideas against the views of a population which is so centralised in the south-eastern portion of the nation, the States must naturally be most careful not to give away any of the powers that they hold that affect the promotion of their **welfare**.

* It has a long history of public **welfare** activities and, I believe, of mobilising the nation, often in good causes.

* I have to say that I believe it is only the first bite at achieving our social **welfare** objectives.

* The honourable member said that this was the first step towards the Government achieving its social **welfare** objectives.

* He said that this was the first step toward achieving the Government's social **welfare** objectives.

* I take it that the honourable member's social **welfare** objectives are exactly the same as those of the honourable member for Denison and those of all other honourable members on the Government side now.

* But what an admission on the part of the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Franklin- this step was only the first bite at achieving the Government's social **welfare** objectives.

* What benefit received by pensioners is this Government going to abolish next as the second bite of its social **welfare** objectives?

* I want to use that example to urge that honourable members respect the program of community health and **welfare** centres started by  Dr Everingham  when he was Minister for Health in the last 2 Parliaments.

* West Heidelberg is a good example of the success of these community health and **welfare** centres.

* When the opportunity was given to them to say what they wanted for medical treatment and social work and residents of the area, who apparently were downgraded in this report, actively formed their own committee, got expert advice and put up a case to the Federal Government under the community health and **welfare** centre scheme for such a centre.

* There too, despite the fact that social workers and the like would say that this is an area of great deprivation and with not a great initiative, the residents took the opportunity to ask for and receive from the last Government an appropriate health and community **welfare** centre which they are helping to manage and which they are using.

* The Government is closely studying the reports of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health and of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm.

* The average working class man who arrives in Australia with his family is struck by the inordinate costs of social **welfare** in Australia both in the field of education and in the field of health, lt would pay honourable members to make a study of the advantages and disadvantages of the British medical service.

* I refer to the concern the Minister expressed yesterday about the development of migrant education and **welfare** programmes.

* Secondly, we saw the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission and more recently and thirdly, the report of the Priorities Review Staff.

* The creation of another commission outside existing departments will further fragment social policy making and the administration of child care and family **welfare** programs.

* The doctors in the scheme expressed the view that one of the merits of their system of practice was the ability to deliver medical services without concern for the economic **welfare** of the individual patient.

* The report continues: 
That the Government institute a committee of inquiry to include medical, religious, social **welfare** and economic representatives with wide terms of reference, to consider fully and advise this Parliament on the manner in which all citizens irrespective of their economic circumstances can be assisted, advised, and helped in such matters as: 
Has a decision been made on assistance for improvements to ablutions facilities and the installation of a telephone at the Ravensthorpe kindergarten submitted by the Ravensthorpe Community Centre to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* I suggest that the very way in which the taxation concessions have been administered in this Budget illustrates that the **welfare** principle has been honoured by this Government.

* The very fact that a rate of taxation concession applies at a higher level for incomes up to $10,000, at a decreasing level to $20,000 and cuts out at  a  higher level of income, indicates a **welfare** principle.

* There are those who say that having granted these taxation concessions not sufficient was given in other terms - in terms of social **welfare** benefits.

* So one makes no apologies for the taxation concessions because it follows **welfare** principles, especially on the levels up to $10,000 a year, and then it follows good economic principles of providing incentives on incomes above that level of income a year.

* The tax concessions followed some well worn and well recognised social **welfare** principles and I hope that they will be recognised for what they are.

* Who likes any lack of social **welfare**?

* In this year indirect taxation has risen slightly so that some increases in social **welfare** and some increases in terms of works could be given.

* It is, however, contributing to discussion of the Government's social **welfare** policies and no doubt this contribution could touch on any of the above topics.

* Leven District of the Boy Scouts Association in which they state that they would like: ... to make known to you and the Australian Government that our particular project has been extremely successful both from the point of view of employment and at the same time contributing to the **welfare** of the young people in this Municipality, not only for the present generation but for generations to come.

* I have to inform the Committee that we have present in the gallery this evening members of the Swedish Parliament's Standing Committee on Social Affairs (**Welfare**) led by  Mr Goran  Karlsson,  Chairman  of the Committee.

* Voluntary **welfare** agencies will be assisted in their emergency relief programs.

* The Government, quite wisely, has extended the thrust of the legislation in time to give the States the opportunity to continue their uncompleted programs while a reappraisal of housing on a **welfare** basis is being carried out.

* I support the Bill to extend the period of operation of the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974 for 12 months to 30 June 1978 because self-contained units for pensioners entitled to supplementary benefits are an urgently needed health and **welfare** facility.

* The Minister informed the House that the Government was studying reports of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health and of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm.

* The least of his interests is the **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* I wish to quote from an article by Judith O'Neill, who is a social **welfare** research officer for the Australian Council of Trade Unions.

* So far the Tribunal has no jurisdiction in the **welfare** field.

* I ask the Minister for Social Security: In addition to his comprehensive program for social **welfare** will he give urgent consideration to the problems of families, and the need to provide increased family assistance so that mothers will not be compelled by economic circumstances to seek employment which would disadvantage her children?

* Can he say which recommendations for the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** on mentally and physically handicapped children have been accepted by the Government and when these recommendations win be given effect to?

* But it is obvious that no one person is able to fulfil all the needs that are so apparent in investigating the areas of social **welfare**, housing, health and the like as they bear on the aged pensioner section of our community.

* Generally speaking, of course, the problem that we are confronted with today - the inadequacy of the legislation that we are confronted with today - is the inadequacy of the total funds made available for **welfare** purposes in Australia.

* I do not want to labour this point at all, but in passing it should be mentioned that lots of people, including active people in the aged persons homes organisations, are gravely concerned that in Australia we are spending 5.5 per cent of our gross national product on social **welfare**.

* In other comparable countries a much greater proportion of the gross national product is devoted to social **welfare**.

* The European Economic Community countries are expending 15.2 per cent of their gross national product on social **welfare**.

* I mention now the percentage of gross national product expended on social **welfare** by other countries.

* It may be of interest to the honourable member that social workers of the Repatriation Department have been attending inter-agency discussions arranged by the Hanover Centre with a view to finding an alternative to Gordon House, a community problem of which **welfare** agencies in general are well aware.

* Quickly pass the legislation necessary to make the kangaroo a protected animal throughout Australia - the culling of herds for the protection of the few property owners genuinely threatened by excessive numbers, or for the **welfare** of kangaroos themselves, to bc carried out by or under direct supervision of Government officers.

* Will he seek details from the Public Service Board of the progress that has been made in implementing the system of reporting on the placement of physically handicapped persons which the Board indicated it was planning to introduce when it gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in 1971.

* The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) I have no record of having received a letter from  Mr Thompson,  former Minister for Community **Welfare** in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to families based on the number of children.

* In government we indicated that we were intending to abolish the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* One of the many reasons, and I shall not canvass them all, which prompted the Labor Government to establish the Commission was that we felt that for far too long the community's attitude to social **welfare** had been determined in large measure by politicians and bureaucrats, prompted perhaps by pressures arising for support or assistance for a particular group in the community which was perceived to be suffering some severe disadvantage.

* Advances in social **welfare** usually arise because during election campaigns politicians decide that it might be a good thing for the purpose of winning votes to make this, that or the other promise in terms of social **welfare**.

* I cannot complain too much about that because perhaps I, as much as many other members, am in this place due to the social **welfare** promises made over many years by the Labor Party.

* But I still do not have to accept it as the best or ideal way to ascertain what are the real social **welfare** requirements of the community.

* Its purpose was to look more closely at the whole network of social **welfare** in the country, a network which, if I might continue the image, had a hell of a lot of holes which allowed a lot of people who were in real need to fall through and not be supported in the way a modern community such as ours should support people like that.

* When a government, and then a department on the direction of the government, establishes some form of social **welfare** support, no one in the bureaucracy or even the politicians in the Government likes to acknowledge that there may be deficiencies.

* That is fair enough, but it often proves to be insensitive to the needs of many people who slip through, who are not in fact caught in the protective device that was the point of the exercise of setting up the particular **welfare** service in the first place.

* Another facet of the Commission's activity in the process of trying to better understand the social **welfare** needs of ordinary members of the community, apart from the pressures of politics, was to get more local community involvement, to seek the active co-operation of the various voluntary **welfare** agencies which are set up by concerned citizens because they recognise that governments are not looking after a particular area.

* Far too often, if something is being done in that area, it is too easy for politicians and the bureaucrats advising them to say: 'It is being dealt with by some nice social **welfare** group, religious organisation, or what you will.

* I suppose that the fundamental point the Labor Party perceived, and I like to think accepted, was that social **welfare** is not a privilege.

* **Welfare** services provided to the underprivileged members of a community are not a form of charity.

* When we do have unfortunate members of the community who are unable to sustain themselves- and the Social **Welfare** Commission investigated a whole range of things- we are all the poorer for their suffering and misery.

* Often they were people who, quite apart from moves made by the Government, were actively engaged in helping the voluntary social **welfare** groups in their local areas.

* Inevitably, because of the nature of its actions, the Social **Welfare** Commission was going to come into conflict with the bureaucracy at all levels and whatever political persuasion.

* All of these actions by the conservationists have been taken with a disregard for the immediate **welfare** of 
The Government's overriding objective is to get on with our various initiatives in the fields of education, health, social **welfare** and urban improvement.

* Has a decision been made on assistance for the construction of a kindergarten building at Nyabing, Western Australia, submitted by the Kent Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for conversion of a hall for the Mandurah Pensioners League submitted by the Mandurah Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department 
Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of equipment for the Dwellingup Hills Youth Centre submitted by the Murray Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* They are now involved in providing a huge range of social **welfare** services on a very closely integrated basis.

* Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of equipment for the Nyabing Girl Guides Association submitted by the Kent Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* For interest sake I add that the Regular Defence Forces **Welfare** Association has communicated with my constituent saying: 
Although many millions of dollars have been spent on **welfare** housing, thousands upon thousands of people on the poverty line or below do not receive the benefit of this money.

* The enormity of this haemorrhage of national funds can be understood when one considers that in the last Budget a total of only $390m was made available to the States for **welfare** housing which funds State housing commissions and terminating building societies.

* The new family allowance scheme places in every mother's hands an allowance to spend as she thinks is best for the **welfare** of her family.

* When all is said and done, we should not be staggered or surprised if this Government were to bring the rate of interest for **welfare** housing to a level near that of the bond rate, because that is what was done for 23 years under a Liberal-Country Party government.

* These things are important to the **welfare** and the living standards of the Australian people.

* Has his attention also been drawn to comments by the Victorian Minister for Social **Welfare**, the Honourable Brian Dixon, M.P., that the scheme suffers from lack of recognition under Federal awards which could make employers liable to pay full award rates to students participating in the scheme; if so, have any steps been taken to overcome this difficulty.

* It is simply a Fraser Government device to get **welfare** housing out of the custodial care of the corporate caring process of governments and into the hands of the private sector.

* There is an urgent need for **welfare** housing for people who live in Griffith, Leeton, Narrandera, Deniliquin, Hay and West Wyalong as well as in most other towns.

* I do not think there is any doubt that the cost of health care will grow much faster in the future and that as a result resources will be taken away, from other major areas such as education and **welfare** where they would otherwise be used.

* The health and **welfare** of the community must be safeguarded at all costs- even at the risk of making a Labor Government look like strike-breakers.

* The emphasis of the AUS, despite the fact that it is supposed to be orientated towards the **welfare** of Australian students, has in recent years become more clearly identified with the interests of people and groups who have no affinity whatsoever with Australian university students, their interests or the interests of this nation.

* In reply to a series of letters to the  Australian,  the AUS stated in the same paper on 2 1 September: 
Broadly speaking the objectives of the Union are to promote the educational **welfare** and political objectives of students.

* Nevertheless, I emphasise the point I made earlier: I wonder precisely what responsibility this should be for the AUS which is, ostensibly, in terms of its own charter, responsible for the activities and the **welfare** of Australian university students.

* Through this machine the executive informs students of their own private political opinions on questions not related to student **welfare**.

* For example, the **welfare** and education of our children and the needs of young families must be of primary importance in establishing pur priorities.

* These are the principles and standards by which we in the Opposition will judge the **welfare** legislation brought forward by the Government.

* There is no hard evidence available as to the benefits of holidays to community health and **welfare**.

* Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the statement of the Prime Minister, that the needy should not rely on **welfare**; if so, will he elaborate on this statement.

* I am sorry that a greater opportunity is not given to honourable members to debate these matters because I think they are just as fundamental to Australia's **welfare** as are questions such as defence.

* That small percentage of people pays 471 per cent or 47c in the dollar in income tax which goes primarily to the **welfare** funds and which is spent by the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  lt goes to the States and to defence.

* One cannot help but feel strong objections to the fact that what should be a key public service, as health and **welfare** in other areas are regarded as a public responsibility, is not regarded in that way.

* In the case of home care services, it will be remembered that in 1969 the Minister for Social Services with some grandiloquence outlined a programme of home care services, paramedical services, senior citizen centres, **welfare** workers to be provided in these services, plus nursing homes.

* The Minister for Social Services at that time said: 
I have also instructed my Department to examine more effective ways of encouraging eligible persons to participate in the Plan, lt is envisaged that the examination will encompass wider use of social workers, charitable organisations and other appropriate **welfare** groups in the community.

* The Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** made a number of recommendations concerning some areas of assistance to the handicapped where, in the view of the Committee, further governmental assistance both Commonwealth and State would be appropriate; and also concerning the co-ordination of Commonwealth activities in this field.

* There are a variety of consultative systems concerning such matters as grievance procedures, safety, employee **welfare** and the introduction of technological and other types Of change.

* Would the Opposition increase social **welfare** payments as well?

* The Treasurer announced in the Budget that $25m of the money allocated to the States for **welfare** housing was unused at the end of the 1973-74 period.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of equipment for the Pingrup kindergarten submitted by the Kent Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for alterations to the kindergarten building at Ongerup submitted by the Gnowangerup Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for equipment for the Mandurah Meals on Wheels submitted by the Mandurah Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* Members however do come from all three levels of government, from service organisations, from members of churches and professional social worker groups and from **welfare** consumer groups.

* 1 ) The function of the community development officer is to facilitate the development of cultural, recreational, **welfare** and social groups in Tuggeranong.

* All organisations and governmental authorities which deliver family **welfare** services will advise and assist lone fathers.

* The names, contract points, and addresses of organisations which have been established with the principal aim of assisting single parent families, including lone fathers; are: 
But it is not just our economy or our social **welfare** programs that are at stake in this.

* I am just about to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  who is at the table, for permission to incorporate in  Hansard  a letter from the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society in which very strong exception is taken to this kind of reporting.

* The debate is catalysed by irregular but frequent changes to health financing arrangements by the Commonwealth Government of the time, sometimes for reasons of community health and **welfare** and sometimes to help balance the books.

* The aged, sick and infirm who rely on social **welfare** payments are being denied the right to eat the food of their choice.

* The fact that prices have been allowed to set the pace has created great hardship for those who rely on **welfare** payments and fixed incomes.

* The Government also has significantly improved **welfare** benefits.

* The expenditure on social services from the National **Welfare** Fund for 1972- 73 other than that resulting from this Bill, is estimated to reach $l,327m which is an increase of $119m over the expenditure for the previous year.

* As well as increasing the amounts spent on social **welfare**, 1 believe we have significantly increased the efficiency of our expenditure, so that each dollar spent provides more real **welfare** than it would have done if the older system had remained unchanged.

* I speak on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill with real pleasure because I believe that the enactment of this legislation will add another form of government action which will reflect the real concern of this Government for the **welfare** of active small business people.

* I can recall that when the shadow Treasurer of 17 years became the 
I say to the people, particularly those who live in the State and Federal electorates around Kingsford-Smith Airport, that while ever Jones is Minister for Transport they Will sleep peace.fully at night knowing full well that he Will stand by them and see that the aircraft operators do not manipulate flights to keep people awake and profit at the expense and **welfare** of the people.

* I thank him also for directing to other States those aircraft that would interfere with the **welfare** of people in my electorate and other electorates.

* I think I can give his assurance as well as mine that whilever he is Minister he Will see that the people's interests are protected, in contrast to what people like the honourable member for Lilley- a future Minister for Transport in the far distant timemight do, and that is put profits before the **welfare** of people.

* Departmental Social Workers, **Welfare** Officers and field staff also explain the services available from the Department and how to use these in their contacts with migrants, refugees, ethnic groups and **welfare** workers employed by other Government Departments and voluntary organisations engaged in migrant/refugee **welfare** activities.

* It is envisaged that these Units will have **welfare** staff who possess multi-lingual skills, and they will work in close liaison with regional and district offices of the Department especially those located in areas of high migrant concentration.

* The Department of Aboriginal Affairs, through its Northern Territory Division, inherited overall responsibility for the self-help housing scheme from the **welfare** division of the former Northern Territory Administration which as we know was part of the Department of the Interior.

* The evidence shows that suitable arrangements had not been made by the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration for the delivery and storage of these houses at the settlements and that damage and deterioration had resulted.

* Do you want to remain an individualist not only for yourself but also for your children and your children's children or do you want a giant **welfare** state where initiative is taken away from you, incentives are abolished and the people of this nation fade into a murky oblivion?'

* But the difference is that the priorities of the Labor Party and the Government lie in the area of quality of life, in the area of education, in the area of **welfare** services and in the area of community health.

* I have spent more of my time, since coming to this Parliament, concerning myself with the problems of Aboriginal **welfare** than with any other specific issue.

* What a desperate collection of measures for a government that had the management of this industry for such a long period, and finds that it now must promote policies with a single purpose of a rapid contraction of production and **welfare** assistance.

* Did he receive advice from the former Minister for Immigration that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of Immigration to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant **welfare**, information, education and the issue of passports.

* Opposition has clearly indicated that the Opposition's intention if it ever came to government would be to restrict and to reduce **welfare** payments.

* Again I am reminded by the presence of the Minister for the Navy that if a member seeks to gain access to a psychologist's report, a psychiatrist's report or a **welfare** officer's report that might have been acted upon he will be told: *No, it is confidential.

* Therefore, a tax originally introduced to finance a particular **welfare** expenditure has simply become a further element of a complex revenue raising system.

* The Asprey Committee 's preliminary report referred to payroll tax in the following terms: 
b) Due to the priority that had to be given to the development and implementation of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act and related measures affecting the **welfare** of handicapped people, no special procedure has been developed as yet for Government contracts to be awarded to sheltered workshops.

* For all the faults of the Whitlam Government, two vital threads ran, albeit imperfectly and inconsistently, through the fabric of its policy program: that **welfare** spending Should be based on need and that the nation's resources should be used as efficiently and beneficially as possible in the community's interest.

* Now they are deliberately depressing the real living standards and limiting the opportunities of ordinary people by maintaining high unemployment, holding back wages and cutting back public services and **welfare** while enhancing the profits of big business.

* Private investment is essential for the **welfare** of the economy and the maintenance of full employment.

* In speaking to this matter I think it relevant that I should read from the social **welfare** policy of the Liberal and National Country Parties.

* It states: 
Our social **welfare** policy seeks to enhance the security, dignity, self-reliance and well-being of Australians  We recognise different levels of need and base our priorities on them.

* Our desire to give power and responsibility back to individuals and groups in order to effectively meet the requirements of social **welfare**, distinguishes our policy from alternative approaches.

* Ensure that the real value of **welfare** programs is not eroded by inflation.

* The National Consultative Committee on Social **Welfare** is a token body giving advice only and taking only single references.

* There is no suggestion that it will take the place of the Social **Welfare** Commission, which the Labor Government set up and which was in a position to take a continuing over-view of policy.

* Indicative of our concern in this vital field of housing is that, notwithstanding our statesmanlike decision to curtail government expenditure, we have maintained the level of expenditure for **welfare** housing at that which was appropriated in the 1975-76 Budget.

* It is essential in debates such as this to analyse some of the history associated with **welfare** housing agreements, so that we can learn from the mistakes that have been made and initiate reforms which will allow the system to function to the best advantage.

* It is true that there have been changes in details in **welfare** housing agreements over the years.

* We witnessed many classical attempts to hoodwink the Australian people and nowhere was this more prominent than in the **welfare** housing group.

* In a second reading speech which he made last year, the former Minister for Housing and Construction,  Mr Joe  Riordan, said: 
Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was pointing out the disadvantageous position of Queensland under the **welfare** housing arrangments.

* Queensland was ready to build more houses for needy people, as it indicated by seeking more money for **welfare** housing in March 1975, but the inept and lazy Labor Government did not give Queensland the money until June, after months of delay.

* An analysis of the per capita advances for **welfare** housing shows that the Australian average is $56.70 and the State averages are as follows: Tasmania, $119.50; South Australia, $91; Western Australia, $63.30; Victoria, $53.50; New South Wales, $51.40; and Queensland, only $37.50, notwithstanding the application by the Queensland Government in April 1975 following the challenge of the then Prime Minister in December 1974.

* Production of **welfare** housing is virtually at a standstill and there will be very little in the pipeline after 30 June 1976.

* Indeed, the Queensland Housing Commission, as my friend the honourable member for Petrie  (Mr Hodges)  said, has built up a good team of contractors who specialise in **welfare** housing.

* An injection of Queensland's rightful share of **welfare** money would be quite appropriate to absorb a lot of this unused capacity and also make allowance for the expected shortfall in funds following the problems associated with building societies in Queensland recently.

* The people who used the accommodation provided were people who on account of their incomes were not able to participate in **welfare** housing, but housing had to be provided as part of the general scheme of the development.

* We had therefore a development of private industry which had special expertise in the construction area but which now has nowhere to go and nothing to do because of the drastic cutback in developmental exploration and the shortfall, in comparison to the Australian whole, of **welfare** housing being allocated in Queensland.

* What sum has been (a) available and (b) granted for (i) home care services, (ii) senior citizens' centres and (iii) **welfare** officers at senior citizens' centres under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 to each of the Stales in ea-h of the last 2 years.

* What disturbs me is this: When the money is made available the Government announces that it has a big scheme to cover home care services, senior citizens centres or social **welfare** workers and a lot of publicity is given to the announcement.

* 1 point out also that there is provision in this Act for social **welfare** officers.

* In 1969-70 the Commonwealth made available $60,000 for social **welfare** workers.

* That amount of $60,000 was made available for the State of New South Wales for social **welfare** workers but not one cent of it has been used.

* If the Minister decides that an issue affecting the health, safety and **welfare** of the community is of such importance that deregistration action should be taken, he must make application to the Full Bench and he has to justify his position in a Full Bench hearing.

* The honourable member for Port Adelaide asked quite piously: 'What sorts of disputes could affect the health, safety and **welfare** of the community?

* No government, when the health and **welfare** of the community are obviously at some peril, cannot respond to the situation.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with  a  view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'The House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them and, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* For example, service clubs, local government, health, religion and social **welfare**.

* Members of the Interim Committee are: 
That where rebates are transferred to social **welfare** payments the transfer compensates for the value of the rebates for each taxpayer or the household supported by the taxpayer, 
The medical system at present puts a high premium upon individual practice.

* As in any other profession or occupational group, some members may be grasping or more interested in their own **welfare** than that of their patients, but in my experience there are very few of them.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Broadly, the publications in the Department's library cover the subjects of immigration, emigration, the education, health and **welfare** of migrants, automatic data processing and demography.

* Has a decision been made on assistance for equipping the Community Centre at Fitzgerald submitted by the Ravensthorpe Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* Quite frankly, what has been done by Nkomo and Mugabe proves that they are not interested in the blacks in Rhodesia or the **welfare** of the people in Rhodesia.

* The Government has taken no specific action on this recommendation; however it was aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** had received a referral related to this subject.

* Have the Premiers been in touch with him or his predecessor on matters discussed by, the State Ministers concerned with child **welfare** at their meeting in March 1970 (Hansard, 13th October 1970, page 2082 and 9th March 1971, page 750).

* That has been given away by the simple fact that the Bill was introduced by the Minister for Labour and National Service  (Mr Lynch)  rather than by a **welfare** minister, such as the 

 Mr and Mrs King have made representations to me and, as a result of investigations made by my Department, I wrote to the then Minister for Youth and Community **Welfare** in New South Wales, the Honourable J. L. Waddy, seeking his assistance in this matter.

* 2 IBM 370/168 computers- Details of medical insurance claims, financial data, statistical data, bibliographical data and personal data pertaining to **welfare** systems.

* The world is well on the way to the acceptance of this profound truth, that the **welfare** of all the people in all lands depends primarily on full employment.

* Such issues as fostering were left to the Northern Territory Administration and the Director of Social **Welfare**.

* In such cases the Director of Social **Welfare** operated within the bounds of the Child **Welfare** Ordinance and in particular, part V of the Ordinance.

* If the proper course had been followed in regard to Nola's case a children's court would have granted an order under section 36 (1) (b) of the Child **Welfare** Ordinance, which would have placed the child under the care of the Director as in paragraph (i), or in the hands of the foster parents as in paragraph (ii).

* So the parents and indeed the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service which advises them could always apply to the same court to revoke an order under the Child **Welfare** Ordinance.

* Thirdly, was Nola Brown a child in respect of whom an order had been made under section 36 (1) (b) of the Child **Welfare** Ordinance committing her to the care of either the Director of Social **Welfare** and Child **Welfare** in the Northern Territory or foster parents?

* Our real concern should be for the **welfare** of the child and the right of the court to make a decision in such a matter.

* Red Cross, Parents and Citizens, Sporting Bodies, all Service Clubs, Aged **Welfare**, Youth Groups, Local Government, Asthma Foundation, Arts and Cultural Groups, Silver Chain, Education and many others.

* The Department employs thirty-six social workers and **welfare** officers whose services are available to all members of the community.

* Has a decision been made on assistance for park improvements at Kojonup submitted by the Kojonup Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department 
(a) In respect of item (b)I below the survey was undertaken by officers of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE).

* As pan of an on-going program of BAE research, to evaluate farmers' attitudes and opinions on a range of farm adjustment **welfare** and motivation issues including the rural adjustment scheme.

* The honourable gentleman will be aware of widespread demands from the Opposition and elsewhere in the community for a curb on the rate of increase of social services and **welfare** services provided by this Government.

* I also have great pleasure in indicating, if the House is interested, that  Mrs Marie  Coleman, the  Chairman  of the Social **Welfare** Commissionwhich the previous Administration indicated that it wished to abolish- will be the first Director of the Office of Child Care.

* Engage in ancillary activities such as **welfare**, adoption agencies etc., but may refer clients requiring help in these areas to appropriate agencies, and undertake such liaison as is necessary to ensure access to such agencies comparable to that available to other Australians.

* 1 ) Can he state whether the United States Secretary of Health, Education and **Welfare** recently stated that it was his opinion that a full 20 per cent of cancers may be caused by occupational exposure to industrial carcinogens.

* The purpose of the survey was to gather information not previously available about amputees to assist maintenance and development of the health and **welfare** services provided to these amputees.

* In any formulation of a code of aims within our system I believe we must recognise that industrial capitalism has proved itself the most efficient means of increasing the wealth and hence potentially the **welfare** of our people.

* In assessing whether the Australian Government should continue to provide assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers, the Commission has considered both the economic efficiency and **welfare** implications.

* Applications for permanent residency from other sportsmen and women who have been here since 1975 would be considered on their individual merits, allowing for such factors as marriage to an Australian resident, family disposition and ability to maintain themselves without recourse to dependence on social **welfare**.

* I have been referring only to the economic benefits of tourism, but what of the benefits to the health, **welfare** and education of our people, not to mention the goodwill and understanding gained from international visitations.

* We have abandoned the Australian Government's estate development and construction activities, which were designed to provide at minimum cost land and housing for **welfare** purposes.

* At the June Premiers' Conference we agreed to advance $235m to the States for **welfare** housing in 1974-75.

* At the same time, however, the Prime Minister stated that the Government stood  ready to consult with the States on the provision of additional advances this financial year in the light of developments in the housing industry, the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds for **welfare** housing to productive use.

* Honourable members will be aware that I have since had discussions with the States about progress on their **welfare** housing programs in the current year.

* At a conference in Canberra on 1 1 October, I announced to State Ministers that the Australian Government would provide an additional $75m to the States for **welfare** housing in 1974-75.

* These additional funds will enable the States to take advantage of the present situation in the housing industry to increase their **welfare** housing activities in a substantial degree.

* We know also that should such disputes have occurred in Australia under a Liberal-Country Party government there would have been cuts in education and cuts in **welfare**.

* No matter how much one tries to get the Leader of the Opposition into a corner he cannot deny that his policy would result in cuts not only in social **welfare** but also in education, health and all the other essentials that make up the greater part of government expenditure in this nation.

* His  very frequent visits to our State amply demonstrated to us his genuine affection for us and his commitment to the advancement and **welfare** of our State.

* In the new arrangements there will be important roles for all people within the community who have the **welfare** of migrants at heart.

* I have been interested in listening to the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder),  having spent many many days with him in the Northern Territory, probably in some 30 to 40 visits to the Northern Territory over the years as members of committees associated with Aboriginal **welfare** and public works.

* In this article, which is headed 'A matter of choice', the editor of the  Canberra  Times said: 
The residents of the mainland Territories are just as much entitled to be represented in Houses of Parliament where laws affecting their **welfare** or levying taxes on them can be made as were the people of the United States of America at the time of their War of Independence.

* But this Budget, concerned as it is with the high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security, provides the essential framework for the attainment of these national goals.

* Look at the social **welfare** area.

* In view of his stated determination to take over the responsibilities of the States for **welfare** and advancement of Aboriginal people, what plans has the Government approved to improve housing, recreation and living conditions in Wreck Bay over which it has direct responsibility and control.

* a public institution or public fund established and maintained for the comfort, recreation or **welfare** of members of the armed forces of any part of His Majesty's dominions, or of any allied or other foreign force serving in association with His Majesty's armed forces; 
1 ) Has he set a date for the transmission to him of the second report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health in which it is proposed to concentrate on the development of proposals for the more effective coordination of social policy development at the Commonwealth level.

* Any proposed changes would of course take full account of the rights and **welfare** of the employees involved.

* Is the approval of the **Welfare** Branch sought before prospecting authorities are issued on reserves?

* 'convivial' industries (to adopt the language of Ivan Illich) which are intended to promote the quality of life, but do not produce tangible goods or services which are capable of being exported or sold at a profit, for example, education, health and **welfare** services.

* People who are concerned about such things as Aboriginal **welfare** and those who are concerned about the deprivation of rights.

* We called it the Special Broadcasting Service because it may well prove desirable for the Government, in the years ahead, if there is a request, to provide some special broadcasting service for example, to the Aborigines throughout Australia or to the social **welfare** area.

* The understanding of the productivity and maintenance ... of ecosystems will enable them to be manipulated scientifically for the **welfare** of mankind.

* Yes; this matter has been condered in detail by the Conference of Ministers for Labour and the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee, and the views of members of the National Labour Consultative Council are being sought on possible approaches fore dealing with the difficulty to which the Victorian Minister for Social **Welfare** referred.

* Firstly, there is the circumstance that fishing is really part and parcel of the sustenance of very many people around the coastline of Papua New Guinea, and in particular it is of great importance to their **welfare** and their future stability in terms not only of sustenance but also of the gradual development of commercial fishing.

* If they were to sell their homes for$15,000 or $20,000 and make a contribution by way of outright gift to an aged persons homes organisation to enable that organisation to build further accommodation, it would give them security in retirement, it would give them comfort in small modern self-contained accommodation; it would give them, as an increasing number of these orgainsations do, ongoing care in the event of their frailty or in the event of their sickness, and current care in the event of their immediate **welfare** need.

* Therefore, as a **welfare** measure, the scheme has not been at all satisfactory.

* This is **welfare** in another form, is it not?

* Quite frequently their only regret is that they did not make the decision much sooner and that they delayed the decision for far too long, to the detriment of the **welfare** of their families.

* Nearly 3 years have elapsed since the Government was given the responsibility for Aboriginal **welfare** and still no accurate figures are available about almost any area that requires concentrated attention - health, education or housing.

* and (4) Assistance similar to that given in the States is provided in the Northern Territory by the Director of Social **Welfare** after assessment of the needs and circumstances of each applicant.

* The RSL is concerned at a spate of rumours drifting round the corridors of power that the Repatriation Department may be absorbed into a Health and **Welfare** complex, and Repatriation hospitals transferred to either Commonwealth or State control.

* and (2) Australian Government assistance for the redevelopment of Launceston General Hospital and for the construction of a new women's hospital in Hobart have been the subject of correspondence between the Tasmanian Minister for Health, Social **Welfare** and Road Safety and myself.

* 1 32 1 in which I sought details of the workings of the Social **Welfare** Commission, in the interests of open Government will he review the answer he gave to that question and provide the information sought.

* Is it a fact that the proposed social **welfare** centres to be set up in the main cities - I refer particularly to the Collingwood, Fitzroy and Northcote areas and the western suburbs of Melbourne - have been cut back or deferred?

* A decision on programs and projects in the community development area will be reached after examination of the report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health which is expected to be availabel to the Government in November 1 976.

* A reduced level of economic growth in turn makes it more difficult for the community as a whole, generally working through the Government, to provide those **welfare**, education, health, and other services that modern communities seem increasingly to demand.

* At that meeting, was there a frank and forceful exchange of views and should this meeting lead to a more humane understanding of the **welfare** and, indeed, the future of the workers at Derwent Park?

* that the new orientation of our societies towards the qualitative aspects of growth and towards broader concepts of **welfare** will require a much closer integration of science policy with the totality of economic and social policy.

* Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic **welfare** of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people.

* The appointee needs to be a sound administrator and possess the appropriate social **welfare** background.

* Insofar as the State governments' public **welfare** housing is concerned, nearly 100,000 families are on the housing commission lists, waiting for homes.

* Let me illustrate in more detail the Draconian cuts that this Government has inflicted on the **welfare** housing programs of the State governments.

* Within the limits necessarily imposed by available resources, it is the policy of the Government to improve progressively the **welfare** of elderly citizens.

* Now, this expenditure is taken from the National **Welfare** Fund, as I think it is" called.

* The function of the Chaplain is, in liaison with the Police Chaplaincy Advisory Council consisting of representatives of Papua New Guinea churches, to give assistance to members of the Regular Constabulary in matters of religion, morality and **welfare**, in particular by arranging for services, pastoral care and other facilities for the free exercise of the religion of members.

* I also point out to the 2 honourable members opposite, both of whom are former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and ought to know- if they do not, I will tell them now- that there is in existence the Social **Welfare** Ordinance of the Northern Territory which presently controls entry to Aboriginal land.

* Hitherto, child **welfare** has always been regarded as the responsibility of the States and the voluntary organisations, although the Commonwealth has been paying $1.50 per day as a subsidy towards the accommodation of certain handicapped children who are living away from home.

* There are 11 such regional advisory committees in New South Wales consisting of representatives of education and public health bodies and child and social **welfare** officers, to help guide and advise the New South Wales Government and local workers for the cause.

* School facilities will be acceptable only if the schools receive certification under the Public Instruction Act, while residential facilities for children or pre-school kindergarten facilities require to be licensed under the Child **Welfare** Act of New South Wales.

* The honourable member for Petrie mentioned that there are very many lazy people in our community who are taking advantage of the **welfare** services that this 
Are these services provided free to exservice personnel while other applicants are obliged to meet all costs in full or immediately submit an order guaranteeing payment from a recognised **welfare** agency as payment by instalments is refused.

* In considering the question of fringe benefits availability, it must be remembered that the War Widow's pension is free of all means test, whereas **welfare** pensions at comparable levels are subject to the means test.

* In one fell swoop the Federal Treasurer cleared the decks, as he put it, to initiate Labor's great **welfare** program and at the same time he put the kiss of death on every Union journal in Australia.

* The Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  has authorised me to make this announcement: A joint meeting of the Caucus Economic and Trade Committee and the **Welfare** Committee, of which I am the Secretary, was held today with the concurrence of the Treasurer and with his agreement has recommended - 
The Australian Legal Aid Office will provide a community legal aid service that will work in conjunction with the private legal profession and with other legal aid and community **welfare** organisations.

* The world is well on the way to the acceptance of this profound truth, that the **welfare** of all the people in all lands depends primarily on full employment.

* As I announced on 2 March, the Commission is to be wound up and  Dr Sax  is to head the new Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat which will have responsibilities ranging over the wide field of health and **welfare**.

* A decision on programs and projects in the community development area will be reached after examination of the report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health which is expected to be available to the Government in November 1976.

* When did the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health present its interim report and to whom  (Hansard,  12 October 1976, page 1784 and 1 1 November 1976, page 2594).

* I know that the honourable member for Murray is a member of the Government parties health and **welfare** committee and that he has a very keen interest in ensuring that this policy is maintained and strengthened.

* For the information of the honourable member for Fraser, I point out that the Minister for the Capital Territory attends almost all conferences of Federal and State Ministers because, not unnaturally, he represents the Territory in almost all portfolios, whether it be transport, social **welfare** or other areas.

* He particularly raised the question of **welfare** housing.

* The Government's foreign policy rests upon the belief that Australia, given her resources, her geographical position, her historical and cultural background and the character and aspirations of her people, is well placed to make a serious contribution to the preservation of peace and the promotion of the **welfare** of our neighbours, while at the same time and by the same path, promoting her own interests and security.

* Their efforts are principally directed towards generating more rapid economic growth, creating wider employment activities, maintaining and accelerating expansion of the agricultural sector, achieving more balanced regional development and greater diversification of the economic structure, and providing improved social **welfare**.

* However, that excuse which some honourable members seem to wish to offer for the Minister neglects utterly the widespread and cogent criticisms directed at his announcements of 24 May 1978, criticisms not made simply from the Opposition but from the Australian Medical Association, the private health insurers and many social **welfare** groups.

* We have seen that throughout social **welfare** services and other services in this country.

* Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health  (Question No.

* Nobody hearing or reading the Treasurer's Budget Speech could realise that there has been a tremendous squeeze on the States and local government; that the Government has broken its promises on education spending; that spending on health programs is down; that the provision for pensioner dwellings is down by 18 per cent in real terms; that funds for Aboriginal advancement are down 16 per cent in real terms; that provision for urban public transport has been cut by 25 per cent in real terms and funds for leisure and recreation facilities by 60 per cent in real terms; that urban programs have virtually disappeared; that the national sewerage program has been abandoned; that all migrants' special serviceseducation, **welfare**, housing, health, languagehave been cut; that the growth centre agreements with the States have been unilaterally repudiated; that environment programs suffered cuts ranging from 24 per cent to 99 per cent in real terms; that the area improvement program has been abolished.

* These groups include the Central Council of Croation Associations in Australia, the Italian **Welfare** Centre of Sydney, the Netherlands Society of Sydney, the Estonian Society in Sydney, the Hungarian Council of 
And I would agree with those remarks -  and indeed the frequency with which the young seemed to have swallowed this argument whole was one of the factors that almost inclined us to leave the age of majority firmly where it was - not that the young were alone in this.

* And, finally, the age at which it is appropriate for the country's **welfare** to call up young men or women could well vary; the military might decide that they needed them at 15 or at 20 or at 25.

* They are more interested in soft issues such as social **welfare**, the environment and even inflation.

* As part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* It is believed by the Government that voluntary **welfare** organisations are a critically important part of the Australian **welfare** system.

* It favours the provision of migrant advisory services and assistance schemes in industry and will encourage industry to take a greater responsibility for the **welfare** of migrant workers.

* In the Northern Territory the administration of education by the Commonwealth is shared by the Departments of Education and Science and the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration.

* I will answer that with just one example of the contribution which Labor made to the **welfare** of Aborigines.

* As the basis of my speech I quote the petition which I presented in this House this morning as the first of a series that will be presented dealing with the question of Aboriginal **welfare** and housing in the south west land division of Western Australia.

* that there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the south west land division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* With the concurrence of honourable members I incorporate in Hansard a table which I have received from the State Minister for Native **Welfare** showing the amounts that have been received from the Commonwealth and the amounts that have been spent by the State on Aboriginal housing from 1955-56 to the present time.

* Joint planning, and even conduct, of schools by educational, health, **welfare**, cultural and sporting agencies could provide additional facilities for the school, allow the community access to its resources, and thus generally increase its fruitfulness.

* In the latter category are 1041 staff for the Department of Social Security- 913 for processing unemployment benefits and other social **welfare** payments and 128 for Darwin re-settlement activities.

* The State Ministers concerned with Child **Welfare** held their Second Annual Conference in Hobart from 15th to 18th March 1971.

* I could see little point in continuing a confrontation which contained a real possibility of jeopardising the whole education program, and the **welfare** of all of our school pupils.

* assistance from government and voluntary **welfare** agencies -  nevertheless the spastic organisations throughout Australia, in the main, do not have enough income to adequately carry out their total responsibilities to the cerebral palsied, and this inadequacy lies mainly in the medical treatment/ medical training/nursing field- 
If the claims were substantiated, did or will, the Government take steps to alleviate the situation of these children whose **welfare** should be the responsibility of this country.

* These include the closure of store and health facilities for Aborigines, a refusal to employ Aborigines on station work, a refusal to sell them petrol or to cash **welfare** cheques, threats to close roads to Aborigines and to drive them from the station.

* They are people who are interested in the **welfare** of mankind and in the preservation of this planet.

* You put wealth before the **welfare** of the people.

* History shows that the Labor Party has always been concerned about the **welfare** of people in preference to money.

* She said that the people of the world are not as interested in the **welfare** of their fellow-man as they should be.

* What is the purpose of the 3-year social **welfare** project in the south-west and southern agricultural region of Western Australia.

* Contrary to continuing and unfounded rumours, the Bill confirms the Government's continuing and vital interest in the **welfare** of those who have served their country.

* I wish each level of government to be in a position to perform better its assigned functions for the better **welfare** of all our citizens wherever they live.

* That where rebates are transferred to social **welfare** payments the transfer compensates for the value of the rebates for each taxpayer or the household supported by the taxpayer; and 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to paragraph 1 60 of the Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* 1 ) Has his attention been drawn to recommendations 26, 27 and 28 of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* 1 ) How many meetings have been held between Federal and State representatives to discuss the implementation of the Bailey Report on Social **Welfare**.

* He was not concerned with the interests or the **welfare** of the people of that State.

* If this is to be the Labor Government's blueprint for the interests of the **welfare** of the people of this State then God help Australia.

* This process has begun, as may be seen in my Government's reforms in the areas of taxation, social **welfare** and its constitutional and legal reforms.

* The report did suggest that all the health, education and **welfare** activities were to be phased out as soon as possible.

* How does he equate the reduction in staff to carry out research into the housing industry with his and the Government 's professed concern for the **welfare** of the industry.

* This Government is too interested in chiselling the people in this country who are dependent on **welfare**.

* It applies also to social **welfare** policies.

* Child care centres, **welfare** services, senior citizens' centres, various recreational facilities and public libraries are vital in supporting people at particularly vulnerable times of their lives or in ensuring more satisfying leisure activity.

* There is a real danger not only that local government will be forced to restrain severely growth of community services such as education, **welfare**, recreation and cultural activities, but also that public works of various kinds will be allowed to deteriorate.

* Professor Henderson's Committee of Inquiry into Poverty has recently reported: 
It is clear that in countries where **welfare** services are advanced- England, Holland, Sweden and Denmark, for instance- local councils are playing a more and more important and responsible part in the process.

* It will cover low income earners and people in the community who have special need for **welfare** services and income supplements.

* Indeed, the whole purpose of the survey was to identify these people and the sorts of profiles that they represent for the development of a **welfare** program as conceived by the poverty inquiry.

* sees a danger of domination and possible elimination of State Government and voluntary agency **welfare** Services'.

* As honourable members know, the Bill is designed officially to establish the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* In the Labor Party's policy speech there was no mention of this new instrumentality, to be known as the Social **Welfare** Commission, being set up.

* The second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  was vague, as was the first annual report of the Social **Welfare** Commission which, incidentally, this Bill seeks to establish although it has already produced an annual report, and also the booklet entitled 'The Australian Assistance Plan'.

* The Minister's second reading speech, the booklet entitled 'The Australian Assistance Plan' and the annual report of the Social **Welfare** Commission are full of references to links between the Commonwealth and regional areas.

* They are the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security, who is obviously a strong disciple of Parkinson's law, the first annual report of the Social **Welfare** Commission, the Australian Assistance Plan compiled by members of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the transcript of the comments made by  Mrs Coleman  on the television program 'Monday Conference' a few weeks ago.

* The  'Mrs Coleman'  to whom I have referred will be the full time  Chairman  of the Social **Welfare** Commission - at least, I presume she will be.

* I presume that if this Bill is passed by both Houses of the Parliament she will be appointed as full time  Chairman  of the Social 
**Welfare** Commission, which has been operating for 6 months or so without any authority from this Parliament.

* I have in front of me the first annual report of the Australian Social **Welfare** Commission.

* setting up of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* As far as I know the position of  Chairman  of the Social **Welfare** Commission, which carries with it the status of Permanent Head of a Government department and a salary of $25,000 a year plus allowances, including a $34 a day travelling allowance, was not advertised.

* He has just spent more than Sim of the taxpayers' money on putting out a pamphlet supporting his health scheme but he would not spend a couple of hundred dollars advertising the position of  Chairman  of such a far reaching and important body as the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* is there some much bigger, granted social **welfare** plan quite unlike anything we've even known before, that the Government has in mind?

* Well, whether it's in the mind or whether it's a gleam in somebody's eye at the moment I guess is the operative question, but we certainly do not want to try to completely restructure the social **welfare** system .

* if one is talking there about the network of cash benefits that are paid as income supports for various people, and the range of personal **welfare** services that are provided  f -  various people for particular purposes.

* But in addition to that I think the  function of the Social **Welfare** Commission is very much broader than to think in terms of even an amended system which will catch the casualties, so to speak.

* It looks as if every government department is going to have a member of the Social **Welfare** Commission within its organisation - that is, if they are not all swallowed up by it.

* 1 and the Social **Welfare** Commission Annual Report consist of cliches, vague statements, no expenditure estimates - which is typical of many of the pieces of legislation which recently have been brought into this Parliament - and hard to define technical jargon.

* There seems to be a desire and an aim to encourage more people to involve themselves in a much wider range of **welfare** activities.

* It is hoped that there will be an increasing feeling of community involvement in areas of social **welfare** which previously has been lacking in many communities.

* It is clear that an improved quality of life can result only from more people involving themselves with and assisting local **welfare** programs.

* However, I pose the question: Do we need a huge new national **welfare** commission to achieve these aims?

* It must be conceded that the objective and concept of improved provision and awareness of social **welfare** will assist many Australians.

* As my time is almost up I remind the House that I moved the amendment to put on record some of the concerns of members of this Parliament towards the Social **Welfare** Commission Bill.

* Even though the Government has emerged so belatedly, in this pre-election period, with concern about Aboriginal **welfare**, environmental matters and many other things, it will help to compound the efforts that have been made by the Australian Labor Party to make these real issues for the whole country.

* The contrary argument, expressed by the honourable member for Hume  (Mr Lusher),  which I support, is that a pregnant woman in fact must consider not only her **welfare** but also that of the child to be.

* I notice that in the  Oxford English Dictionary  the definition of altruism is 'devotion to the **welfare** of others; regard for others, as a principle of action; opposed to egoism or selfishness'.

* I sincerely trust that every honourable member in the House will apply himself to the report because many of the recommendations will be crucial for the **welfare** of this country.

* We are genuinely concerned about the **welfare** of the people and will continue to be.

* Another factor which concerns me considerably is that the lack of efficient public urban systems puts at greater risk the **welfare** of the motoring public.

* He renders no service to the community, he contributes nothing to the general **welfare**, he contributes nothing to the process from which his own enrichment is derived.

* Almost $2000m will be sliced off education, **welfare**, housing, transport and urban and regional development programs.

* l ) and (2) The following grants-in-aid to assist organisations in the Electoral Division of Sydney to employ social **welfare** workers have been granted on the dates stated; the total amount of funding for each organisation is also listed.

* Since the inception of the scheme in 1 968 numerous inquiries have been made about the availability of funds for social **welfare** purposes and it is not possible to provide details of these inquiries.

* There is only one formal application outstanding for a grant-in-aid- INCA Institute Nazionale Confederate di Assistenza (**Welfare** Institute for Italian Workers in Australia ) which at this stage has been neither accepted or rejected.

* Has his attention been drawn to recommendation 15 and paragraph 171 of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* If there is no provision for a clearance to be given, does it follow that Commonwealth **welfare** officers and others will not be able to give evidence?

* Expenditure by the Department of Social Security (and its predecessor, the Department of Social Services) on **welfare** is shown in the following table: 
1 ) The second report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health is expected to be received in October.

* He is making no contribution towards the common **welfare** of the community.

* More specifically, as Minister for Social Security, he initiated massive increases in health and **welfare** expenditure which the nation could illafford.

* In 1972-73, expenditure on health and **welfare** was $2.88 billion.

* Of more significance, expenditure on health and **welfare**, as a share of total government expenditure, expanded from 28.3 per cent in 1972-73 to 36.7 per cent by 1975-76.

* Is it new thinking which has caused the revision of social **welfare**?

* This means that laws made by the Assembly will no longer be subject to veto by the Australian Government; that all matters affecting the **welfare** of the New Guinean people except defence and foreign affairs will be subject to laws made by the Assembly alone; and that  those  laws will be administered by a public service responsible only to the House of Assembly.

* Australians who remain in the service of the New Guinea government will equally be responsible to the House of Assembly, but the Australian Government will accept responsibility for their salaries and the **welfare** of their families.

* -When speaking tonight in the debate on the Address-in-Reply to  Her  Majesty's Speech, the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  discussed a wide range of issues, including inflation, unemployment and social **welfare**.

* Availability of **welfare** grant monies- or 'capitation'- is not an essential requirement for the functioning of Regional Councils.

* It should not be used to make people increasingly dependent on **welfare** systems.

* Sir Wilfrid  Kent Hughes was always helpful in his attitude to those sections of our legislation that were designed to promote the **welfare** of people who had helped Australia but who were in need.

* However, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  pointed out, there are areas in which we could cut the Budget expenditure further in the non-productive areas without affecting the **welfare** of the country.

* I should like to see the **welfare** services of the country extended to cover nursing home benefits.

* Despite what the people opposite say about our not being interested in **welfare** my Party will introduce a system of automatic increases on a twice-a-year basis fixed on a proper system so that there will be no way that the people will miss out on the amount they are entitled to get as a pension.

* As a member of the Government's health and **welfare** committee I can assure the people that we show deep concern.

* One has only to look at the current outlays to see that this Government places a great deal of importance on social **welfare**.

* Twenty-five per cent of total outlays of this Government of $24,32 lm, namely $6, 187m is being spent on social security and **welfare**.

* Of course industry is important; industry is important for reasons of employment, for reasons of **welfare** and for reasons of exports.

* Labor will not cut the standards of the people in social security, health and **welfare** because of economic pressures.

* Other of the Senate Committee's recommendations dealing with follow-up **welfare** work, English language training, **welfare** benefits, family reunion, et cetera, are being carried out under the supervision of the Standing Committee, and the Determination of Refugee Status Committee.

* It is quite apparent from  Dr Lopert's  statement that she was very disturbed, not only that it embarrassed her but she was concerned for the **welfare** and safety of the patient.

* Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to recommendation 24 of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* This decision does not mean, of course, any diminution in the Government's interest in the **welfare** of those who made sacrifices in the defence of our country.

* The officers of the Department of Social Security and of the Commonwealth Employment Service also deserve considerable credit for their understanding of the situation and the fact that they were able to operate within the changes made to various parts of the **welfare** legislation, which for the first time enabled selfemployed persons to benefit in times of stress from the social **welfare** system.

* Until recently I was unaware that it had even appointed a spokesman on health and **welfare**.

* However, the trends in this Bill, together with statements made by the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  are leading us towards the **welfare** state and do concern the Australian Country Party.

* One is economic responsibility and the other is the creation of the **welfare** state.

* The measures announced in the Labor Parry's policy speech show a complete lack of financial responsibility and indicate that in the long run the interests of the average hard working taxpayer will suffer from having to support the cost of the **welfare** state.

* How can any responsible person think that the payout on social **welfare**, involving as it does about one-fifth of the total Budget, can be disregarded when the financial aspects of Australia's annual Budget are being considered.

* The members of the Rockhampton Social **Welfare** Development Planning Council and the organisations they represent are as follows: 
the industrial action has had, is having, or is likely to have, a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** .

* Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department 
That's because Medibank, like other social **welfare** services, will be financed by money from tax revenue.

* The Government will place great emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* I would like to reply very briefly to the comments of the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  when he suggested that members on this side of the House had less than a passing interest in the **welfare** of our returned men.

* Mr Acting Speaker  - 
Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health: Recommendation 24  (Question No.

* The Bill brings in representatives of certain **welfare** organisations, and I think that is quite proper too.

* The matter of **welfare** assistance in the Northern Territory for persons falling outside the provisions of the Social Services Act is one for my colleague, the Minister for the Interior.

* Most of the Department's expenditure is in the form of payments to the States for specific purposes, the bulk of it being for **welfare** housing.

* Surplus capital funds remaining after responsibility has been transferred will be distributed to the Army and Air Force central **welfare** funds in suitable proportions.

* In particular I would like to mention the current  Chairman  of the Board,  Mr G.  J. Betts, whose advice and experience have been of much assistance to me in arriving at the present result, I would also like to pay tribute to ASCO which has been the source of over $10m for Army and Air Force **welfare** programs since it began trading in 1959.

* It appears that this Government has discovered a new and brilliant mathematical formula for drawing up its social **welfare** and manpower programs.

* If individuals have access to appropriate training facilities thereby acquiring social and industrial skills, not only is the **welfare** of the individual greatly enhanced but also when the economic upswing is underway there is room for a smooth expansion of demand and output without the inflationary cost pressures caused by skill bottlenecks.

* If the Minister is really interested in and is trying to protect the **welfare** of the whole community he should have taken steps to initiate action to raise productivity in individual industrial undertakings which, of course, would be the main responsibility of managements.

* There are many areas where increased productvity is vitally necessary for the **welfare** of the employee and employer, as well as the public generally.

* This, in my opinion, is most commendable and should be the basis of any social **welfare** system.

* So I support the view that greater emphasis should be placed on anti-poverty measures as a basis for **welfare** action.

* Not only does Australia according to a recent World Bank survey have a more equal distribution of income than almost any other country in the world but also I believe there is merit in the suggestion that Australia's adoption of a basically selective approach to **welfare** is largely responsible for the fact that the incidence of poverty in Australia is lower than in any country with the possible exception of the Scandinavian countries.

* This approach to **welfare** allows a greater degree of flexibility for the Government to address itself to new areas of need as they arise.

* These and other areas of need I feel sure can be better catered for by the flexibility which is inherent in the Government's needs based **welfare** policy.

* If one looks at what has happened over that period of 10 years, there was an extraordinary increase from 1 7 per cent to over 27 per cent in social **welfare** expenditure, health expenditure almost doubled, and education expenditure trebled.

* One can look to other statistics for verification in order to gain the contrast between the concern for the **welfare** of families in Australia under a Labor Government, and the brutal indifference of this Government.

* In the 1975 Budget Speech I announced that in the preceding year there had been an increase of 7 per cent in real terms in the income of the average income earner, and if one made allowances for redistributional benefits in the fields of education, **welfare**, health and so on, the increase in real terms was 9.5 per cent.

* It is a firm policy of the Government that the major aspects of expenditure in its social **welfare** program must benefit people of relatively low income.

* It is expected in a civilised society that he or she must be taken care of by some form of payment or social **welfare** benefit.

* In America the former Secretary of Housing, Education and **Welfare** and now head of the Urban Coalition, John W. Gardner, has bluntly stated that the present system of medical care delivery is outworn, expensive and outrageously inefficient.

* In an article headed 'The $60 Billion Crisis over Medical Care' the reputable United States magazine 'Business Week' in January this year stated: 
I think it is about time we measured our achievements in terms of people and **welfare** and not money and statistics.

* Social **welfare** and economic policy are two subjects which are too often discussed in isolation from each other.

* As for claims that I am not helping Federal-State relations, my concern is for the health and **welfare** of Queenslanders.

* I am also concerned with the **welfare** of my patients and the patients of my colleagues.

* The AMA and individual doctors have a duty to speak up on matters which affect the **welfare** of patients.

* Labor's Health Scheme will seriously affect patient **welfare**.

* On what dates have there been meetings of the interdepartmental committee established to consider **welfare** policy.

* The honourable member for Wills said what the Government should have done, but may I remind him that over the last few years the Government has done more to assist in the field of Aboriginal **welfare** than has any other government since federation; it does not have a bad record.

* A study of the achievements of the Government since the setting up of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in 1967 must prove that the Government has not been niggardly or lacking in its approach to the **welfare** of our coloured people.

* Has the Social **Welfare** Commission established committees to inquire into various matters.

* 1 ) The members of the Townsville **Welfare** Council and the organisations they represent are as follows: 
1 ) Who are the members of the Mackay Council of Social **Welfare** and what organisations do they represent.

* It is vital to the **welfare** of thousands of whole communities in Australia and to decentralisation.

* I challenge it to state unequivocally whether abolition of the means test is or is not one of the casualties of the rather massive public expenditure cuts which it is proposing as part of its economic administration of this country in which major **welfare** fields, such as education, **welfare** housing, urban and regional development, **welfare** services, hospitals and community health services will all be cut back substantially according to a secret document circulating among a small number of senior members of the Liberal Party.

* Australia's finance, the future security of Australians, their employment opportunities and their **welfare**.

* We would have, people associated with **welfare** societies and people associated with churches.

* Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health  (Question No.

* There is an actual effect on the **welfare** of the migrants in this country.

* OVERSEAS STUDENTS  Mr GRAHAM-  Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports of a survey conducted by the Overseas Students Service at a Victorian university in which it is alleged that many Asian students in Australia have personal and **welfare** problems and nobody with whom these problems may be discussed?

* I suppose when one has any very large number of students gathered together one will find that some of them have what are described as **welfare** problems.

* This particular sample, from what is said in the survey, could hardly be representative, because the Overseas Students Service itself, supported by Government funds, is one of the bodies that is supposed to give **welfare** counselling to students.

* My department has a **welfare** officer to look after the needs of overseas students in every State of the Commonwealth.

* Darwin Disaster **Welfare** Council: final report (5 copies).

* Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health (Question No.

* But as the people are well aware, the relic Opposition majority in the Senate has continually blocked major items of our mandate - our policies on health, education, social **welfare**, urban living, land acquisition- 
The Opposition parties may bleat about that too but remember their great leader of earlier years,  Sir Robert  Gordon Menzies, over a quarter of a century ago promised to abolish the means test.

* Members of the Opposition still have the effrontery to express concern for the **welfare** of the pensioner.

* Over the whole range of social **welfare** services this Government has acted promptly to improve the lot of the less fortunate and the under privileged.

* Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health (Question No.

* The Government has made a decision which, as far as I can make out, has not led to the executive of the Returned Services League, the main body representing the **welfare** of ex-servicemen and women in Australia, appearing to complain to the Parliament.

* Included in this figure are 153,000 wards of the nation for whom basic responsibility lies with the Ministry of Social **Welfare**.

* The Ministry of Social **Welfare** in Vietnam has indicated that it is not completely correct to speak of 'destitute orphans': those not being cared for by the Government are, for the most part, cared for in family groups.

* The matter of adoption of foreign children in Australia is one which chiefly concerns Child **Welfare** Authorities in each of the Australian Slates.

* The Vietnamese Ministry of Social **Welfare** and Refugees and the Ministry of Health have advised that, generally speaking, the Government of Vietnam does not favour the adoption of Vietnamese children in foreign countries.

* I believe that this matter is one in which the Parliament as a whole can make a real contribution to the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* The matter is a complex one which I do not wish to go into in detail at this time, but 1 believe that the measure to remove the sales tax on contraceptives, as proposed in the Bill, is only one of a wide variety of family support, counselling, education and other social **welfare** programs which this Parliament should consider and support.

* I regard the organisational and administrative responsibilities accepted by these committees as being a most important contribution that they make to the scheme and to the **welfare** of the aged people who are residents under it.

* This report was prepared by the Australian Government Social **Welfare** Commission.

* But the unfortunate aspect of this approach is that it seems to generate a greater resentment towards Aboriginal **welfare**.

* 1 ) Funds will be made available to the Indulkana Community in June 1979 to enable it to assume responsibility from the Department of Community **Welfare** on 1 July 1 979.

* 1 ) It is considered that there is a responsibility for the **welfare** of pensioners at all levels of Government.

* **Welfare** relief is not the responsibility of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and no provision is made for it in my Department's budget.

* Labor's policies in these fields are policies for women; they are part of our program to improve the **welfare** and widen the rights and opportunities of the whole community.

* Mr Fraser  constantly talks about restricting social **welfare** payments to those in genuine need.

* Every statement of this kind from  Mr Fraser  is a threat to the security of women and everyone on social **welfare** benefits.

* It is wrecking creative programs for the health, security and **welfare** of women and children just as it is wrecking those for men.

* The wrecking of Medibank is an attack on women; the neglect of the cities is an attack on women; the Fraser Government's onslaught on social **welfare**, urban transport, sewerage programs, area improvement, environmental and recreational programs are attacks on the living standards of everyone, men and women alike.

* Third, the health and **welfare** of their families.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their **welfare**; and 
The committee met for the first time on 23 and 24 June 1976, and it was resolved that the Department of Social Security should prepare working papers for consideration by State officials, which led to the preparation of a comprehensive document.

* At the same time as consultations were being held with the States, discussions took place with the private insurance industry, employer organisations, trade unions, the medical and legal professions, **welfare** organisations and motorists' organisations.

* What banking facilities are available at the Wave Hill Aboriginal **Welfare** Settlement in the Northern Territory.

* He is also known as 'cut Johnson' because it was during this period that he cut by 19 per cent the Federal Government's contribution to **welfare** housing in Australia.

* the effects of the scheme on the health and **welfare** of the community.

* In the present Budget a sum of $8.9 billion has been allocated in the general area of social **welfare**.

* Indicative of this success has been the increase in the total number of  recipients  of social **welfare** which is theirs injustice, not in charity.

* The total number of social **welfare** recipients will grow this year from 2,280,000 to 2,336,000.

* It is interesting to note that in the Budget of a government of concern and interest in the unfortunate in society the allocation for **welfare** is about 28.2 per cent of the total Budget allocation.

* Eighty-five per cent of personal income tax collections in Australia is spent on health and **welfare**.

* The Australian Labor Party in 1973 allocated 20.4 per cent of our income to social security and **welfare**.

* It is referring to the **welfare** spending in this country.

* The low income earner has been protected by the provision of **welfare** housing and by schemes such as that instituted in my own State of Western Australia by the State Liberal-Country Party Government to provide support in hardship cases and of course there is limited financial capacity on the part of State governments to provide for all hardship cases.

* The low income earners, the people who need **welfare** housing- hardship cases- have been provided for in these hard times of high interest rate policy but it is the middle income earner who has been caught in the squeeze and there is nothing in this legislation that the Corporation can do to assist those middle income earners who are already buying their home and who are caught by the continuing high interest rate policies of this Government.

* When was the National **Welfare** Fund established.

* What is the establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* For example, in the case of social **welfare** expenditure, there is a whole range of policies concerned with social **welfare** objectives or affecting the distribution of income which require appraisal before valid international comparisons can be made.

* Account would also need to be taken of social **welfare** expenditure financed through the private sector, especially where this is organised or subsidised by governments.

* Private investment is essential for the **welfare** of the economy and the maintenance of full employment. '

* direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of thy glory and the true **welfare** of the people of Australia'.

* It will help to stimulate business whilst protecting the needy and protecting also the key areas of expenditure, health and **welfare**, including pensions of all kinds, education and defence.

* I mention in particular social **welfare**.

* Precisely this: The Prime Minister came up with the idea of buying off legitimate criticism of his Government's shabby record in the migrant **welfare** field by making $50,000 available to the Greek community in Melbourne and $50,000 available to the Italian community in Sydney.

* The same situation applies to one of the commitments of the Minister for Social Security,  Senator Guilfoyle,  who went to the Italian community in Melbourne and made a great play of donating $5,000 to FILEF, which is an Italian **welfare** organisation.

* The FILEF organisation has been told by way of correspondence that the grant for the employment of a **welfare** rights officer will terminate on 1 January 1977.

* The Government will continue to take a very close interest in the economic **welfare** of regional centres which are of such importance to the nation's **welfare**.

* -As one who has been genuinely committed to the **welfare** of pensioners and the under-privileged since I first came into Parliament 1 1 years ago, may I say that I support the legislation and I congratulate the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Newman)  on the manner in which he is performing the duties of his portfolio.

* They are complaining because the Minister has arranged and the Government has commissioned the preparation of some very important reports on the future of this type of **welfare** housing.

* I believe that the subject of **welfare** housing is above and beyond party politics.

* Contrary to what  Mr Holgate  has said in Tasmania, namely that 'in my opinion the Federal Government is progressively trying to opt out of government housing leaving the States to accept the financial burden' and 'that is why  Mr Newman  wants to cut off our supply of low interest money which we depend upon so much to charge reasonable rents' this Government, under this Minister, is determined to get better value for its **welfare** housing dollar.

* Claims by  Mr Holgate,  the Tasmanian Minister, that the Commonwealth is opting out or the disgraceful allegation that he has spread around that we were trying to push up pensioners ' rents - 
As I said, the Bill will extend the scheme from 3 years to 4 years and will pump $10m into **welfare** housing for single pensioners.

* That, regrettably, is a fact of life, But Headline Harry should be reminded who created inflation and also - 
I mentioned 2 reports- the Task Force on Coordination in **Welfare** and Health, known as the Bailey report, and the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm.

* In the field of health and **welfare** it offers a new hope to an Australian marching towards the twenty-first century.

* Sixthly, towards the end of this century Australia will need to spend relatively more on such things as aged pensions and other age related **welfare** schemes and relatively less- I am sad to say this- on such things as child endowment, education, creches and the like.

* The Bailey Task Force has proposed the establishment of a SHACC- that is, sheltered accommodationprogram as one of 4 programs in the **welfare** and health area.

* Indeed, I believe, in the approach and the commitment of our Government that we have demonstrated to the pensioners of Australia, to the poor of Australia, and to the under-privileged of Australia that we have a genuine commitment to their **welfare** and to their betterment, that we are determined that they shall be properly and appropriately housed, and that they shall be cared for in the twilight years of their lives.

* **Welfare** Committee 
Social **Welfare**.

* The electors have inflicted stinging rebuffs at the ballot box to those politicians who have sought to push the **welfare** state so far that it has become an intolerable tax burden to the people and so that all the other spending in the public sector is constrained by what is going on there.

* Honourable members will be well aware of the emphasis placed by the present Australian Government on all aspects of social **welfare**, especially those involving the more socially disadvantaged people in our society.

* In delivering the Government's **welfare** policy speech on 1 May 1 974, 1 gave further details of the policy the Government had endorsed.

* The Bill offers a subsidy of up to 50 per cent of the salary of a suitably qualified or experienced social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons centre.

* The term 'social **welfare** worker' includes a social worker, **welfare** officer, psychologist, occupational therapist or other person providing a service or treatment for homeless people.

* The funds for these subsidies will be provided from the National **Welfare** Fund and provision has been made for expenditure of up to $550,000 for the remainder of the year 1974-75.

* The Government's belief in social justice, which has been demonstrated by massive inputs to our social **welfare** program, opens up the possibility of programs such as this leading to a diminution of the problem through the rehabilitation of this group of the socially disadvantaged.

* It is my intention to establish these committees as quickly as possible, ensuring that all involved in the **welfare** of the homeless participate in the work of the committees.This then is the substance of the Bill.

* It has become increasingly obvious with the development of modern technology, the changed way and pace of life and the increasing acceptance on all sides of the **welfare** state that there has been increasing government involvement in the citizens' daily life and a dramatic expansion of the Executive 's power.

* The **welfare** of whole communities depends on the well-being of the world sugar industry.

* 1 ) Who are the members of the Rockhampton Social **Welfare** Development Planning Council, and what organisations do they represent.

* That report is neither a full nor accurate assessment of the contribution made by the mining industry to Australia's economic **welfare**.

* This report upon which the Minister for Overseas Trade places such importance takes a narrow, myopic view of the industry's contribution to Australian **welfare**.

* I call it a lack of planning because it has brought us the major problems of increased crime, vandalism, riots, aud an increase in alcoholism and drug addiction, an increase in emotional and mental disorders and an increase in unemployment, **welfare** dependency and poverty.

* Increased offences mean an increase in the number of prison visits, arrangements for bail and legal representation, attendances at hearings, communications with family and, if the person arrested is imprisoned, a continuing interest in his or her **welfare**, sometimes for many years, under arduous prison conditions.

* This assistance includes: Inquiries relating to the **welfare** and whereabouts of Australians; repatriation and financial relief of distressed Australians in the form of a repayable loan as already mentioned; **welfare** visits to persons in gaol, hospital or in an asylum; assistance in natural disasters or emergencies; and making available to Australian citizens who have been arrested a list of local lawyers who may be able to assist them.

* The standards to be applied may differ from country to country depending on such factors as language and cultural differences, the opportunity for self-help and the local availability of social, charitable or **welfare** services.

* Has an appropriation of $2m been set aside to provide financial assistance to voluntary **welfare** organisations throughout Australia.

* Apparently the Government gives this activity a greater priority than it gives to other areas of government responsibility that it should be attending to, such as social **welfare** and helping the needy in the community.

* J quote from The Family in a Money World' by Feldman, a well known social **welfare** worker, on the subject of money.

* He said: 
Within our society the position of economic independence in the light of what I am putting to the House from sources regarded as fairly powerful authorities in the field of **welfare** work emphasises that reasonable money resources play a dominant role and is essential to the mental **welfare** of people in our community.

* Sister Stacey is well known throughout Australia for her magnificent work for Aboriginals at Alice Springs Hospital, where her specific responsibility has been the training of Aboriginal mothers in maternal and child **welfare**.

* Hence the health of the very small and very delicate infants is very likely to decline and all the good work that takes place at the maternal and child **welfare** centres is lost.

* This is one of the great problems that everyone interested in the **welfare** of Aborigines is trying to solve.

* Surely, the Parliament has justification for hoping that these wielders of the scalpel would also have incisive minds, that they would be men able to cut quickly to the core of concern in this debate, namely, the **welfare** of the people of Australia, the **welfare** of the patients.

* We would probably soon reach the position that is applying in Canada, where the Minister for National Health and **Welfare** has announced that reductions of 25% in votes for both emergency health services and emergency **welfare** services will be effected in 1970-71.

* It is a fact that in areas which have no relationship to Aboriginal Affairs but which impinge upon the **welfare** of Aboriginal people States have responsibilities.

* I wish to pay tribute to the work of Manfred Cross, the former member for Brisbane, as I believe, as would all members who had the privilege of serving with him, he had a tremendous interest in the **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* The reports that we brought down before the Parliament were not our only contribution to the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* The inquiry was commenced in 1963 and was a longstanding commitment of members of Parliament to the **welfare** of people who were affected by mining development.

* Many members of the Services will recall with respect and appreciation the great contribution that such people made to the morale and **welfare** of the Services, often in dangerous and difficult circumstances.

* a survey of hostel accommodation for young Aboriginals in Perth conducted by the Western Australian Director of Community **Welfare** has shown that there is sufficient Aboriginal hostel accommodation either currently available or already planned in Perth for the present need and 
I believe that the farmers of this country have shown the way to the rest of the community.

* The net incomes of people in other sectors of the community, whether they be doctors, people in industry or social **welfare** workers, are higher than those of the farmers.

* He embodied what it meant to be Australian, the best kind of Australian- a man quietly and passionately devoted to the **welfare** and future of his country.

* In every field- secondary and tertiary education, sport, recreation, the club movement- he was an active and forceful promoter of the interests and **welfare** of Wollongong and all its residents- those who were born there and those who had come there from other parts of Australia as well as from overseas.

* The Commonwealth assists development generally by helping to create a climate for investment, by making available grants and loans, by establishing special financial channels to assist private enterprise, and by investment in such responsibilities as civil aviation, telecommunications, health, social **welfare**, basic research and exploration programmes, in none of these things does the Government act unilaterally.

* Another major criticism which the Opposition has regarding this committee of inquiry relates to the insufficient attention which is given in the terms of reference to the social **welfare** implications of the financial system.

* Perhaps the only section of the terms of reference relating to social **welfare** can be found in paragraph (d) which recommends that the committee investigate: 
This is not specific enough.

* The terms of reference should clearly state that the committee of inquiry must give special attention to the effect of any changes in the Australian financial system on disadvantaged community groups and the functioning of social **welfare** policies.

* What has happened to the appealing pre-election Utopian economic and social **welfare** policies of this Government?

* Such differentials have no place in a social **welfare** system which is based on compassion.

* It will result in a lower price level than would otherwise apply and in increased economic **welfare** for the ordinary people of Australia.

* Inquiries have been set up into national superannuation, national compensation and other **welfare** matters so that a thorough review of these areas can be made.

* This, they say, will be brought about by the present Government, particularly with assistance to local government for such services as social **welfare** measures, including child care and those sorts of things.

* Turning to the Standing Committee's significant contribution to the subject of service accommodation, I would like to commend the members for their obvious concern for the **welfare** of servicemen which is evident in the report, and which I share.

* An important issue is therefore whether this far reaching change in established policy would adversely affect the ready deployment of the Defence Force or the morale and **welfare** of Service families.

* Ten years ago, in 1967, the amount outlaid for social **welfare** was about 17 per cent of a Budget of about $6 billion.

* Today social **welfare** payments exceed 27 per cent of the Budget outlays.

* Let us look at another area: Grants made direct to local government authorities for expenditure on aged and disabled persons homes, a social **welfare** subject very dear to my heart and an area in which many people in my electorate of Barton have need.

* The new Agreement gives the States more flexibility to direct **welfare** funding to those in real need and to those who can best use those funds.

* It is important to recognise that we are dealing with **welfare** housing, with public housing.

* The problem with previous agreements, and in particular the agreement which existed between 1973 and 1974 and which was supported by the then Labor Administration, was that a significant proportion of money available for **welfare** housing went to people who did not need it.

* A substantial amount of additional money over and above the base amount provided by the Commonwealth is available for **welfare** housing in Australia in the current financial year.

* We believe that there is clearly an opportunity for the States, if they so desire, to increase the funds flowing to **welfare** housing in Australia.

* Additional State funded programs in the area of **welfare** housing amounted to $60m.

* The States have an opportunity to provide at least the same level of activity in **welfare** housing in the current financial year as they provided in the last financial year.

* It is quite wrong of the Opposition to paint deliberately a false picture of the very real support that is being provided by this Government for **welfare** housing.

* As I said, the funds available should at least equal those provided by the Commonwealth last year, so long as the States play their part and co-operate in providing **welfare** housing.

* In redistributing that profit back into this country we provided benefits for people in a myriad of areas where we took up responsibility, such as school dental services, community health services, better roads and improvements in urban environment, Aboriginal **welfare** and education.

* By the end of 1976 the Utah Foundation had distributed the princely sum of $668,551 in donations within Australia in various **welfare**, research and cultural areas.

* For a long time our sorts of societies, that is, Western democratic societies, have accepted the principle that those services that are seen as a necessity- services that in short we recognise as social services, such as unemployment and sickness benefits, social **welfare** payments of all sorts and so on- are not paid for by imposing a fiat rate tax on everybody in the same way as the contributions to the voluntary funds.

* If one accepts that then, in my view, one has to accept the thesis that that sort of service or that sort of **welfare** function, if you like, should be provided out of taxation revenue and based on a sliding scale, as we accept for all other forms of social service.

* So the Liberal and Country Parties have immediately sought to revert from that system, which does represent social equity- it does, despite the honourable member for La Trobe 's interjection, and he recognises it for every other sphere of social **welfare** that he can think of- to the private enterprise system, which in essence is going to weigh far more heavily on the poor compared with the rich.

* Let us look further than the immediate needs for **welfare** housing which this Government has neglected and see what has happened even with those presently employed on low and middle incomes, and particularly those young couples or young people seeking their first home.

* What action has the Government taken to ensure that the **welfare** of these citizens is protected?

* Child **Welfare** Ordinance 1961-1968 
Is it because of Government policy (Hansard, 28th September 1971, page 1602) that the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**, in inquiring into the problems of, and the provisions for assistance to, mentally and physically handicapped personsin Australia, did not have the benefit of access to reports of the interdepartmental committee established to make a survey of handicapped children and the facilities available for their use (Parliamentary Paper No.

* It is a scheme that has been condemned by the medical profession, by pharmacists, by hospital administrators, by social workers and by **welfare** organisations.

* Anyone with the slightest understanding of health and social **welfare** knows that this scheme simply cannot operate effectively; but then, of course, it never was intended to do so.

* What (a) allocation and (b) expenditure was made in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' budget or otherwise for **welfare** relief on settlements and missions during each year since 1973.

* How can we be expected to trust the Government on its record in regard to Aboriginal **welfare**?

* We were forced to introduce it as a response to the unreasonable and totally unacceptable racially discriminatory laws in regard to Aboriginal **welfare** in Queensland.

* The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal **welfare** and rights.

* While the Prime Minister was giving those assurances his representative in Aboriginal **welfare** matters, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner),  was going about the community conveying the impression that he was an unyielding, dedicated defender of the rights of the Aboriginal people in the community.

* It is totally unacceptable that we have a government presenting itself to the Aboriginal people of Australia and suggesting that so much of this legislation should be taken on trust when its record, insofar as matters of trust are concerned, in regard to Aboriginal **welfare** is so appalling.

* The Queensland Government in its policies on Aboriginal **welfare** has established a nasty racist record.

* For instance, in the area of expenditure it has slashed by about $60m in real terms the amount of money being provided very broadly for Aboriginal **welfare** this year compared with the provision in our last Budget in 197S.

* It has cut back expenditure in health, education, housing, generally in the **welfare** area, and in all of those areas in which it is well established that Aboriginal people have distinct disadvantages, not through their own fault but because of generations of neglect which has been imposed upon them by the dominant white culture of this society.

* The Prime Minister has asked the Opposition for bipartisan support in Aboriginal **welfare**.

* We want him to step up to those which we expect should be applied for the **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* Improvements in social security and **welfare**, if not always parsimonious, under the previous Government often had a tinge of reluctance about them.

* In social **welfare**, we are doubling the contribution towards the capital cost of senior citizen centres and increasing by one-third the subsidy towards Meals on Wheels, back dated to the beginning of the year.

* One of the primary causes of the domestic inflation in Australia has not only been the Government's misjudgment but its failure to encourage further investment in the productive sector at a time when the Government's budgetary and **welfare** policies are injecting excess liquidity into the economy.

* We do not need a cradle-to-the-grave society in which the Government will dictate all aspects of our daily lives, and expect those of us who still want to work to pay dearly for the ultimate **welfare** state in which the individual will lose all freedom of choice and the capacity to plan his destiny.

* Is the inter-departmental committee established to consider the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in its report tabled on 5th May 1971 on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia, whose membership was disclosed by the Minister for Health in the Senate on 9th December 1971 (Senate Hansard, page 2560), the same as the inter-deparimental committee established to make a survey of handicapped children and the facilities available for their use, whose membership he himself refused to disclose on 28th September 1971 (Hansard, page 1602).

* During the last 33 months the Government has presided over the deliberate erosion of financial support for Aboriginal **welfare** and development programs.

* No doubt my area already has similar **welfare** workers.

* This situation, for that matter, applies to any area of community **welfare** spending.

* Use could be made of a police and citizens **welfare** club which stands idle all day or of a disused community building such as a shire office, a fire station or like buildings of a semi-industrial or office nature.

* Let us face it, in the past the State housing commissions, particularly in Western Australia, have been prone to erect homes over large areas without providing for community **welfare** in the area.

* Basically, the reasons were ones of enlightenment, progress and concern for the **welfare** of our fellow man- sympathies which the present reactionary forces opposite only glimpsed uncomprehendingly in the previous 3 years.

* He overlooked the fact that to buy a house anywhere- even **welfare** housing- requires some accumulation of capital by the intending buyer.

* This Bill provides $364.6m for the various States for **welfare** housing.

* This whole Bill is supposed to be about **welfare** housing.

* If honourable members are going to talk about **welfare** housing, surely they will be talking about people who have limited resources and people who are least able to defend themselves.

* My attitude is consistent when carried through to capital punishment, sex education, access to professional social **welfare** workers, child care centres, community assistance programs and so on.

* The honorable member for Fremantle  (Mr Beazley)  was good enough to say that I was sincere in regard to Aboriginal health and **welfare**.

* When I heard this and found this opinion expressed by the most competent authorities I checked it in a number of places and personally contacted a number of doctors who were active in the field of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* I spoke personally to sisters in charge of **welfare** clinics on the settlements.

* trade unions, employers, **welfare** organisations and interested community group have not had an opportunity of presenting their views '.

* This has been recognised as the single most important reform in the Australian **welfare** system since Federation.

* We are also becoming a **welfare** orientated hand-out society.

* The **welfare** philosophy is making huge demands on our budgets, on our national finances and on our prospects for economic recovery.

* It is a very important project to everybody concerned with the **welfare** of that area.

* Some are concerned with the internal audit and some with **welfare** and other operations.

* The **welfare** role adopted by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Defence Service Homes Corporation is notable and one that should continue.

* There is an increasing number of requests from national social **welfare** co-ordinating bodies for grants to establish and maintain a Federal headquarters.

* Amongst organisations which have sought Federal funding are : 
The Department does, however, provide financial assistance to three national **welfare** organisations: 
The State Grants (Home Care) Act, which was passed in 1969, has used less than one-third of the moneys appropriated for these purposes.

* They have been forced to allocate resources from their budgets for social **welfare** when this should have been the responsibility of the Commonwealth.

* Speakers on both sides of the Houses have made observations and suggestions on social **welfare** matters which I have noted, and I will make sure that the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  in the other place is made aware of them.

* He accused us of dismantling and distorting the social **welfare** program, of breaking promises and of dealing coldly and harshly with pensioners.

* Previously the Social **Welfare** Commission was also represented; but, in view of the abolition of the Commission in the near future, it will not have continuity of representation in that Committee.

* Mr Deputy Speaker,  these 2 Bills represent the first step of the Government in achieving its social **welfare** and repatriation policy objectives.

* They have won formidable support from many Christian and other authorities intimately interested and experienced in matrimonial law, marriage guidance and family **welfare**.

* If the Government can find money in that way it should make it available to provide assistance for more than 1 million people dependent on social **welfare**.

* I do not quibble at money being provided for essential services but I do say that the Government's priorities in social **welfare** are completely upside down.

* In a splendid little document the campaign lists chapter and verse the failure of this Government in respect of social **welfare**.

* On the first page of this letter to the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  of 8th October 1970 it states: 1 am writing to you on behalf of the Pensioners' Little Budget Campaign Committee which consists of people who are not themselves pensioners but who have joined together in a voluntary capacity to urge upon your government new initiatives in  the field of pension and post retirement **welfare**, following the introduction of the recent Federal budget.

* Parliament and say: 'For once the Prime Minister has listened to me and 1 am willing to introduce a little Budget Let him give a stimulating approach to social **welfare**, not the old decadent approach be has brought to the Ministry which we thought had gone when he was elevated.

* This generosity to the States demonstrated the real concern of the Labor Government for the financial **welfare** of the States.

* We have come no longer to debate whether social **welfare** ought to be directed to the needy and how we ought to do this, but to take as established the notion that social **welfare** is a universal right that should be paid to everybody, irrespective of need.

* They are overwhelmed by more important reasons that argue that we should apply social **welfare** to need.

* There are memories of the 'poor laws' and of the unnecessary, extreme and hard-hearted discretion that needlessly withdrew the dignity of the recipients of **welfare** assistance, much of which was in kind.

* It is not necessary to behave in such a way that dignity is withdrawn if **welfare** is applied to need.

* There are compelling reasons why we must adopt a needs approach and direct our social **welfare** of all kinds to those who need the succour of the community.

* It so happens that at the moment I am discussing **welfare** benefits.

* We cannot afford to ignore the areas of health, education, **welfare** and **welfare** housing.

* So we ought to look very carefully at these transfer payments areas and the **welfare** area- I am using the word '**welfare**' in its widest sense- to see where we can cut them without hurting the needy.

* Is it sensible that the people who occupy **welfare** housing are not among the needy?

* I think it was Professor Henderson who pointed out that the majority of those in **welfare** housing were not the poor and that the majority of the poor were not in **welfare** housing.

* The question I would have preferred to discuss in this context is this: Considering the sharp increase in the social services allocation and the heavy emphasis on this aspect in the Budget Speech, might it now be possible to discern at last something that we could regard as a Liberal Party plan, scheme or philosophy of social **welfare**?

* That is, might the Liberal Party at last have moved away from ad hocism as the basis of its social **welfare** programme?

* Proportionate to population Western Australia has contributed far more than its share to the nation's **welfare** and this can be illustrated in all basic areas.

* Before I proceed to that point, I might mention that it is interesting that the honourable member for Hotham is basing his opposition to our scheme not so much on the **welfare** of patients but on the interests of private hospitals.

* That body is a fairly vital element in the field of patient **welfare**.

* That has occurred in a budgetary position in which the Government claims that enlarging the Budget deficit is impossible, in which it refuses even to discuss the possibility of a tax cut and wage rise trade off, in which recession has stretched **welfare** services to the limit with threats being made to cut them even further, in which unemployment has been deliberately created through cuts in capital works expenditure and inflationary pressures have been exacerbated through increases in government charges.

* On 13 September 1974- in the heyday of the former Administration- the then Minister for Housing and Construction, who interjected a moment or two ago, said that so far as **welfare** housing was concerned he would provide a bottomless pit of funds.

* In fact, in the Hayden Budget of last August **welfare** housing funds were cut back by $20.8m which, having regard to the rate of inflation, certainly was a very much larger figure then than it is now.

* Rather than income support for people on **welfare**, they tend to provide programs like the food stamp program where literally billions of dollars of aid per year are transferred to the individual in terms of that kind of benefit.

* I do not believe that education is a matter of a **welfare** benefit.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* He is assisted by an unsalaried, live-in **welfare** worker, and a youth being paid under the NEAT scheme.

* Referrals come from a vast number of sources, including general purpose voluntary **welfare** bodies, churches, government bodies and youth oriented programs such as CYSS centres and the Brisbane Youth Service.

* This sort of conflict is worth noting, as religiously based organisations are by far the bestestablished in the **welfare** area.

* On looking at the map of New South Wales it can be seen that the Menindee Lakes are the only major water storage in the western part of New South Wales and to hand over control of this water to the River Murray Commission, as stated in the terms of this Bill, is a serious disregard for the **welfare** of the citizens of this area.

* It was abundantly clear, as it has been for a number of years, that the one sign of Australia's genuine commitment to the **welfare** and stability of the ASEAN countries would be a liberalisation of Australia's trade with them.

* The increase in graduates in social work will enable the staff of social **welfare** departments more effectively to regionalise their activities, as in most States they are presently attempting to do.

* There is no doubt in my mind that since 1972 the Australian Labor Party Government has demonstrated far more readily its interest in the **welfare** of our returned service men and women than did the previous government.

* There is no doubt that they will see that the Australian Labor Party Government since 1972 has demonstrated that it is interested in the **welfare** of ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen.

* It is because of the large allocation from the national **welfare** fund to health this financial year that more has not been available to keep up the pace of improvement in the pension rate which this Government has maintained since it came into office.

* Payments this year from our **welfare** fund will reach an all time high of $ 1,473m, which is an increase of $13.)

* We must take other **welfare** and social aspects into account.

* We consider **welfare**, protectionism and qualitative aspects also.

* On the contrary, a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of **welfare** assistance rather than viable support to take growers over the hump of any particular crisis.

* As Commonwealth social **welfare** benefits are not available to growers because of the work test, the stabilisation payments in many cases are just a substitute for this kind of benefit.

* -In the short time at my disposal I wish to make a couple of references to the type of hypocrisy which we have just heard from a once parasite on the trade union movement, who made a lot of money in living off the unions and who now talks glibly about private **welfare**.

* The honourable member for Stirling spoke today about private **welfare**.

* My illustration demonstrates the view of the Liberal Party about private **welfare**.

* What is the composition of the committee of evaluators set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission to evaluate the Australian Assistance Plan.

* I suggest to this Parliament that the help thus given is more meaningful than any single social **welfare** measure introduced by the Labor Government notwithstanding its claim- its usual hollow claim- to have a monopoly of concern in this area.

* I stress that measure, first, because it highlights the concern of the Government in this its first Budget to push ahead with its social **welfare** program notwithstanding the difficult economic climate and, secondly, because it links up with the second major initiative I referred to, the indexing of personal taxation.

* The Oenpelli Mission is to be commended for the very important part it plays in contributing to the **welfare** of our Aboriginal people, but I was surprised that people at the mission did not show greater keenness towards the construction of the road.

* (a) In November, 1973 the Social **Welfare** Commission requested the Queensland Council of Social Service to study and make recommendations on the implementation of the Australian Assistance Plan in the Brisbane Metropolitan' area, particularly in relation to suitable boundaries for Regional Councils for Social Development.

* Copies will be distributed to anyone interested by the Queensland and New South Wales Councils of Social Service, and will be available from the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* The distribution of Commonwealth funds for **welfare** housing is a highly emotional area.

* Is it a generally accepted fact that Aboriginals in Australia have poorer health, education, employment and other **welfare** prospects than non-Aboriginal Australians.

* The High Court of Australia, sitting in its legal ivory tower, has made decisions which are disastrous for the **welfare** of Australia and, in particular, uphold the validity of the  Curran scheme  and made section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act subject to a new almost obscene interpretation rendering its original purpose null and void.

* -I ask the Treasurer: Was there a plea at the Premier's Conference for more funds for **welfare** housing?

* Has the Minister for Social Security seen draft letters circulated by the Australian Mutual Provident Society to its employees urging them to write to members of Parliament attacking what it describes as 'luxury social **welfare** programs'?

* This Government has excelled all others, in my view, in this respect in relation not only to local government but also **welfare** organisations, industrial groups and just about every kind of community organisation one could think of.

* Our predecessors here and the centralist Government of New South Wales loaded local government with all sorts of new responsibilities in respect of a whole lot of **welfare** duties but it gave local government very little money with which to carry out those tasks.

* It was interested in the **welfare** of the sons and daughters of the Australian community.

* I therefore call on members of the Opposition to sheath their sabres, forget for a while their profound interest in the **welfare** of multi-national corporations, get their heads from under the haystacks, and reflect on the plight of the human beings who are recipients of pensions outlined in this Bill.

* For many years I have been a trade unionist and trade union official, and my years of experience in the industrial sphere of this country have demonstrated to me that the present **welfare** system, after deteriorating throughout 23 years of Liberal mismanagement, is now a crumbling, fragmented and socially unjust patchwork offering no real social security.

* As a member of the new Australian Labor Government I am pleased to have the opportunity of cementing the first brick in the foundation of a social security structure which will put the **welfare** of the community on a rational, socially-just basis and, for the first time since the last Labor government, offer some hope to the working man and his family.

* This is the Prime Minister who said in his policy speech two years ago: 'We have a comprehensive strategy to restore prosperity', and who said: 'Spending on essential education, health and **welfare** programs will be maintained'.

* The honourable member for Hotham has re-stated what can only be described as a wicked attack on **welfare** organisations in the community and on sporting organisations, all of which have been benefiting and more of which will benefit from these programs.

* I point out that all **welfare** and sporting organisations in the honourable member's electorate will be circularised with his comments today and .

* He referred to the Bailey Committee, which is a health and **welfare** task force and about which there are a certain number of rumours.

* Now we need a government in office which will take up the development of public policy in these directions and achieve for Australia, as a Labor Government can achieve for Australia, what is needed in this field to correspond with what Labor in fact achieved 30 years ago in the development of the **welfare** State.

* Australia needs the job to be done now in the public control of resources and their use that we achieved in social **welfare** 30 years ago.

* Without this we could not hope to achieve our program for housing, social **welfare**, education, health services and the like.

* Once again in this Budget the Australian people have been asked to believe that, provided the Government spends record amounts, in the short term the quality of life must improve, that opportunities for education must be greater and that better social **welfare** will result, while all the time the potential recipients of this mythical Government generosity are being asked to pay a greater and greater share of their income in taxation.

* Everyone wants a **welfare** state provided they do not have to pay for it.

* The Government was elected on a grand design for income redistribution combined with social **welfare** policies to help the low income earners within our community, but it has ignored the fact that inflation is reducing the real purchasing power of income, that there is a rapidly falling value of money, that prices for goods and services are rising and that there is a lower net income as taxes increase.

* The growth of our **welfare** services and community advancement programs are desirable- but they must ultimately depend upon our economic prosperity and upon our willingness and ability to pay for additional services through higher taxation.

* It is impossible for any government to continue to spend record amounts on **welfare** and community services and at the same time seriously attempt to restrain rises in costs and prices.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* We have said that employment, development of the country and the **welfare** of our citizens are important matters which must be seen within the context of the whole Australian economy.

* Not one of us in this House can rest easy where the **welfare** and progress of the chronically unemployed youth are involved.

* From my experience in Aboriginal **welfare** I am bound to say that there is such a diversity in the level of advancement of Aborigines and in the levels of their living conditions that there is no simple common answer to the problem.

* Yet, on the question of **welfare** state activities I believe that the record of this Government is the best in the history of Australia.

* The **welfare** state now costs this country $1,40Om dollars a year.

* I believe that our present Prime Minister is a man who is dedicated to the **welfare** of the Australian people, perhaps more than any other Prime Minister Australia has had.

* I want to comment on general health and **welfare** policies for country people and on some of the things which have been done and on those which remain to be done.

* I refer in the broadest terms to the **welfare** aspects of Federal Government assistance as distinct from commodity or industry policy, that is, assistance which attempts to alleviate the day to day problems encountered by country people to a greater degree or to reduce the cost disadvantage of those country people compared with city people.

* It was not aware that general **welfare** principles would exclude country areas.

* I am talking about **welfare** which I believe comes under the heading of social security.

* Another tremendous **welfare** problem concerns education in country areas.

* Many problems and disadvantages in this broad aspect of **welfare** remain- I believe that it is tremendously important to talk about broad aspects of **welfare** in debates such as this- but I am confident that this Government is the first government since Federation which is genuinely trying to do something for the **welfare** problems in country areas.

* Our task is to ensure that growth really does lead to an increase in **welfare**, remembering that **welfare** consists not only of the quantity of goods and services which we produce but also of the quality of the environment in which we consume them.

* This Government will revolutionise the community's approach to the problems of **welfare**, particularly the problems of the aged, the sick, the handicapped, the retarded and the migrant.

* Even the most enlightened and equal approach to social **welfare** can only scratch the surface of the basic problems of equality and wellbeing of most of our citizens.

* In the first sittings you will be asked to give priority to legislation affecting the immediate **welfare** of the people, and to matters in which my advisers believe delay would mean damage to the nation or unwarranted neglect of the peoples wishes and mandate.

* Today we legislate to improve the **welfare** of the people.

* The honourable member referred to comments by the honourable member for Hotham, the spokesman for the Opposition on health and **welfare** matters.

* I believe that the community will achieve superior health and **welfare** services as a result of this sort of approach.

* Let me remind him, as he deserves to be reminded, that last year in this House there was passed a Commonwealth-State housing Bill which provided **welfare** housing for those who were in greatest need.

* The fact is that that legislation has resulted in the greatest drop in interest rates ever experienced in Australia's history in **welfare** housing.

* In some States the interest rate on **welfare** housing has dropped by up to 1.75 per cent, representing a payment of nearly $3 a week less for every week of the mortgage, for 25 or 30 years, than would otherwise have been the case.

* That assistance in **welfare** housing has been introduced despite the opposition from the Australian Labor Party.

* I can understand, therefore, the reluctance of the honourable member for Reid when dealing with these matters to mention in detail the areas of **welfare** housing.

* His remarks are interesting because in the whole field of social policy proposed by the Australian Labor Party almost the only area in which it would impose limits in respect of **welfare** and needs is in some aspects of education - not even in housing.

* This is particularly important because there has been an insufficient output of social workers in this country and as a result of our **welfare** policies we will need more of them.

* Again it involves community involvement in determining and planning **welfare** policies at the local level, with everybody, including the recipients of **welfare** services, being involved.

* with the colleagues referred to with a view to having the public **welfare** and the rights of consumers placed before considerations of revenue raising, or docs this herald consideration of further taxes on unprescribed drugs which will then have to be made stronger by manufacturers without regard to the physiological and pathological effects.

* Some of those benefits have been seen increasingly by governmentsvery much by State governments as well as others- as **welfare** payments.

* We come therefore to a very important principle, namely, to what extent is the insurance industry to be tied in terms of either its short term obligations or its long term obligations to the **welfare** principle?

* It is now allowing takeovers by multinational corporations, a practice which it claimed and has claimed consistently over the years to be detrimental to the **welfare** of the Australian people and to this country.

* The article which follows states: 
Has a decision been made on assistance for development and equipment of an Aboriginal community centre at Pinjarra submitted by the Murray District Aboriginal Association to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

* As usual, the Opposition could well be asked how it would finance its vast but indefinite expenditure on defence, social **welfare**, local government, education and overseas aid, without increasing taxation.

* Why then, for the sake of politics, does the ALP support those who are not interested in the **welfare** of Australia?

* So, through responsibly looking at the needs of the economy and the terrible neglect in the areas of social **welfare** and education by successive Liberal Party governments, wehave been able to provide for the Australian people and at the same time introduce a Budget that will allow the business of Australia to move along, that will allow our factories to run at peak production, with people at a peak level of employment, with the number of unfilled jobs as high as they ever have been and, at the same time, we have tried to do something creditable about the appalling 13 per cent level of inflation created by the former Government 12 months ago.

* I strongly support the proposition that abuse and wastage, whether it is in relation to **welfare** or any other government expenditure, must be restrained or eliminated, if that is at all possible, so that those who are in greatest need receive a more equitable share of the **welfare** dollar, or the taxation dollar as a whole.

* There were many cuts in the **welfare** field.

* So we can see that the Government has nothing to boast about in its **welfare** program.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* I take this opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  on introducing one of the most popular social service **welfare** Budgets post-war.

* In doing so, I direct my remarks to the field of social services in which some very important decisions affecting the **welfare** of many of our best aged citizens have been made.

* I think it is important always when discussing what may be the problems of high tariff in Australia also to discuss the **welfare** and the wellbeing of the people who are involved and affected by decisions which are taken by governments 
It is true and it has been said from this side of the House on a number of occasions.

* It is so much hogwash for the Government continually to use the 25 per cent tariff cut as the basis for saying that the Opposition does not think about the **welfare** of industry or the people who work in it.

* Let me say one thing: Another element is involved in this question- I will deal with it quite separately- and that is that when a government is providing funds for **welfare** housing I believe there is some obligation on the Government to do so in a way that will provide the best housing for the greatest number of people and not in a way which, because of the expense involved, will heavily restrict the number of people who can be accommodated in such **welfare** housing.

* There is really no primary responsibility on the Commonwealth, apart from and distinct from that which is the responsibility of local government, State government, State government **welfare** agencies and the like, to do anything differently in respect of Aboriginals than it would do in respect of other members of the community who, by their anti-social misbehaviour, bring themselves into ill repute with their neighbours.

* There are programs within the **welfare** agencies of government and there are activities which local government can undertake to help Aboriginals who are housed under this national housing program embarked upon by this Government as it has been embarked upon by previous governments.

* Broadly, press statements are distributed to media organisations, members of Parliament, Government departments, embassies, political party organisations and members, **welfare** organisations, libraries and individuals from whom requests are received.

* Pursuant to section 34 of the Services Trust Funds Act 1947 I present the annual reports of the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund, the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund for the calendar year 1976, together with financial statements and the report of the Auditor-General on those statements.

* It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre.

* In accordance with our policy of concentrating **welfare** assistance on people in the greatest need, the Government is in favour of making the Act more effective in meeting the needs of a wider range of homeless people.

* At this stage, however, the Government has not yet reached a decision on the proposals of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health, one of which is that the homeless persons assistance program should become part of a wider 'Sheltered Accommodation Program', administration of which might be devolved to the State governments.

* Expenditure under the National **Welfare** Fund on accommodation and meal subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1977 amounted to $1.7m.

* Salary subsidies were paid for 34 social **welfare** workers.

* But, when Opposition members have to debate a specific issue- whether it be medical research, defence, the **welfare** area, education or anything else- they say that we should have given more money.

* The statistics that are uncovered and reported in the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission for 1972-73 are worth considering.

* The decision to reorganise the administration of our economic aid programs is based on the view that improvements in aid must be affected in almost all aspects of our aid endeavours - in the machinery for formulating policy, in ensuring greater attention to the **welfare** and distributive effects of our aid, in evaluating the effectiveness of our various schemes, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the program.

* It is rather curious that the spokesman for the Opposition on **welfare** matters, the honourable member for Hotham, seems to have been selected for this role not because of what he can contribute constructively on **welfare** matters but for what he can do for the Opposition in either containing commitments in the **welfare** field or destroying worthwhile programs.

* Only this week I received a letter from a person who is a constituent of the honourable member for Hotham, and is involved in the **welfare** field, bemoaning the fact that, as he put it, 'Don Chipp has changed from being a reason-  able small '1' liberal to becoming a quite reactionary and repressive person where the issues of social **welfare** are concerned'.

* Frankly, I sincerely regret that the policy of the Opposition as articulated by the Opposition spokesman on **welfare** matters, seems to be one of destruction where community development is concerned in **welfare** services, 
If so, will a condition of these payments be that expenditure, employment, housing and other local government, community development, **welfare** and commercial activities so funded be under the control of the representatives chosen by the communities concerned at ballots where voting and the custody and counting of votes are supervised by scrutineers appointed by the local communities, assisted by appropriate legally aware persons chosen by them after full information as to voting and scrutineering statutes is given to his satisfaction.

* One result has been the greatest decline in interest rates charged for **welfare** housing ever sustained or experienced in this country.

* Therefore, in general there is a range of interest rates now chargeable on Stab **welfare** housing and to the home builders account to the co-operative terminating societies of the order of 5 per cent to 5S per cent and 51 per cent.

* The honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  consciously led Australians to believe that they were entitled to **welfare** irrespective of whether they were in need of it.

* It is a variation of the attitude which led him to tax and deficit the Australian economy into stagnation in order to provide **welfare** for the middle class.

* One of the great difficulties for any government is trying to ensure that the social **welfare** allocations go to those in greatest need.

* The fact is that in social **welfare** policies the great difficulty has been to identify in some circumstances those people who require assistance and those who require it more than others.

* How were the various objectives emphasised by the Australian Labor Party prior to the 1972 election, and shared by this side of the House, in the field of social **welfare**, in education, urban development and in assistance to the poor to be achieved?

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be meeting with various State Ministers including  Mr Ron  Payne, the South Australian Minister for Community **Welfare**, in Sydney this Friday to discuss matters pertaining to the Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council.

* When a conclusion is reached this will involve funding for education and other aspects of Aboriginal **welfare** related to the outstation movement.

* The Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account formula is for 40 per cent of the royalty payments for minerals extracted from the land to be paid to land councils, 30 per cent to be paid to the local traditional owners of the land concerned, and the remaining 30 per cent to be paid towards the general **welfare** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* That formula is to be departed from by taking some money out of the 30 per cent for the general **welfare** of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and giving it to the land councils to cover extra administrative costs.

* The Government has already shown that it does not intend to forget mining centres which are already employing many thousands of people and which contribute millions of dollars yearly to the State and national **welfare** in royalties and taxes.

* High grade ore at Broken Hill is reaching the end of its life but there is a large body of low grade ore. We believe that the Government should be conscious of the contribution that Broken Hill has made to the **welfare** of Australia and that some assistance should be given towards the exploration for and the mining of this body of low grade ore.

* If necessary she is placed in the custody and care of the Director of Social **Welfare**.

* In the field of social **welfare** nothing significant has been achieved in the 23 years the previous Government held office.

* This area of social **welfare** was neglected by the previous Government.

* This table also includes the distribution of additional amounts to be provided for **welfare** housing, to which I shall refer in a moment.

* An additional $65m is being provided for payment to the States for **welfare** housing activities under the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* With the additional $6 5m now provided, the total allocation to the States for **welfare** housing in 1974-75 will reach $375m, an increase of $156m over the 1973-74 allocation.

* Or are we going to be entertained by the same performance as we have had when Ministers of the Federal Government in the areas of housing, transport and health and **welfare** have taken proposals to the State Government?

* These projects, one for the South Sydney Municipal Council and the other for the Leichhardt Municipal Council are for **welfare** centres.

* The South Sydney Municipal Council has an architect's estimate of the cost of one project- the renovation of the Reg Cope **Welfare** Centre which has been in existence for approximately 20 years.

* There is a plan indicating the location of the Reg Cope **Welfare** Centre.

* The project is designed to provide dining and **welfare** facilities for approximately 130 persons daily.

* The Council is already operating 4 other **welfare** centres within the municipality.

* The 4 centres are the Ron Williams **Welfare** Centre, the Gordon Ibbett **Welfare** Centre, the Harry Burland **Welfare** Centre and the Cliff Nobel **Welfare** Centre.

* It will help the Reg Cope **Welfare** Centre in South Sydney.

* There are 2 **welfare** centres in Leichhardt.

* One is the Harry Hannaford **Welfare** Centre.

* The City of Sydney has 5 **welfare** centres.

* Of course, a balance is always needed and advances must continue to be made in fields of social **welfare** and education but if the source of these advances, the growth and wealth producing areas of our economy, are restricted or hamstrung and if the scourge of inflation is allowed to race on unimpeded, the Government will end up robbing the very people it makes a sham and a pretence of representing.

* Education and social **welfare** have been given top priority in the Budget, as they should be in any Budget, and while this is not the place to debate fully these 2 vital areas of government responsibility, I commend the government for many of the measures undertaken.

* They know that single and married women are at times so threatened by the thought of bearing a child that their own **welfare** - possibly the **welfare** of a family- is seriously threatened.

* Social **welfare**, I suggest, is a right and a privilege not to be taken lightly or abused, extended or increased only when the nation can sustain the cost.

* We will make extensions and increase social **welfare** in this country but only within the context of the ability of the people to meet that cost.

* That would mean that our allocation of resources to education, health, social **welfare**, and urban and regional development could be planned without risk of dislocation.

* Without a doubt, already in a period of only 11 months, they have created a completely new perspective and completely new horizons in the fields of social **welfare** and health services.

* There was a time when Australia could boast that it was one of the great countries of experiment in social **welfare**.

* The $10.4m allocated to the State Housing Commission of Western Australia will enable **welfare** housing activity to proceed at about the same level as in 1972-73.

* The honourable member is interested in the **welfare** of the Services.

* The Committee decided to press the urgent need for an integrated approach to the planning of health and **welfare** services in Albury-Wodonga; to bring to the notice of the Ministerial Council the acute shortage of social **welfare** workers in the area, particularly those experienced in youth work; to ask the Cities Commission for a study of the effect of the growth centre on the ecology; to press for the regular release of planning information so that Albury-Wodonga businessmen can plan for the future; and to ask that the Development Corporation consider the need for infant and child care facilities in commercial development and community facilities, as well as providing for the disabled.

* Some corporations might very well find that an enormous project involving millions of dollars and the **welfare** and livelihood of thousands of Australians could be placed in jeopardy because if a breach of section  82KH  or section  82KJ  of the Act were discovered the entire tax deductibility would disappear.

* If there were people in 1937 and 1938 who could have envisaged the fact that Philby was to become an active member of a government that was totally against the **welfare** of the government of the United Kingdom, is it the judgment of members of the Opposition that that ought not have been stated in some paper about him?

* Do they not understand that the **welfare** of their nation is protected directly in ratio to the significance of the national security organisation?

* If one looks at the same subject of Aboriginal **welfare** and the determination of this Government to remove all forms of discrimination from its legislation, that also gives support to the disadvantaged.

* The same can be said of the Government's policies on pensions, **welfare** housing and social services generally.

* To that extent it is a valuable **welfare** measure and one that ought to be supported.

* He fails to understand that **welfare** housing cannot be used and ought not to be used as the principal compensating agent for a downturn in the level of housing activity in Australia.

* But I cannot help feel that in large measure it is a power given to judges to bolster their need for believing that the sentences they impose will not be undone by subsequent decisions by psychologists, social and **welfare** workers, and others who are charged with the duty of observing prisoners and assessing their chances of successful reintegration into society.

* Its members consist of the Director-General of Social **Welfare** and 3 other members who at present are the  Chairman  of the Prisoners' Aid Society, an ex-Chief Parole Officer, and a medical practitioner.

* The parole boards receive opinions from psychiatrists, psychologists, prison officials and **welfare** people, and with the growing experience and expertise that they, acquire, they make a decision as to, whether a prisoner should be released by being parolled.

* There is nothing in the Ordinance to direct a departmental officer or officers to take account of medical reports, psychological reports or reports of social or **welfare** officers, or to take account of the opportunities or lack of opportunities for gainful employment outside gaol.

* Another matter to which I refer is the Northwest One Stop **Welfare** Centre in my electorate.

* If we are to increase the amount provided for expenditure by the States, are we to reduce the amount that is to be spent on social **welfare** measures?

* The Leader of the Opposition, from all the inferences that could be drawn from his remarks, was suggesting that what the Government was doing was not sufficient and that it should also increase its expenditure on social **welfare**.

* I mention the decisions on **welfare** housing, pensioner housing and the home savings grant.

* Under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement we are providing to the States an amount of $3 16m for **welfare** housing and of that amount $ 130m will be by way of matching grants.

* As we look around at the deprived areas in Australia and the deprived schools about which We of the Labor Party talk we see that they are, typically, in the working class area - the areas with larger families, the areas where both parents go to work, the areas where there is a greater concentration of migrants, areas where there are more families dependent on **welfare** payments and areas where more children have to leave school at an earlier age.

* In Victoria the groups are as follows, the numbers of organisations in each group at 30 June 1969 being shown in brackets: hospitals (160), benevolent homes (12), hostels for the aged (124), children's homes (56), foundling homes and refuges (15), rescue homes' (4), convalescent homes (1), blind, deaf and dumb institutions (6), medical dispensaries (2), institutes for maternal and infant **welfare** (4), philanthropic organisations and societies (295), church relief organisations (27), benevolent societies (76), training schools for nurses (3), nursing services and societies (4), bush nursing centres (20), ambulance services (24), hostels (11), creches (7), kindergartens (135), and organisations for the **welfare** of boys and girls (425).

* What is his attitude to the view of the interim committee that a regional structure for social **welfare** should be combined with the already established regional structure for the Grants Commission.

* I am opposed to the pill being on the free list and I would prefer to see these funds of $5m, or S8m from next year, allocated to family planning agencies rather than the present system of subsidising the use of the pill and other devices - and they are being subsidised - because family planning agencies provide counselling and advice across the whole range of family **welfare** problems.

* Rather than attacking the Labor Premiers who have these and other doubts over the end result of the Fraser Government's proposal, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development would be more productive if he ensured that studies were undertaken correlating the cost benefit and social **welfare** implications of alternatives to the existing scheme.

* But the Government has not introduced this measure because of any **welfare** motive.

* The 2 Government parties have never been interested in **welfare**.

* The Labor Party said during that period that what it would do was introduce pensions that were indexedour motivation was social **welfare**- so that they always kept their value.

* The Australian Government meets **welfare** payments in all other avenues.

* But what the honourable member for Kingston  (Mr Chapman)  did not say was that the Commonweath sought to increase the rents for **welfare** housing to the long-term bond rate.

* We have to be diplomats and social **welfare** workers, and of course we have to make a contribution to this chamber as well.

* But, despite the need to constrain public expenditure and the severity of the economies that the Commonwealth Government has imposed upon itself, the amount appropriated in this Bill for expenditure by the States on **welfare** housing is, whatever semantics the honourable member for Hughes  (Mr Les Johnson)  might indulge in, slightly higher than the allocation made last year by the previous Government.

* In passing, in talking about the need to restrict government expenditure, the honourable member for Hughes must remember that in his Government's time it also saw the need for some restraint on the rapid increases that had occurred in the allocation of funds for **welfare** housing.

* It was pointed out by the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh)  that the ability of the States to finance **welfare** housing is not restricted by the amount of money appropriated in this Bill.

* One pan of the amendment was to the effect that the Government is not paying 'due regard to the nature and extent of the **welfare** housing needs as between the various States'.

* In the public **welfare** area, I have already agreed to proceed in consultation with the States towards developing a new arrangement for financing this activity in the States.

* Of course, in addition to that social **welfare** costs another $6 billion or 25 per cent of Government expenditure.

* Therefore Australians really pay very dearly for their health and social **welfare**.

* An amount of $550,000 is to be allocated for **welfare** purposes, $200,000 for general community purposes and $350,000 for the arts.

* I will be asking the committee of the House of Assembly to give me advice as to the disposition of the $750,000 that relates to **welfare** and the general community.

* It is argued that social **welfare** benefits should be available to the islanders.

* In the social **welfare** area there is so much to be done.

* In the social **welfare** field it is always a case of too little too late.

* The Government is not really interested in the pensioners' **welfare**.

* More importantly, it must take a direct interest in the **welfare** of migrants who have been brought to this country by private project development firms which have nominated migrants and made promises which cannot be kept.

* The performance to date has been that of a stop-go economy, of stop-go **welfare** schemes and broken promises, particularly on the means test, and of Federal Government bond rate moves which have caused soaring home loan interest rates that have been passed on by building societies.

* Industrial safety in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea is provided for by the Industrial Safety, Health and **Welfare** Ordinance 1961, and orders made under the Ordinance; the Industrial Safety, Health and **Welfare** Regulations 1965; and sections of other Ordinances, such as the Papua and New Guinea Electricity Commission Ordinance 1961-69.

* -Is the Prime Minister aware that  Mr Dixon,  the Victorian Minister for Social **Welfare**, has called on the Federal Government to pay unemployment benefits to men and women who have been stood down because of the power dispute and stated that any decision to abolish these payments would cost the Victorian Government $7.6m a week.

* Can he assure the House that the Government will heed  Mr Dixon's  plea or has he once again put his policy of 'salvation through stagnation' ahead of the **welfare** of the unemployed?

* The rehabilitation part of it is supposed to have been a major social **welfare** step in rural reconstruction.

* It has no concern for the social and spiritual **welfare** of the people of this nation.

* That is the measure of its concern for the **welfare** of the farmers.

* One of the fundamental requirements of efficient administration of social **welfare** and unemployment benefits is to ensure that eligibility for benefits is determined.

* Unemployment benefits, social **welfare** benefits and other benefits are designed to relieve people of hardship and suffering and are paid for by the taxpayers and the community generally.

* Those areas referred to the whole of the social infrastructurethe need to build up education, health services, urban and regional development, **welfare** housing, social security and **welfare**.

* I was interested in his early comments in which he stated that the former Labor Government was elected in December 1972 because of the appeal of its **welfare** program.

* Whilst one can understand that people will support a **welfare** program, I assure him that one of the reasons that his Government was elected in December 1972 was that it had been out of office for 23 years and the Australian people had forgotten what it would mean to have a profligate socialist government on the treasury benches.

* The Australian Government has direct responsibility for the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement under which **welfare** houses are built as well as for defence service homes.

* Most  important of those would be the attention to be given to Aboriginal **welfare**.

* There are others in this Parliament, certainly in my own Party, who are better qualified than I am to speak on Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Rehabilitation (SIDCOR) comprises representative from the Departments of the Special Minister of State (chair), Education, Health, Labor and Immigration, Repatriation and Compensation, Social Security and the Treasury, and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission and the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* The regional organisations of Councils were set up exclusively for the purposes of the Grants Commission Act, but it now appears that the Australian Government favours these organisations accepting at least some degree of responsibility in relation to other programmes in the field of Urban and Regional Development and social **welfare** (Australian Assistance Plan).

* Land purchase for recreation, erection of community buildings and several much needed **welfare** and youth programmes that would involve the appointment of staff.

* Let us hope that this sort of attitude is gone forever because it should be obvious to anyone interested in the **welfare** of local government, which is related to the **welfare** of disadvantaged citizens and_ areas, that the Liberal-Country Party coalition Government and its counterparts in the State governments had no intention of giving any real assistance to local government.

* These measures, however, are only an interim step pending receipt of the report of a Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, which was set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission about twelve months ago at my direction.

* Finally, do his Government's policies in favour of the big cities mean that the **welfare** of the small States which export much more than they import is to be sacrificed in favour of the most populous States?

* But the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition then went on to say that health, education and social **welfare** expenditure would be excluded.

* Can the Minister inform the House what measures have been taken to stimulate the expansion of the Australian assistance plan so that more people have the chance to be involved in developing **welfare** facilities in their own community?

* I have had to make a judgment between an easy destruction of the Liberal Party and damage to the **welfare** of this country.

* I have decided to put the **welfare** of Australia ahead of my contempt for the Liberal Party.

* The provisions concerning the safety, health and **welfare** of employees in the asbestos industry are covered by State legislation.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* Now, however, local government is involved in many other activities, such as those of a **welfare** nature.

* In other words, they should be financed out of the same revenue as other governments use to pay for their **welfare** services, that is, local councils must have access to Commonwealth revenue.

* The Australian Labor Party must ask itself whether it wants to jettison or desert a country that has the **welfare** of 14 million people under its control.

* In my statement to the press on 11 March 1973 I said that my Department would be seeking approval (from the Public Service Board) to appoint 48 multi lingual **welfare** officers, some of whom it was proposed would work with migrant children in schools and between the schools and migrants' homes.

* The intention to make such appointments was first discussed however at a meeting with State education authorities on 12 January 1970, and there is reference to my Department's intention to assess the need to extend its normal integration services, through the provision of interpreters and **welfare** officers to meet the requirements of the child migrant education program, in the Ministerial Statement made to Parliament on 23 April 1970 by the then Minister for Immigration.

* I refer to those people in  receipt of  social  security and **welfare**  benefits.

* Under the previous Government - and I take the figures from Hansard of 21 August 1973 - the amount actually spent on social security and **welfare** benefits rose by $503.5m over the amount provided in the previous year whereas the estimated increase this year over the amount provided last year is only $339.5m - a very serious drop of some $64m or 33 per cent less than the increase provided last year over the preceding year.

* Can the Minister assure the House that these restrictions will be lifted immediately so that non-English speaking migrants are guaranteed equality of access to medical, legal and social **welfare** services regardless of what language they speak?

* It is determined to put some limit on the blank cheque that has been signed in relation to Medibank because it knows perfectly that if the expenditure on Medibank is allowed to grow at its present rate it will grow so fast that the money needed for it can come only from future education and **welfare**.

* The Government is also providing an increase- a large increase- in child endowment, which will be paid to the mothers of children in areas in which there is real need and in which the private **welfare** agencies have said that such payment is so necessary.

* The honourable member for Bowman complained about housing in Queensland and **welfare** housing.

* In the last year of the McMahon Government $ 167m was made available throughout Australia for **welfare** housing.

* In health and **welfare** Australia led the world nearly 50 years ago.

* Firstly, these industries are vital to the **welfare** and interests of the Australian community, and more particularly those who live outside the metropolitan areas.

* Category A registered publications are confined to country newspapers and periodicals and newspapers and periodicals published by religious, charitable and **welfare** organisations and by educational, scientific or technical organisations having the dissemination of knowledge as their principal object.

* I am particularly concerned that Australia may be in for a period of open ended **welfare** funding.

* The demands on the **welfare** vote are showing signs of increasing by very large amounts.

* The amount allocated for the function of social security and **welfare** in 1965-66 was $933m.

* So the amount of Commonwealth Government outlays for the social security and **welfare** function was about 18 per cent of the total outlays.

* In the present financial year, under the last Labor administration, the amount allocated to the social security and **welfare** function is close to $5,000m.

* The figure for the social security and **welfare** function is approaching 25 per cent of total expenditure.

* So in 10 years the outlays on the social security and **welfare** function have risen from 18 per cent to an amount roughly equivalent to 25 per cent.

* **Welfare** spending increased steadily in the 1960s.

* The trend, rather than getting better, is expected to get worse, barring a sudden and drastic overhaul of the whole **welfare** state.

* I believe that Australia needs to look at **welfare** and at the emotional and extreme demands on Federal Government outlays in this direction.

* I think we must determine a level of **welfare** spending which is acceptable to the community and to the Government.

* Then we must allocate that amount of money among all our competing **welfare** functions, in much the same way that there is an acceptable figure for the amount of money that ought to be spent on defence.

* I am horrified at the prospect of the politically sensitive area of **welfare** putting increasing pressure upon the Parliament and upon the Government m relation to the expenditure outlays which the Parliament is called upon to allocate.

* We must accept the fact that we cannot allow to develop in Australia a situation which would be anywhere near similar to the American experience where something in excess of 50 per cent of the federal Government's outlays are going one way or another into the area of **welfare**.

* Often it is increased by political activity, by bidding up and by the creeping **welfare**.

* I do not use that word disparagingly, but the **welfare** commitment tends to creep.

* I think it is particularly important that we take note of it in this **welfare** area.

* We were told that the two previous Budgets were social **welfare** Budgets.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton),  the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  and others told us that they were social **welfare** Budgets.

* State **welfare** departments make financial assistance available to people caring for children who are under State control.

* This new allowance should be seen in the context of the broad program of education, training and general **welfare** for handicapped children being developed by the Government.

* Parents or guardians who care for a handicapped child at home will be encouraged to take full advantage of the facilities that are being made available under the general **welfare** program and the child's attendance at a day school or training centre will not affect eligibility for payment of the allowance.

* The IAC report reflects a complete lack of optimism about the future of the industry, it ignores confirmed market potential, it proposes a costly, complex and ill-considered **welfare** system for individuals rather than product assistance to stabilise the industry itself .

* I congratulate the Government for plugging two of the gaps in areas of social **welfare** injustice in providing for the single or no-parent families with dependent children, the supporting mother's benefit, which clarified one area, and the double orphan's pension for the parentless or orphan child.

* I know that I am speaking on the same subject as did the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  but I am quite happy to do that because I believe that there is one area still outstanding which is the single most serious area of social **welfare** injustice in Australia, and that is the single male parent with dependent children, the widower, the divorced or the deserted father.

* It is certainly not the view of this Committee based on the evidence it received, or of the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in its report 'The Environmental Conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and the Preservation of their Sacred Sites', and the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** in its recent report 'Drug Problems in Australia- An Intoxicated Society?'

* Indeed, the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** voiced its concern when it said: .

* He could not justify the Government's inaction and the fact that it had completely ignored the representations that had been made to it by those who are responsible for the **welfare** of exservicemen in this country.

* I think it is time that a responsible Minister - one who spoke with, I believe, some sincerity when he sat on the back bench, on the abolition of the means test and the inadequacy of the income received by pensioners - spoke in his reply about the miserable 50c increase that he gave to the pensioners in this Budget and which has led to the kind of representations that every honourable member in this Parliament, whether he sits on the Opposition side or the Government side, has received from the various organisations which are concerned about the **welfare** of these people.

* I know that most States now give some assistance in the form of State social **welfare** payments.

* Not all the information concerning sources and uses of funds for **welfare** housing sought by the honourable member is available.

* Also, as **welfare** housing arrangements in 1978- 79 were made under the 1978 Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, the figures for 1978-79 and for earlier years are in some cases not directly comparable, and, because of different accounting arrangements, estimates for the various States are not comparable in many cases.

* However, the information which is available, and the fact that under the revised Housing Agreement increased surpluses may be generated from the operation of housing programs and utilised for **welfare** housing purposes, support the statements made following the June 1978 Premiers' Conference.

* The involvement of the local community and local government bodies in the provision of **welfare** services is not entirely a new concept or one exclusive to the proposed assistance plan.

* In Victoria the State Government has for a number of years, since 1969, provided a subsidy through the Social **Welfare** Department to pay the salary costs of a full time social worker to promote local government involvement in community services.

* In such pilot programs and the proposed action research the hope can be expressed that heed is paid to the experience, pitfalls and insights gained from similar research conducted in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, of which I am sure the Social **Welfare** Commission is aware.

* Since the Bill was introduced the Minister has indicated that the Australian Government has decided to emphasise support for **welfare** pro jects proposed by local communities under the assistance plan rather than to proceed with **welfare** centres operated by the Department of Social Security.

* I presume the reason for it was specifically to cover the position of  Mr Tom  .Roper, who was a member of the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission and who after joining the Interim Committee was elected as a member of the Victorian Parliament.

* Has his attention been drawn to a report in The Review, 27th May-2nd June 1972, (a) that the present manager of the Foundation has abolished the Foundation's **welfare** program and cancelled such things as providing amenities for showering and shaving or a free meal for **welfare** cases who needed help to get back their self-respect and dignity before looking for a job or housing and (b) that the second floor of the building used by the Foundation, once used as emergency accommodation for Aboriginals in need, has been converted into a comfortable apartment for the present manager and his family at an alleged cost of $7,900; if so, will he investigate these allegations.

* If the allegations in parts (2) and (3) are correct, will he take whatever action is necessary to ensure that Commonwealth funds appropriated for Aboriginal **welfare** are spent as the Parliament intended.

* They have been contributing to the National **Welfare** Fund in the form of taxation and getting shrunken benefits in return.

* a joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social **welfare** needs of the Australian community'.

* One of the things that happens- this is a criticism of State governmentsis that every time there is an increase in the pension, the tenants of Housing Commission houses or flats, **welfare** housing, in Victoria at any rate, always have their rentals raised and this generally absorbs most of the increase.

* But the real issues are what this Government has done on education, cities, health, consumer protection, social **welfare** and foreign investment, and it is this last subject which is the nub of the matter.

* The quality of life we enjoy, the structure, the efficiency of our manufacturing industries, the distribution of and the demand for **welfare** services, the role that Australia will play as a member of the international community- in short, Australia's population policies-are central to the population decisions of government.

* Concern for social justice and social **welfare** and respect for human freedom are fundamental to American values.

* Since the company is a major fruit cannery in the Shepparton region these difficulties, without some degree of alleviation, would have serious consequences for the stability of the industry, the **welfare** of growers and the **welfare** of the whole Shepparton area generally.

* At this time, when so much is being done to give a degree of independence to school communities and so much is being done to involve the parents in school councils or **welfare** clubs, assistance needs to be given in those deprived schools where there is this cultural gap to enable the school council, **welfare** club or parent group to ensure that people do not stay away because of a nervousness or fear that they will expose their lack of appreciation and understanding of the education process.

* The main thrust of the Budget is directed to continuing the programs in social **welfare**, health, urban and regional development and many other areas.

* Similarly in social development it is quite clear that if the national Government had had more authority in this area many more important social **welfare** programs would have been developed on a national basis.

* I am talking about social development in its broadest context, not just social **welfare** programs.

* The Department has got itself into a situation in which the migrant **welfare** section of the Department is a rank failure.

* It ought to be adopting the recommendations contained in the Bailey report, the report of the health and **welfare** task force and other reports which talk about cohesive services that need to be coordinated in the interests of migrants in general.

* But when the social **welfare** system is being worked out no doubt the question of those who might temporarily be in need because of unemployment will be considered in the context of that sort of system.

* I see in this bypassing, as I see in other legislation, evidence of another example of what I think is a disturbing trend in social **welfare** legislation and something about which I intend to speak in this House on the estimates for the Department of Social Security, that is, the tendency to institutionalise our social **welfare** services.

* The domiciliary nursing care benefit has been the subject of examination by 2 Government established enquiries in the health and **welfare** fields- the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* The Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health proposed in its report that the domiciliary nursing care benefit, with envisaged possible modifications, be included in a Community Health and Care Program.

* Is the Minister for Immigration aware that there is considerable anxiety among applicants for positions as multi-lingual **welfare** officers with the Department of Immigration at the delay in finalising the appointments?

* Neither of those figures represents the full extent of the Commonwealth commitment to the **welfare** of migrants.

* Forty-eight special project grants with total expenditure of $150,000 were made in 1978- 79 to encourage self-help among ethnic groups and to help trade unions in providing **welfare** services to migrant members.

* Human dignity and the exercise of free choice consistent with over-all public **welfare** are basic rights which must be assured in every society.

* Such policies must be an essential component of an over-all development strategy, linking and harmonising them with policies on industrialisation, agriculture, social **welfare**, and environmental and cultural preservation so that each supports the other in a progressive improvement in wellbeing of all mankind.

* In the social **welfare** sphere, the present Government has carried on many of the policies which were instituted by us when we were in government.

* In the social **welfare** field, we raised the pension right across the board when it was necessary.

* 30 August: A Report from the Social **Welfare** Commission - Tabled by  Mr Hayden.

* 4 December: A Report from the Social **Welfare** Commission concerning Aged Person's Housing - Tabled by  Mr Hayden.

* The honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  who was very vocal in opposition to this item has a motion before the House seeking standing committees on foreign affairs and defence, finance and trade, health and **welfare**, primary industry and national development, transport and communications, education, science and the arts, legal, home and internal territory affairs.

* As I mentioned, we are continuing our agreements with the States to provide **welfare** housing.

* I hope that, in the next year or so, the discussions and negotiations that we are having with the States will result in a much more effective delivery of **welfare** housing through StateFederal co-operation.

* This year in New South Wales there has been a reduction of $33m in the allocation to that State for **welfare** housing.

* Accordingly, a valuable and desirable contribution could be made to **welfare** housing.

* Also, $100m ought to be provided by the Government for **welfare** housing.

* People in the community who are associated with school committees, parent organisations and so on do not get one cent in return for the hours they devote to the **welfare** of children.

* The Australian Mutual Provident Society's pre-printed message cards to Federal members urging a 'modifying of this Government's social **welfare** programs' are in reality a campaign urging a reduction in unemployment and sickness benefits, age, invalid and widow pensions, a postponement of the abolition of the means test for age pensions and an attack on all less privileged people who receive any kind of social **welfare** assistance from this Government.

* As this campaign for abortion has proceeded, it is notable that concern for child endowment, maternity **welfare**, reduction of neo-natal, infant and child mortality of Aborigines have all been played off the stage.

* Such concern would be to find why people are pressured towards abortion; how unwed mothers might have proper care and hospital attention to give natural birth to their children; the procedures of adoption; the provision of government subsidised day care and after school centres for children of working parents; payment of equal tax rebates for dependants, rather than the present system of concessional deductions; increased **welfare** benefits for deserted and/ or unmarried mothers; removal of legislative discrimination and positive action to suppress social and commercial discrimination against unwed mothers, de facto wives and illegitimate children.

* In the Northern Territory these can mean the saving of Aboriginal child life, for children in such centres are seen by infant **welfare** sisters and, as a consequence, their health problems are treated.

* Its rebuff to the Amnesty International mission, which visited Indonesia in January 1975 a predominantly Australian mission including  Senator Peter  Baume and led by  Mr Dick  McGarvie, Q.C.,  President  of the Victorian Bar Council was in marked contrast to the co-operation which its leaders have shown to the 3 previous International Amnesty missions to Indonesia in 1966, 1969 and 1970.I appeal to the Indonesian Government to relieve the plight and increase the **welfare** of the Tapols.

* I appeal that it allow independent observers to inspect the prisons so that their improved **welfare** can be verified.

* However, the extension of those standards to Commonwealth Government contractors, employees engaged in the Territories and interstate trade and commerce poses jurisdictional questions, but with the co-operation of the State Ministers for Labour, considerable progress is being made in the development of uniform safety, health and **welfare** legislation.

* In total this represents one of the greatest long-term social **welfare** and rehabilitation problems in history, lt involves millions of people and affects just about every family in South Vietnam.

* The contribution Australia has made to social **welfare** and rehabilitation is a mere drop from the tap compared with its military spending.

* What worries me is that, as with so many other aspects of social **welfare** policy brought into this Parliament, no comprehensive report has been produced to the Parliament indicating the basis upon which the Government has made its decision to embark on particular legislation.

* I am not talking of the general public relations booklet which the Department has produced but the sort of report that is produced as a command paper by the **Welfare** Department in Great Britain.

* The grandiloquence of the Minister on this aspect of social **welfare** scarcely seems justified.

* There is, however, an understandable reluctance on the part of many firms- and also of employees- to leave areas of activity with which they are familiar, even if those activities may be costly to the community or may not be contributing fully to national **welfare**.

* Recommendation concerning Seafarers' **Welfare** at Sea and in Port.

* These nurses, who work mainly in maternal and child **welfare** clinics, said that their survey showed that it was not practical for a family to try to live on one low income.

* I think the item that has received the most generous comment is that relating to social **welfare**.

* Total expenditure on social **welfare** is $6, 187m- almost 25 per cent of the total Budget outlay, and a 23.5 per cent increase on last year's budgetary item.

* The increase alone is greater than the total allocation for social **welfare** just a few short years ago.

* In fact the amount allocated for social **welfare** in this Budget makes the amount allocated for it only 5 years ago look like petty cash.

* As with social **welfare**, we have generously recognised the continuing need for a high priority for education expenditure.

* Both funds provided to the States to meet their obligations for educating our children and funds provided to colleges and universities to ensure increasing facilities for our young men and women, tike the allocations for social **welfare**, make allocations a few years ago seem like petty cash.

* The general practitioner has a tremendously important part to play not only in relation to the physical **welfare** but also the psychological **welfare** of the patients.

* b)  Mr Bornstein  has had considerable experience in the fields of health and social **welfare** research and policy as well as a close involvement with various projects and studies concerned with social, economic and physical dislocation.

* These have included close liaison with Australian, State and local government authorities and voluntary **welfare** organisations and community groups.

* The priorities which must be given to other Government programs affecting social **welfare**, education, and urban development, as well as the heavy demands for Post Office, services, especially in and near the metropolitan areas of the capital cities, are such that there must be a substantial redistribution of and increase in both the income and expenditure of the Post Office.

* I do not doubt his sincerity, I do not blame him for being a strong advocate in support of the **welfare** of the workers in the industry and for the general **welfare** of the town of Albany.

* The Australian Labor Party is equally committed - 
Evidently there was no doubt in the Board's mind that it was contributing to the **welfare** of the nation by development and things of that nature.

* Our first obligation is to our own people, and tariff protection affords us the opportunity to protect their **welfare**.

* The Labor Party's policy on this matter is as follows: 
What amount was spent on Aboriginal **welfare** (a) in total and (b) per capita of Aboriginal and part-Aboriginal population by (i) each State and (ii) the Commonwealth in each of the last 10 years.

* We have achieved that without reducing expenditures across the areas embraced by the Budget in the more significant fields of health, **welfare**, education, transport and industry.

* I am delighted to have the opportunity of speaking to the estimates for health and **welfare**.

* We must do this with the knowledge that our own **welfare** and security are inextricably bound up with the **welfare** and security of others.

* National Commission on Social **Welfare**  (Question No.

* In Queensland additional **welfare** housing funds are justifiable on both human and economic grounds.

* That is possibly why there is a waiting list for **welfare** housing in New South Wales of 32 000 people whereas in Victoria the figure is only 21 000.

* 1 ) Did he say on 20 July 197S that advances for the States **Welfare** Housing Program will not be less than in the previous financial year.

* Undesirable is defined as any publication that 'brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt; is harmful to the relations between any sections of the Republic; is prejudicial to the safety of the State, the general **welfare** or the peace and good order'.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* It forgets that the revenues raised by governments from direct and indirect taxes in the private sector give governments the money needed to finance education, social **welfare**, health, roads, sewerage and so on.

* It gives real increase in dollar terms in such priority areas as defence, which is up by 17.6 per cent, education, which is up by 15.3 per cent, and social security and **welfare**, which is up by 23.5 per cent.

* Members of the Opposition must have been quite shattered last Tuesday evening- I am quite sure they still have not recovered- when they realised that all their verbal garbage during recent months, particularly during the last election campaign, about cuts that the Liberals would make in pensions, education and social **welfare**-  (Quorum formed).

* I mention that the Government has already approved no less than $3 10m for **welfare** housing purposes in 1974-75 and, after carefully reviewing the situation in Queensland, we have now agreed to provide a further $8m for **welfare** housing in that State.

* There are still far too many **welfare** programs which involve transfers of tax from poor people to rich people and these are many of the areas in which the Labor Party seems to be standing up in support of well-off people.

* Transfer payments through the **welfare** system should be directed entirely to people in need and an enormous proportion of them are still not being so directed.

* These matters include such aspects as economic affairs, health, social **welfare** and whatever a member's interests may be, particularly in dealing with certain aspects of legislation.

* The Trustees of the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund; 
Omitted from this year's statement are the former tables No.

* 9, National **Welfare** Fund, and No.

* Information in respect of the National **Welfare** Fund can be  found in the table published on page 25 of the attachments to my Budget Speech and full details of the war service homes insur- ance account are provided in the report of the Director of war service homes.

* Therefore in matters which concern wages policy, social **welfare** policy, government legislation arrangements, industrial policy and general policy, members of the Ministry take decisions as part of a team without the Prime Minister's presence.

* Such a result could be achieved only by slashing into existing **welfare** programs.

* Would it cut down on education, on social **welfare**, on health and on urban and regional policies?

* In these circumstances it is reasonable for the Government to expand programs in this way, particularly programs with a strong **welfare** element which are so difficult for those conservative and affluent representatives on the Opposition side to understand.

* By contrast, the Opposition would cut back sharply on health, education, social **welfare** and urban and regional development.

* It ignores the dependence of individual **welfare** on the **welfare** of the whole community.

* This matter comes within the scope of this debate because it is the Department of Social Services which is charged with the task of looking after the National **Welfare** Fund from which these benefits come.

* They know this so well because they, together with the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the Methodist missions, and also the Church of England **welfare** associations, are the organisations to which these people must go.

* But the human **welfare** of the staff concerned and the human **welfare** of the communities affected have not been taken into account at all.

* That is the part to which I would like to draw attention -  and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres'.

* The poor need health and **welfare** services, whilst those in better circumstances do not.

* Infant **welfare** facilities, pre-school centres, sporting fields and pavilions and public halls command priorities in newly developing areas and must compete with road, drainage and bridge construction.

* The Commonwealth should be entirely responsible for the cost and provision of social services, health and social **welfare** programmes as advised by local councils and considered by a board or committee.

* In terms of **welfare**- and the Labor Party seems to use this area as its argument- I admit that we do not really have very much to say.

* But in terms of national benefit the **welfare** argument probably would be better sorted out by the provision of other funds in other ways to the primary sector.

* The **welfare** factor does arise but it is not an important one from our point of view.

* Our soil is looking for **welfare**; our farmers are not.

* In some instances a regional profile (including existing **welfare** services) is being drawn in conjunction with the development of a set of social indicators.

* Did the Minister for Social Security note during February newspaper reports from Western Australia relating to claims made before the Western Australian Royal Commission into Aboriginal Affairs by a  Mr R.  W. Crosbie,  District Officer of the Western Australian Community **Welfare** Department at Katanning, and other allegations made by  Mrs B.  Hayward of Gnowangerup?

* I would despair if the health insurance field were left to a government monopoly because I am vitally interested in social **welfare**.

* I have been publicly critical of some of the cutbacks that this Government has made in social **welfare** because I believe that from humanitarian and cost benefit points of view cutbacks in some areas are not sound common sense.

* A recent Swedish study reveals that children born after their mothers have been refused abortions were far more likely than other children to become members of broken families, inmates of public institutions and recipients of **welfare** benefits.

* Cost benefit studies which were carried out in 1972 by Political and Economic Planning for the British Family Planning Association established that averting the birth of an unwanted child saved in public health and **welfare** services alone $1,350 in the case of a child born fourth in its family, $1,510 in the case of a child born fifth in its family and $8,728 in the case of the illegitimate child.

* The Government is building up in the minds of the people of this country a **welfare** ethic.

* I believe that  President  Nixon was quite right when he told the Americans during his campaign: 'We need to build in this country a work ethic, not a **welfare** ethic' The Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  told us that he sat alongside  Mr McGovern,  the Presidential candidate, when he flew from London to Washington.

* whole campaign was built on cutting down the sinews and muscle of America's defence system and building up a **welfare** ethic so that everybody gets something for nothing.

* He instilled in their minds the need to build up what I have called and what he previously called, a work ethic - not a **welfare** ethic.

* It produces no programme for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* Pursuant to the provisions of the Services Trust Fund Act 1947-1950 I present the annual reports of the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund, The Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund for the year ended 30th June 1972, together with the reports of the Auditor-General on the books and accounts of the funds.

* Did he receive a letter from  Mr Thompson,  former Minister for Community **Welfare** in Western Australia, requesting that a subsidy be paid to families based on the number of children.

* As one who has a close association with hospitalisation, social **welfare** and handicapped people, 1 will be a very keen critic of any change in policy in this field, and again will welcome on behalf of these unfortunate people the assistance that has been promised.

* As I mentioned on Tuesday night of last week, this should be seen as part of the total development of health and **welfare** services in the community - an integrated, balanced plan for the provision of adequate health and **welfare** protection for the community.

* Greater public demand for expenditure in the **welfare** state, coupled with more demands for lower taxation- in other words, spend more but give me more- is not the way of this country.

* 1 ) and (2) In relation to each of the eleven offices opened to date in all States, various bodies and persons active in the field of **welfare** have offered assistance.

* The 36 volunteers comprise seventeen solicitors, one clergyman, three social workers, a **welfare** officer, an employment officer, three typist/secretaries, one law clerk, one law student, three members of the Citizens Advice Bureau, one interpreter, and four persons who have volunteered to give general assistance, including a member of the State Parliament.

* The honourable P. Howson, as the then Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, in a debate in Parliament on 14 September 1972 set out the number of organisations which had been set up to care for the **welfare** of the Aboriginal.

* Contraceptives are provided free by the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration to Aboriginal women where contraceptives are required on medical advice or where a woman wishes to plan her family and would otherwise be unable  to  do so for economic reasons.

* Does the Commonwealth's concern with **welfare** housing suggest that people who do this should be penalised?

* Honourable members will be aware that the Bailey task force found that the total expenditure in the health and **welfare** areas of Commonwealth government responsibility exceeded $8,800m in 1975-76, or 40 per cent of the total government outlay.

* A report submitted recently to the Government by its Health and **Welfare** Committee referred to this matter in the following terms: 
The right honourable member for Lowe  (Mr McMahon)  who preceded me in this debate said that changes had to be made in the law.

* The right honourable member for Lowe referred to children and the need for **welfare** workers.

* **Welfare** workers have their place, but there is no substitute anywhere for parents, home and the love and affection which may come from a well adjusted and well organised home.

* We have tended to cut back on the material services but we have maintained and not cut back our priorities for **welfare** services and projects concerned with physically handicapped people, hostels for young people, women's refuges and programs of this type.

* I now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will always guide your deliberations and further the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* I have been interested in that field and I have been chairman of the previous Government's social **welfare** committee for the last 3 years.

* He said: 
As pan of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* I hope that the Government will direct its **welfare** assistance to those people.

* I note that in an interview that the Prime Minister gave to Allen Barnes and which was published in the  Age  of 1 3 February, he said: 
I think that when one deals with policy questions in the field of social security one has to pay tribute to the Department of Social Security and also, to my mind, to the Social **Welfare** Commission which was set up by the previous Government.

* The present Government has now announced it will abolish the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* For example, the Government proposes to abolish the Social **Welfare** Commission and therefore  Mrs Marie  Coleman, who is the  Chairman  of that Commission, as I understand it, is left without any sort of recourse against the Government.

* The most important aspect of the Social **Welfare** Commission, which I would have thought would appeal to the present Prime Minister and the people behind him- it certainly appeals to me, although I do not share many of the Government's views, but I hold the view, and I am glad that the Government at least expresses the view- that it is important for the **welfare** dollar or whatever it might be calledthis applies not only to **welfare** but to education and health etc.- to be spent in the most efficient and the most appropriate manner.

* I think that the Social **Welfare** Commission did a lot of policy analysis work and I think that work is one of the most important aspects of the Commission.

* One is in the form of a speech by  Mrs Marie  Coleman which deals with priorities in social **welfare**; the other is a social policy reference paper which also includes all the other Social **Welfare** Commission publications, of which there are many.

* It is very attractive to be able to say that we do not want means tests, stigmas and so on attached to social **welfare** payments and that therefore we opt for universalism.

* If the Government is going to give something to everybody all over Australia, if, for example, it is going to provide child care services all over Australia, it will be terribly expensive, but if it can be argued that such things should be provided only in certain geographical areas or to certain disadvantaged families - 
Is he considering the United States Department of Health Education and **Welfare** Secretary's Advisory Committee Report on Automated Personal Records Systems as a basis for licensing data banks under Government control.

* Goods came into the country which had been manufactured by a work force getting $A 1 2 a month, with no workers' compensation and no social **welfare** benefits at all.

* Honourable members can see from that that the honey industry is very concerned about the **welfare** of this plant.

* The letter continues: 
Is a grant provided to local governing bodies under the States Grants (Home Care) Act to assist with the salaries of **welfare** officers employed by Councils, and is this grant restricted to a basis of 50 per cent of a calculated 56 per cent of time spent on work with the aged.

* If so, and as this restriction limits the activity of a **welfare** officer to a particular section of the community, (a) can a re-assessment of this grant be made to modify the requirements relating to this restriction and (b) can the suprvisiion of services provided be organised so that the need for detailed quarterly reports is removed or modified.

* If the Government believes that some forms of **welfare** ought to be reviewed- and there may be a case for such reviews- it should at least have the decency to wait for the findings of its own inquiries.

* However, the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to public expenditure and is opposed to Government intervention in the provision of **welfare** services.

* 1 ) On 19 December 1977 I announced the establishment of the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat which will be responsible for the development of plans and policies and review of existing policies and programs in the broad field of health and **welfare**.

* The social security measures outlined in the Governor-General's Speech quite correctly emphasise the urgency of **welfare** provisions.

* These measures represent the basic steps in the development of a national **welfare** policy, freed of discrimination by sex, age or economic condition - a **welfare** programme which is a real response to our national conscience and which should be a basic condition in any civilised community that has a respect for its own citizens.

* A national **welfare** policy should provide a dignified way of life for the minority groups in our community which cannot contribute to the economic processes.

* Given this national **welfare** policy, it is essential then to provide a flexibility and a mobility in our labour force which gives our people the maximum opportunity to express themselves and the maximum opportunity for the nation to benefit from their skills and intelligence.

* Instead of focusing political debate on the purpose for which we should use our resources for the community **welfare** we find people concentrating on the use of resources to satisfy short-term political pressures or concentrating on the details of management, for instance by asking where the money is coming from instead of asking whether the priorities are right.

* Also it acts as the normal community **welfare** office and provides most of the community needs of the people in the area.

* I also asked the Union whether it would favour a situation in which the needy benefited from **welfare** payments and whether **welfare** should be redirected to the needy.

* Grant made under the Commonwealth Government's program of Grants to Community **Welfare** Agencies (Special Assistance Scheme) in 1976-77 in the Federal Electorate of Banks.

* But he was given the doubtful responsibility as a Minister of giving guidance on the **welfare** of the people.

* People's rights are better protected when the people themselves are involved, particularly in policies for their own **welfare**.

* We recognise the need for social **welfare**.

* Is it a fact that the Minister for Social Security has appointed  Ms Eva  Learner to the Social **Welfare** Commission as a **Welfare** Education Consultant to provide advice on curriculum in the context of educational programs developed within institutes such as universities, colleges of advanced education and technical colleges, concerning training for social work.

* and (4) A doctor providing any medical procedure should have regard to the laws of the State or Territory in which he practises, professional ethics and the patient's interest and **welfare**.

* One could reasonably expect in these circumstances some transfer of social **welfare** costs back to the public as a direct responsibility, as this Government is now doing.

* Also a reduction in **welfare** provisions will throw an added cost burden back onto the average wage earner.

* It appears to me by the way in which Government supporters have sought to absent themselves from the chamber today in this debate in such obvious, organised large numbers that they either do not understand the serious and disturbing implications of reduced export income on the Australian economy and the very worrying effects it will have on business and the **welfare** of people or- I believe this is the more likely explanation- they find themselves totally ill-equipped to present a defence to the way in which they are handling the economy in the light of this development, reinforcing the general decline in the level of economic activity in Australia.

* Sure, this year our **welfare** programme concentrates on consolidating past gains and getting the new health scheme under way.

* Nowhere in the debate has mention been made of the **welfare** organisations that come into the area of eligibility.

* The organisations designated as accredited **welfare** organisations are the Young Men's Christian Association, the Young Women's Christian Association, the Salvation Army, the Australian Comforts Fund, the Australian Red Cross Society, the Campaigners for Christ and the Australian Forces Overseas Fund.

* Surely there is nothing wrong in a government's thinking ahead for its own revenues on which social development and **welfare** payments may well depend.

* I have no doubt that, if the position were to be reversed and the Opposition were to be in government again, it would be equally as austere in what it did in any area of **welfare** services as it was austere in those areas as a government up to 1972.

* They are consistent with the very generous approach which we have adopted to social **welfare**.

* Unless the wealth-producing industries are capable of surviving profitably, the essential social **welfare** policies that have been announced by this Government - the grand dream of the Labor Party for this grand society - will go by the board because the finances to support the objective will not be available.

* and (2) In addition to the direct service which my Department provides for the migrant community through its own social workers and in other ways, funds are provided also under  a  grant scheme for the employment of social workers by community **welfare** agencies which are engaged in direct **welfare** amongst migrants.

* I call upon those persons who are running this Croatian Embassy to realise that they have now gone as far as they can go with their public display, that the game is over and that they should peaceably and sensibly close their Embassy and continue to go about their business of assisting, if they wish, the Australian Croatian community by the ordinary activities and ordinary means by which they look after the **welfare** and the problems of their members in Australia.

* Finally, I make it perfectly plain once again that the Croatian community in Australia is amongst the finest of the communities that have contributed to our national **welfare**.

* But we call upon the specific persons running this Embassy to take heed of Australia's obligations, to close its activities and to allow members of the Croatian community in this country to continue to develop and contribute to the **welfare** of Australia as a whole.

* Under the Social **Welfare** Ordinance 1964- 1969, section 10, the Director of Social **Welfare** may provide to persons who in his opinion are socially or economically in need of assistance such legal assistance as in the Director's opinion may be necessary or appropriate.

* provides for a **Welfare** Fund Payment to the ITF which is used by the ITF to support **welfare** facilities for seafarers throughout the world and which replaces the contributions made by National Flag carriers either by donation or taxation to maintain such centres.

* On 1 October I announced jointly with the Minister for Community **Welfare** of Western Aus tralia, the honourable Ronald Thompson, a major social **welfare** co-ordinating project in the south-west and southern agricultural region of Western Australia, as part of the development stage of the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Funds will be provided for the establishment and operation of a Regional Council for Social Development, which will also be able to recommend financial assistance for a wide range of **welfare** activities, as listed in the schedule in chapter four of Discussion Paper No.

* This project involves close co-operation between the Western Australian Department for Community **Welfare**, the Social **Welfare** Commission and my Department.

* Pursuant to section 16 of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973 I present a Social **Welfare** Commission report on the Australian Assistance Plan, together with a statement by the Minister for Social Security relating to that report.

* It has been allotted to the Army and the Air Force for use in their **welfare** and amenities programs.

* These programs are administered through funds such as the Army Central Amenities Fund and the RAAF **Welfare** Trust Fund.

* **Welfare** pensioners and the unemployed are denied indexation of their payments, but people at the Prime Minister's salary level and companies in the super-profit category get the benefit.

* Here, the Government might think of increasing capital funds available for **welfare** housing, freeing up savings bank funds even more for private home building, and look at ways of increasing investment in public facilities such as sewerage services, bridges, highways and hospitals.

* The great paradox of socialist governments is that, from the time they assume power, they undermine the foundations of the private enterprise sector and deprive themselves of their capacity to implement their expensive social **welfare** policies.

* I am worried that the Government, in taking this action, may be giving us a further indication of its lack of interest in the **welfare** of people who live outside the cities.

* Statements by Ministers indicate that they are falling over each other in order to make plain their disregard for the **welfare** of country people and their anxiety to put country people in their places and do great things for all the Labor voters in the cities.

* Admittedly the increased oil royalties received by the Government following the crude oil price increases by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, known as OPEC, greatly assisted the Government in not only reducing the deficit, but also enabled the Government to continue its social **welfare** policies of assisting those most in need.

* People working in the social **welfare** and health areas, voluntary and services organisations, government departments, politicians, parliamentary and tertiary libraries, churches, hospitals and individuals who have a special interest in social **welfare**.

* In fact, we are seeing a pronounced deterioration in the relative strength of the United States and its allies visavis the Soviet Union and its allies, a pronounced deterioration in the capacity of the Western alliance to present a united face, and a deterioration in the capacity of the Third World to feel that in the West it has a group of states which are reliable, can be depended upon to make decisions and have the courage to carry them out for the **welfare** of mankind.

* -This is a very sad measure because the Government has decreased in a significant way the amount of funds which it will provide for **welfare** housing.

* Let it be quite clear: The amount of real assistance to housing and to the area of **welfare** housing, which is only part of the market, has been decreased by an effective  20  per cent.

* While there may be argumentation by the Government that it has in fact kept up the level of assistance in **welfare** housing to States, the States obviously do not feel free enough to be able to keep up the level of approvals at which houses will be commenced and at which houses will be completed as in the previous year.

* So there has been a real and a calculated drop in **welfare** housing.

* That scheme, put up by a party bent on **welfare**, was designed to assist those who built the most expensive houses, who saved the least and who negotiated the highest interest rates on money.

* It is nonsense for any government to talk about **welfare** and say that it is a **welfare** government when these 2 very basic social obligations have been forgotten.

* 1 ) The Australian Capital Territory Consultative Committee on Social **Welfare** (ACTCCSW) and the Northern Territory Consultative Committee on Social **Welfare** (NTCCSW) each have a member of the respective Legislative Assemblies on their committee.

* We are moving now to things such as community health centre committees and the various community **welfare** organisations which have an interest in a particular kind of disability and an interest in setting up a service for persons with particular diseases and handicaps.

* Was Nola Brown a child in respect of whom an order had been made under section 36 (1) (b) of the Child **Welfare** Ordinance committing her to the care of (a) the Director of **Welfare** or (b) foster parents.

* There has been talk about **welfare**, of people on low incomes, and of pensioners.

* We can justify our actions in the **welfare** area even though we have had to try to constrain public expenditure where possible, and we have been able to strike a healthy balance between meeting the needs of the people and, at the same time, trying to stabilise the economy after the chaotic period when Labor was in office from 1972 to 1975.

* It is an indication of the attitude that has been adopted generally by this Government in regard to migrant **welfare**.

* from the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare**.

* We would be concerned with social **welfare**, health and education programs, and we are determined that there would be no better systems of social **welfare**, health and education in any other country.

* Therefore the Government that he supports has provided less money this year for **welfare** housing that it provided last year.

* Apart from the fact that this Bill does not make sufficient funds available for **welfare** housing in any of the States, it does not make funds available that are comparable with those of last year.

* He reduces by $22.5m this year the amount of money that should be made available for **welfare** housing.

* I have already mentioned that in Victoria, government approvals for **welfare** housing declined by 22.9 per cent.

* He can also tell us why there has been a real reduction of $22.5m in the amount of money made available to Victoria this year for **welfare** housing.

* Has the Social **Welfare** Commission taken any part in ensuring that any organisations interested in matters of community **welfare** are invited and involved.

* The proposition that I put before Parliament gives every member an opportunity to consider his own **welfare** and that of everybody about him.

* I believe that the logical thing for our own personal **welfare** is to knock off at the reasonable hour.

* But the sensible, commonsense and humane attitude is to consider the **welfare** of the people who make our work possible - the broadcasting monitors, the dining room staff, the attendants, the car pool drivers, the Library and Hansard officers who are the innocent victims - and knock off at a reasonable hour.

* The scheme covered in this Bill is additional to the measures already taken by the Government to increase substantially the volume of finance provided by the savings banks for housing and the action to increase the funds for **welfare** housing purposes.

* I am certain that all members of the Parliament sympathise with and support the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  about the need to look after and protect the **welfare** of our aged people.

* I have gained the impression from complaints that I have received from people living right under the flight path that if instructions have been given to pilots to safeguard the **welfare** of people by flying around residential areas the pilots have ignored the instructions or not carried them out.

* In view of the combined impact of personal income tax indexation, increased pension and other **welfare** benefits, and in particular the effect of the family allowances scheme.

* While the rate of increase in government expenditure has been cut, government expenditure on social security and **welfare** has increased by 23 per cent.

* In answer to a question earlier this week, the Minister stated that Government support for the reserve price scheme for wool was a **welfare** payment to wool growers.

* Will the Minister say which other **welfare** schemes of the Government require repayment of the funds provided and have an interest rate of at least 1 1 per cent?

* It is important that these mills do continue in existence and do remain viable operations because the whole **welfare** and, indeed, the economy of quite a section of that part of the State depends upon the continuing operations of the New South Wales sugar industry.

* Did the Queensland Supreme Court on S October 1976 decide that  Mr Killoran  as trustee of an Aboriginal reserve must account for all moneys in respect of mining on that reserve, keep properly audited books and devote the proceeds to the reserve, not to the Aboriginal **Welfare** Fund.

* I doubt the honourable member's real interest in the **welfare** of these children, whether they were black or white.

* It was made because the honourable member for Prospect puts the support of some Australian Labor Party candidate ahead of a common and decent approach to Aboriginal **welfare** as practised by the manager of Napperby station.

* If I had time I should like to deal with the general **welfare** philosophy and the achievements of this Government, the sorts of things we still have to do and so forth, but I shall concentrate on two or three specific things.

* As the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  said in his second reading speech, the allowance should be seen in the context of our broad program of education, training and general **welfare** for handicapped children being developed by the Government.

* Although the increases in social **welfare** payments will be welcomed, a 50c increase to pensioners will not arouse any degree of enthusiasm.

* It was the prime motivation for expediting the program for self-government and independence rather than any thoughts of the **welfare** of Papua New Guinea.

* Only yesterday I was discussing this proposed measure with a local association of school **welfare** clubs of various primary schools in my electorate and the neighbouring electorate of Barker.

* But in response to a letter I arranged to meet the school **welfare** clubs for a discussion and an exchange of views on the question of children's television, particularly in regard to the advertising that takes place.

* I told the women representing the **welfare** clubs not to underestimate the power of commercial television operators to put pressure on certain people to prevent teeth being put into this legislation.

* The honourable gentleman has displayed a consistent concern about the **welfare** of those people since he has been a member of this House.

* Payments to the States for **welfare** housing are up by 10.4 per cent.

* In the last Budget of the previous Government there were massive cuts in **welfare** housing.

* There has been an increased commitment to the States for **welfare** housing.

* Is the Minister aware that the Regular Defence Forces **Welfare** Association is establishing a fighting fund to brief senior counsel and obtain a legal opinion on the recovery of the surplus for the benefit of the people to whom it rightfully belongs - pre- 1 959 contributors, retirees and widows as at 30 June 1969?

* 1 simply point out once more, as I have pointed out in this House for about 10 years, that the logic of the taxation system of deductions runs counter to the logic of social **welfare**.

* How anybody can justify this sort of thing in a system of social **welfare** is, to my mind, the height of absurdity, yet the same sort of thing is repeated in some of the other deductions that are currently allowed.

* 1 maintain that the greatest barrier to the development of an adequate social **welfare** system in this country is the loss of revenue that is built into the income tax structure by reason of this higgledy-piggledy array of deductions that have been built up applied originally in the main to dependants but only one-third of which now cover dependants while the rest are a ragbag of assortments.

* Available revenue would be increased which could well lead to the establishment of a better pattern of social **welfare** that would be according to need and not according to income.

* It is true that the reduced immigration programme for this year will provide an opportunity, as I said in my statement on the size of the programme, to extend and develop our **welfare** and education activities amongst migrants.

* I do not think that the description of the superphosphate bounty as a **welfare** provision is a new one.

* In my opinion, it has been a **welfare** provision for a long time for quite a number of people who did not need it, especially the wealthy farmers who got most of it.

* It was very largely as a result of this **welfare** provision by which previous governments were willing to make the assistance available to primary industry that we decided to bring an end to the existing arrangement and refer the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission, albeit on a narrow basis.

* What would be the position if we adopted a user pays principle in respect of many other fields in which the Commonwealth has a responsibility such as railways, education, water supply, social **welfare** and health?

* Without the ability to make a worthwhile contribution to general **welfare**, which is so important in the world today, we soon could find ourselves becoming a second rate nation.

* I can inform the honourable gentleman that the Government has decided not to proceed with the taxation of the **welfare** payments enumerated on page 22 of the Budget Speech.

* For Preston our 5 000 ratepayer pensioners would be contributing to a social **welfare** payment to the unemployed.

* The development of advanced technology is essential for the **welfare** of Australia and for the development of our economy.

* I commend the approach of my colleagues, who have taken a very proper and legitimate point- a point that I commend to all honourable members in this place- that it ill-behoves this nation at this time to create a separate category for the unemployed in terms of social **welfare** payments because, as has been pointed out, of all the groups in this community the unemployed are in many cases, through no fault of then- own, in quite desperate economic circumstances.

* If we are serious in saying that they must be assisted to find work it is perfectly proper for unemployment benefit payments to be indexed in the same way as every other social **welfare** payment has been indexed.

* It is to apply to Aboriginal organisations, nonprofit **welfare** organisations.

* It is taxing **welfare** organisations that have miserable income far less than is needed for Aboriginal **welfare** in the Northern Territory.

* Under the Child **Welfare** Ordinance 1961-1968 of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea an allowance not exceeding Seven dollars per week may be granted by tha Director of Child **Welfare** where one or both of the parents of a child under the age of sixteen years is imprisoned.

* **Welfare** officers regularly visit all major corrective institutions in the Territory and detainees are encouraged to discuss with them domestic matters including fears they may have for the well-being of their families.

* The second part of the motion moved this morning deals with social **welfare** implications and housing.

* I think it demonstrates that the proposer of the motion misunderstands the question when he brings forward social **welfare** aspects of a capital market inquiry.

* As I see it, social **welfare** aspects and housing are political questions which must be determined by the political parties and by the Government of the day.

* I am bound to say that I deprecate the possibility that there will be stoppages of this magnitude - with their obvious harm to Australian industry, commerce and the general **welfare** of the people - while claims are before the national conference, which has the support of all parties including the Waterside Workers Federation and the employers.

* I ) What progress has been made by the working party on social **welfare** manpower, established by the Social **Welfare** Commission under section 17 of its Act.

* Maybe the featherbedding will be at the expense of a lot of other general **welfare** in the community.

* -My grievance is that the Fraser Government unilaterally is trying to force the State governments of Australia to agree to the changing of the existing CommonwealthState Housing Agreement in a way that will create hardship for many existing tenants of **welfare** housing and will create inequity between the needy poor and other less affluent people in our country.

* The Fraser Government is intent upon forcing the States to pay the long term bond interest rate of 10.5 per cent per annum on loans for **welfare** housing.

* As a consequence, the tenants of **welfare** housing will pay rents at the current market level.

* The Government has been concerned in this area as in other important areas of potential redistribution, such as education, health and **welfare**, on the one hand to reduce the total volume of funds available and on the other to seek to ensure that the money that is spent is spent basically on behalf of its natural constituency, that is, on behalf of the better off, the more affluent or, if you like, the middle class.

* To me there appears to be no reason why small classes could not be conducted in the home, local church hall or even infant **welfare** centre.

* Such a class was established last year in Doveton in my electorate at the local infant **welfare** centre where women could attend and leave their babies under the care of the infant **welfare** teacher.

* This proposal was examined by the Social **Welfare** Commission and was later considered by the Annual Conference of Australasian Administrators of Social **Welfare** held in Wellington, New Zealand in February.

* A Conference of Australasian Ministers for Social **Welfare**, in endorsing that conclusion, considered there was a need for a conference of the Australian State adoption officers and interested Australian Government Departments to discuss, inter alia, such an agency.

* This coutry has been witness to, some of the most severe and, in many cases, quite unjustified expenditure cuts on very worthwhile community programs, in such areas as health, **welfare**, education and urban improvement.

* One of its first and highest priorities when it came into government in the **welfare** field was to reintroduce the $30m superphosphate bounty.

* At the same time, a whole range of important community **welfare** programs-health services, health benefits- were cut back and made more expensive because they were given a lower priority in the eyes of the Prime Minister.

* The Government's policy is one of carefully regulated and controlled development having full regard to the protection of the environment and the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* The development of those resources, while serving the objectives just mentioned, must also be regulated and controlled so as to ensure full protection of the environment and the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people, and yield the economic benefits to Australia and its people that were described in the report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry.

* Honourable members will be aware of the Government's determination to bring about a greater coordination of health and **welfare** programs.

* This determination was illustrated by the recent appointment of the Social **Welfare** Policy Committee of Ministers and its supporting Permanent Heads Committee.

* These Committees have been established to ensure the integrated development of plans and policies and to review existing policies and programs in the health and **welfare** field.

* The social **welfare** policy secretariat will be physically located in the Department of Social Security.

* It will have responsibilities ranging over the whole field of health and **welfare** and will in fact absorb some of the ongoing activities of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission.

* Let me summarise by saying that  Dr Sidney  Sax and his secretariat will cover the whole range of social **welfare** and health programs, with a far-ranging brief that will support the planning and programming activities of many departments, but primarily, of course, those of the Department of Social Security and those of my own Department.

* The Bill before the House provides for the repeal of the 
For example, the honourable member for Moore talked about the need for the Government to concentrate its **welfare** spending in relation to the very poor.

* They are critical areas in terms of **welfare** priorities.

* The electors recognised the neglect in every part of the public sector and in every area of social **welfare**.

* I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to endorse the expenditure of $235m through the States on **welfare** housing.

* I am pleased to see that additional advances could be made available, given the increased resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds for **welfare** housing to productive use.

* This program recognises the need for education, health and **welfare** components in child care.

* The implementation of this program will place Australia amongst those countries most genuinely concerned with the **welfare** of the young.

* The director of the Link-Up **welfare** group in Melbourne,  Mr John  Dickinson, said recently that his group's telephone service for desperate people was averaging a suicide call every 30 hours.

* Mr Dickinson,  of Link-Up, who talks regularly to these sorts of people, was quoted recently as having said: 
Health and **Welfare** Committee this year by the director of the New South Wales Health Commission's central drug and alcohol advisory service, in which he stated that substantial groups of heroin addicts had been detected recently in three parts of Sydney- areas with high youth unemployment levels.

* In other words, last week I indicated that the Government made representations to the Ugandan authorities about the Archbishop's safety and **welfare**, shortly after his arrest.

* Why did not honourable members opposite introduce those sorts of provisions if, in fact, they are really interested in the **welfare** of the rank and file trade unionists of Australia?

* The Opposition is not really interested in the **welfare** of the rank and file trade unionists of Australia.

* It is certainly not true where the contestants are powerful industrial organisations whose activities can affect, for good or ill, the **welfare** of all Australians.

* One of the most significant amendments being made by this Bill is the amendment to section 62 of the Act, which deals with conferences and reports by counsellors and **welfare** officers.

* This provision will be amended so that a conference can be ordered with counsellors or the court can order a report on the **welfare** of children to the marriage.

* The court can make these orders whenever the **welfare** of the children to the marriage is affected.

* **Welfare** bludgergets $700 a week.

* But let me concentrate for a moment on what I consider to be our most serious immediate economic problem - a problem reaching disastrous proportions - intiation, increasing costs and prices undermining the social **welfare** of ordinary Australians, families, young and old; inflation with its crippling costs bearing down on industry and services; inflation undermining the morals of the people and leading to inevitable restlessness and industrial troubles.

* We realise that money is also spent in the field of repatriation and that the total amount of expenditure in the category of **welfare** is in the vicinity of $l,800m.

* They mean reduced services to the public in health, social **welfare** and education, and reduced employment opportunities both in the private and public sector at a time when hundreds of thousands are out of work.

* Then, with a slightly more relaxed Budget in 1980- relaxed in terms of **welfare** provisionsthe Liberal Government will go to the polls at the end of that year hoping that the false start in the economic recovery and a little more money in the pockets of the poor, before the added availability of funds induces a rise in inflation, may fool many people in the community to vote again for the Liberals.

* The **welfare** of the patient is the primary objective that the Government always has in mind.

* Secondly, **welfare** relief offered for a week's subsistence, which amounts to probably ten times more than the average monthly income of people in 
He was talking about the crisis in the building industry and about pumping money into State housing authorities for **welfare** housing.

* He said that the Government is maintaining **welfare** housing as its top priority.

* The postscript is not quite so healthy because the Master Builders Association of New South Wales, in the article to which I referred, said that there is a shortfall of $ 18m in loan funds for **welfare** housing by the New South Wales Housing Commission and this has meant that the programmed additional 6000 houses will be reduced to 5000, and that is not quite the same way as the Minister put it.

* I also welcome those aspects of the Governor-General's Speech relating to immigrants as being essential to any successful and humane immigration program and I also urge the Government to give serious consideration to the suggestions in the Henderson report directed at eradicating some of the deficiencies and prejudices which our social **welfare** system presently contains regarding migrants.

* Because I live in and represent an electorate in which there is a great deal of poverty and personal hardship, particularly in the inner suburbs of Penh, I intend to devote much of my time in this House to **welfare** matters.

* In making what I hope will be constructive suggestions for **welfare** management in this country, I must express my concern at the way in which honourable members opposite keep insisting that we are a businessman's government.

* That is why I see a mutual compatibility of interests between my support for a government which espouses the cause of free enterprise and my personal desire to become involved in both economic and **welfare** management matters.

* I simply suggest that existing **welfare** payments be disbursed in a way which will not add to total expenditure but which, if done on a more selective basis, will ensure that more assistance will go to those whose needs are greatest.

* I hope that in the future, when circumstances permit, it will be possible to restrain total expenditure and still preserve the rights and privileges of the disadvantaged people in Australia by ensuring that the whole spectrum of **welfare** payments is applied more selectively and less universally.

* The application of universal **welfare** payments in place of selective benefits is an inhumane strategy in a country in which resources are limited and in which poverty still very obviously exists.

* In certain circumstances there is much to commend the universal provision of such **welfare** benefits; it is in accord, in my opinion, with the best interests of a democratic society.

* If the ability to pay is used as the basis of collecting revenue then the logical corollary is to support a criterion of need as the basis for **welfare** disbursement from that revenue within our present social **welfare** system.

* After all, progressive taxation has a much greater redistribution effect than either regressive levies or proportionate contributions in the funding of **welfare** schemes.

* The Victorian Government this year will receive the same total amount of funds for **welfare** housing as it received last year.

* I contrast that with the $36.5m which was handed over to it in 1 97 1 -72- the last full year of the Lib- - eral Country -Party Government -Y-et-the-.fact_ that  Mr Dickie  has received for **welfare** housing in Victoria an increase of $6 1.6m in comparison with 1971-72 apparently eludes him.

* Perhaps the most substantial of these amendments concern the **welfare** and custody of children.

* The Bill will extend the range of circumstances in which a court can order the parties to confer with a counsellor, or can order a counsellor to report to it, on the **welfare** of children of the marriage.

* These powers will become available to the court in any proceedings in which the **welfare** of children of a marriage is affected.

* There will be a 57 per cent increase in the coming year for subsidies for **welfare** officers.

* I point out to the honourable gentleman that, as I recall it, the Council on the Aging was not too happy when the Labor Government froze the funds available for subsidies to **welfare** officers.

* The report on the survey conducted recently by the Department of Social Security- I refer to the booklet entitled 'A Place of Dignity' which is the report on a survey of homeless people and homeless persons assistance centres- opened with the comment that an estimated 10,000 homeless men and women in Australia were being assisted by **welfare** agencies.

* I think that this is something that the capital city councils cold have a good look at, not necessarily with a view to administering the programs but with a view to encouraging local charitable organisations under their jurisdiction to involve themselves in this area of **welfare**.

* As to social contact there was a high usage of church or **welfare** shelters and a virtual absence of family ties.

* Also, the community, through its elected representatives, should accept that governments must pursue **welfare** policies directed towards areas of real need, such as homeless persons.

* It seems ridiculous to me that governments should succumb to the political temptation to adopt concepts of universal **welfare** benefits for egalitarian reasons rather than to use selectivity as the proper basis for **welfare** expenditure.

* This 'needs' approach to **welfare** is supported by the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty in Australia, and the Government has indicated its support of this concept.

* What is needed, of course, is the courage of government to implement this concept in all of its **welfare** programs.

* This Government is committed by its own platform to administering **welfare** programs in a decentralised, dignified, unobtrusive and sympathetic manner rather than through impersonal bureaucratic agencies.

* The Government must ensure that they are not forced to leave this area of **welfare**.

* If the purpose of these centres also is to provide some scope for rehabilitation rather than just mounting a salvaging operation, additional suitably trained staff, quite apart from **welfare** officers, may be required.

* For these reasons I was surprised when the subsidy arrangements were changed with respect to home care services and the salaries of approved **welfare** officers.

* Subsequently, when the full story came out, we realised on a closer inspection of both these areas that it is clear that the financial commitment of this Government will increase substantially- by 14 per cent with regard to home care services and by 57 per cent with regard to subsidies for **welfare** officers.

* I also point out to those honourable members who seem to think that the Government should stay in every area of **welfare** for all time that the very title of this Bill is the States Grants (Home Care) Amendment Bill 1978.

* This Parliament is not the Santa Claus as far as the **welfare** and health systems of Australia are concerned.

* So there is a very close relationship between taxation on the one hand and **welfare** on the other hand.

* In the last few years the Government has been put into a straight jacket situation due to the **welfare** schemes put forward by the Labor Government at a time when the expectations of the people to receive more were very readily grasped.

* The Committee comprises five members- The Assistant Director of **Welfare** Branch, a representative of Women's Electoral Lobby, National Council of Women and A.C.T.

* What is the nature of the assistance available to local authorities, through his Department, for the provision of **welfare** services  or  buildings.

* Private companies are to be given assistance and beef producers are to be given increased eligibility for **welfare** payments.

* Furthermore, I believe the Minister should adopt the policy of the Labor Party and make **welfare** benefits available to all Australians and eliminate the system whereby a person more than a century old is ineligible for **welfare** benefits which, putting it mildly, hardly assists our drive for migrants.

* Finally, so far as the Department of Immigration is concerned, I believe that its officers should be congratulated if this migrant is the type of citizen selected - healthy, ageless and so confident that he will live long enough to share in the **welfare** state of liberalism.

* It is most frustrating, indeed quite horrifying, to a new member to come here full of the wonderful spirit of being able to make some contribution to this national Parliament and to the **welfare** of the people but to see the appalling tactics adopted time and time again by the Government to prevent members from making some contribution, however small it may be.

* As evidence of its all-pervasive cruelty, the Government has imposed on these people new and regressive taxes, crippling new charges on lump sum leave payments, the abolition of the maternity allowance, the destruction of the concept of universal health and massive reductions in **welfare** housing.

* This is a very mean measure which will have serious consequences for some of the most disadvantaged recipients of social **welfare** payments in Australia.

* Neglect of man's physical **welfare** could be disastrous for his future.

* To sum up, the economic **welfare** on which social and cultural **welfare** depend will be advanced or retarded according to how we utilise our resources.

* Productivity is largely dependent on individual attitudes, and our national **welfare** and success in the broadest possible terms depend on the continued development of a positive approach to the manifold problems of using our limited resources in the most efficient way possible.

* I consider this Bill to be another step forward in the Government's 15 point program for the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* It is with great regret that I look back on the years that this scheme has been operating and that an overall plan for the **welfare** of handicapped people was not one of the prime objectives of this Parliament when it first sat.

* As it is, our **welfare** program for all kinds of handicapped people has been like Topsy; it has just grown.

* I believe that it represents an isolated element of benevolence on the part of the Government in the area of social **welfare**- a government which in other respects is mounting an assault on social **welfare**.

* a ban) which has had a substantial adverse effect on the **welfare** of part of the community.

* They are of the mistaken view that their own **welfare** would be best served under a 95 per cent content plan.

* It is unrealistic to expect that decentralisation of functions such as education, social **welfare**, urban planning, resource development and law enforcement can be achieved without a regionalisation of local and semi-government authorities and a rationalisation of finances.

* Nearly 1 million Australians remain impoverished because our social **welfare** services are still fragmented, archaic and inadequate.

* We are all concerned for the **welfare** of the pensioners and to ensure that they get health services that perhaps they may not be able to pay for.

* I suggest to the Opposition that ensuring the **welfare** of the needy is a worthwhile and a just objective.

* This is a matter that concerns the **welfare** of the Australian people and is fundamental to our growth and employment prospects.

* The Government's claim that the increased expenditure on social security will improve social security benefits and **welfare** services is simply untrue.

* The Budget contains no funds for the social policy planning units established in the States to develop social **welfare** initiatives.

* This Government would have us believe that the sole test of our prosperity, the sole measure of our personal **welfare** and security, and the sole limit of our individual aspirations, is in having money in our pockets.

* Those governments ensure, not only that private enterprise prospers, but that individuals and families have a minimum standard of living and social **welfare** and that the private sector accepts its share of the cost of providing it.

* The Department of Social **Welfare** there is the one which seems to be given the most attention.

* This Bill continues the Government's curious notion of **welfare** reform.

* This Bill represents miserable **welfare** policy.

* It displays social **welfare** thinking at its most primitive and least caring.

* All of this 'grand design of social **welfare** reform'- that is placed in inverted commas to indicate the clear sarcasm- comes from the same man, Fraser, the man who promised tax cuts at an election eight months ago and this week introduced substantial tax increases in their place.

* This Bill turns the clock back- a long way back- on social **welfare** reform in Australia.

* Everything that it has done in the **welfare** field, including the effects of the taxation adjustments, erodes the position of the family, and especially the position of the middle and the modest income families.

* I have to observe that on the basis of the evidence available, the Fraser social **welfare** policy is a policy of a mean tightwad.

* If one looks over the range of items necessary for the **welfare** of blind people in the community one finds that they carry a certain amount of sales tax.

* 1 would like to comment on the **welfare** officer position.

* No **welfare** officer has been appointed under this legislation for the Darling Downs and there are none at present in Tasmania.

* We hope that the Minister can make the necessary arrangements to overcome this situation and to allow the number of **welfare** officers to be increased.

* We therefore request the Minister to have consultations with the colleges of advanced education to make sure that there are plenty of **welfare** officers available not only for attachment to senior citizens clubs but also to move out into the general public.

* The misleading statements on Aboriginal **welfare** by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

* Mi HAYDEN (Oxley-Leader of the Opposition) (2.15)- The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  is an agreeable man- so agreeable, in fact, that he is able to agree at the same time to two conflicting policies on Aboriginal **welfare**.

* On the one hand, publicly, he pretends to support Aboriginal **welfare** programs which are of the same nature as those which the Aboriginal movement presents and on the other, privately, he enters into sleazy, secret deals with the Queensland Government, allowing the Government of that State to maintain raciallybased policies on Aboriginal **welfare**.

* For instance, the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations has reported scathingly about the racist attitudes permeating the Queensland Government's Aboriginal **welfare** policy.

* It said in an official report: 
It went on to point out that the whole administration of Aboriginal **welfare** in Queensland by that State Government is infected with these racist overtones.

* These thoroughly unacceptable and outmoded racist principles have been enshrined in the legislation and policies on Aboriginal **welfare** of the Queensland Government.

* The penalty it is going to pay arises because it is not prepared to stick to the elaborate fiction that the Minister likes to broadcast that we have a government concerned about Aboriginal rights and **welfare**.

* In a letter sent to  Senator Keeffe  the Minister said: 
Despite the fact that people are now back at work, rural incomes have trebled, profits are going through the roof, our trade surpluses are embarrassingly high and look like going higher, tariffs have been reduced, the dollar is sound and more realistically valued, we are out of Vietnam, conscription has been abolished and our relations with Asia and Africa have now been brought out of the colonial era, social **welfare** is now taking its rightful place in our order of priorities, the 2 Jeremiahs of  Her  Majesty's Opposition daily pronounce imminent disaster and chaos.

* Two further areas where the Government has taken new initiatives are in the road safety and social **welfare** fields.

* An amount of $20,000 has been provided for reflectorised markings on the Pacific Highway and for special turning lanes at the Tuggerah turn-off, and $5,000 has been provided for the Central Coast Social **Welfare** Co-ordinating Council.

* Social **welfare** payments will account for $ 1,820m.

* Today we see the social **welfare** provision amounting to almost that total.

* Consideration should be given also to various other aspects of our social **welfare** programme.

* The tapered means test, supplementary assistance, homes for the aged, sheltered workshops and Meals on Wheels have resulted in increased expenditure on social **welfare**.

* As the  Economist  records, f stg500m has been cut off the social **welfare** budget.

* This brought about a marked decrease in social **welfare** expenditure.

* We have not made cuts in the social **welfare** area.

* Money incomes rise to preserve purchasing power and the Government can adjust social **welfare** payments to protect lower income earners, pensioners and so on.

* We note also that there have been backdowns in other significant areas, particularly with regard to the taxation of some social **welfare** payments to handicapped persons.

* I also want to comment on the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports with regard to the National **Welfare** Fund balance.

* In 1952 an amendment to the National **Welfare** Fund Act provided a standing appropriation for the automatic replenishment of the NWF from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in respect of all moneys paid from the NWF.

* Given the standing appropriation provisions for automatic replenishment of all amounts paid from the National **Welfare** Fund for social security, the balance of the Fund, of course, has been continually replenished.

* In these circumstances there is no need for any working balance in the National **Welfare** Fund and in fact the balance serves no useful purpose.

* It is division 873 and refers to assistance for **welfare** housing under the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* When one looks at that advance and at the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  it is quite clear that the Budget Speech indicated that the advances to the States for **welfare** housing were to be kept at the same level as they were in the previous year.

* Bearing in mind both of those facts, the Advance to the Treasurer and the Budget Speech which reflected the advance for **welfare** housing, an error has been made.

* What has happened clearly is that for this year the $ 10.4m has been taken off the advances to the States for **welfare** housing.

* In campaigning in that election, he said that the Queensland Government was assured of a blank cheque for **welfare** housing for all those contracts that it could let.

* 8m from the amounts available to the States in respect of **welfare** housing.

* States in terms of the **welfare** housing commitment of this Government What has happened is that well over 2500 fewer homes will be able to be built as a result of the subtraction of money.

* I believe that there has been a double subtraction of that amount from the amount due to the States in toto for **welfare** housing.

* There has been no significant upturn in housing activity which would compensate for what is to be done in the public **welfare** housing field.

* The circumstances which require that there be no reduction even of the money amounts for **welfare** housing, I believe, are rather overwhelming.

* The  Deputy  Prime Minister will find, if the bookkeeping is analysed, that an error has been made which can have quite grievous consequences for those people on low incomes who require **welfare** homes, housing commission homes, and home builders' account advances.

* In fact, expenditure in the Budget on social **welfare** and repatriation is the largest single item of Commonwealth expenditure.

* As a matter of fact it is the largest amount provided for social **welfare** in the history of the Commonwealth.

* The provision of social services, repatriation benefits, health services, housing and other **welfare** activities will require an expenditure of $2,095m.

* This is almost $268m more than last year and $78m of this increased amount represents current improvements in social **welfare**.

* One of the factors which has affected the American experience has been the collapse of the capacity of the city to carry its **welfare** programs, which was the historical means by which **welfare** was financed in that country.

* In Australia a not dissimilar situation has occurred in recent years with regard to State **welfare** programs being substantially taken over by Federal funding, in some instances- I would think significant instances- without a greater expenditure of actual funds on **welfare** services.

* Hunt, Minister for the Interior; the Honourable J. L. Waddy, Minister for Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare**, New South Wales; the Honourable E. R. Meagher.

* King, Minister for Social **Welfare** and Aboriginal Affairs, South Australia; the Honourable W. F. Willesee, Minister for Community **Welfare**, Western Australia; and the  Hon  ourabls D. F. Clark, Minister for Housing, Industrial Development and Sea Fisheries, Tasmania.

* The Assistant Secretary, **Welfare** Services Branch, **Welfare** Division has been nominated as the Department's Ethnic Liaison Officer.

* The amount to be spent this year on Aboriginal **welfare** is up 70 per cent to $53m.

* Mr BOURCHIER (Bendigo) &lt;8.&gt;10)- In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Health, the Repatriation Department and the Department of Social Security I would like to mention firstly the community **welfare** centres that were introduced this year.

* I understand that the Department of Health has received some 500 applications for these **welfare** centres and that now, unless there has been some alteration, something like 120 applications have been approved.

* I believe that 100 per cent of the funding of these **welfare** centres is to be provided by the Government in the first year.

* I support the Homeless Persons Assistance Amendment Bill because it secures the future of the homeless persons **welfare** program.

* Until now there has not been any guarantee that this program would be an on-going one, which has meant that neither the Government nor the organisations delivering this **welfare** have been able to undertake long term planning of programs designed to assist homeless men and women.

* Some valuable government assistance also has been provided through capital grants, food and accommodation subsidies, rental subsidies and subsidies for the salaries of social **welfare** workers, but until now the Act has required statutory extensions following periods of evaluation and review.

* By removing from the enabling legislation reference to a prescribed period the status of this Act and of those organisations and individuals operating under it has been enhanced and the Act can now be given the long term **welfare** priority which it rightly deserves.

* As to social contact, there has been a high usage of church or **welfare** centres and a virtual absence of family ties.

* Yet it is the church and other charitable organisations which the Government, under this Act, is trying to encourage to stay in this field of **welfare** to help the homeless and destitute people in this country.

* Organisations such as the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Jesus People- which is a uniquely Western Australian group who look after the homeless group in Western Australia and do an excellent job- must remain in this field of **welfare** because the people they are helping are those who are often referred to as 'skid row' people.

* I do not believe that governments should provide all the finance required to care properly for this area of **welfare**.

* If this were done much of the essential spirit and dignity which comes from the church and charitable and other non-profit **welfare** organisations would disappear.

* That figure represents 0.01 per cent of the Budget outlays for 1979-80 which are classified as social security and **welfare** payments.

* I would like to refer also to the salary subsidies, which amount to 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons' assistance centre.

* According to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  at present subsidies valued at $320,000 are being provided for 44 social **welfare** workers at 40 different homeless persons' centres.

* Social **welfare** workers need formal qualifications in order to be eligible for this subsidy.

* If the purpose of these centres is to provide some scope for rehabilitation rather than just to mount a salvaging operation, additional suitably trained staff, quite apart from social **welfare** officers, may be required.

* One 35-bed hostel in my electorate employs nine **welfare** workers.

* This problem is an almost inevitable consequence of the conflict which occurs in determining **welfare** priorities when universal payments assume a significance, both political and budgetary, which precludes a flexible approach in appropriating funds to emerging areas of need.

* The more we rely upon universal payments in the social **welfare** field, the more that prevents a total concentration of scarce resources in areas of need.

* I know that the Government is seeking to stress the criterion of need as the basis of disbursing **welfare** funds.

* It reads: 
Notwithstanding this desirable method of administering a **welfare** policy, I think that we have a long way to go and the homeless persons assistance program highlights that fact.

* I find it strange that in a country of 14 million people, strongly endowed with the world's most valuable resources, enjoying one of the highest standards of living in the world and spending $14.7 billion annually on health, **welfare** and education, areas of real need involving minuscule appropriations remain relatively ignored.

* It is rather a question of priorities between universality and selectivity in **welfare** payments, which I have debated time and again in this chamber.

* Perhaps there is a tendency for policy makers in democratic systems to listen to the highly organised and highly articulate **welfare** groups, which leads mainly to income transfers being made from middle income earners to other middle income earners.

* Whatever the reason, I strongly suggest to the Minister for Social Security, who has constantly advocated a needs approach to **welfare**, that she give a top priority to re-examining the present funding levels under this Act which services a very needy section of the community.

* The cost of sustaining a permanently deprived and depressed economy in future years would be immensely greater in social **welfare** terms than the assistance which should now be given for essential shipping services to Tasmania.

* At the next Senate election, and at the House of Representatives elections, I shall propose joint standing committees - for example, on Aboriginals, science and technology, health, education and **welfare** and technical change as my Party's platform ordains, and, as I have often advocated, on such matters as law reform, Commonwealth-State agreements and New Guinea.

* In March he suggested committees on external affairs and defence; transport and communications; trade, industry and labour; legal, constitutional and home affairs; health, **welfare**, education and science; and national finance and development.

* The rate of interest now, caused by this Government which is allegedly concerned with social **welfare** and has a social conscience, is the highest on record in Australia's history.

* The Labor Government has also broken another promise it made in the social **welfare** area, that is, the promise to remove the means test for persons 70 years of age and over.

* Does the Minister see any justice in a man who has been deserted by his wife and who has been left with 4 children to care for receiving no assistance under the social **welfare** program of the Labor Government?

* The Government is closely studying the reports of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health and of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care of the Aged and Infirm.

* Let me reiterate what this Government has done for persons covered by the social **welfare** budget.

* The Leader of the Opposition talked about **welfare** housing.

* I well remember and I should imagine that honourable members remember that in about October 1975 the Labor Government froze all outlays for **welfare** housing.

* Many people were forced to leave their homes and had no **welfare** housing to go to thereafter.

* Members of Parliament have to face the tremendous dilemma of choosing between committing themselves to statements that have been made and the matter of directing **welfare** to areas of need.

* We must seek as much as possible to direct **welfare** to areas of need.

* If persons who are not entitled to **welfare** and who can well look after themselves are given assistance from the public purse we will find that the whole economic structure will be in peril.

* In general, the Government is expending large sums of money on **welfare** and it to be supported for the massive outlays that it has undertaken in very difficult economic times as part of its overall humanitarian program in assisting the underprivileged in our community.

* As the honourable member well knows from his own association with and involvement in community **welfare** services in his home area over many years, we must also provide services.

* We are proposing, I hope within a week or a fortnight at the most, to make an announcement of the people who will be manning a national commission on social **welfare**.

* Briefly, the purpose of this commission which will be staffed from people of many disciplines, highly qualified in their fields, will be to identify long term objectives and to assist in the development of a rational framework of social **welfare** programs which will hang together in a balanced, planned sort of way to provide for the evaluation of these programs so that we are continually aware of their relevance or of their need for improvement or redirection in certain areas as community needs and aspirations change from time to time.

* I commended the Bill because it sought to allow voluntary organisations, **welfare** organisations and people interested in philanthropy to transfer their entitlements and to receive money or assistance from the Government if they had an entitlement under the Aged Persons Homes Act.

* It increased the subsidy or the grant to which these **welfare** organisations were entitled.

* Every **welfare** organisation with which I have spoken has supported the stand on this matter by the Opposition in asking for an extension of the Act for another 2 years.

* This Bill transfers entitlements to **welfare** organisations running aged persons hostels as distinct from aged persons' homes.

* Nobody in any of the **welfare** organisations with whom I have spoken says that it can be done.

* The Minister just said, and put doubt into the minds of all **welfare** organisations, that perhaps this working committee of inquiry will recommend against the extension of this Act.

* is well equipped to handle social **welfare** and educational problems and various other areas of social activity, it still is true that difficulties are created in the A.C.T.

* represents what could be the lot of every citizen in this country if we were able to bring proper planning into the development of towns and cities and proper consideration to their **welfare** needs.

* Here in this legislation is the time honoured connotation of the dollar complex and the inevitable and mercenary relationship of social **welfare** legislation to a forthcoming election.

* More importantly, the Government should recast Australia's social **welfare** provisions to lay a basis for the remaining years of the 20th century.

* Funds for **welfare** housing are reduced by $23m.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* At the conclusion of his speech he stated that I had not made any speeches on **welfare** in the time that I have been in this House.

* I would like it noted that I have made the following speeches on **welfare**: On 5th March 1970 in my maiden speech; on 12th March 1970 on Aborigines; on 3rd June 1970 on handicapped children; on 17th September 1970 on the Social Services Bill in relation to pensioner poverty; on 22nd October 1970 on Aboriginal advancement; on 1st April 1971 on the Social Services Bill; on 15th 
September 1971 on superannuation pension increases; on 2nd December 1971 on home care under the States Grants Bill; on 24th May 1972 on 2 repatriation cases; on 20th September 1972 on social services matters and on 11th October 1972 on housing.

* I also asked 4 questions concerning **welfare** matters on 30th October 1970, 6th May 1970, 9th December 1971 and 17th October 1972.

* I urge him to do that because the people of Australia must think that he is more interested in propping up those private funds than in the **welfare** of the people and, more importantly, the real intelligence behind the Act which is to stop this sort of nonsense going on where false advertising can mislead the people and encourage somebody to do something against his better interest.

* Even the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  - it probably does not surprise many people and it certainly does not surprise me - has been induced to become involved, probably seeing some short term political advantage to the ALP in the next Federal elections, but not necessarily concerning itself with the **welfare** and the long term **welfare** of the Australian Aboriginal people.

* Extensive **welfare** policies based on race and not on need can create, and in my opinion and in the opinion of a lot of people are creating, a white backlash in many parts of Australia.

* We hear of the question mark over the Broken Hill Pty Company Ltd steel expansion program and the new exploration and development, private investment generally which sustains and creates for the future the capacity for the greater production of goods and services to meet all our national goals in the social **welfare** and other fields that we wish to pursue.

* The FACS program, established in April 1977, is administered by the Department of Community **Welfare** Services in Victoria.

* They were broadcasters, actors, writers, film makers, producers, trade unions, representatives of home and school associations, co-operatives, advertisers, churches, **welfare** and voluntary groups, students- but all members of the public.

* If two or more of those members do anything which in the words of this amending Bill affects the safety, health or **welfare** of the people of this country a declaration can be sought from the Commission that if such behaviour occurs again within six months the union will be deregistered.

* We can understand that, but when we look at the words used in the Bill we wonder what does not affect the health, safety and **welfare** of the people of this country.

* That affected the health and **welfare** of Australians but the Government does not interpret its action in that way.

* Everything that is done in this country affects the safety, health and **welfare** of people, but the Prime Minister wants to kick the trade union movement and use it as the last resort in order to stay Prime Minister of this country.

* It demonstrates that the Government lacks real philosophical objectivity in the area of social **welfare**.

* Spending on essential education, health and **welfare** programs will be protected against inflation.

* Increased unemployment benefits and relaxed eligibility regulations began to foster a **welfare** mentality which is still with us today.

* Perhaps the most poignant example was **welfare** for the sadly disadvantaged remnants of the AboriginesAustralia's native race.

* Aboriginal **welfare** became a self-sustaining bureaucracy with a huge share of the Government money going to social workers, administrators, researchers and consultants.

* Canberra political commentator Peter Samuel observed: 
The reports make numerous recommendations on migrant **welfare** but they are too numerous for me to mention here.

* This area is also extensively covered in the Bailey report on **welfare** and health and in numerous other reports which have been prepared for the Government in recent years.

* I believe that every possible consideration has been extended to the **welfare** of the residents there.

* If in the **welfare** state this is a process of robbing Peter to pay Paul, then it is the Peters to whom I am referring, and it is the Pauls on behalf of whom my friend, the honourable member for Barton, is complaining.

* I was one of those who participated at great length in the introduction of Medibank when I was  Chairman  of the then Government Members **Welfare** Committee.

* In the four Budgets introduced by the Fraser Government it has significantly re-ordered priorities in the area of income, security and **welfare**.

* Commonwealth support for **welfare** services now places greater emphasis on need.

* The Government has started to develop through the federalism policy a process by which more control can be exercised by the States and local communities over their own **welfare** priorities.

* As was pointed out in the recent interim statement of the Department, the overriding objective of the Government is to build up a department which is both efficient and compassionate, with a recognition that these two values, far from being in conflict, are the twin pillars around which a truly effective **welfare** operation must be designed.

* The Commonwealth has increased its allocation for subsidies for **welfare** officer salaries, housekeeping, home repairs, gardening, laundry and other home care services under the States Grants (Home Care) Act by some $4m or 60 per cent compared with the expenditure in 1975-76.

* The Government in 1976 announced a $12 lm program under the Handicapped Persons **Welfare** Scheme.

* At this point, I would like to interpose and say that I am anxious to have all cash social **welfare** payments made by the Commonwealth in an effort to reduce anomalies.

* Further discussions will take place at a meeting of Commonwealth and State **Welfare** Ministers expected to be held in June next.

* I still regard the position brought about by this Bill on its enactment, 
Letter from former Western Australian Minister for Community **Welfare**  (Question No.

* 700) 
proper arrangements in all the circumstances nave been made for the **welfare** of those children .

* My friend opposite, the honourable member for Lilley, thinks that he could somehow separate the **welfare** part from the rest.

* Government programs in the health, education and **welfare** fields are actively seeking to assist these persons.

* In practice the power and responsibilities of that guardianship have been delegated to the Director-General, the Department of Community **Welfare** in South Australia, and to the principal officers of the relevant child **welfare** authorities in other States and Territories.

* Hence the **welfare** and status of these children will continue to be protected.

* The Minister, in association with child **welfare** authorities, is concerned to do whatever is possible within her powers to facilitate the adoption of the many children such as these and in fact already has signed some 90 orders which have the effect, by exempting the children from the provisions of the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, and hence the guardianship of the Minister, of permitting the due legal processes in the States or Territories to determine whether adoption applications may be approved.

* There is a great deal of social legislation and social **welfare** legislation in the broader sense, among other things, which is enacted almost daily in this place for the benefit of the working man.

* As I mentioned at the outset of my speech, or soon after, it is entirely important that this Bill should be seen to be achieving or attempting to achieve a situation of improved industrial conditions generally for the economic **welfare** of this country, which certainly can stand improvement in any direction in which we are able to effect it in a responsible way from this Parliament.

* I think it is entirely proper that we should be trying to make a situation of improvement whereby industrial relations covering this Commonwealth area of employment will be materially improved for the general **welfare** of the people of this country.

* I will be watching with great interest when the Opposition's social **welfare** policy is tabled to see whether the matter which the honourable member raised is included in the policy.

* We must demon.trate our co-operation and our sincere regard for the **welfare** of people in matters such as this.

* I am certain that the Government and the people of Australia will pull their full weight because, as I said earlier, our record in respect of Kampuchea is going to be seen by the world as demonstrable evidence that Australians do care and that we are concerned for the **welfare** of our fellow human beings.

* There is always pain in adapting to a new situation but there is no reason why that pain should be made greater by people who are not concerned with their **welfare** but with some political advantage.

* Will there also be a decline in the number of new **welfare** houses being built.

* The findings showed an overall desire to double education expenditure, health and foreign aid, increase social **welfare** outlays by one-quarter and slash- by two-thirds- defence spending and spending on economic development.

* This kind of luxurious waste of Government funds to prove a touch of social **welfare** sophistication, sits sadly atop a **welfare** system which barely provides adequately for the financial day-to-day needs of the needy.

* I congratulate the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  for an excellent document and an excellent program of social reform in a wide sphere of activity including health, education, urban transport, other urban problems, social **welfare** and many other fields.

* With those community health services, with heavy emphasis on preventive medicine and with rehabilitation we will make an important break with traditional medical practice in this country and I believe it will be a great breakthrough for the **welfare** and health of the people of Australia.

* The Budget will create a greatly increased demand for buildings particularly **welfare** housing and school buildings.

* Is the Minister for Housing and Construction aware of Press reports of the criticism by the New South Wales Minister for Housing of the Budget allocations for **welfare** housing?

* Is it a fact that New South Wales will receive from the Budget this financial year only $90m for **welfare** housing?

* Finally, what is the allocation to New South Wales for **welfare** housing in the current Budget, and what was the allocation for **welfare** housing in the last full year of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government?

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* However, the Government is still considering the Bailey task force recommendations in the general health and **welfare** area.

* Therefore, it is only sensible that since the Government has not yet reached a decision on these matters, including the future of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act, in relation to health and **welfare** generally, the existing legislation should continue for a further 12 months.

* This Bill represents the first real breakthrough in **welfare** housing.

* This is an enormous increase in the allocation for **welfare** housing, and it signifies tha great priority which the Federal Labor Government puis on providing housing for families with a limited income.

* The Labor Government, because of its prime commitment to the less privileged, has increased its expenditure on **welfare** housing.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* 1 ) With reference to his statement made at the June 1978 Premiers ' Conference that the recycling of rental income and sale proceeds would make possible total expenditure on **welfare** housing in 1978-79 at least equivalent to that in 1977- 78, what was the total expenditure by **welfare** housing authorities (a) by State, (b) by Territory and (c) for Australia in (i) 1976-77 and (ii) 1977-78 for (A) construction, (B) repairs and maintenance, (C) loans, (D) land purchases, (E) repayments of interest and principal to the Commonwealth and (F) other purposes.

* It seemed inconceivable to me at the time that any government could so lightly regard the **welfare** of hundreds of thousands of human beings as to use their suffering as a means of righting their own economic misadventures.

* After being the Minister responsible for social **welfare** for nearly 5 years and having failed to abolish the means test he now proposes to move: 
The honourable member for Reid spoke of interest on loans over a 25-year term, but he did not mention that loans could be available at less than 8 per cent interest.

* I welcome the Bill which is a direct result of the progressive policies on **welfare** that were announced by the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  in the Budget last month.

* The Commonwealth and States housing arrangements under which the Federal Government makes available funds to the States at a low rate of interest for **welfare** housing works is another.

* He will ignore the real issues affecting Australia and endeavour to run an election on false and despicable issues ignorning the mess in foreign affairs, education, health services, social **welfare**, etc.

* There should be committees such as a standing committee on health and **welfare** set up in this place.

* Let us set up a committee on health, a committee on social **welfare** and a committee on trade practices.

* The budgetary cuts to pensions and the unemployment benefit reflected this attitude in social **welfare**.

* We must reestablish the economy of this rich and vigorous country and then carefully press forward with social **welfare**, health and education policies which will ensure that this country is second to none.

* No one will be disadvantaged because the **welfare** system- in this case the public hospital system- guarantees that no one will be disadvantaged.

* The only contribution to abortion this Parliament will be authorising will be through the **welfare** system where the legality and administration is a State and not a Commonwealth responsibility, and is therefore beyond the control of this Parliament, or where there is a legitimate medical necessity through the medical benefits system.

* But let it not forget that it is profit that will finance all its geat schemes for the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* There is no way- just no way- in which the Government can pretend to be more concerned about Australia, about the development of Australia and about the true **welfare** of the Aus.tralian people than this side of the chamber.

* Exhaustive enquiries are made by the child **welfare** authorities and considerable delays can occur before the Courts or, in the case of Queensland, the Director of Children's Services, who is the approving authority in that State, can consider these applications.

* Delays can occur because of the sheer volume of work imposed on social workers and other staff in the offices of the State and Territory child **welfare** authorities, or in getting the matter before the court.

* Any enquiries about these matters should be directed to the relevant State of Territory child **welfare** authority.

* The addresses of the principal officers of the child **welfare** authorities in each State and Territory appear at the end of this statement.

* For the above reasons, people interested in sponsoring a child from overseas for the purpose of adoption or who are proposing to adopt a child overseas, should in the first instance, seek advice from the child **welfare** authorities in their State or Territory of residence.

* It is for this reason that people contemplating adopting a child overseas should seek the advice of the child **welfare** authority of the State or Territory in which they reside before initiating any adoption action overseas.

* Additionally, those people who have adopted a child overseas should similarly consult the child **welfare** authorities in the State or Territory where they reside, as otherwise problems for that child may occur in the future if the adoption is not recognised.

* Since 1952, by agreement with the State and Territory authorities, those powers and functions of guardianship of the Federal Minister for Social Security under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act, have been delegated to the principal officers of the relevant State and Territory child **welfare** authorities excepting the power of delegation.

* In the case of adoption, the preparation of a recommendation by a State or Territory Child **Welfare** authority involves a careful examination of the situation which can be a lengthy process.

* This will enable child **welfare** authorities to take all the necessary action in connection with adoption, marriage or departure from Australia without the necessity of referring the matter to the Federal Minister for Social Security unless there are exceptional circumstances.

* To ensure that the children's **welfare** is safeguarded, the Minister for Social Security has requested that child **welfare** authorities continue to refer for attention, matters of an unusual nature or where malpractices occur, and has asked to be kept informed on a regular basis of the number of children in their State or Territory who are known to come within the provisions of that Act or are exempted therefrom.

* At the conference of the Council of Ministers of Social **Welfare** at Darwin on 24 May 1976, it was agreed that a standing Committee of Australian Adoption Officers be established to assist States and Territories to liaise with the Federal Government and to consider matters affecting intercountry adoptions and other related issues.

* The addresses of the relevant Child **Welfare** Authorities to whom all enquiries regarding adoption should be addressed, are as follows: 
A Luddite approach seeking to block changes is too despairing to tolerate and too damaging to the future **welfare** of the country.

* Will he provide the names of all persons currently employed in Tasmania, full or part-time, whose salaries or stipend are paid out of Commonwealth funds and whose responsibilities relate primarily to the **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* The six Bills just introduced underline our determination to proceed with uranium development in a carefully-regulated and responsible fashion with full regard for proper environmental control and for ensuring the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* We have set ourselves a policy of carefully regulated and controlled development, paying due regard to proper environmental control and ensuring the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* I present the following paper: 
The people find themselves in a situation in which their families represent a social **welfare** insurance policy for the future.

* I rise to support strongly the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  which states:  the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for  out  capital cities and regional centres.

* I do not want to develop it, as one could so easily, but we are sick and tired of this Government's deference to the great business corporation instead of being primarily concerned with the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* For example, expenditure on social **welfare** is up 12.7 per cent.

* Assistance to the States which contribute so much in the administration of the services essential in **welfare**, education, health, employment and all the rest of it, has increased by 14 per cent.

* Many people in Canberra who are involved in **welfare** work are considerably disturbed at the possibility that this body should undertake projects which, for instance, had nothing whatsoever to do with **welfare** and which ignored the needy people in the community.

* How were these funds, which were supposedly to provide for the people in need and the **welfare** agencies, to be used for cultural, artistic and sporting purposes other than directly through an indoor recreation centre?

* On the other hand, if there is a creative, approach by both sides to these matters, we will see created, either with the Assembly's approval or despite, a system of administering **welfare** and community development funds in this Territory with which I hope everybody will be very happy.

* It is not to the credit of a government, a house of assembly or a legislative assembly to have **welfare** agencies knocking at the door and wanting funds for the needy.

* I shall be doing so because there are organisations in Canberra that are in need of **welfare** funds.

* In the opinion of some experts in the child **welfare** field this mother had little chance of leading a normal life.

* I have had reports from people involved in the **welfare** areas which state that apparently dogs can be affected if they are in a room where marihuana is being smoked.

* These apologies and excuses expose the sham of the man who claims that he is genuinely interested in the **welfare** of the ordinary working man and woman.

* 1 ) Have allegations of misappropriation of funds allotted for Aboriginal **welfare** in Victoria been brought to his attention.

* It is so much easier to deal with a company, to accuse the people in private enterprise of being clandestine conspirators against the **welfare** of the country.

* In my judgment, whilst there is an attraction of a deadly sort to such a sinister plan, one can more readily assume that what Australia should be doing is proceeding with its proper work of looking into exploration, encouraging it to go forward, inviting people to speculate, taking the risks, and doing a proper job in the hope that when Australia does produce oil and gas fields it will be able to play its part in providing these minerals as needed for the **welfare** of our own country and the rest of the world.

* The honourable member for Riverina  (Mr Grassby)  who has just resumed his seat has given  a  very good example of the general lack of interest or concern of members of the Labor Party for the **welfare** of people who live in the country areas, including people who operate country radio and television stations and.

* Apart from the value of this industry to the economy of the State it has a real effect on the **welfare**, progress and development of towns in areas where it is grown.

* Our association over the years, whether I was in or out of this House, related to the **welfare** of the people in his or my electorate.

* Firstly, it approved the establishment of 2 experimental migrant resource centres- one in Melbourne to be operated under contract by the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society, and one in Sydney at a total cost not exceeding $70,000 in the current financial year.

* Thirdly, it agreed that the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Social Security should draw up a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society setting out the basis of the provision of services by the Society for and on behalf of the Commonwealth.

* They will be expected to provide a multi-lingual reference and information point for migrants, particularly in respect of services provided by Commonwealth, State and local government intrumentalities, and a range of resources which would be accessible to social workers and **welfare** officers working with migrants, to ethnic community leaders, **welfare** administrators, teachers and students interested in migrant problems, and so on.

* I have grave doubts whether in our society health or **welfare** services should be part of the profit making system.

* Health and **welfare** should be a public responsibility.

* community health and **welfare**, and 
The tourist industry is an important industry.

* In short, the many facets of this important and growing industry contribute to the Australian economy through: Urban and rural development; decentralisation; new and expanded employment outlets; contribution to foreign exchange earnings; avenues for profitable short and long term investment; a contribution to education; new avenues for improving community health and **welfare**, both physical and mental; a deeper understanding of different cultural standards and community attitudes; and a wider base for international understanding and goodwill.

* It has become unfashionable for the fact to be recognised that the middle income and higher income earners are bearing the greatest proportion of tax in each dollar earned, which goes towards our **welfare** program and towards the total federal revenue.

* They were not looking for handouts, the method adopted in the social **welfare** area.

* Owing to the fragmented nature of our health and **welfare** facilities, people needing assistance are often unable to locate the source and they wander through a bureaucratic maze of government, semigovernment and voluntary agencies, becoming more and more distressed as they fail to overcome their emotional or financial problems.

* An adequately trained social worker will be able to give the time to case counselling which is now unavailable to any substantial degree not only in my area on the central coast of New South Wales but probably in most areas in 
I do not think many people outside those who are working in this field realise just how fragmented our society **welfare** structure is.

* If you like to go back even further and look at the relevant figures when this Administration was previously in office, in 1970-71 some $142m was made available for **welfare** housing and that was then 1.74 per cent of government expenditure.

* I am trying to bring out the fact that this Government has downgraded its contribution to **welfare** housing as a proportion of public spending even though public spending overall has been cut by this Government.

* For instance, Hanover **Welfare** Services in Melbourne runs an extensive organisation including Gordon House, a very large institution with 200 or 300 beds.

* Perhaps a **welfare** committee of this House or an appropriate Senate committee could examine the matter so that we can provide money in such a way as to fulfil the initiatives taken three years ago.

* The appointment of social **welfare** workers under the Aus.tralian assistance scheme will no doubt overcome the problem eventually 
I should like to see a study done on a vehicle with a specially designed interior to make meal deliveries and with facilities to ensure the delivery of a really hot meal.

* All of these aspects need looking at by a trained **welfare** worker, and here again shires could provide the solution.

* It must be very distasteful for him to have to cover up for the problems that are being created for the unemployed and the disadvantaged, and the problems in the **welfare** area.

* Profit making and profit taking is the essence of the exercise, whilst **welfare** and full employment objectives are only considered if they are compatible with and subservient to the profit objective.

* These are the special considerations they have been given: A 50c increase in prescription charges; the delaying of a legitimate pension increase; and for pensioners who do not survive without the increase the abolition of pensioner funeral benefits; a reduction in **welfare** services through the imposition of staff ceilings; and a heavy reduction of overseas aid programs to deprived countries.

* Its policies represent a desperate effort to restore profits at the expense of jobs and **welfare**.

* He presided over social security during the important period of Labor's three-year term when social **welfare** benefits and costs rose from $2,099.7m to $5,077.4m and when the Commonwealth taxpayers' expenditure on health rose from $783.2m to $2,952.7m.

* I ask you: How can one judge a man who one moment says he has insufficient funds for **welfare** housing and the next has to struggle to hide a Budget surplus of $100m?

* To increase our understanding of the problems facing these people, a new section was recently created within my Department to carry out research into the effects of social, cultural and environmental factors on employment and employee **welfare**.

* I agree with the honourable member for Banks  (Mr Martin)  that public servants have kept pace with the rise in national productivity, but the benefits of increased productivity can be and are distributed in many other ways - in higher wages, the avoidance of price increases that might otherwise occur, and increased expenditure on community services such as education and social **welfare**.

* I intend to address my remarks to that section of the estimates dealing with Aboriginal **welfare**.

* It is quite obvious that the present Government has a very scant regard for the Aboriginal people generally and places very little importance upon the urgent need for substantial improvement in their general **welfare** and conditions.

* Marine sciences will become far more significant to the long-term **welfare** of this country.

* I do not mind being a sort of social **welfare** worker.

* The information refers only to expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** as distinct from expenditure on benefits available to all Australians.

* Since June 1969 Aborigines in New South Wales have been the responsibility of the Directorate of Aboriginal **Welfare** in the Department of Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare** and separate records are not maintained.

* Expenditure which was normally a charge against the Department of Native **Welfare** in respect to medical and education for Aborigines is now carried by the relevant Departments and not included in the above figures since 1962-63.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Thus we have the situation in Victoria referred to by the Maternal and Child **Welfare** Officer of South Melbourne Council, Doctor Dora Bialestock, who was quoted in the 'Age' of 14th November last year as saying that the largest portion of the Victorian Government's subsidy for preschools was going to the more affluent suburbs.

* While it guarantees to all children in the Australian Capital Territory the right to 1 year of preschool education, the assistance which the Commonwealth gives to the States in the form of capital grants for pre-school teacher colleges if of only marginal assistance and reflects a sense of concern for the **welfare** of Australian children which is only slightly greater than English governments in the eighteenth century showed towards Dame Schools.

* Pursuant to the provisions of the Services Trust Funds Act 1947-1950 I present the annual reports of the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund, the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund for the year ended 30th June 1970, together with the reports of the Auditor-General on the books and accounts of the funds.

* Attention is given to the social **welfare** section in the Budget and to the primary industries which are still vitally important and which in some quarters are still not given the consideration that is due.

* I am extremely gratified by the social **welfare** provisions in the Budget, particularly the additional assistance to be given for home nursing.

* He is accepted as a man who strove mightily for the **welfare** of all Australians as he viewed that **welfare**.

* By the standards of changes in other **welfare** payments, the special rate pension has been treated reasonably well.

* The attendant's allowance is a worthy **welfare** provision but again the application is extremely limited.

* The fact that the amendments mentioned tonight - those that have been moved and those that have been discussed with me but not moved - were never mentioned in relation to the Bill which led to the setting up of the Social **Welfare** Commission suggests to me that this is a rather late, panic reaction in the hope that something will be done by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission.

* However, nobody seemed very much afraid that it would happen with the Social **Welfare** Com mission although, essentially, the functions of the 2 Commissions will run parallel.

* He quoted from the Social **Welfare** Commission Bill which states: 
If you take the view that the Country Party style of politics, of using political muscle for a narrow band of special interests, is counterproductive to the cause of optimising resource allocation and maximising economic growth consistent with economic **welfare**, this new institution might offer an attractive alternative.

* **Welfare** among migrants, which is a very important area and which requires attention even more now than it possibly did in the past, is neglected and, I am sorry to say, appears to be administered on the basis of political patronage at the moment.

* The organisation concerned indicates that this gentleman has provided a valuable service in the field of migrant **welfare**.

* It aims to consolidate and to extend the help which is given to voluntary organisations which undertake the task of looking after the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* In many spheres of **welfare** the States have said that they have had to fill in the gap which, in the past, has been left by Commonwealth legislation.

* I have read articles by the Sub-Normal Children's **Welfare** Association which state that it is all very well to subsidise the establishment of buildings but it is another matter to keep up with the running costs of those institutions.

* I feel that the aircraft- certainly the passengers- are constantly under threat from anything from did.geridoos to French umbrellas which, in the hands of a person deranged or with malicious intent, could imperil the **welfare** of the aircraft.

* I should have thought that the honourable member for Oxley would have been better engaged if he had made some constructive criticisms of the legislation and of the future of the social **welfare** policies because that is what we are dealing with and that is why we are here.

* We are here to try to assist the Government or to criticise the Government about improvements in the social **welfare** policy and not to live in the past.

* I will concede, as the honourable member for Oxley seemed to have some pleasure in pointing out, that the Labor Party did do some good things in the area of social **welfare** when it was in office.

* I would also like to read into the record just 4 points in the social **welfare** policy which was unanimously adopted by the Liberal and Country parties.

* The third part of our social **welfare** policy is this: 
I regard that as a very important election undertaking also.

* To some extent those grants are now provided by State government **welfare** organisations.

* For that reason we have put into our social **welfare** policy that we will remove from voluntary organisations the burden of providing emergency cash assistance, without infringing their ability to provide it.

* Even if one dismisses the humanitarian grounds on which I am speaking, surely on a hard, economic, cost benefit analysis the Government's case is unanswerable because that woman would have then gone off social **welfare** benefits and would have been earning wages and paying taxes.

* This will recentralise activities in social **welfare** which had been decentralised very effectively into the control and operation of the local community in a number of" areas, especially in my electorate.

* These concessions have been paid for by reductions in the **welfare** area and community expenditures.

* I have been allowed only five minutes in which to associate the National Country Party with this piece of most necessary social **welfare**.

* I remind the people of Australia that notwithstanding the need to spend much more money in this area there are parallel schemes in existence: $3m has been made available on a dollartodollar basis with the States for the provision of youth support schemes; various family support service schemes, the community health programs and the **welfare** housing programs are operating.

* Those who do not will stand condemned for their disregard of their own health, their own length of life, their own family and dependants and the **welfare** of this country.

* He moved that the Budget be rejected, for 5 reasons, among them: because it produces no programs for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* It is nonsense to talk about economic **welfare** unless one remembers what is the real escalator of economic **welfare**.

* When there is a total growth situation in the economy it is possible to begin to do something in respect of economic **welfare** or social **welfare**.

* Unless that growth occurs it is impossible to do anything real in terms of social **welfare** because one is merely substituting one form of expenditure for another.

* In plain terms we have a dishonest and discredited Government, a Government of lies and broken promises, a Government that is driving Australia into deeper recession and decline, a Government that is wilfully neglecting the urgent needs of the Australian people, a Government renouncing all responsibility for national **welfare** and national progress.

* In all of it there was not one novel, constructive or creative idea, not one initiative for the **welfare** of the people, not one serious proposal for economic recovery, not one example of imagination or vision or endeavour.

* Every government program for the people's **welfare** and security, every State and federal and local initiative for better cities, health care, transport and community advancement will be starved and strangled.

* The questions df education, health and other **welfare** problems were clearly defined in the.

* particular commodity but are there quite correctly to protect the **welfare** of people whose incomes depend on those industries.

* I think the words I used were that it was one of the most exciting and memorable advances in social **welfare** ever tabled in this Parliament.

* In that case, there would have to be a cutback on the social **welfare** scheme.

* Interwoven into the economy is the need for organisations like the Post Office to pay their own way in order that we may be able to assist in avenues of social **welfare** those who are needy instead of subsidising a service that should pay its own way.

* The proposed increases are an endeavour to make up this leeway and to make available money for social **welfare** schemes, pensions and other things of that nature.

* However, there is one such organisation and one such home that I have had something to do with, namely, the Judge Book Memorial Village in Eltham which is run by the Community **Welfare** Foundation of Melbourne.

* I think this should be borne in mind in view of the comments that come from members of the Opposition suggesting that the Government is not concerned with social **welfare**.

* We find this unacceptable and indeed incomprehensible coming from this Government or indeed any government claiming to have a mandate from the community, claiming to have a moral commitment for those more dependent than most upon actions of government for their **welfare**.

* I move the following amendment to the Social Services Amendment Bill: 
I should like the House to compare that record with the Labor Government's record in 3 years of government, 3 years in which the most significant achievements were made in the field of social **welfare**.

* As a consequence a **welfare** grant of up to $1,500 is available to growers producing export apples and pears and canning fruits.

* This Government recognises the very important aspect of the principle of identifying the **welfare** need.

* There are many people in the farming sector in real need of **welfare** assistance.

* Whilst we do not say that these measures are **welfare** measures, they in part will put some confidence back on the one hand and on the other put some life back into the economy in a financial sense.

* Did members of the Opposition tell us how they would solve the problems of rural **welfare**?

* These not only have adverse effect on the **welfare** of rural producers, on their employees and on the rural people and institutions dependent on agricultural industries but they have adverse resource allocation effects.

* It would make good economic sense, on both efficiency and **welfare** grounds, to distribute these incomes more evenly over time.

* By analogy, a hypothetical distribution of compensatory assistance over time, to make it countercyclical, would consequently improve economic efficiency in the rural sector and would remove one area of potential conflict between economic efficiency and **welfare**.

* I think that in any proper debate on this subject we always have to remember that there is a relationship between the manufacturing sector, the primary industry sector and, as I have said, the **welfare** area of those in need in the country.

* I look forward to an examination by the Government in the period that this bounty is in force until 30 June 1977 so that we can have a good look at what is happening in rural Australia, so that hopefully we can develop **welfare** policies to assist those in need in those areas and so that we can develop reconstruction policies in certain sections of the industry.

* Although government policies for the most part have been responsible for sending large numbers of the population to join dole queues and **welfare** lines, the Government has consistently avoided or denied its responsibility for caring for these people, preferring instead to capitalise on their misfortunes and victimise them by referring to them as dole bludgers or **welfare** fat cats.

* As a result of our belief in that regard, the basis of our policy includes the **welfare** and integration of all our citizens.

* Our policy provides that Australia should have the capacity to provide such things as housing, employment, education and social **welfare**.

* For that reason, I was pleased to read the speech given by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Hayden)  to the Western Austraiian Mining Club on 30 March 1978 when he made the statement that the mining industry has made a significant contribution during the last decade or so to the **welfare** of Australia.

* The Broken Hill mines have made a very significant contribution to the **welfare** of Australia since that time.

* I support these remarks because I believe that nothing holds greater promise for the nation 's future **welfare** than the development of our mineral resources.

* He would make heart-rending speeches about the plight of pensioners and then oppose amendments proposed by the Opposition and aimed at improving the financial and material **welfare** of pensioners.

* The systems of social security benefits and health and **welfare** services will be vastly improved as the Government explores new horizons for the benefit of the community.

* In the social **welfare** field we see a hodge-podge produced for pensioners.

* Increased **welfare** services are also being forced on local government by subsidy in the way of baby health centres, elderly citizens' clubs, creches and so on.

* The Minister for Social Security made an even more serious misrepresentation when speaking of our policies on social **welfare**.

* The Opposition's policies on social **welfare** have been available since about the first or second week of May in a booklet entitled 'The Way Ahead'.

* Of course it is true that in any system of 1 social **welfare**- the honourable member for Hotham is aware of this- there will be a percentage of people who will abuse that system.

* What is not so obvious- but what should be clearly understood- is that this is a continuation of the record of the Whitlam Government, to seek out constantly new ways of making a life of dignity for those who receive any form of **welfare** payment.

* Since then not only has the social **welfare** system been rationalised; benefits and pensions have increased at a far greater rate than increases in prices and wages.

* So I could go on citing these striking examples of the Whitlam Government's continued progress in the area of social **welfare** and how this contrasts with the inactivity of the Liberal-Country Party governments when they were in office for 23 years.

* They have outstanding debts which have accumulated while they have been in prison and many are left to rely on handouts from churches and **welfare** and voluntary charitable organisations.

* Today we are not talking about 'dole bashing' as many of the newspapers in their editorials and members of the Opposition like to call any attempt to share more equitably and efficiently the resources available to **welfare**.

* These two extremes should not prevent people from constructively criticising abuse and recommending changes to improve the efficiency, equity and cost benefit of the **welfare** dollar to see that it goes to those in the greatest need.

* He is fed up because after he finishes his day's work and goes down to the pub at night, he finds somebody who has a spurious **welfare** claim and has been at the pub all day.

* So there is no simple answer to reducing the abuse of the **welfare** system.

* What I am saying is that we have to look to the real **welfare** of these Aboriginal people - 
In dealing with the tremendously important field of social **welfare** the Leader of the Opposition again came forward -with a most confused dissertation that I could not understand.

* would like to see certain other improvements in the social service and social **welfare** legislation, particularly for old people, but this is my personal opinion and it is not backed, as it should be, by the information that is available to the Government.

* Mr Speaker,  I am sure that this and other matters concerned with the **welfare** of primary producers of this country were very carefully considered by the Minister for Primary Industry and indeed by the Government generally since there are, as the honourable member would agree, many advantages enjoyed by primary producers which the other sections of the community do not enjoy.

* Three main sections of the Budget account for some 56,231 m. They include defence, the first responsibility of a national government, which will require SI, 252m, and the national **welfare** fund and repatriation, over $2,000m.

* If in a Budget of $8.654m a sum of about S2,000m is for social **welfare**, surely this represents a reasonable deal for the people concerned.

* However, a number of Government members- quite a small number- members on the Government parties' Health and **Welfare** Committee brought this matter to my attention.

* Members of the Opposition wish to place on record that the Labor Government was elected to promote the **welfare** aspects of our society.

* One of those **welfare** aspects was the abolition of the means test for age pensioners.

* The Commission found that, because Queensland has a higher proportion of its population in the age group of 0 to 18 years than New South Wales and Victoria, it has need for a greater per capita expenditure on child **welfare**, for instance.

* With regard to health, hospitals and **welfare** for public health, Queensland spends 41.1 per cent less per capita than the average of the six States.

* On child **welfare**, Queensland spends 18.6 per cent less than the average of all the States.

* In this total area of health, hospital and **welfare**, Queensland spends 21.5 per cent less than the average of the six States for such per capita expenditure.

* It is a factor which should be borne in mind by the people of Queensland that they are getting a level of service in these very important areas of education, health and **welfare** which is far below that being provided by the other States, despite the fact that their own government is being funded by the Federal Government specifically with funds designed to enable the Queensland Government to provide services which are of the same standard, quality and range as those provided by the other States.

* In Queensland there is clearly a desperate need to expand the services in the health, education and **welfare** area.

* In both of these areas I have realised the importance of social **welfare** and health programs.

* If I recall aright, in the Budget Speech the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  said that Australia must be restored to a position of leadership in the provision of **welfare** services, and I do not think that anyone would deny assistance to people in need.

* The social security and **welfare** budget is something like $3,44 lm of a total budget of $ 16,274m, which is 21 per cent of the total budget.

* The honourable member for Henty  (Mrs Child)  endeavoured to make out a case that this Government in its 2 years in office has been the only government that has ever done anything in the field of social **welfare**.

* He and his predecessors did have a very humane approach to social **welfare**.

* Our standard of living improves, so obviously we must improve our social **welfare** benefits.

* I have spoken to **welfare** officers and chaplains who have in the last few months come to Australia on vessels carrying migrants, and there seems to be no doubt that a large number  -  10 per cent is a large number - of persons coming to Australia at the moment from the United Kingdom are really coming here for a holiday.

* I believe that they are of considerable benefit to migrants and I am thinking in particular of the Greek community and how much it has done to help Greek migrants in counselling, securing employment and general social **welfare** work.

* The sentiments of the Labor Party in regard to social **welfare** and unemployment benefit would ring much more truly if it practised what it preached.

* I quite agree; it is time that the people of Australia realised that this Government is responsible for the introduction of most of the social **welfare** legislation now in operation.

* As with previous Fraser Government Budgets, funding which goes to Aboriginal people has been cut in regard to housing, health, education, employment, enterprises, town management, public utilities, cultural and recreational funding, legal aid training and consultation and research- in fact, in every category except for general **welfare** where there has been a small increase.

* The one line where there has been a slight increase is the **welfare** area.

* There are provisions for the **welfare** and custody of children and a requirement that proper arrangements are to be made for the **welfare** of children before divorce becomes absolute.

* The Minister also failed to indicate whether his Department has conducted any form of needs survey among working women in the Commonwealth Public Service to determine those forms of assistance which they regard as being most important An employer who was concerned about the **welfare** of his staff would first ascertain what the employees regarded as important priorities, but this the Government has failed to do.

* The totality of this Government's social **welfare** program can easily be nullified by the effects of inflation.

* In housing, as in so many other areas of national **welfare**, this Government substitutes inertia and expediency for planning and positive policy.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has established three Committees under Section 17 of its Act- 
The permanent Working Party on Social **Welfare** Manpower 
Honourable members will notice that the estimates of my Department for the Northern Territory this year provide for a total expenditure of $16m on Aboriginal **welfare** which is an increase of 13.7 per cent on the estimates for the previous year.

* I believe that I should say something about the dimension of the problem of Aboriginal **welfare** because it is only when there is a real appreciation in this regard that there will be an awareness of what has to be done in the future and the time scale to which this can reasonably be related.

* The Government is not prepared to allocate more from the Budget to the Post Office because this could only be at the expense of our priority programs in the fields of education, **welfare** and health.

* This is another Bill in the series being introduced in this session to improve **welfare** services for elderly people.

* In broad terms the Principal Act provides three forms of assistance: Firstly, for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance for aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building of senior citizens' centres; and thirdly, for the employment of **welfare** officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens' centres.

* This is in accordance with one of the recommendations made in the First Annual Report of the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission which I tabled in the House recently.

* The third provision of the Bill concerns assistance towards the employment of **welfare** officers.

* Section 10 of the principal Act provides that where a person is employed as a **welfare** officer of a senior citizens centre wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of approved **welfare** services by or in association with the centre, the Australian Government may pay an amount equal to one-half of the **welfare** officer's salary.

* In order further to encourage and assist the provision of the **welfare** services to which I have previously referred, the amending Bill increases the Australian Government's subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of the salary paid to appropriate **welfare** officers.

* If I could interpolate one final comment,  Mr Speaker,  I would like to acknowledge the representations 1 have received regarding the fact that this subsidy for **welfare** officers is restricted under the terms of the Act to **welfare** officers engaged wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of **welfare** services for the aged.

* I am unhappy about the fragmented arrangement where several departments each sponsor **welfare** services.

* I would prefer to see the **welfare** services which are at present being provided exclusively for elderly people expanded and made available for everybody in need of advice or assistance, irrespective of age.

* This calls for the development of an integrated program of **welfare** services, complementary to income support programs and the welfarerelated aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies.

* It is certainly a generously improved program compared to what has gone before but is only a stopgap measure pending the development of more comprehensive integrated and adequately planned measures to ensure that the aged and indeed every other section in the community have easy access to a comprehensive range of **welfare** services.

* I repeat, this is the purpose of the Australian assistance plan which is undeniably the most significant step taken in the field of social **welfare** in the history of this country.

* Last December the Government put to the people in its policy speech the undertaking that it would negotiate a new **welfare** housing agreement with State governments.

* I think his remarks can be summarised in this way: A great deal more money should be spent on **welfare** housing.

* Above all else, interest rates made it so extraordinarily difficult for people on lower incomesthat is, the people who find support through **welfare** housing programs- to meet the demands made by housing authorities for interest and capital repayments.

* I congratulate the Government, and I am pleased to support this legislation because once again it gets us back on the path by which more and more people will have access to **welfare** housing programs on just terms.

* There are many anomalies in the present **welfare** housing arrangements.

* It is a fact that the people who were the beneficiaries of **welfare** housing programs have in some instances been in a position to make repayments in excess of that required by existing contracts.

* We should remember the remarks made by the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty regarding the approach to **welfare** housing.

* That Commission's report made it abundantly clear- as did the report on housing of the Priorities Review Staff- that there were a great many instances of people in **welfare** housing - 
In relation to this Bill the Opposition is saying that State housing authorities apparently cannot be trusted to execute satisfactory, meaningful and efficient **welfare** housing programs.

* It is because they can be trusted that provision has been made for very considerable flexibility to be given to State housing authorities in the approach they will take to **welfare** housing.

* Who, other than a socialist, would take the attitude that all decisions regarding **welfare** housing programs should be made in Canberra?

* Who else would take the attitude that there should be no flexibility between States or within States on how **welfare** housing funds can best be utilised.

* This Government takes the view, and will not swerve from it, that present circumstances require the most efficient use of funds and the most innovative approach to **welfare** housing that can.

* As my friend has said, the Victorian approach to home ownership in **welfare** housing leads the States without exception and has done so for many years.

* This legislation is the most far reaching reform in the approach to **welfare** housing that this country has seen.

* This should disturb the national Government which is concerned with the health and **welfare** of its community, and also with its labour force.

* Even if one took the most optimistic view of inflation, the reality is that over the course of the next 12 months prices will rise and, as they rise, the standard of living of those people relying on social **welfare** benefits will decrease.

* (a), (c) and (d) Financial assistance in the form of Direct Grants is available to incorporated Aboriginal groups and organisations in a variety of fields such as housing, health, education, employment, **welfare**, economic enterprises, town management, recreation and agricultural activities and legal aid.

* What research projects have been initiated and supported by the Social **Welfare** Commission, what cost was involved, and who or what institution conducted the research.

* I would urge members of the Storemen and Packers Union to think of the **welfare** of their fellow workers in the present circumstances.

* It is a sad thing that this legislation was not brought down in circumstances which would have enabled the whole range of people interested in Aboriginal **welfare** - no less the Aborigines themselves - to express their views on the legislation in order that whatever emerged from the Queensland Parliament might be the best possible legislation.

* There has been a failure to train staff in all the positions they occupy on these reserves, whether they be policemen, justices of the peace or the lass working in the maternal and child **welfare** centre.

* It is certainly a social **welfare** Budget dealing with the quality of life and with a great deal of public expenditure.

* After all, in one city in America, by using a computer in its social **welfare** agency it was found that a woman who had been receiving social security payments for 15 years had never had a medical examination.

* As passed by the Senate, the major provisions of the Family Law Bill provide for the establishment of a family court in Australia for the first time; the establishment of State family courts for the first time; the ability to seek matrimonial relief in the family courts, the State supreme courts or the magistrates courts without first proceeding for divorce; the abolition of all fault grounds for divorce; joint custody of children and joint responsibility for their maintenance; widely increased use of **welfare** officers to help in custody disputes and in the ongoing relationship between parents; the financial responsibility of each party to a marriage and to maintain the other; criteria for the provision of maintenance for spouses and children based on the applicant's need; the establishment of a family law council and an institute of family studies; and greatly increased counselling opportunities relating not merely to divorce and reconciliaton but also to the on-going problems of divorced persons, particularly in relation to their children.

* The provisions in the BUI governing the **welfare**, maintenance and custody of children are important because the protection of children is probably the strongest justification for intervention by the state to regulate the dissolution of marriage.

* The existing law prevents a divorce decree from becoming final until the court is satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the **welfare** of the children so does the BUI.

* In addition to continuing these measures and introducing uniformity where the existing law is State or Territory law, the Bill contains some additional provisions such as those for separate legal representation of children in proceedings, enforcement of custody and access orders and greater use of **welfare** officers.

* All tentative planning activities in the **welfare** field will be affected seriously by any definitive, comprehensive and authoritative statements concerning population projections.

* Firstly many eminent demographers would contend that the population size and the ultimate population size is only going to be of relative consideration- relative to the standards of living we want, relative to productivity, relative to what governments do to ensure the **welfare** of their citizens and relative to economic strategy in relation to unemployment and inflation.

* The Labor initiatives in the social **welfare** field at one stage made Australia attractive to immigrants but the Government has now, I believe- I think we can be critical of this-attempted to dismantle the Labor initiatives in that social **welfare** area.

* That means that payments to people on social **welfare** in those countries are far in excess of what we can offer.

* Staats, former consultant to the Social **Welfare** Commission, of the changing composition of the Australian workforce.

* Family unity, growth centres, **welfare** and other requirements, representations on bodies that affect the **welfare** of their own future and representations throughout the occupational structures that give a voice to the individuals are some of the matters to which I make reference.

* The nursing home benefits arrangements for which the Bill provides represent a major advance in the Government's health and **welfare** program introducing a new era of financial security for nursing home patients.

* Out of my concern for the **welfare** of nursing home patients, I have written a letter to all patients to reassure them that the proposed changes to the nursing home arrangements will advantage them as patients.

* I am sure that the end result of this will be a real improvement in human **welfare** in the form of better dental health for the next generation of Australians.

* It is not just that we have more dental therapists and it is not just that we have more buildings; the benefit is a tangible one in human **welfare**.

* In the field of social **welfare** there can be some disappointment with what is provided by the Budget.

* In 1970 the South Australian Council of Social Services conducted a survey through the various social **welfare** agencies on what was termed 'emergency housing'.

* As a result a priority housing assistance scheme was established and a referral system devised in agreement with social **welfare** agencies.

* The Australian Government has embarked upon what is a most ambitious social **welfare** program.

* He will have to be pretty active to cater for his own **welfare** and earn his own income from the point of view of work in the courts or elsewhere.

* The Government of this country almost went bankrupt in the process of trying to find money from people to pay for some of its expensive social **welfare** and health policies.

* The Labor Government raised health and **welfare** payments to such levels that some people in the community began to believe that it was their God given right to receive a benefit from the government.

* The Australian Labor Party's philosophy is expressed in its health and social **welfare** policy.

* The Government makes no apology whatsoever for its changes to the health insurance system or for its ideological approach to health and **welfare** which, as I said earlier, is vastly different from the approach of the Australian Labor Party.

* The Liberal-National Country Party Government's fundamental social **welfare** philosophy rests on its commitment to channel scarce resources- they are scarce enough; they are taken from the people's pockets- into the areas of need.

* We stand for progressive social **welfare** policies .

* Material support is obtained as social service benefits and pensions, from **welfare** agencies and missions, by begging, by 'borrowing' from other men, and by residence in hospitals, prisons, sanatoria and homes for the aged.

* Also, the Bill allows for recurrent expenses to be paid, sometimes up to 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker.

* The Bill defines a social **welfare** worker as someone qualified or not necessarily qualified.

* That, I believe, would present enormous problems to **welfare** organisations.

* I have been somewhat troubled in recent years when the Leader of the Opposition - now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  - made it clear that he believed it to be of vital importance to the **welfare** of Australia that Papua New Guinea should become an independent country as quickly as possible.

* We have, under the umbrella of our powerful friends, been able to create a society which has developed at an enormous rate - a society which has been prosperous and within which the **welfare** of the average family is as well developed as can be found in any country on this earth.

* The people of Grayndler definitely need much assistance from governments and social **welfare** programs that can be funded only by the Federal Government.

* In some of the suburbs of my electorate slight variations in **welfare**, employment or economic policies can have a grave effect on the social fabric of the area.

* The Government has not increased family allowances this year even though it seems to think that is the jewel in its social **welfare** crown.

* Without consulting the land rights body in Western Australia and without consulting the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning, the Western Australian Government intends to hand over to the Minister for Health and Community **Welfare** the absolute control of entry by diamond prospectors, including the De Beer group from South Africa.

* The Minister for Health and Community **Welfare** would be one of the most racist people in any government in Australia.

* As the **welfare** and development of Aboriginals affect more than one department, a ministerial committee will be appointed to study the special needs and problems of Aboriginals and to advise ways of improving them.

* These vary from day to day but range across such matters as the state of the economy, the Commonwealth's role in **welfare**, relations with the States - so important in a Federation - and external relations and defence.

* In the Liberal scheme of priorities the **welfare**, the security and the future happiness of Australian youth are subordinated to an obsession with corporate profits and a heartless manipulation of the Federal deficit.

* As the Minister for Housing and Minister for Works  (Mr Les Johnson)  said in his second reading speech, the purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to make advances to the States for **welfare** housing during 1973-74 and the first 6 months of 1974-75 in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement.

* each of the 5 years commencing 1973-74 the Commonwealth would make advances at low interest rates to the States for **welfare** housing purposes.

* We should also involve counsellors and people interested in family **welfare** concepts, such as social workers, and even representatives of family units, so they can determine what they can do together.

* This could be spent towards the **welfare** of his family.

* I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition which states: the House condemns the Budget because it falls to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme fox restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres'.

* My officers also interviewed  Mr Vrettos,  who said that there seemed to be far more worry back home about his **welfare** and whereabouts than he had himself.

* Loans made under Section 12/2E of the Social **Welfare** Ordinance; 
Child **Welfare** Council operating subsidy; 
Before I divert from that on to the further points on the subsidy I would like to refer to statements made by the Minister in his second reading speech in the House in which he claimed there had been substantial cuts in the expenditure on health in Canada last year.

* The first thing he referred  to  was a 25% cut in the votes for emergency health and emergency **welfare** services which were effective during this financial year.

* Without meaning in any way to be argumentative but simply putting it as a fact as I see it, I think it is true to say that the last Government would have divided the provisions contained in this single Bill into at least six or seven separate Bills so as to squeeze out the last drop of public approval and political advantage to which social **welfare** measures lend themselves.

* Fourthly, it is recognised that a responsible **welfare** system cannot be based on some simple view that more of everything for everybody will solve all.

* 1 have in my hand, to illustrate that it is no dis covery at all, a paper presented to the very first meeting of the Health and Social **Welfare** Committee of the Labor Caucus held after the last election.

* In my view a proper order of social **welfare** priorities should give greater emphasis to pension levels than to means test abolition.

* In the meantime let me simply say that this Bill is to be welcomed as a further step in the direction of a decent and comprehensive **welfare** system.

* As individuals the delegates are associated with Service Clubs, Educational Bodies, Sporting Clubs, Church Groups, Local Government and various community **welfare** bodies.

* A capitation gram of $244,000 per annum is available for **welfare** projects and the Regional Board estimates that on the current rate of project expenditure, 9 per cent of total funds available would be spent on administrative costs, i.e.

* In reaching its decision on the mining of uranium the Government had as a fundamental concern the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people in the Ranger Region.

* Another fully qualified teacher found refuge in the office of Catholic **Welfare** in Sydney.

* I also ask him to explore the proposal being advanced by a **welfare** officer with the Catholic Migration Office in Sydney to establish some improved and continuing hostel accommodation.

* Translation and **welfare** services for our other ethnic groups were woefully inadequate but for the Turks they were non-existent.

* During that period the Kensington group, which represents a wide spread of Turkish migrants, formed their own social **welfare** group, hired their own premises and conducted a survey of their community.

* They say that the Government's import parity fuel policy has added a most significant indirect tax to the Government's income armoury which has allowed the Government to reduce the deficit and to hand out some well deserved improvements in the **welfare** sector.

* When listing these points it would be wrong for me as  chairman  of the Government Members Health and **Welfare** Committee not to congratulate the responsible Ministers and the Cabinet on such measures as the reintroduction of twiceyearly indexation of pensions, increases in permissible earnings to retain eligibility of pensioner health benefit cards, the extension of the eligibility for pensioner health benefit cards and other fringe benefits to supporting parents, the increased capital allocations for the aged persons and senior citizens' programs, the extension of service pensions to all allied ex-service personnel and the accelerated animal quarantine program.

* In rejecting these reasonable representations and this expression of United Nations opinion, by continuing atmospheric testing in the Pacific and by announcing that further tests are yet to be held, the Government of France has shown what I can only describe as an inexplicable disregard for the **welfare**, well being and the clearly expressed views of the people of Australia, the Pacific and the littoral states of the region.

* While it is to be recognised that these are possibilities and that the conclusions reached are subject to qualification, nevertheless, it should be selfevident that any pollution of the environment carrying with it the possibility of endangering human life and **welfare**, should be avoided.

* But we cannot acquiesce in any compromise affecting the **welfare** or safety of the Australian people.

* It has no **welfare** aspect to it whatsoever, lt is designed to help most those who negotiate the biggest mortgages, and it would assist 'hose who, in negotiating the biggest mortgages, bid interest rates up.

* lt would make such a subvention a hostage to higher interest rates, and that should be examined, lt is a **welfare** policy that would operate in absolute and complete regression from the way in which it should operate.

* The smaller the amount saved, the higher the mortgage, and the more assistance the Opposition would have to give - yet this is put forward as a **welfare** policy.

* The private sector fails the community by being unwilling to spend when the **welfare** of the community is at stake.

* Looking through the Budget a bit further we come to social **welfare**, and the first item dealt with specifically is education.

* The Australian Parliament and the people can now see the justification for the allegation by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  of waste, extravagance, duplication and over utilisation in the expenditure of funds on Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The people and the Parliament can now see the justification for the slashing of expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** of $33m in the Budget and the abrogation of the election commitment given by the Attorney-General  (Mr Ellicott)  in December last year.

* The article said that according to an analysis of the Friedman thesis- which has been followed to a great extent by this Government- **welfare** states with a high ratio of government expenditure are more prone to inflation than others.

* The following State and Commonwealth Ministers attended the Conference of Child and Social **Welfare** Ministers held on 5th June 1972: 
A further important factor is that there will be reduced financial strain on the parties because of the cost of proceedings in dealing with a break-up of marriage.

* It seems to me that the Bill places the **welfare** and custody of children on a reasonably enlightened basis.

* I am anxious that we concentrate on how we can best solve the problems of the family with less legalism and at the minimum of cost and how we can support the parties in coming to an agreement in advance on the property distribution, the maintenance problems and the **welfare** of the children.

* We thought that the committee could have comprised people who had experience in counselling and in matters relating to **welfare** and who generally had expertise in practising in this jurisdiction.

* At the present time, despite the absence of an office of the former Department of Immigration a **welfare** team comprising social workers and bi-lingual **welfare** officers speaking the languages of the major migrant groups operates in the Parramatta area as the need arises.

* Inflation poisons the growth of an economy and robs people of the advances in social **welfare** and standards of living that would otherwise be achievable.

* This involves striking a proper balance between the demands of the public sector, which distributes social **welfare**, against the health of the private sector, which creates the means of financing public spending.

* This committee revealed that one of the main factors affecting the attraction of migrants to Australia and their decision to remain here was Australia's social **welfare** programme.

* The report states: 
and (3) Under the Social **Welfare** Ordinance 1964-1971, the Director  of  Social **Welfare** hat authority to provide assistance to persons, including pensioners, who are in need of it.

* In October 1972 the Child **Welfare** Grants Act was passed.

* That was followed by the Social **Welfare** Commission report of July 1974.

* These reports were directed at trying to overcome the very real problems which were faced both by the Fry committee and by the social **welfare** committee in this context.

* In 2 years living in Israel I had the opportunity of seeing at first hand the effective operation of a well integrated system of community **welfare** organisations under the control of local government.

* In my opinion, this will create a number of major problems as the Prime Minister's Department to date has had little, if anything, to do with the areas of specific education and social **welfare** which are obviously the 2 major fields related to pre-school education.

* The Opposition is of the view, and will certainly carry it into effect when we return to the Treasury bench, that there should be established a Children's Bureau which will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain responsibility for the administration of programs within their respective portfolios such as those of health, education and social **welfare**.

* In other words, the Children's Bureau will act as a collector of information and a disseminator of trends and information to the Departments of State responsible for various aspects of social **welfare** matters.

* I would prefer the Government to reject the recommendations of the Priorities Review Staff on administration and adopt those put forward by the expert working party of the Social **Welfare** Commission in this regard.

* The important factor which we need to emphasise, however, is that social **welfare** programs at this level must emphasise the need for local participation at the grass roots level.

* It came in because it knew that deficit financing, financed by a bank for social **welfare** benefits, was disastrous so far as inflationary pressures were concerned.

* If we have a deficit of this kind not for productive services but for **welfare** services, that amount of money- it was $2,648m or a lesser amount according to the amount that is properly attributable to Medibank- must have inflationary consequences for us.

* What sum was paid to Queensland from the National **Welfare** Fund for (a) hospital benefits and (b) payments to public hospitals for pensioners in each of the last 10 years.

* and (b) No payments are made direct to Queensland State authorities from the National **Welfare** Fund in respect of Commonwealth hospital benefits.

* **Welfare** would be the first place to suffer.

* It has involved local resident groups in area improvement programs, in social **welfare** activities and in the establishment of community health centres.

* You will be aware that in my policy speech I said that the government would continue to make general improvements in the Social **Welfare** field as and when we can responsibly do so, without causing inflation or increasing the tax burden.

* -Speaking in the debate on the estimates for Aboriginal Affairs last year I made the point that the whole question of the **welfare** of Aboriginal people should not be allowed to become a party political issue.

* Much has been achieved for the **welfare** and training of the Aboriginal population.

* Funds in the crucial areas of employment and **welfare** have not been cut.

* In the **welfare** field, funds available to the Aboriginal Legal Service have been maintained at $7.

* It is designed to assist the States to facilitate the building of dwellings for those who desire **welfare** housing.

* It is for the States to determine who would be appropriate to receive **welfare** housing.

* The Bill before the House today is one of a series of further measures which I will be introducing during this session of Parliament to assist the provision of a comprehensive program of **welfare** services for the people of Australia.

* This contact ensures that frail or isolated people receive a daily check on the state of their health and provides them with an entree to many other **welfare** service that are available in the district.

* The Government has major responsibilities demanding its attention in the traditional areas of social **welfare**, education, defence, and so on.

* I refer to such bodies as the proposed Minerals and Energy Authority, the National Pipeline Authority, the Industries Assistance Commission, the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Australian Industries Development Corporation.

* It is my personal hope that the States will be generous in allocating amounts to that purpose in clause 14 which is concerned with the provision of staff to promote safety, health and **welfare** in individual colleges.

* In the iterim we have seen an extensive media campaign mounted by the Uranium Producers Forum in an attempt to convince people that there are no real dangers involved in the use of uranium, that it is just another energy source, or in the disposal of nuclear waste: that the mass of the people will benefit from uranium by increased employment opportunities, by social **welfare** benefits and economic activity.

* They have expressed their very serious concern for the **welfare** of their children and their grandchildren and for the future of humanity.

* I believe that the Minister should concern himself not with the amalgamation of unions but with the **welfare** of unionists.

* After listening to the honourable member for North Sydney  (Mr Graham)  I could not but think that if he represents the advanced thinking of members of the Government side on health and **welfare** schemes it is no wonder that the national health scheme is in a hell of a mess.

* I was a member of the social **welfare** committee of this Parliament which gave to every citizen of this country from one end of the nation to the other free hospitalisation without any means test.

* In other words it was not to be considered as though it were a **welfare** service.

* In my opinion this is far outside the wishes of the producer and shows a disregard for his **welfare**.

* The grower is entitled to be told that he is a part of any scheme claimed to have been introduced for his **welfare**.

* I repeat that the first objective is rapidly to expand the public sector both by direct spending and transfer payments, increased **welfare** and social service benefits.

* So I stress again that the Government wants to enlarge the public sector by spending up on social **welfare**, city development and the rest, and  Mr Clyde  Cameron, together with, the broad mass of the electorate in a perfectly legitimate way, wants higher incomes and more money for the goods and services they choose to acquire; in short, they want more real private spending power.

* In the Budget we should be able to read about the Government's concern, or lack of it, for the long-term health of the individual sectors of the economy and we should find reflected the Government's priorities in regard to the **welfare** of the different sectors or groups in the community.

* There is only one measure in this Budget which could be regarded as a positive step towards improving the **welfare** of the farm sector; that is the introduction of the income equalisation deposits scheme.

* This is the fourth measure that I have been privileged to introduce during the current session of Parliament as part of the Government's far-reaching programme for the purpose of improving the health and **welfare** of aged people.

* These organisations, honourable members will no doubt agree, play an important role in looking after the health and **welfare** of aged or invalid people in their own homes, not only by ensuring that they obtain adequate meals for a nominal charge, but also by providing a necessary contact between people who may be frail and lonely and supportive services such as home nursing, paramedical, housekeeping, emergency transport, shopping, gardening, hairdressing, chiropody, library and general counselling.

* In terms of today's social **welfare** expenditure this is not a major item, but the importance of adequate nutrition to elderly people living alone cannot be overstated.

* As I told the House when introducing the Aged Persons Homes Bill recently, one of the most important aspects of this year's comprehensive programme to improve the health and **welfare** of aged people is to encourage and assist people who might otherwise be admitted prematurely or unnecessarily to nursing homes or other similar institutions to remain in their domestic environment for as long as possible.

* Popular though those concessions were with so many people in the community, the really important acceptance of this Lynch Budget related to the tax indexation of personal incomes, together with the decision to increase social **welfare** in real terms, to accept a greater financial responsibility in the field of education, again in real terms, and to bring back some realism in the field of defence spending.

* It should be seen as a culmination of much effort that has been put into the **welfare** of the aged by members who sit in this House today representing such electorates as Mackellar, Sturt and Oxley.

* Of the 120 not yet approved, 9 were referred back to the Board for further information on their social **welfare** aspects as they did not appear to come within the scope of the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Substantial sums of Commonwealth money are given to the Queensland Government for the **welfare** and advancement of the Aboriginal people.

* It is failing in the area of **welfare** and in the area of the advancement of the Aboriginal people.

* I cannot see any **welfare** or advancement in that.

* In looking at the situation in terms of **welfare** and advancement, **welfare** would relate to good personal health, hygiene, a good diet and the right sort of environment.

* We are in the process of destroying these people if we leave their **welfare** to the likes of the Queensland Government.

* We have to be able to say to the Aboriginal people: 'We are genuinely concerned about your **welfare**'.

* This is one of the practices of reactionary people in the community who resent any efforts to liberalise social **welfare** benefits and services.

* I can assure honourable members that the evidence there shows that these sorts of assertions are grossly over-blown and I do not believe that the Liberal Party does itself any credit, if it claims to be a liberal party, by jumping on the bandwaggon of reaction where social **welfare** benefits and services are concerned and where peoples' fundamental rights to self respect and dignity are involved.

* Her  abiding interests throughout her career were to uphold and maintain the dignity and the importance of the Parliament, to further the people's claims in the area of social **welfare** and to contribute to the planning and development of Canberra as the nation 's capital.

* One can find similar impressive achievements in the area of social **welfare**: Family allowances, the supporting parent's benefit and the indexation of pensions and benefits.

* Honourable members would be aware, of course, that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has already given an undertaking that the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** on the mentally and physically handicapped relating to sheltered workshops and other matters, insofar as they are an Australian Government responsibility, will be implemented by this Government.

* The council will have a major responsibility for the general **welfare** of the handicapped and because of the importance with which this is regarded the council will be reporting direct to the Prime Minister.

* One of the reasons why people who have migrated to Australia are now leaving Australia, and why there are so many leaving, particularly those from the prime source countries, is that Australia does not now compare with those countries in **welfare**, health and housing standards.

* We shall never retain them in this country unless we discard our pettifogging and begrudging **welfare** policies.

* If there are to be any social **welfare** measures for the wool industry they cannot be introduced through the back door of the Corporation.

* However, there are many other things apart from the market price that are detrimental to the woolgrowers' **welfare**.

* The way to regard this is that $2.2m is left for expenditure throughout the 6 States for all the other purposes under the headings of **welfare** and difficulties.

* There is the Migration Act 1958-1968; the Navigation Act 1912-1968; in Queensland the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders' Affairs Acts 1965-67; the Vagrants, Gaming and Others Offences Acts 1931-1967; in Western Australia the Licensing Act 1911-1968; the Native **Welfare** Act 1963; the Native (Citizenship Rights) Act 1944-1964.

* I have visited businessmen and private residents in these places and also in the Lower Nudgee area, and I have no doubt that all these people recognise my interest in their **welfare**.

* I suppose we must wait until Budget time to find out just how much further the States will be squeezed in this area that the Government chooses to call **welfare** housing.

* If the young couple is on a wage at about $165 a week, the situation would be that the take-home pay would be $125 a week of which $45 would go to so-called **welfare** housing, leaving them with a miserable $80 a week.

* Certainly in the need area, that of **welfare** housing, the Minister, in his speeches but certainly not in the Bill, is abdicating responsibility for providing that form of housing- except in the sense that the Commonwealth will make moneys available to the State housing authorities, and those funds are welcome.

* The publication states: 
What is the function of each of the Governmentemployed social **welfare** workers.

* In the few moments left to me 1 want to look at the field of social **welfare**.

* There has been a doubling of the amount provided for senior citizens' and social **welfare** centres.

* Funds are available under the social **welfare** assistance plan and it is possible to get a grant of $20,000 for a regional director and planning staff to draw together the myriad social **welfare** and health activities which are now run by so many different government agencies without any over all planning.

* It introduces people with other qualificationsI am sure the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  would appreciate my point- in the humanities and social sciences and **welfare** work to try to bring about conciliation in a less rigid, less legalistic, less frightening way than under the present system.

* It is this, that subject to proper and satisfactory arrangements being made for the **welfare** of children, and particularly if there are no children, what adult people do is primarily a matter for themselves as long as they do not break the criminal law, do not offend their neighbours and are not guilty of breaking the law of torts.

* We have heard of Utopia and the **welfare** state; but this is ridiculous.

* One wonders how far we will go with this ridiculous **welfare** state.

* The Bill has been denounced as unchristian, a marriage breaker, a nation destroyer, one which neglects the rights and obligations of women and men and the rights and **welfare** of children.

* They have completely ignored clause 114 which allows an appeal to a court before proceedings commence so that she may bring about an injunction for physical protection, mental protection or **welfare** protection for herself or the family.

* The first principle to be applied by the courts will be: 
the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their **welfare**.

* Likewise, the **welfare** of the family depends on that relationship and not simply on the law.

* The future of the children of a broken marriage needs consideration by the best possible tribunal assisted by the skills of **welfare** officers and other counselling staff wherever needed.

* Fault should rightly be removed from the basis of divorce proceedings, but it is impossible for the court not to consider needs and **welfare** without it.

* The new examination of fault is to evaluate the future **welfare** and concern of all members of the family.

* This Bill outlines the principles of the family court- not the old court which was highly legalistic and argumentativebased on reasonableness, discussion and **welfare** principles, and takes into consideration the needs of each member of the family and their capacity to contribute to continuing **welfare** outside that existing marital relationship.

* It is only when we consider the needs of people rather than the legalistic rights of people, and base those rights on needs and contribution, that we can say we are preserving marriage, not as an outmoded institution but as a family unit of **welfare** which will lead to a better and stronger nation.

* I am sure that everyone in the House has listened very carefully to, and is in agreement with, the sentiments expressed by my friend the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant)  and others about the concern of honourable members on both sides of this House for the **welfare** and well-being of ex-servicemen.

* As a community we have an obligation to look after, wherever it can be done and needs to be done, the **welfare** of exservicemen and of their families.

* Is he aware of the rising resentment amongst the staff of Parliament House at all levels at the callous disregard of their personal **welfare** shown by his handling of the hours of meeting?

* In 1963 the total cost of all expenditures under the Social **Welfare** Act was $590m.

* In other words, the increases in this Bill, for all practical purposes, equal the entire cost of the pension program as recently as 7 years ago and the entire cost of all Social **Welfare** Act benefits as recently as 12 years ago.

* Secondly and more uncomfortably, the sheer scale of the finance involved again serves to remind us that social security accounts for such a large proportion of Commonwealth expenditure and the growth of social **welfare** expenditure represents such a large proportion of growth overall that it is impossible to ignore social **welfare** as an aspect of the more general economic debate in which the Parliament is involved.

* I believe that this social **welfare** debate provides a useful and appropriate occasion to take the matter at least one small stage further.

* We should ask ourselves, for a start, whether social **welfare** programs have any role to play as part of the general case for wage restraint.

* The response to the measures taken in the **welfare** area has been overwhelmingly good.

* I wonder where the additional revenue is coming from- the sort of revenue that allows them to provide an extra $50m for **welfare** housing, a 24 per cent increase in funds for youth and community services, a 34 per cent increase in other **welfare** areas and a 55 per cent increase for pre-schools.

* Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition talked about annuities for low income farmers, which I presume are **welfare** handouts for low income farmers.

* It is a **welfare** type approach to rural policy.

* According to Labor, more money should be spent on education, regional development, health, **welfare**, the States, and a hundred relatively smaller items.

* In the area of social **welfare** nearly $9,000m is being paid.

* The list of responsibilities of the shire are planning roads, sewerage, drainage, pre-school and infant **welfare**, libraries, social services and recreation.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* I suggest that it has been a serious defect, which persisted until this Government came into office, that there has been a total absence of monitoring the evaluation of the progress of various types of programs in the field of **welfare**.

* I think honourable members would recognise from what I have said in this House from time to time that this Government has been developing systems of monitoring an evaluation of many of its **welfare** programs and intends to expand this activity to a comprehensive stage.

* The means test as we know it would, ipso facto, disappear and a very limited **welfare** fund would exist for cases for dire emergency where a new and much more stringent means test would apply.

* Whilst one is critical of the **welfare** aspect of the Budget in particular, it is more important to see the way that the Leader of the Opposition has approached the economy as a whole.

* The Minister will recall that in Townsville we have formed a sporting association for Aboriginals known as the All Blacks **Welfare** and Sporting Association.

* There is increased social security and **welfare** spending.

* This principle was supported by Professor Henderson's Commission of Inquiry into Poverty and by the Priorities Review StaiT report on social **welfare** policy.

* Specific documented cases can be produced by local general practitioners, church organisations, community **welfare** groups, the Royal District Nursing Service and the East Bentleigh police concerning emotional difficulties, suicide, chronic illness, psychiatric disorders, mental retardation, alcoholism, drug abuse, marital disruption, one-parent families, physical handicap, school drop-outs, juvenile delinquency, preventable criminal behaviour and multiple psycho-social economic and family problems associated with many common physical ailments, whose needs are not being met by the existing general practitioner service or by the public or voluntary community agencies.

* We will get 6 doctors on a feeforservice basis and they will share the functions of family counselling, emergency treatment, immunisation and infant **welfare**.

* This will break new ground in the field of social **welfare** in Australia.

* These new nursing home and domiciliary care benefits, taken together with the other initiatives in the field of social **welfare** announced in the Budget, demonstrate the determination of the Government to correct imbalances of opportunity within the community and to assist those who need it to receive health care and comfort without loss of dignity or independence.

* I present the following paper: 
Since coming to office this Government has certainly provided substantial assistance to those in need, including those seeking **welfare** housing.

* We continue to provide substantial assistance for those in need of **welfare** housing.

* Whilst it is true that no government would be foolish enough to claim that it is not guilty of mistakes, on the other hand it is absolutely true that we are a trading country which for its economic health is interdependent on the **welfare** of other nations.

* It has been able to maintain payments also to those in receipt of social **welfare** benefits at a rate ahead of the cost of living.

* The major components of the programme were $500,000 a year for housekeeper and home help services, $500,000 a year for **welfare** officers' salaries and approved capital expenditure in senior citizens centre, and $250,000 for paramedical services to aged persons in their own homes.

* Another advantage of the State-run institutions is that they provide the sort of ancillary services - physiotherapy, occupational therapy and so on - which are essential to any chance of rehabilitation and to the **welfare** of the aged if they are to live a reasonably happy life in the evening of their days.

* It is the same crude, insensitive, brutal materialism that characterises the Liberal Party in every sing'e one of its social **welfare** policies.

* That emphasis was towards the establishment of a government which was representative of the people and which took responsibility for the growth of the people and the **welfare** of its citizens.

* There was, however, some criticism of the report to the effect that it had concentrated on the educational aspects of pre-school services and had neglected to deal with adequate provision for **welfare** or custodial-type day care.

* In the Budget Speech the Treasurer proudly said that since coming to office the Government had taken a great stride forward in the field of social security and **welfare** and that now it must take stock of its progress and consolidate its gains.

* The suggestion I have made no doubt will conflict with the ambition of the Government to create a **welfare** State where the majority of the people are dependent on handouts from a socialist government.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) its breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.'

* This is surely a magnificant contribution to this sector of the social **welfare** field.

* These 2 Bills will be of great benefit to aged people right across Australia and clearly spell out the Government's regard and concern for the **welfare** of the aged.

* Under these arrangements, the **Welfare** and Social Services Branch (comprising nine officers) of the Government and Social Affairs Division of the former Department of the Interior was the only branch of that department to become part of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

* The estimated expenditure from the national **welfare** fund for this year is $423m.

* Providing the State governments act with responsibility within the framework of the federalism policy there is no reason to believe that there will be any reduction in the level of **welfare** officer and home care services.

* We are now, as I have argued, on the threshhold of being threatened with a new colonialism, and the immense resources of the sea should not go to the strong; they should go to the corporate **welfare** of humanity.

* That is why I believe that this Parliament, if it seeks to assert sovereignty and to settle the matter, is contributing to that extent, to the common **welfare** of mankind.

* The care of the sick and the aged, and the protection of the **welfare** of the needy in the community, is becoming a difficult and extremely complex task.

* I plead once again with people who, for one reason or another, are deriving social **welfare** benefits unlawfully, to think carefully of those elderly people who are living in what could only be termed shocking conditions.

* They enjoy their television and their radio, but the zoom of jets flying overhead has practically destroyed their health and **welfare** and the enjoyment they obtain in their old age from such things as television and radio.

* I should like to thank the many folk who campaigned so resolutely to have the seat of Cook returned to the Liberal Party, not merely as part of the Fraser coalition team, but to support the principles, platform and policies of the Liberal Party of Australia which we have seen from the elections in December are clearly regarded by the vast majority of Australians as the only way to safeguard the future **welfare** of all Australians.

* Who among us hi this Parliament has not been exposed as a daily event to the work and interests of community groups concerned with the **welfare** of the less fortunate or the less able?

* In his Speech, the Governor-General on 17 February said: 
It is believed by the Government that voluntary **welfare** organisations are a critically important part of the Australian **welfare** system.

* I turn now to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** entitled  Drug problems in Australia- an intoxicated society?

* The have encouraged members of Parliament to go out amongst the forces and to attend exercises to show to the Australian community that members of the Government- I know that members of the Opposition have done this also- are vitally interested in the **welfare** of the Services.

* National Catholic **Welfare** Committee of Australia $100,000 a year from 1 April 1973.

* Soil and water are ultimate resources on which much of the nation's economic activity and **welfare** depend.

* The losses caused by soil erosion are: Firstly, to the land itself; secondly, to other lands; thirdly, to public utilities and public authorities; and fourthly, to the national economy and the **welfare** of the community as a whole.

* Its thin veneer of concern for the **welfare** of the Australian people has been readily exposed by the honourable member for Herbert  (Mr Bonnett)  who is the shadow Minister for Housing, and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch).

* How does this measure up to the needs of Australian housing and our traditions of social **welfare**?

* But I pledge the Australian Government to continue to support to the limit of our capacity State efforts to build for **welfare** housing.

* It did seem from the very limited information from the very limited number who were interviewed that a large proportion of those who said they would comply identified themselves as low income earners or people who were in receipt of **welfare** payments in some way, or could be in receipt of **welfare** payments, and who believed that the purpose of the census was to allow the Government to get better information on which to base policies which would be of help and assistance to them.

* None has been so destructive of family security, as contemptuous of family **welfare** or as corrosive of family life.

* By failing to increase or index basic social **welfare** benefits the Budget permits a drastic erosion of payments on which many disadvantaged family units are dependent.

* The same picture emerges when the absence of indexation is applied to other key **welfare** allowances and benefits.

* Western Australia deserves better than this, not on any emotional, much less philanthropic, basis but on the cold hard reality of the State's contribution to Australia's **welfare** and economic development.

* Proportionate to population, Western Australia has contributed far more than its share to the national **welfare**, and this can be illustrated in all basic areas, including migrant absorption, interstate trade and overseas earnings.

* What concerns me is the lack of perspective about the role of public spending in promoting the increased **welfare** of our community as shown in the responses of the Opposition.

* Last year, 1974-75, much of the increase in public spending against the economic cycle was on increased employment benefits, the Regional Employment Development scheme, finance for housing paid through the banks, some $ 150m paid as special advances, an increase in the expenditure on **welfare** housing between 1973-74 and last financial year of $200m, the payment of a loan of more than $400m to the Australian Wool Corporation, and the extra money provided to the States for employment purposes.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* In a period of one month the savings banks loan funds which amount to more than the total made available for **welfare** housing in Australia in any one year.

* That is the thrust of Government policy and in fact that is the thrust which has allowed so many young people, and citizens of all types, to start buying their own homes; to move off the **welfare** list and to be able to afford their own homes.

* They have to fall back on social **welfare** if they can get it.

* Funds for **welfare** migrant facilities and **welfare** rights services have been reduced by 12 per cent in real terms from a miserable $800,000 last year to an even more miserable $750,000 this year.

* We urge the Government to grant extensive government assistance to migrants in housing and **welfare** areas.

* If we had allowed the situation to go on unchanged, the cost of universal health insurance would rapidly have consumed the social **welfare** dollar in this country.

* The lesson to be learnt from any universal health insurance system around the world is that unless there are proper inbuilt cost constraint mechanisms- I know that the honourable member for Oxley agrees with this- clearly the cost will get completely out of hand and will consume the social **welfare** dollar.

* Significantly, the productive sector has to be encouraged if any government is to be able to implement its social educational **welfare** policies.

* It is no use the Labor Party saying: 'We can withdraw all those now and leave the rural industry to look after itself, thinking that by so doing if things again fall into a state of decline it will be able to introduce **welfare** policies and thereby re-establish prosperity.

* The Fraser Government inherited chaos stemming from the old **welfare** state paternalism with handouts for all regardless of need and regardless of cost to the taxpayer.

* Social **welfare** payments depend largely on the well-being of that sector.

* Of course we would like to see more money going into all sorts of areas- education, local government, roads, social **welfare** and soon.

* Social security and **welfare** spending will increase by 12.7 per cent in 1977- 78 following an increase of 27 per cent last year.

* That this House views with concern the failure of the Government to take action to restrict the effect of inflation on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving **welfare** payments and believes the Government should take urgent action to ensure that these people are not adversely prejudiced by its economic mismanagement.

* They have a feeling that they are making decisions in relation to their own **welfare** and community.

* Further widening of access to the concession would raise issues of social **welfare** policy and, in so doing, prompt the question whether the sales tax law is the proper channel for providing social **welfare** benefits.

* What is probably the most current and authoritative body of information is the report of the Secretary of Health, Education and **Welfare** issued on 3 1st January 1971.

* The enormous increase in expenditure shown in the trust accounts is equal to one-third of the amount made available as grants to the States for **welfare** purposes.

* I firmly believe that a royal commission should be established to inquire into the whole area of Aboriginal **welfare** and administration.

* This is the procedure allegedly adopted on environmental matters, on **welfare** matters and on matters concerning the trade union movement.

* Millions of Australians now rely on the life insurance industry for their long-term security and the **welfare** of their families.

* I instance for example the Jewish Family **Welfare** organisation in Melbourne, which has been interesting itself in this field, but lately this matter has taken on a new dimension by reason of the pioneering work done by Alderman Joan Pilone and the City Council in Sydney in the establishment of the Beehive Industries.

* I gratefully acknowledge the lead that has been given in this field by such activities as those of the Jewish **Welfare** organisation in Melbourne and particularly of course the initiative shown by Beehive Industries in Sydney.

* Now, as then, the honourable member and those who sit behind him show a complete disinterest in the reports on conditions in government and Catholic schools which have been prepared by bodies such as the Inner Suburban Education Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**, various organisations of teachers and parents, the migrant education task force and the Interim Schools Commission itself.

* Everywhere I go I find local government people speaking with excitement and enthusiasm about the functions such as social **welfare**, health care, conservation and the development of leisure facilities, which they can perform so much better than either the Australian Government or the State governments.

* Particular regard is given to the **welfare** of the Australian fishing industry in the assessment of proposals for foreign access to the Australian Fishing Zone.

* It is a general popular error to Imagine the loudest complaint's for the public to be the most anxious for its **welfare**.

* I agree with previous speakers that **welfare** workers should accompany these voluntary workers and that the needs of these people should be catered for in other areas additional to the need for a meal.

* We note that since the beginning of this session he has introduced 3 most important social **welfare** Bills.

* Prime Minister McMahon's high opinion of  Dr Coombs  was shown by the fact that under him there was the first considerable increase in the appropriations for Aboriginal **welfare**.

* So that component of funding is quite irrelevant to their **welfare**.

* He indicated further that there had been some problem in the sense that the Government, since it had taken office, was not showing the interest he would have expected in matters associated with the **welfare** of those using postal and telecommunication facilities in his electorate.

* But I will give the honourable member this assurance: The Director in Queensland is a first class public servant, interested in the **welfare** of Nambour and other places.

* It is concerned with the **welfare** of people and with keeping our cities as attractive and exciting places in which people can live, not stunning them into concrete jungles.

* We increased the expenditure on **welfare** housing from $167m in the last year of the McMahon Government to $365m for this financial year.

* It will come from the cancellation of various **welfare** programs, the deferring of the pension increases, the introduction of subsidies to rich farmers, the tax allowances to increase company profits, the inconsistent behaviour in relation to the money supply and the haste to get out of public participation in development and exploitation of our mineral and energy resources.

* Some of the members of the Commission have been chosen from various professional disciplines so that a wide range of professional expertise and experience could be brought to bear in considering social **welfare** policy.

* At the same time, the Government is concerned to ensure that the ordinary man or woman who may be a user of **welfare** services, or dependent on pensions or other income support programmes, would also have a voice in the development of **welfare** policy.

* There is a growing surge of interest in consumer participation in the planning and provision of **welfare** services throughout the world.

* The Government considered it more appropriate to invite the ACTU to nominate a member of the Commission, since union membership includes a great many potential or current consumers of **welfare** services.

* There are few aspects of our environment, our culture or our **welfare** which can be adequately tackled without involving local government.

* In particular, modern societies require that a great deal of work hi the social **welfare** field be carried out by local authorities.

* I was able to obtain from Cabinet issues of principles and definitions of objectives relevant to options available for future **welfare** housing in the States.

* We have many industries 'that are very capable of producing satisfactory products which are essential to the health and **welfare** of this .country.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry, into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* I also reinforce the point that this Minister and this Government are interested in both the **welfare** housing and private housing sectors.

* We are determined to see that in the course of this Liberal-National Country Party Government and the next one, that the percentage of people who can get into a position of home ownership increases dramatically and that the benefits to be obtained from **welfare** housing programs go to those people in the greatest need.

* Those State Ministers do themselves, their State and their country a disservice by their supercilious, and callous statements of disregard of the nation's **welfare**.

* Gone are the extravagancies of the Labor Administration; rapidly disappearing over the horizon, thank goodness, is the handout mentality associated with the socialist philosophy of the **welfare** state.

* Lone fathers and their children have been discriminated against in **welfare** legislation for many years by all governments.

* This prejudice is reflected in the way **welfare** benefits are provided automatically for fatherless families but not for motherless families.

* But there is no question that improved income support, improved domiciliary care, improved child minding facilities and a more equitable disbursement of **welfare** funds between lone fathers and lone mothers would go a long way towards relieving some of the pressures on these families.

* I implore the Government to take decisive action in this area of **welfare** as soon as possible.

* Because I work in a capital city electorate I have many constituents with problems in the area of social **welfare**.

* As the spokesman for the Opposition on matters relating to health and **welfare**, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Ohipp),  and members of the Opposition want to sit for a further week and thereafter.

* Secondly, it must allow Australia to satisfy other national objectives such as **welfare** and quantitative advancement of our national life.

* Under present arrangements child **welfare**,, broadly speaking, is a function pf the States rather than of the Commonwealth.

* It takes the Commonwealth into a new area of **welfare** work but its purpose is to enable churches and voluntary organisations to improve and expand a service which they have been providing for many years.

* The **welfare** of unmarried mothers who continue to care for their children is traditionally  a  matter for State Governments.

* The whole problem must be related to the Government's proposals to take account of the fact that invention is a very important contributing factor to overall **welfare**.

* When we get an opportunity to correct the matter that he will consult those of us interested in the public **welfare** and in the Parliament.

* They are often utilised and varied for causes of social justice and **welfare**, but they are pre-eminent.

* The degrees of difficulty have to be borne in mind against 2 principles which ought to motivate a Budget analysis: What are the **welfare** provisions in it and what are the attitudes within that Budget to the position of human capital?

* The Leader of the Opposition spent very little time dealing with the **welfare** provisions in this Budget, and well he might because within those economic constructions the **welfare** provisions have been real; they have  Men  generous and they have been just.

* The attitudes to family **welfare**, almost not mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, in view of his adoption of a new, strange family code at Launceston, are well understood.

* But the attitudes to family **welfare** are also real in this Budget.

* I have indicated that two of the **welfare** aspects of a Budget are its attitude to social **welfare** and its attitude to human capital.

* It is designed basically to restore the pool of wealth from which this nation can pay its **welfare**, from which it can pay for all the things that it should be doing in the total **welfare** area.

* The simple proposition is that if we do not have an economy that is in fact stimulated, an economy that is working hard, an economy that is producing revenue and gross domestic product, we do not have the surpluses available to put back into **welfare**.

* It is not simply a question of saying 'too much of the cake is going to the business sector, let us put some into **welfare**'.

* As I see it the problem we now face is how to make certain that we replenish the pool with funds so that we can in fact go ahead with many of the **welfare** initiatives that I believe were quite properly supported by the Labor Government.

* My complaint with those **welfare** initiatives is that the Labor Government endeavoured to pay for them with non-existent money.

* My complaint is that the Labor Government destroyed our capacity to pay for those **welfare** initiatives.

* Having built up the expectations of the people of Australia those initiatives must now be deferred until we can restore the wealth of society- the wealth of this nation- sufficiently to be able to pay for those **welfare** projects.

* It will lead us to a far better economy and a far better nation- a nation that can afford more and more **welfare** that is real rather than illusory.

* But are not the rights involved in the provision of **welfare** services just as powerful in their demands for adequate financing as are the rights of the people who command and operate our defence Services?

* In the field of social **welfare** spokesmen for the Government continually assert that its **welfare** policies are based on the formula of first assisting those most in need.

* At every opportunity the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  and his predecessor have always claimed that the Government's **welfare** policies are based on the premise - I repeat it - of assisting those most in need.

* It certainly appears to be a callous rejection of the **welfare** of a section of the population who have been written off as useless because they are no longer productive.

* The Government has reversed the election promise to reduce taxation; it has ignored the pledge to pay special attention to the chronically ill; it has sabotaged the undertaking to establish a national system of kindergarten child minding" centres; it has failed in its social **welfare** programme to make adequate provision for those most in need; it has forgotten its indication to act on the report of the nation-wide survey on education.

* For instance, in Canada classes for language instruction and courses in civic affairs have mushroomed and are conducted under various auspices, such as provincial departments of education, local school boards, service clubs, churches, **welfare** agencies, universities and ethnic groups.

* Suffice it to say that a critical area of social **welfare** has now been comprehensively examined and flowing from that examination decisive actions have been taken accordingly by a decisive Government.

* This is an area of social **welfare** that has needed attention and it has now received that attention.

* They are, firstly, to accelerate progress towards economic self-reliance; secondly, to accelerate indigenous involvement, that is, involvement by local or native people, in employment, management and ownership; and thirdly, to raise the standards of **welfare** of the local people.

* He made this very true statement: 
In supporting the legislation that is now before the House, 1 would like to congratulate the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  for introducing another social **welfare** measure.

* The Minister has emphasised that social **welfare** is not merely the handing of services to people.

* It was intended that the meeting would discuss the question: Do we need a health, education and **welfare** authority in the Australian Capital Territory?

* After the discussion was over, the point was made that a number of the participants in the audience were public servants and the fact that they were public servants had hindered and made it difficult for them to participate in discussion on the subject of health, education and **welfare**.

* In the short time available to me I want to refer to the dishonest approach that has been adopted by the Queensland Government in respect of the amount of funds available to it this year for **welfare** housing in Queensland.

* The Queensland Government on this occasion this year has also complained that it has not received the same amount of money that it requested for **welfare** housing.

* It asked for a sum vastly greater than that allocated by the Australian Government and complained that Queensland's position in the field of **welfare** housing in comparison with that of South Australia was such that it was being unfairly treated.

* It is interesting to see the statistics and to compare the effort made by South Australia in the field of low cost **welfare** housing over a great number of years.

* In Queensland in 1972-73 the total number of dwellings in the **welfare** housing field that were completed, under the arrangements of the State housing authority and the home builders account, was 1973.

* In that year South Australia completed almost three times the number of houses in the low income **welfare** housing area than Queensland did.

* However I doubt that the Queensland Government could live up to its claim that it will complete in the vicinity of $80m worth of housing in the **welfare** housing field this year.

* The Queensland Government has received a very fair deal in **welfare** housing from this Government.

* Advances for **welfare** housing for Queensland per head of population have increased under this Government from $8, when this Government took office, to over $15 in this Budget.

* Let us look at the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* -On 18 February 1973 the proposed establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission was announced by the then Minister for Social Security.

* I gave the justification for that in the following words: 'It would be self-defeating if the system of wage indexation were to attempt to insulate the community from tax measures designed to redistribute resources for the benefit of the community in the form of improved public facilities in fields such as education, health, **welfare**, personal benefits, urban improvement and so on.

* I advocate that we should have an Australian taxation foundation such as already exists in Canada, a body of people outside our Taxation Branch who are knowledgeable in this field - lawyers, accountants and people in business - and who are interested in this field which is vital to the **welfare** of our nation and vital to our level of economic activity.

* I draw the attention of the House to the Institute of Economic and Social **Welfare** which has been set up in the United Kingdom and subsidised by that Government.

* As I understand it, it was not so long ago that the Minister for Social Services - [ would pray that he would correct me if I am wrong - endeavoured to prevail upon Cabinet and the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  to increase social **welfare** benefits.

* But the Government that sits in this place, and which is supposed to look after the aged and the **welfare** of the community, had to wait almost 20 years before it recognised that these organisations were doing a very good job.

* Every other citizen is entitled to an age pension, to a family allowance, to unemployment benefit and to the full range of Australian social **welfare** benefits; but that is not the case for those Australian citizens who are unfortunate enough to live on Norfolk Island.

* The merest concession to the islanders' **welfare** has been made by the Government.

* If the Government has the **welfare** of the people of Norfolk Island in mind, it will accept the Opposition's amendment.

* the Government is going to consult with any Aboriginal communities which might be affected by such mining activities so that their **welfare** will be taken into account when applications for exploration and mining development rights are being considered.

* This will allow a very big advance in Aboriginal **welfare** in all the fields in which it has been assisted in the past.

* The provision of these funds will permit more assistance to be given to the States to provide housing, health, education, employment, **welfare** and community services for Aborigines.

* But the present interim committee includes people who are interested in social **welfare** work, people from every State who are virtually working in close consultation with the various State departments.

* There is payable, during the year that commenced on the first day of July, 1970, to each State, for the purpose of financial assistance in connexion with the **welfare** and advancement (including housing), of the Aboriginal people of Australia living in that State, amounts not exceeding in the whole the amount specified in the First Schedule to this Act opposite to the name of that State.

* After the amount of $4,800,000 is used for housing, as specified in the Bill, the balance is to be used for other **welfare** or advancement of the Aboriginal people.

* There can be no doubt that although this would become a ghastly situation in the economy and although the dose of medicine would be very intense, it would be absolutely vital to the **welfare** of the economy that the medicine be taken.

* However, what consistently worries us is that in many areas there is a clear need as a matter of very high priority for this and other forms of community **welfare** services which, for a number of social, cultural and economic reasons do not get developed; that is, the initiatives regrettably are not taken up.

* What I am worried about is his **welfare**.

* All we have said is that there are clear areas of public need in Australia in health, hospital and **welfare** services.

* I am therefore pleased that  Dr Sax  has been transferred to head the new Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat.

* I believe very strongly that there is an overlap between the fields of health and **welfare**.

* We can often push costs away from health but all we are doing is pushing them on to **welfare**.

* It is futile to believe that only one side of this House has concern for the **welfare** and well-being of those Australian residents who have come to live here permanently from overseas.

* These guys work their hearts out for the **welfare** of migrants.

* My approval is subject to a special condition that the project organisers and staff shall closely co-operate with New South Wales health and **welfare** authorities and officers in relation to the operation of this project.

* They are much more concerned with pre-schools and social **welfare**, providing sufficient public open spaces and sports ground and community recreation facilities generally.

* The Government has a policy concerning the **welfare** of handicapped children but it is not always able to implement it.

* many of Australia's newspapers ran sensational stories about young and healthy 'dole dollies' who collect numerous **welfare** cheques under a variety of assumed names and pool the proceeds to live in splendour along Australia's gold coast or used their dole money to maintain comfortable existences as surf bums.

* and (2) It is generally accepted by pensioners and all concerned with their **welfare** that a surviving spouse needs more than half the pension income available to a married pensioner couple to maintain an equal living standard.

* The main emphasis of the debate falls on the domestic issues of the economy, namely, health, housing, primary industry, education and social **welfare**.

* For the purpose of expedience he chose to muddy the policies of the Australian Labor Party on health and social **welfare** rather than to debate the alternatives.

* Each State has a public and professional education program, a research program and several States have a patient **welfare** program.

* National cancer control has been seriously inhibited by lack of funds for basic research, for the application of research knowledge to the practical management of cancer, for public education and for patient **welfare**.

* The honourable member, who has just resumed his seat, omitted to mention the fact that the truly remarkable achievement of the Minister, and the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  who has worked so closely with him in matters of urban affairs, was to bring about that deathbed repentance of the previous Government over the **welfare** of the cities of this country of which the National Urban and Regional Development Authority was the first and only expression.

* Inadequate education, health care, social **welfare** and law enforcement as well as a deteriorating physical environment are the price of our having chosen to move so far so fast within such narrow confines.

* Resources should be redirected to making good the shortcomings of our own society and increasing our assistance to neighbouring countries in the reasonable certainty that if Armageddon comes it will be for reasons other than ovr failure to sustain a 2 per cent per annum rate of population browth 
The position of Interpreter- Receptionist, North West One Stop **Welfare** Centre, Coburg, Melbourne.

* It should remind us that other matters besides our economic health are important to our **welfare** and can be forgotten only at our own peril.

* Immigration is the second major component of population growth and it is here that the rate of growth should be regulated to allow the maximum **welfare** of the present community and those who make their homes here.

* We live today in a time when the public looks more and more to local government for increased services, particularly in the field of **welfare**.

* This Government is looking to greater community involvement in the implementation of its social **welfare** programs by seeking the participation of councils in the decision making process at the local level.

* This access to grants from the Grants Commission will go far in assisting local councils in lesser privileged areas more effectively to provide municipal, health and **welfare** services for their communities.

* I would hope that the Australian Assistance Plan or some other agency of this **welfare** Government would look into this problem which by no means is confined to the country.

* There will be no opposition to this Bill going through the House because there is a definite need for finance for the States to proceed with their plans for **welfare** housing.

* As I said earlier, the Opposition does not want to inconvenience the States any further with their **welfare** housing problem, and we support the Bill before the House.

* No doubt the Government brought these measures down because, with inflation raging as it is, it is essential that some assistance be given immediately in the 3 fields of social **welfare** which these 3 Bills cover.

* I should say that there would not be a shire councillor or alderman who would not desire to participate in this field of social **welfare**.

* I can well remember a former honourable member for Barton, the late  Dr H.  V. Evatt, during the election campaigns in 1954 and 1955 talking about the need for Australians to spend vast sums of money on social **welfare** and decrying the standards of education in the community.

* That the Labor Party Government set out to do, and the impact upon the Australian economy and upon the **welfare** of the people in Australia was inevitable.

* I can assure honourable members from experience of years ago that this sort of threat to trade lines has a vital effect on **welfare** of the nation.

* I do not think that there is any room for doubt that the Government sees aid as a contribution by the Australian people to the **welfare** of our less fortunate neighbours and that this is the way in which the people of this country want to see it.

* In fact the speech gave some very important guide lines as to the objectives of the new Agency, such as ensuring greater attention to the **welfare** and distributive effects of our aid, in improved evaluation of our aid programs, in bringing greater expertise into our staffing arrangements and in more directly associating the community with the programs.

* We do have an interest which is related to a need to maintain stability in the world and a common concern about humanitarian matters like the **welfare** of people and the wish to avoid war and turmoil as much as we can.

* I am moved to suggest that the honourable member was giving a diatribe, not on the Schedule but on some strange philosophical attitude that he has to the issue of **welfare** housing.

* The point of this legislation which the Opposition has refused to acknowledge, and which during the course of this debate, it has consistently contested, is that the legislation introduced by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development  (Mr Groom)  in this session provides for the most flexible, the most logical and the most innovative approach to **welfare** housing that this Parliament has ever seen.

* That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the House debating the present problem of nursing home benefits and the Opposition policies on social **welfare**.

* the relationship between programs for the aged and the infirm and other health and **welfare** programs.

* Although from time to time we have new statements and new government offensives in some direction on Aboriginal **welfare** always there later comes the shock.

* But for reasons which had nothing to do with Aboriginal **welfare** when there was a change of Prime Minister, a new, ingratiating attitude was taken towards the Government of Queensland with this egregious failure as its record and it has been left in immunity.

* The Budget is aimed at goals of importance to all Australians - growth and development; the adequate defence of our nation; the fostering of industry; the expansion of educational opportunity; and the continued betterment and extension of our social **welfare** system.

* In the difficult process of determining spending priorities, our **welfare** programme shows how highly we regard the need to achieve an equitable distribution to upgrade the living standards of those who most need it.

* We believe that much more needs to be spent on social **welfare**, Aboriginal **welfare**, education and other important fields.

* My view is that State aid should be for the **welfare** of the State and for all the people in it.

* Unless we can throw off the crushing burden of rural industry, led to bankruptcy and bewilderment by this Government, we can never really afford the urgent measures so desperately needed in the fields of social **welfare**, Aboriginal **welfare**, education and all the rest.

* -This Bill, which gives effect to the budgetary initiatives in the **welfare** field, continues the principle which this Government has enunciated since taking office, that is, that **welfare** should be based on need.

* Members of the Opposition often accuse this Government- indeed all Liberal-Country Party governments- of neglecting the **welfare** aspects of governmental responsibility.

* This does not mean that the ideal **welfare** goal has yet been achieved.

* For that reason, I support the thrust of this Government's policy to implement its **welfare** programs according to a 'needs' rather than a 'rights' basis.

* I believe that the family allowances scheme, which was introduced earlier this year, provides for the most massive redistribution of income in our recent **welfare** history.

* In October 1975, the Liberal and National Country Parties' **welfare** policy stated the need for 'protecting benefits from erosion by inflation through automatically adjusting benefit levels every 6 months, according to movements in the consumer price index'.

* This question of pensioner tax liability is one of the lesser known and unfortunate aspects of the previous Labor Government's **welfare** policy.

* The  President  of the Australian Pensioners League in Western Australia was quoted recently in the Press as having said: 
1 ) Who is conducting the research into community **welfare** needs in the Mount Morgan area.

* For instance, social security and social **welfare** programs may best be administered by local government instead of by the Federal Government or a State government; it may well be that programs conducted by State or local government could best be conducted federally.

* A particular fantasy relates- and it should be seen in this context- to the fact that the Government is endeavouring to divert **welfare** to the needy.

* That is a curious concept to the honourable gentlemen opposite who felt that **welfare** was something you bought votes with rather than looked after people with.

* We do not have as our basic god, as our basic gaol, the purchasing of votes through the **welfare** system which was the sole motivation in assisting the middle class twoincome family at the expense of the worker in this kind of situation.

* I also asked the Union whether it would favour a situation in which the needy benefited from **welfare** payments and whether **welfare** should be redirected to the needy.

* I simply suggest to the House that the attitude held by this group of people, many of whom may well be very dedicated and may well be very good pre-school and day care teachers, that **welfare** is a bottomless pit to be sucked dry is one which cannot be allowed to persist.

* Taxes pay for **welfare**.

* What is required is a clear statement of the extent to which the Government sees these services as being instruments of **welfare** and decentralisation and to what extent it sees them as being business undertakings.

* There needs to be a greater degree of consultation and a greater degree of flexibility in the way in which it administers its social **welfare** responsibilities.

* It is amazing to hear cases of people who have endured so much hardship for so long simply because they did not know that some **welfare** assistance was available to them from the Government.

* I do not share his optimism about the Government's actions in the field of health and **welfare** services.

* They need a **welfare** officer to deal with the **welfare** cases in that area.

* At the same time they spoke about introducing a national superannuation scheme for social **welfare** benefits.

* the honourable member for the interjection, 
The executive members of the Manly- Warringah Social **Welfare** Co-ordinating Committee and the organizations they represent are as follows: 
I speak now on completely non-party lines when I say to the present Minister for Defence and to the Prime Minister that we of the Opposition can see the need for such a joint party committee of investigation.

* The Regular Defence  Forces  **Welfare** Association can see it.

* The so-called mini Budget has been presented to the man in the street as some great advance in **welfare**.

* The package presented to the wage earnerthe plus items of wage indexation and increased endowment, combined with the minus of the Medibank levy and the loss of deductibility for children- was presented as a 'sensible policy' that would add to his, the wage earner's, **welfare**.

* This legislation is one of those fundamental changes in the structure of our social **welfare** system which cannot be lightly accepted.

* The first and most important is the **welfare** and wellbeing of the men, women and children of Australia in the future who are going to be entitled to the benefits which this Bill is designed to provide.

* Be that as it may, legal aid must now be seen as an integral part of Australia 's social **welfare** program.

* In a situation where the assistance which is provided by the legal profession itself and the particular State governments are inadequate, and law as a social tool continues to remain unavailable to a whole segment of society, it becomes the obligation of the Federal Government under its social **welfare** program to step in.

* There shall be a representative of the Attorney-General, 2 private lawyers and a number of other people involved in legal aid and **welfare** work.

* Inflation, in essence, reduces the national **welfare**.

* The increased social **welfare** payments and other expanded forms of public assistance undertaken this year will, in large measure, be illusory money increases.

* It is a social **welfare** assistance scheme.

* I would hope that now it has been shown by the Opposition that the Bill is not a compensation Bill but a new social **welfare** Bill the Government will consider the consequences of that and consider how a proper compensation scheme could be developed in this country so as to take away the anomalies and inadequacies of the present approaches to compensation throughout this country.

* So that all told it looks as if the mining industry may have made a contribution to **welfare** during the 5-year period referred to of something to the order of $700m and not, as the Minister has claimed, as if a contribution has been made to the mining industry of $55m.

* The terms of reference of the Task Force directed it to look at ways of co-ordinating **welfare** programs 'having in mind that coordination could be effected at the State and local government level without Commonwealth involvement'.

* The fact is that new ventures in social **welfare** or security, as in housing, higher education or transport, have, ever since the Second World War, always come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor- and the original funding for them has come from the Federal GovernmentLiberal or Labor.

* Already there have been a number of social **welfare** programs amalgamated or transferred to the States by the Fraser Government.

* After consultations with interested groups and a report from the Social **Welfare** Commission recommending its retention, the Minister for Social Security announced on 21 May 1976 that the Government would not continue to fund the program beyond June this year.

* It is perfectly clear that the Fraser Government is obsessively concerned with administrative arrangements and with reducing federal expenditure rather than with providing effective social **welfare** services.

* Overlap and duplication can be eliminated with planning and goodwill, but without a commitment- a sharing- by the Federal Government it is much harder to close the gaps in health and **welfare** services.

* Ever since the Second World War every new initiative in health and **welfare** services in Australia has been taken by the Federal government.

* The organisational structure of meals on wheels services may well be a particularly fine example of government and voluntary aid combining to provide an effective and extensive social **welfare** benefit.

* The third provision in the State Grants Home Care Bill concerns assistance towards the employment of **welfare** officers.

* Section 10 of the principal Act provides that where a person is employed as a **welfare** officer of a senior citizens centre wholly or mainly in connection with the provision of approved **welfare** services by or in association with the centre, the Australian Government may pay an amount equal to one-half of the **welfare** officer's salary.

* The Minister in his second reading speech said: 
In order further to encourage and assist the provision of the **welfare** services to which I have previously referred the amending Bill increases the Australian Government's subsidy from one-half to two-thirds of the salary paid to appropriate **welfare** officers.

* The Opposition thoroughly supports this legislation but as I said in my speech in response to his statement on the **welfare** commission I do invite the Minister's Department to look at the employment of amateurs in this field.

* The Government realised that there were not enough paid social workers or **welfare** officers to cope with delinquent children and it handpicked with meticulous care adult citizens to act in a capacity of honorary **welfare** officers.

* I have someone fairly close to me who is an cutstanding **welfare** officer.

* In conclusion, the Minister says that he is unhappy about the fragmented arrangement whereby several departments each sponsor **welfare** programs.

* In so doing, this would deprive the pensioners of Australia of increased benefits, because approximately 40 per cent of the money that is gathered from the fuel levy is expended on social **welfare** payments.

* It is my opinion that the taxpayers of Australia are paying far too much personal income tax and for the honourable member for Blaxland to advocate higher taxation, lower pensions and lower social **welfare** payments is absolutely unacceptable.

* The intriguing feature about this is that the Leader of the most centralist Party in its own power distribution in the Anglo-Saxon world - except the Communist Party - would find the occasion appropriate to raise for discussion as a matter of public importance a subject concerning the fate, the existence and the **welfare** of] local government and semigovernment authorities.

* The Party has done no work on this matter until today when, for reasons which have nothing to do with the **welfare** of the people, it has been able to dredge up this matter for discussion.

* That shows the arrogance of the people who do not live and have not lived in State **welfare** housing.

* They have little understanding of the serious problems that exist in **welfare** housing.

* If we are to overcome the serious problems faced in **welfare** housing then the Government itself must make more money available.

* There has been a decrease in the purchasing power of the money that is being made available for **welfare** housing as can be seen by comparing the amounts made available for the year 1974-75 and the amount being made available under this legislation.

* Based on the real value of money today the amount that is being advanced for **welfare** housing is a deplorable situation.

* The serious problems facing **welfare** housing will not be overcome unless this Government makes more money available.

* 1 believe also that the Minister for the Environment, Housing and Community Development should give us the right under clause 15 to debate this issue every year so that we can illustrate the shortcomings that exist in **welfare** housing.

* This Government's priority in respect of all government spending and all public sector spending has been one of cutting back and the area of **welfare** housing is no exception.

* -In past years there has been a continuing growth in Federal legislation aimed at providing an ever widening range of community facilities in health, **welfare**, sport, cultural and recreational areas.

* Sub-clause (c) provides for the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their **welfare**.

* This brings me to the next 2 fundamental provisions of the proposed legislation- Parts VII and VIII relating to the **welfare** and custody of children and to maintenance and property, which are the 2 areas where so much litigation now takes place and Part IV relating to family courts.

* The passage of time and the Standing Orders for debate prevent me from expressing my opinions on each of these matters, but I do want to say something about the **welfare** and custody of children, the family court and the proposed amendment to Parts VII and VIII of the Bill which should be made.

* In proceedings with respect to the custody or guardianship or access to a child of a marriage the Family Court shall, under clause 64, have regard to the **welfare** of the child as of paramount importance.

* The court will take a more active part than under the present law in supervising arrangements for the custody and **welfare** of a child, and a support staff of **welfare** workers will be provided and will be available to the court to assist both the court and the children who are subject to custody orders.

* My continuing worry in relation to the power and operation of the Family Court is to ensure that its decrees and orders, particularly with regard to **welfare** and custody of children and maintenance of property, are observed and that responsibility for compliance with and observation of the court's decrees remain a function of the court itself, or one of its agencies.

* Would it be the end of community **welfare** services that have been developed?

* Would it be a severe excision of expenditure in **welfare** housing?

* I was there as  Chairman  of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs as we were interested in the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people involved.

* It outlines a common task which is achieved only in close partnership with the State, the schools, the parents, the churches, the political parties and all other social organisations serving man and the common **welfare**.

* **Welfare** housing has felt the axe and the allocation for that has been cut from $400m last year to $330m this year.

* However, if one believed that governments should be responsible for the **welfare** of its citizens- all its citizens- and that governments should show the way in job creation programs, in providing health services, education, transport, et cetera, one would agree that this government is a miserable failure.

* It is possible to tackle the big items of health, education and **welfare** in a way that will not do anything to disadvantage the needy but in fact will improve their position- by placing means tests on benefits paid to those who are not needy.

* It exiles a significant minority from the benefits of prosperity though they are placated by **welfare**.

* And, more ominously, it may gradually corrode the basis of prosperity itself 
What sum has been (a) available and (b) granted for (i) home care services, (ii) senior citizens' centres and (iii) **welfare** officers at senior citizens' centres under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 to each of the States in each of the last 2 years.

* I often hear the claims of members of the Opposition that theirs is a party of concern, theirs is the only party that has ever done anything for **welfare** recipients in this country, they are the leaders in all these so-called areas of concern.

* There are grants totalling $500,000 to community **welfare** agencies which are in need of support in providing emergency assistance to members of the community.

* As we have a large percentage of migrant people, this money has been spent correctly by social workers who have been appointed to bodies such as the Italian communities **welfare** committee.

* It is true that I have received an interim report from the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Those matters will require subsequent consideration by the Government following a later report which we expect in the early part of next year from this working party set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Mr Neil expressed concern that the Liberal Party- may have alienated itself from the Greek community because of the mass prosecutions of Greek migrants involved in allegations of social **welfare** fraud.

* Some Greeks thought it strange that immigration officers should be despatched on a mission which appeared to be on behalf of the Liberal party 
1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the construction of a garage for the Newdegate St John Ambulance Association submitted by the Lake Grace Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* Advances by the Australian Government for the States' **welfare** housing programs will not be less than in the previous financial year - 
Our economies are the most prosperous on earth: our technology and productive genius have proven indispensable for all countries seeking to better the **welfare** of their peoples, be they socialist or developing.

* It manifests itself in a denigration of ex-servicemen 's organisation, which have already made their contribution to the **welfare** and development of Australia.

* When one looks at the system of **welfare** payments in this country one might well ask whether that publication should not have been entitled 'Australian Taxpayers Ripped Off.

* Commonwealth expenditure for health, **welfare** and education has risen from 25 per cent 10 years ago to nearly 50 per cent at present.

* If the expenditure on health, **welfare** and education has doubled in the last 10 years, how much further can it go?

* In raising this matter of public importance I call on the Government to take further measures to ensure that those most deserving in the community receive most of the **welfare** dollar and, conversely, those least deserving or not deserving receive less or nothing from the **welfare** dollar.

* Inherent in this proposition is that the proportion of Commonwealth expenditures attributable to **welfare** must be contained and that a more equitable reallocation within the **welfare** appropriation be made.

* Let me remind the House that 10 years ago every 10 workers supported 1% **welfare** recipients.

* Now the same 10 workers support 2% **welfare** recipients.

* Further, the average income earner in Australia is contributing nearly $2,000 a year to **welfare** services- $35 a week from the average income earner's taxes.

* They are, firstly, the whole area of **welfare** abuse and, secondly, the incidence of political strikes and disputes instigated by a small militant minority.

* Why should other more needy people in the community be penalised when single parents are living in de facto relationships, often both being supported by the **welfare** dollar?

* How does the family man earning $212 a week and paying $40 a week in tax react when he sees moving in next door four single people who, by pooling their **welfare** payments, live as well as he does and who do not pay any tax at all?

* Why should not **welfare** abusers be tracked down with the same diligence as tax evaders?

* The **welfare** dollar must be more effectively and efficiently administered.

* The findings ofthe Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare**, which indicate that the **welfare** system is out of hand and largely unaccounted for, must be considered very seriously indeed by this Government.

* It is also looking for equity in the **welfare** system.

* I believe that we must look seriously at the whole area of **welfare** to ensure that the taxpayer's dollar is more efficiently and effectively and equitably used.

* At the same time, we must acknowledge that there are some serious gaps in the delivery of **welfare** services.

* There are many other examples where **welfare** payments, particularly allowances, have not been indexed to account for inflation and remain at the same figure as many years ago.

* At the same time, from my own experience I know of many other instances where **welfare** dollars are being grossly wasted.

* I am, however, calling on the Government to ensure that **welfare** payments are equitable and fair, that those in greatest need receive the greatest benefit.

* I suggest that, if substantial savings are made within the **welfare** appropriations as a result of these and other suggestions, we should seriously consider redistributing those savings to **welfare** recipients in greater need rather than sending them back to the Consolidated Revenue Fund in the Treasury Department.

* I am not castigating those people who receive **welfare** benefits.

* Despite what the Opposition has been saying over recent months, the Government has been interested in the **welfare** of this industry.

* They are talking about the threat from man-made fibres running counter to the **welfare** of the wool industry because we now might be pricing ourselves out of the market.

* If ever there was a member of this Parliament who has the propensity to go from one area to another trying to tell the people in each area what they want to hear, regardless of the **welfare** of the nation and frequently regardless of the interests of the industries he is referring to, the classic example of recent times has been the honourable member for Riverina.

* Government has assaulted the **welfare** and the prosperity of the Australian people.

* If one likes to apply to the dairy industry the principles of social **welfare** which apply in secondary industry it would be seen that the dairy subsidy has been far cheaper than would have been the equivalent social **welfare** payments.

* I wish to confine my remarks to one small section of the estimates for the Department of Social Securityindeed, it accounts for only about 0.2 per cent of the Government's proposed expenditure on social security and **welfare** in this current financial year- and I refer to the Australian assistance plan which, in my opinion, is one of this Government 's most constructive and exciting initiatives.

* The Australian assistance plan was formulated by the Social **Welfare** Commision.

* The basic objective of the plan is to involve people in regional social **welfare** activities and to assist them in the development of integrated patterns of **welfare** services within their community.

* To achieve this aim, the Social **Welfare** Commission, in its Discussion Paper No.

* The regional council was expected to involve representatives of the Australian, State and local governments, trade unions and employer groups, **welfare** consumer groups and non-government bodies associated with social **welfare**.

* All this represented a very substantial break from previous government involvement with social **welfare** because here it was being recommended that residents within a region would determine their own social **welfare** priorities rather than have those priorities determined for them by a remote government.

* They would also be handling and allocating Australian Government funds to meet these **welfare** needs in their community and this was probably an even bigger break with the past.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission recognised these difficulties and recommended that a pilot program be undertaken with one regional council in each State being given administrative finance and also funds for allocation for social **welfare** purposes; the amount of these funds for allocation to be determined on the basis of $2 per person living in the region.

* A government which was not genuinely interested in community involvement or in overcoming the **welfare** deficiencies most acutely concerning the people would not have taken the chances that this plan clearly involves.

* I say this with some feeling because my electorate is in the western suburbs of Melbourne and this region of Melbourne was chosen by the Social **Welfare** Commission as the area in which to have a full scale trial of the plan within Victoria.

* The reasons for choosing this region presumably were that it is a lower income region with pressing needs in all areas of social **welfare** and that in recent years an active group of concerned people had come together within the region to assess the needs of the area, to draw attention to the deprived nature of the region and to press for action to overcome these social deficiencies.

* By the time the Australian Assistance Plan was first mooted in August last year there was therefore already in existence in this region a body which included many persons interested in or working in the social **welfare** area who had already done a lot of work on assessing **welfare** needs in the region and who were willing and eager to become involved in such a plan.

* The members of the general committee covered a wide spectrum of occupations and interests in social **welfare**.

* Once the Council was formed it had then to set about the process of allocating the $700,000 of capitation money to various social **welfare** projects in the region.

* It has been used to extend and initiate Meals on Wheels services, to provide a full-time co-ordinator of social planning for the regional committee on the ageing, to establish community centres, to conduct social research and to assist a variety of migrant, youth and **welfare** groups to maintain and extend their services.

* In summary, it has provided a tremendous fillip to **welfare** services in the region and, importantly, has raised enormously the level of community interest and activity in social **welfare**.

* I should mention also that under the Australian Assistance Plan there is provision for community development officers who will have the principal task of stimulating involvement of people in social **welfare** activities and assisting **welfare** groups in the region.

* But much of this increase, like that on pensions and social **welfare** and education- much more than half of the total- was essential if the poorer members of the community were to be kept up with inflationinflation, I remind honourable members, with which the present Government had nothing to do- and if real standards in education were to be maintained, let alone advanced.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the purchase of a mobile van for use by service groups catering for shows and sporting, civil defence and other functions submitted by the Dumbleyung Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department 
I am aware that Commonwealth legislation does not provide for the payment of pensions to a deserted wife with children before 6 months has elapsed from the time of desertion.

* I am also aware that the New South Wales Department of Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare** relentlessly has opposed the granting of maintenance payments to widows who have received consent orders from a court.

* She is receiving $42 a fortnight from the State **Welfare** Department because of the desertion.

* I appeal to him to do something about the Act in general and to take away from the New South Wales Department of Social **Welfare** the handling of this type of case.

* Pursuant to section 16 of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973 I present the annual report of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* These concerned **welfare** officers, school programs, a special telephone service and expanded facilities for English language teaching.

* Areas like the Central Coast where building booms had taken off were already years behind in basic amenities, such as water, sewerage, roads, drainage, kerbing and guttering, **welfare**, recreational, sporting, health and educational facilities.

* Will he consider moves to assist the industry against this situation which militates against the **welfare** of people employed in the eucalyptus industry in Australia.

* We propose, in addition, to double the Australian Government's present contribution towards the capital cost of senior citizens centres to $2 for every $ 1 contributed by a State Government or local governing body, and we will increase from one-half to two-thirds the Australian Government's contribution towards the salaries of **welfare** officers employed at such centres.

* How are we to deal with those inquiries that must be made by State **welfare** organisations if they are to give relief?

* They will impede the operations of State **welfare** departments.

* I am hoping that we will be able to present evidence of his work before the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**.

* In what way does the extension of the integration services to meet the special needs of migrant children by the provision of bilingual or multi-lingual officers trained in **welfare** work, announced by him as an initiative of his Government, differ from the proposal on the same subject announced by the previous Minister on 31 August 1972.

* Unless there is a government that has a concern for the creation of wealth, this country will not have the resources to meet the **welfare**, the compassionate and the developmental requirements which we all would want to see met.

* Being an electorate primarily of migrants, old people and employees it received great gains under our policies allowing huge increases in pensions, migrant services, housing for the aged and general social **welfare**.

* His present mood and basic attitudes will force people to the streets and he will need a good deal more than a malleable 
In addition, the Government 's continued support for the education and **welfare** of Aborigines and migrants is contributing significantly to combating learning difficulties within those groups.

* These measures illustrate the Government's concern for the **welfare** of the handicapped and the high priority afforded the provision of adequate facilities and care to meet their needs.

* This excellent publication referred, for example, to the following items: School meals; free milk; health services; national cultural activities - in this country they are subject to another department; scientific research and development - again financed separately through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other such bodies; sport; leisure activities; civil education; youth activities; child **welfare**; public libraries: in-service industrial training; basic nursing training; armed Services colleges; rehabilitation and repatriation training; sponsored foreign students - for instance, the entire implications of the Colombo Plan - radio and television, and interest payments on loans used for school buildings.

* The Prime Minister also demonstrated his total disinterest in the **welfare** of Aborigines when he announced that the Government would not insist on sequential development of uranium mines in the Northern Territory.

* The Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam governments all accepted the basic responsibility for the **welfare** of Aboriginals that the 1967 referendum conferred on this Parliament.

* Particularly on the expenditure side we welcome the significantly increased outlays, for instance, upon education, health, **welfare** and urban and regional development.

* Conference believes that the fundamental prerequisite of the co-operation envisaged in this Resolution is full and continuing consultation between the Government and the trade union movement on all matters affecting the level and direction of economic activity and the social **welfare** of the community.

* 1 ) Who are the members of the Task Force that has been set up to examine **welfare** services and community based programs in the health/**welfare**/community development area.

* A government which really believes in the **welfare** of Australia is distributing the income of the nation in the places where it should be distributed.

* Honourable members opposite know that pensioners and people who depend upon social **welfare** schemes in the country and the city and everywhere else today are receiving the benefits they were denied for so long by those who sit opposite.

* One of its main concerns would have been the **welfare** of our communities in the broader sense of the word.

* This meant not only social **welfare** but also the **welfare** of groups of people as ethnic communities, the relationships with children growing away from the heritage of their parents, the children's relationships to their parents and the survival of those groups as entities.

* We envisaged this Institution as being concerned with the **welfare** of communities in that sense.

* So too the Institute of Multicultural Affairs ought to be investigating the community **welfare** needs of immigrants.

* The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to make advances totalling S84.6m to the States for **welfare** housing during the first 6 months of 1973-74.

* The total amount to be advanced to each State in 1973-74 for **welfare** housing purposes, which is yet to be determined, will be the subject of an authorising Bill to be introduced into Parliament during the Budget sittings.

* Four of these settlement hospitals have infant **welfare** clinics.

* In recommending this, I do not detract from the excellent work that has been done by the nursing staffs, by the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration and by everyone connected with the running of these hospitals.

* Now the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  who is the Opposition spokesman on social **welfare**, is saying that we should also have a Medibank levy.

* Members of the Opposition do not have any real interest in the Government's economic programs at the moment which are designed to provide better educational opportunities for the ordinary children in Australia, better **welfare**, better urban development and a better environment.

* Also, the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** is to inquire into all aspects of repatriation.

* I would now like to deal with some of the individual items in the estimates for social **welfare** and repatriation.

* This shows a despicable disregard of the **welfare** of children.

* The Bill should go a long way to assure responsible members of the Public Service that both this Government and, I think, governments in general are concerned for the **welfare** and better management of the Commonwealth Public Service and that they are not about putting down their own employees.

* Clearly, whilst in some areas such as health services, **welfare** services or education, the cultural background of an individual is relevant throughout life, in the case of employment that should not be so.

* Is there a future for many of the innovative programs started during Labor's term of office- programs under the Department of Social Security such as **welfare** rights, the Outreach program, telephone interpreter services and so on?

* The ever increasing casework books of organisations dealing with migrant **welfare** amply illustrate the need for greater funding.

* In other words, despite the increasing clamour from various migrant **welfare** organisations for more funds, for reasons best known to itself the Government has inhibited the Department of Social Security- now it is the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs- from distributing the funds theoretically available for grantsinaid.

* At the outset I certainly want to record the long-time and effective interest which the honourable gentleman has shown in matters of social **welfare** in general and in relation to pensioners in particular.

* I mention only briefly that of course it is the Government's total objective to put value back into the **welfare** dollar and at the same time to recognise that, so far as social **welfare** groups are concerned, the overriding objective in their interest and that of the balance of the Australian community must be firstly to wind down the present rate of inflation.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: the House condemns the Budget because it fails to define adequate economic and social goals for Australia; and in particular because it provides no programme for restoring full employment, no means of checking the costs and prices of goods and land, no framework for improving the standards of education, health, **welfare** and public transport and no national plan for our capital cities and regional centres'.

* Is a small rise in cash **welfare** benefits, with an actual decline in their value, the answer to poverty, indignity and insecurity among the aged, the widowed, the returned men, the sick and the handicapped?

* If the provision of assistance to dairy farmers becomes a matter of choice between **welfare** measures such as unemployment benefits and a floor price for skim milk powder or the alternative, that is, imposing heavy taxes or levies on the viable parts of the industry such as the whole milk sector, then I would hope that the Minister would continue to favour the **welfare** measures rather than rob Peter to pay Paul.

* It may be that some consideration could be given to this work which is more important than, perhaps, some areas of social **welfare** that have been undertaken by this Government.

* Contrary to what Liberal supporters say when they refer to their **welfare** programmes, notably in education, it was the right honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Calwell)  who, as the Leader of the Federal Labor Party in 1966, proposed that per capita grants to independent schools be made on the basis of $30 per annum for primary school students and $40 per annum for secondary school students.

* 1 ) Is he able to say whether the United States of America Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** has launched a campaign to impress upon Medicare and Medicaid recipients the desirability of having a second opinion before surgery.

* The New South Wales Department of Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare** has advised that at the same date State assistance was being paid to 1,257 deserted wives with children.

* The New South Wales Department of Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare** has advised that at the same date State assistance was being paid to 197 wives of prison inmates with children.

* But it could be the most significant legislation under the social **welfare** heading which the Parliament is to deal with in 1970.

* The Speech was silent on very important matters affecting the **welfare** of aged people in our community and, indeed, invalids as well.

* Ministers of justice, judges, criminologists and leading figures in the fields of correction, police, social **welfare** and generally related areas were to be involved.

* It has a legal- in fact, a constitutional- responsibility for immigration and the **welfare** of migrants and their families.

* Its sole concern is with recruiting, vetting or deporting migrants, it has no responsibility for migrant **welfare**, health, education, housing, employment.

* Sydney: Poverty had increased by nearly 30 per cent in Sydney since February, a **welfare** officer said today.

* The **welfare** officer was Reverend Bruce Thorton.

* He also said in the course of his remarks that he has heard a rumour that I had washed my hands of any interest in social **welfare**.

* The Melbourne Centre will employ- 1 Sessional Psychiatrist 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Social Worker (number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load) 1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 **Welfare** Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 1 Liaison Officer 1 Clerical Assistant 2 Typists 1 Labourer 
The proposed staffing for the Sydney Centre includes - 1 Sessional Medical Consultant 1 Sessional Clinical Psychologist 2 Sessional Remedial Teachers 1 Executive Officer 1 Case Work Coordinator (Psychologist)  1 Social Worker (Number of positions will be dependent on the size of the case-load)  1 Senior Vocational Counsellor 1 **Welfare** Officer 1 Workshop Manager 2 Foremen 4 Instructors 1 Storeman 2 Clerical Assistants 1 Typist 1 Labourer 
Some progress in meeting interpreter needs has been achieved through a growing range of services in my Department.

* These include the employment of more than 120 bi-lingual or multi-lingual officers; the recent appointment of 48 specially qualified multi- ' lingual **welfare** officers, including 16 to work in the education field, and the provision of a telephone interpreter service in no fewer than 42 languages in Sydney and Melbourne and soon to be extended to other States.

* I would pay tribute to those non-governmental organisations and enterprises - in particular Good Neighbour Councils, **welfare** organisations throughout the community, national groups, and bank migrant information services - which do provide interpreter services.

* I am informed that the answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) The Government has accepted the recommendation of the Working Party established to examine the question of the distribution of certain functions previously carried out by the former Department of Immigration that a Standing Interdepartmental Committee should be established to ensure a continued, co-ordinated and integrated approach to all matters relating to immigration and the **welfare** of migrants.

* Government policies which influence mortality are posited primarily on the desire to enhance the health, safety and **welfare** of the community and their effect on population growth is incidental.

* This applies both to policies involving government services to the Australian people, such as education or social **welfare**, and to policies in which population is treated as a resource, such as the gearing of manpower to economic development.

* The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to pay the States this year the sum of $3 10m for **welfare** housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement.

* This authority will enable the Treasurer to continue payment to the States for **welfare** housing in the period from 1 July 1975 until an appropriation measure for 1 975-76 is passed by the Parliament.

* Their role is properly in the field of **welfare** housing.

* Some **welfare** housing has been built by the housing commission but there has not been this particular type of low rental housing that the legislation before us provides for.

* Proposed new section 143 A, which is sought to be inserted into the Act, will give to the Governor-General a wide range of powers which may be exercised against unions which take industrial action which has a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of the community.

* The proposed section allows the Minister to apply for a declaration from a full bench of the Commission that industrial action by a union or its members has had, is having or is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of the community.

* I understand that the social **welfare** branch to which he is attached has not had a director for 2 years, so low does this particular area rate.

* The Victorian social **welfare** report of last year discloses the severe overloading of staff working on parole and probation.

* I am informed that State and Territory child **welfare** authorities have stated that 1 96 of the children in question have now been adopted and the adoption of the majority of the remaining children is pending.

* -It is very gratifying to know that some people of that tender age are interested in the **welfare** of this House.

* The training of Aboriginal men and women is the responsibility of the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration within the Department of the Interior.

* One of the functions of the **Welfare** Division is to provide for the **welfare** and advancement of Aborigines in the Northern Territory and to carry out its functions the Division is staffed with experienced and qualified officers.

* Thirdly, social **welfare** should be adequate to enable our physically and mentally retarded, our aged, invalid, sick or widowed people to live in dignity.

* I turn to social **welfare**.

* If effective government geared to the needs of the 1980s and beyond  is  to be achieved ... if the great issues of national and local concern such as education, health, social **welfare**, housing and urban development are to receive maximum intelligent attention ... if all our resources including human talents and local knowledge are to be effectively harnessed ... if innovation, diversity and imaginative reforms are to be encouraged .

* It is implicit in the application of the federalism policy that local government must play an added role to better serve the communities in the areas of health, social **welfare**, housing and urban and community development.

* I suggest that all people who believe in the **welfare** of every citizen in this country should vote for this proposal that is coming before the Parliament to deal with this matter urgently.

* Here is a chance for honourable members opposite to be statesmen, to stand up and debate this issue today and to allow this Government to implement policies that will affect the **welfare** of all the people of this country and will safeguard their interests in every possible way.

* This Government initiative is a tangible expression of its very real and proper concern for the **welfare** of children.

* These consultations revealed among other things, that child care which was beneficial to the child's overall development was prohibitively costly for the large body of parents, and secondly, that the childminding arrangements that most parents could afford fell far short of the quality that was required in the interests of child **welfare**.

* Second, the Government's initiative springs from its concern for the **welfare** of children of working mothers.

* Persons in charge of centres will be required to seek the co-operation of family counselling and other local social **welfare** agencies including those operated by local governing authorities, especially in cases of family disruption and where parents or guardians are seeking to place very young children in centres; 
It is clearly time that the area of health, was looked at.

* No nation can support some of the **welfare** schemes that have been put forward.

* The Government should look also at the question of social **welfare** payments.

* 2) 1976 is to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch)  to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $375m for **welfare** housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* The 1976-77 advances are high in real terms compared with earlier years when the States themselves allocated **welfare** housing funds from their overall loan council works-housing program.

* At the time the Agreement was negotiated the States were intended to receive an interest concession of 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent on their **welfare** housing funds because the long-term bond rate was then 6.5 per cent.

* This in itself was significantly more generous than any previous financial arrangements for **welfare** housing.

* The Commonwealth has borne the entire increased cost of the loan funds from which the **welfare** housing advances are made.

* The level of interest rate concessions on **welfare** housing funds to States is currently about 6 per cent.

* The level of real assistance for the States' **welfare** housing programs has therefore increased considerably as the interest concession has become greater.

* We believe that the only sensible course, particularly within the present objectives of budgetary policy generally, is to seek to restore activity in the **welfare** housing area to an even keel.

* The **welfare** housing sector is a small but important part of the total housing sector; in recent years government dwelling construction has amounted to something like 12 per cent of total dwelling construction.

* Premiers and housing Ministers of those, and other, States have called for larger **welfare** housing advances than this Bill provides for.

* In the Commonwealth's view, large advances for **welfare** housing are not the way to ensure a robust housing industry.

* In other words, the Treasurer will be authorised to continue payments to the States for **welfare** housing in the period from 1 July 1977 until an appropriation measure for 1977-78 is passed by the Parliament.

* The problem is not the rate of tax but the growing expenditure on health, **welfare** and education with which the Government and the country are faced today.

* In 1967-68, ten years ago, this Government had a total commitment to health, education and social security and **welfare** of $ 1,571m.

* So, the rate of taxation is not keeping pace with the amount of expenditure in these **welfare** areas.

* In 1967-68 the expenditure on those three items of health, education and **welfare** represented 72 per cent of personal income tax collections.

* On reading through the report of the Australian Taxation Office and associating it with social security payments and other such expenditures, I found that in 1978-79, of every dollar that the Commonwealth collects in excise, indirect taxation and other sources of revenue, 42c will be spent on health and **welfare** and 23c will go to the States and local government.

* I invite honourable members who complain about the insufficiency of **welfare** commitments compared with commitments to other government initiatives to look at the fact that if we do not have a healthy economy, if we do not have incentives for taxpayers to get out and earn money productively, we will have no support for the standard of living which we currently enjoycertainly we will have no income from which to make **welfare** payments to enable recipients of **welfare** benefits to continue to enjoy that standard of living.

* Germany: German assistance continued to be centred primarily in the field of medical care and social **welfare** activities.

* Mekong Delta); post and communications (postal equipment and motorcycles) **welfare** and relief (flood relief for Central Vietnam).

* Collectively it is a very significant contributor to the **welfare** of the nation, lt is of great importance in earning export income.

* The welding together of a practical approach involving considerations of scientific advances which, these days, can make possible efficiency if there is an economic basis, together with considerations of community **welfare** give us the spectacle of an industry that concerns people; and people are the concern of this Parliament.

* Part of the continuing work of **Welfare** officers is Instruction on the need for moderation in the consumption of alcohol with individual counselling given in problem cases.

* He was later asked to return to Australia for a certain period to assist in establishing a **welfare** office for the Italian communities in the areas of Coburg and Brunswick and also to establish a newspaper in the Italian language so that these people would be assisted in their integration into Australia society.

* So in February 1974  Mr Salemi  came back to Australia and helped to establish a **welfare** office in Coburg.

* They developed a pride in the centre for it was a free **welfare** agency which they had established themselves.

* Even when the Labor Government, in cooperation with the State Government, started the north west one-stop **welfare** shop, commonly known as NOW, they continued to throng to the FILEF **welfare** centre.

* It is symptomatic of the state of debate in this chamber and the community at large that there has been little intelligent analysis of the Fitzgerald report on the contribution of the minerals industry to the **welfare** of Australians.

* With the Government determined to identify national interest in this whole area it was necessary to examine the real contribution to the **welfare** of Australia- hence the Fitzgerald report.

* Do not look very much for the **welfare** of the handicapped children in our community because they are still running chocolate wheels to raise funds to maintain their own schools.

* Does he remember what the previous Government did not do about the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** which was tabled in May 1971 in respect of the **welfare** of the mentally and physically handicapped children in Australia?

* The final report of the Social **Welfare** Commission noted this very attitude when it said: 
Imposing restraints on government spending has inevitably meant that many desirable programs can move ahead only at a slower pace than we might have hoped.

* In making choices we have been concerned to protect areas such as **welfare** payments where people are affected as individuals or areas especially important to opportunity, such as education where real growth in expenditure will be encompassed especially in areas related to the trades which have been so much neglected even under the previous Administration.

* Since that time we have continued to make inquiries about his **welfare**, not only in Hanoi but also with the Vatican.

* Australia's embassy to the Holy See recently sought further information from the Vatican about the **welfare** of Monsignor Thuan.

* a concern shared by the Government, I have written in my ministerial capacity to the Vietnamese Charge d 'Affaires in Canberra about the **welfare** of persons under detention in Vietnam and of Monsignor Thuan in particular.

* It has shown that this McMahon Liberal-Country Party Government is concerned with the **welfare** of every section of the community, and its concern for the social **welfare** of all Australians has been clearly demonstrated.

* As I mentioned earlier, the LiberalCountry Party Government has shown a total concern for the social **welfare** of all Australians in this Budget.

* I know how lack of information is restricting the **welfare** of these producers.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth , revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* Unlike the Opposition I and others on the Government side of the House are genuinely concerned for the **welfare** of fruit growers as people.

* We want a proper and rational debate, sound recommendations and effective Government action of the sort indicated in the motion of which I gave notice this morning and which I now read to the House in full: 
I repeat that I and my colleagues have fought hard and will continue to fight hard for the **welfare** of the apple and pear export industry in general and the fruit growers of Tasmania in particular.

* If the honourable member listens to what the benevolent organisations such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence and many others which have an orientation towards social **welfare** matters have to say, he wil come to understand that there is a need to provide this faculty.

* It has been called for especially by the **welfare** oriented bodies.

* Among the problems increasingly referred to are the growing alienation of the young to the community and its institutions, increases in vandalism and more serious forms of anti-social behaviour, loss of incentive and work motivation, increasing incidence of personal psychological problems, pressures on **welfare** services and the loss of skilled manpower resources.

* There is a need for the national Government to involve itself, not by directly overseeing urban development projects and becoming a giant landlord and developer, but by providing additional funds to local government for capital works programs such as day and child care centres, recreational and care centres for children both after school and during holiday periods; parks, gardens and flora and fauna reserves; family and community counselling facilities, particularly among migrant communities; library and recreational facilities; health and **welfare** centres, including family planning and infant health centres; sewerage and drainage schemes; and road, street and bridge works.

* With the greater community awareness of social issues and rising expectations of social **welfare**, local government has been required to provide many of the facilities and services I have mentioned.

* The Minister for Urban and Regional Development has acquired a reputation of being concerned for individuals and their **welfare**, and I pay him tribute for his concern.

* In all the States, education, health and community **welfare** departments, for example, provide services to Aboriginal communities in the same way as they do to other citizens.

* They have promised that the wicked Government will cut expenditure on education, legal aid, Aborigines and on childhood, old people, and other **welfare** services.

* But they know and the people of Australia know that even in times of severe budgetary restraint we have, by our allocations in the Budget, indicated to the people of Australia that we are committed to restoring economic sanity while improving education, health and **welfare** programs.

* There are very few people in Canberra who cannot get help and assistance from excellent cooperation between **welfare**, housing and community based organisations.

* We also recognise that only a healthy and vibrant economy can provide the resources our **welfare** agencies so properly call for.

* If the honourable member for Darling Downs has read closely the 3 reports that the Government has commissioned on this matter- the report of the Interim Committee for the Pre-school Education Commission, the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the report of the Priorities Review Staff- he will know that the maintenance of standards has been a matter of very great concern to the Government and its advisers and that very properly provision has been made to see that standards are maintained.

* In the 3 years Australia laboured under a Labor Government there was an unprecedented transfer of resources- from profits to wages and **welfare**; from the private to the public sector.

* One of the Henderson reports on Aboriginal **welfare** stated: .

* In the process, it is becoming a lucrative business- for professional **welfare** workers, administrators, researchers and consultants.

* The very young and the very old had become a greater charge on the taxpayers along with the army of professional **welfare** workers, administrators, researchers and consultants, child minding centres and staffs and nursing homes.

* I also believe that social **welfare** programs such as the Australian Assistance Plan must be pruned to realistic levels before the Australian people lose their initiative and independence altogether and settle for a way of life based on handouts, as they were encouraged to do by our predecessors.

* Such **welfare** payments as are required to help the genuinely needy should be made in some way that will ensure that they get directly to those who need them, without passing through a chain of bureaucratic middlemen.

* I would like to see the Government do the same with all other **welfare** policies.

* I firmly believe that the federalism policy which has been outlined by this Government is one with a great deal of application in the social **welfare** area of our activity.

* It is my firm belief that local government is capable of undertaking and is eager to adopt the responsibility for more social **welfare** programs.

* Whether social **welfare** programs include supporting mothers benefits, handicapped children allowances, grants to community organisations, day care centres, the appointment of social and community planners or child catalysts, local government is the tier of government better able to spend the **welfare** dollar for full value.

* The artificial creation of regions by the convenience of groupings on a map does not offer an ideal basis for an efficient and creative social **welfare** regional scheme.

* An electoral system is already established and there is a traditional involvement by people in local government and in **welfare** which gives an historical head start to community participation.

* There are in our towns and in our cities people who will work on committees or **welfare** and charitable programs without any personal gain except for the feeling of satisfaction that they are doing something for their fellow man or woman.

* To this end it was recommended by the Public Service (Canberra) **Welfare** Committee that  a  Board of Review should be created to investigate the whole question.

* What sum has been (a) available and (b) granted for (i) home care services, (ii) senior citizens' centres and (iii) **welfare** officers at senior citizens' centres under the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 to each of the States and Territories in each year of operation of the Act 
That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* I heartily wish that the Minister for Social Services had contributed more of his time to this particular matter, because social **welfare** in this country is still blighted by concepts which were first conceived in the dying stages of the last century.

* It would have been more appropriate for him to have talked in terms of new concepts that he hoped to develop in the last third of the 20th century in preparation for the new social **welfare** programme which would be required to meet the needs of the people in the 21st century, which is a mere 30 years away, not long in the span of time.

* But in the table that the Minister has presented to the House and which has been incorporated in Hansard, running to about 20 pages, he clearly has provoked this sort of response, so I will spend a few minutes discussing some aspects of how he could have looked at the pension in real terms of contributing to the people's **welfare**.

* It is literally a level of deprivation for so many social service beneficiaries, for which this Government is responsible by manipulating pensions at election time in an effort to bribe votes and then neglecting the **welfare** of beneficiaries at crucial moments subsequently.

* Any money which becomes available for social **welfare** should be allocated to the area of greatest need and according to priorities.

* Their need is greater than mine and social justice demands that greatest benefit from social **welfare** programmes must go to areas of greatest need as a priority.

* We do not know what the long term objectives are for social **welfare** services in the community.

* The unconcern for their **welfare** which is consistently manifested in subsequent Budgets is an example of atrocious neglect of public responsibility.

* There is an infinite variety of figures, analyses, surveys and findings to establish that the Australian system of social **welfare** is inferior to need and that it stands embarrassingly disadvantaged compared to other advanced economies.

* Where once we led in social **welfare** services we now rank somewhere between 15th and 20th on a scale of what has been provided by various other countries.

* According to the 1968 United Nations Year Book on National Accounts, Australia spent 10.4 per cent of its gross national product on the provision of health, education and **welfare**.

* Social **welfare** programmes in Australia proceed on a disjointed piecemeal basis.

* It is crass political opportunism which motivates a government to manipulate social **welfare** programmes like a box of tricks for election audiences to 'ooh' and aah' over and then, after the election is over, to tuck the box away with determination after carefully labelling it: 'Not to be used until the next election'.

* The conservative government at Canberra is thoroughly discreditable, exploiting as it does in this manner of grand political opportunism the **welfare** needs of those in want.

* A completely new approach must be adopted to the provision of social **welfare** services in Australia.

* With these requirements in mind, the Australian Labor Party has pledged itself to undertake a wide ranging social **welfare** programme, not only aimed at rooting out poverty but also aimed at progressively removing the very real disadvantages of social discrimination and at establishing economic security for all in ill health, unemployment, invalidity, widowhood and age.

* On the other hand the development of community based field services operated by regional departments of social **welfare** will be fostered by direct special grants under section 96 of the Constitution to State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies.

* Australia to which refugees wish to go; the background of refugees to be accepted- their capacity for early integration or otherwise; the availability of special post arrival services- language instruction, education, training, accommodation, health and **welfare**; and the numbers of refugees for which voluntary agencies can care.

* The program of this Government is based largely on **welfare** matters.

* Certainly this is money which can be well spent because Aboriginal people in many areas have a need for advancement with respect to **welfare**, health and education.

* In the Budget, $2 19m is made available to assist the States to provide **welfare** housing.

* The Public Service Board has agreed to the creation of a further nine positions and, subject to completion of the necessary formal processes, the establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission will increase to 29.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has been responsible for the formulation of policy for the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Committee and Working Party meetings between the staff of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Department of Social Security are held frequently.

* I think it is fair to say that this is one of those difficult areas in relation to taxation and social **welfare** policy.

* I say to the honourable gentleman, secondly, that if indeed the community believes that some amongst its number, by reason of their disabilities, should be deserving of additional assistance, the right method of doing that is by direct support and social **welfare** payments.

* But to return to this Appropriation Bill, this is a very clear and tangible expression by this Australian Government of its concern for the **welfare** of thousands of my own electors, some 45 per cent of them, who have been so severely hit by this bridge disaster and the consequences that followed.

* There are provisions in the Bills for the further funding of the Deakin University at Geelong, for the establishment of a central office of the State College of Victoria, for the establishment of diploma courses in **welfare** studies at one or two colleges of advanced education and for the further expansion of the study centre of the Albury-Wodonga centre of the Riverina College of Advanced Education.

* Surgeon General Jesse L. Steinfeld disclosed all of the actions at a hearing of a Senate Commerce Sub-committee following their approval by the Secretaries of Health, Education and **Welfare**, Agriculture and Interior.

* A circular on 2,4,5-T was published by the United States Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, and Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** on 15 April 1970.

* Since the tabling of the Report there have been many important changes in health and **welfare** benefits available to the Australian community.

* In accepting the responsibility of further uranium development we will ensure that that development will be very strictly controlled, with the fullest and most effective protection for the environment and the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people as recommended by the Ranger Inquiry.

* We will have specific arrangements to ensure Aboriginal **welfare**; 
The administrative machinery I have described will be the foundation on which further development of the industry will proceed.

* It is completely in accord with the recommendations of the Ranger Inquiry and will provide a proper and adequate basis on which uranium development will proceed so as to harmonise the interests of development, environmental protection, National Park values and Aboriginal **welfare**.

* For the information of honourable members I present a report entitled 'The Contribution of the Mineral Industry to Australian **Welfare**'.

* The other matter to which I want to draw the attention of the Goverment is an anomaly which recently was brought to my attention concerning the reason why many people suffer embarrassment in the field of social **welfare**.

* Mostly, these families are in the low income group, and are severely affected by the delays in workers compensation, insurance, Commonwealth sickness and unemployment benefits, and pensions, and worst of all by delays in initial payments of Social **Welfare** Department assistance.

* The Bill is a conglomeration of four or five separate health and **welfare** proposals.

* Having in mind the establishment of a Government insurance office and the extended terms of reference of the Woodhouse Committee, especially the words 'together with the application of the scheme where death results from such sickness or defect', one wonders how open-ended the Government's intentions are in this area of social **welfare** and social security.

* We would commend anything that is humanitarian but I would remind the Government that it is not a bottomless pit from which one funds social **welfare** payments.

* The social **welfare** state might be all very well in theory but someone has to pay for these benefits and someone has to fund this so-called Australian Government insurance office.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* But it has been hell bent on centralism and duplicating almost every social **welfare** program which exists in this nation.

* The amendments will: require a commissioner to consult with his  deputy president  before making or varying an award relating to wages and conditions; prohibit the Commission from ordering, recommending or sanctioning in any way, an employer paying wages to an employee for time when the employee was engaged in industrial action; provide for the expeditious hearing of stand-down applications, either before a single member of the Commission or a full bench; provide that the question of whether an industrial dispute exists may be the subject of a reference to a full bench; enable an industrial dispute or part of an industrial dispute to be referred to a full bench at the conciliation state; reinforce the powers of the  President  of the Commission by enabling him to withdraw a matter from another member of the Commission and either deal with it himself or refer the matter in a full bench; and provide increased protection for the community by creating an alternative path to the deregistration of organisations and thereby remove delays in the deregistration process in cases where the safety, health or **welfare** of the community are put at risk by industrial action.

* The Government does not believe that any member of our community, whether a direct participant in industrial relations or not, should have to put up with tactics which threaten their health, safety or **welfare**.

* We will not stand by and watch while individual Australians are denied their right to obtain goods and services affecting their safety, health or **welfare**.

* The Government believes that the present deregistration provisions are not adequate to deal with the special circumstances where organisations, or sections of them, endanger the safety, health or **welfare** of Australian families.

* The Minister may apply to a full bench of the Commission for a declaration that industrial action by an organisation or a group of its members has had, is having, or is likely to have, a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of the community or a part of the community.

* These new provisions are designed specifically to protect the job security, safety, health or **welfare** of Australian men and women and their families.

* He said that there is no framework for improving the standards of education, health and **welfare**'.

* Commonwealth expenditure in the field of education for the coming year will amount to $426m and for social **welfare** about $2,529m.

* Will the Prime Minister invite Archbishop Loane to supply him with a report on the degree and nature of hardship suffered by certain sections of the community in the Sydney diocese, derived from information available through the **welfare** and pastoral services of his Church, with a view to providing appropriate and more adequate aid to those who are suffering hardship?

* Andrew was interviewed by the Child **Welfare** Department because of truancy.

* I cannot recall his ever being accused of lacking in compassion and interest for the **welfare** of ex-servicemen.

* The Government is taking action in other ways through its Social **Welfare** Commission under the leadership of  Mrs Marie  Coleman, to look at the causes of drug addiction.

* Will the Minister assure the House that the Government's admirable nationalistic zeal will not be allowed to run so wild that it will be counter productive in its impact on the development of the Australian economy and the **welfare** of the Australian people?

* In other words, it is more difficult for the new immigrants to find jobs and often they have to depend upon our social **welfare** system.

* Mr Newman apparently recognises, but the State Labor Premiers do not, that **welfare** housing aid should be separated from Government assistance to other forms of housing.

* The purpose of this Bill is to secure the future of the homeless persons **welfare** program by removing from the enabling legislation reference to a prescribed period.

* It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre.

* Subsidies valued at $320,000 are also being provided for 44 social **welfare** workers at 40 centres.

* The program, by assisting with rental subsidies and social **welfare** worker subsidies, has been able to contribute to the development of the halfway house concept.

* This allows for placement of clients in a residential setting while they are assisted in adjusting to the many demands of a different life style by social **welfare** workers funded under the program.

* In this regard, the definition of 'social **welfare** worker' has been interpreted in the widest possible sense under the program, the main criterion being that a worker provides a personal **welfare** service to homeless people.

* In addition, there are the family support services scheme, the community health program and the **welfare** housing programs.

* What he said as an expression of the Government's philosophy on social **welfare** is worth repeating.

* It was not worried about the **welfare** of pensioners.

* This is the magnificent symbol of conservative social **welfare** achievement proposed for the 1970s and, to boot, there is added a means test within a means test.

* To realise this one has only to look at a table showing percentage expenditures on health and **welfare** in this and other countries.

* All that the Government proves by refusing to act in this respect is how backward it is in its thinking on **welfare**.

* Most of what he has put forward as far as **welfare** thinking is concerned has been superseded.

* We see no radical rethinking, no fresh concepts emerging, no efforts to remould the sort of **welfare** practices, policies and values which apply in this community and yet clearly we need new values.

* We need a system of **welfare** programmes that will back this up.

* It is not of much use giving money to people with need and more especially people with chronic need unless you have the **welfare** services to back up this sort of assistance to help people to become selfsufficient, to maintain their self-respect and to uphold their personal dignity.

* Canada and Australia are comparable countries in this sort of thing and certainly in economic terms and the social **welfare** programmes that this country is capable of achieving, lt is quite clear that Australia has the capacity to introduce this sort of system for the benefit of the community.

* We have the power to do it and having the power we must fulfil the responsibility to introduce these things; to give people a sense of security and to assure them that the community is concerned about their **welfare** and that in times of crisis need especially there will bc adequate support for them.

* We must introduce a system of regionalised social **welfare** programmes, a subject I have raised many times before in this House.

* I conclude by suggesting that this House should refer the total area of social **welfare**, not only the benefits now provided but also the funds of services which should be provided, both financially and by way of **welfare** programmes backing up financial services, to a select committee of this House so that we can have some objective, in depth, analyses of the needs in this community and so that appropriate recommendations may be made to this House on the kind of policy which should be developed in the future.

* There has been too much secrecy surrounding the work conducted by the Department of Social Services on policy matters affecting the **welfare** of many human beings.

* Housing is vital to the **welfare** and happiness of individuals and thus to our future development as a nation.

* Housing is vital to the **welfare** and happiness of individuals and thus to our future development as a nation.

* The team manager thought that it was a shocking thing to happen in a civilised country but was forced to warn  Dr Darveniza  for the **welfare** of the team as a whole.

* He said: 
The Budget contains a far-reaching **welfare** programme, part of which will be implemented by my colleague, the Minister for Health  Senator Sir Kenneth  Anderson and part of which falls within my own responsibilities.

* The social services aspects of the **welfare** programme are covered by 3 Bills.

* The Whitlam Labor Government is concerned with the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* On 23 July 1975 the Prime Minister announced that the Australian Government had decided to initiate a special survey of Vietnamese refugees who had settled recently in Australia He announced that the survey would take approximately 5 years, would be conducted by  Dr Jean  Martin of the Australian National University and would encompass such things as the refugees' reasons for leaving their own country; their social characteristics; their aspirations in their new homeland; what Australian Government assistance in maintenance and **welfare** they requested, or needed and received; the problems they thought they might have to face in settling in Australia and how these compared with the problems actually encountered; the problems of culture and language difference that they had to face; what happened to their cultural identity in the process of resettlement; and to what extent, if at all, they suffered from racism.

* Only in this way can the true needs of **welfare** of the people of Australia be met.

* In relation to handicapped persons' **welfare**, we have announced major new initiatives to improve services to the handicapped people and voluntary, religious and similar organisations caring for them.

* In the electorate of Bonython the Handicapped Person's **Welfare** Act has benefited greatly 2 caring services.

* maternal and child **welfare**, 
I believe that the Prime Minister is covering up in regard to the activities of Assistant Ministers.

* By way of passing reference I say that most honourable members know that Assistant Ministers were appointed not to assist the **welfare** and development of this Parliament but to give the Prime Minister the numbers in an evenly divided caucus; of the Liberal Party.

* The first recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee states: 
The Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** published a report entitled 'Drug Problems in Australia- An Intoxicated Society?'.

* In conclusion, I refer again to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** entitled 'Drug Problems in Australia- an intoxicated society?'

* greater emphasis on special procedures to identify claimants and to detect abuse; personal interviews of new claimants of unemployment benefit; additional staff and counter facilities in response to increases in workload; upgrading of managerial resources and the granting of wider discretionary powers to local managers; advance payment of the initial benefit cheque in cases of hardship to avoid recourse to **welfare** agencies; and greater readiness to issue counter cheques to persons in need.

* I table 2 reports: The report of the Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the first report of the Task Force on Coordination in **Welfare** and Health entitled Proposals for Change in the Administration and Delivery of Programs and Services.

* In June and July 1976 the Government established 2 inquiries in the health and **welfare** fields.

* The second, the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health, chaired by  Mr P.  H. Bailey, was announced on 23 July.

* The 'Holmes' Committee was asked to examine and report on: 
The relationship between programs for the aged and the infirm and other health and **welfare** programs.

* Honourable members will recall the decision to establish the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health arose out of the Government's concern at the proliferation, duplication and overlap of Commonwealth programs and services in the health, **welfare** and community development fields.

* The report also contains a range of other recommendations relating to specific programs including, for example, pathology laboratories, rehabilitation centres, and the immediate post-arrival **welfare** of migrants.

* In proposing various administrative changes, both reports make suggestions as to how the Commonwealth can safeguard the role of local and voluntary agencies delivering health and **welfare** services in the community.

* Our view is that these reports raise important issues in the health and **welfare** fields which merit serious consideration, not only by governments but also by all those involved.

* The Committee on Care of the Aged and the Infirm and the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health are to be commended for their efforts.

* Task force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and HealthProposals for Change in the Administration and Delivery of Programs and Services'- Ministerial Statement, 17 February 1977.

* Spending on social security and **welfare** is up $2 10m on the Budget estimate.

* The report did not stand up technically nor did it cater for the **welfare** of South Australians.

* The second basic reason was the obvious difference in approach, attitude and capabilities - and here I am making a contrast between Liberal Premiers,  Sir Thomas  Playford and Steele Hall in keeping the **welfare** of their State constantly to the forefront.

* The people of South Australia were interested in the issues concerning their **welfare** and prosperity.

* The fourth main purpose is to correct an existing anomaly in the war service homes legislation by providing for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 War or in the subsequent war-like operations as an accredited representative of a **welfare** organisation.

* However, we consider that there is a strong case on the social **welfare** grounds for exempting female persons with qualifying service under the Act from this requirement.

* The proposed extension of benefits to members of **welfare** organisations who served overseas with the Forces will correct an injustice which has been allowed to exist for far too long.

* During the 1939-45 War representatives of **welfare** organisations served in such areas as North Africa, Greece, Crete, Papua, New Guinea, Malaya and Singapore and there were many casualties including some who died on service or became prisoners of war.

* The enactment of this legislation will ensure that the scheme will go on making its important contribution to the national **welfare** by enabling eligible persons in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain a home of their own.

* People from the Social **Welfare** Department, which is a State organisation in Victoria, visit there regularly.

* It is called the Dallas **Welfare** and Youth Services 
We were supposed to debate the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill today.

* And expressions of the sort that it is reported the Prime Minister used in the Caucus yesterday in relation to artists are quite surprising for people who thought that they could trust his interest in their **welfare**.

* I will be delighted if he can get up in this chamber and say that the provision of services, the provision of Arabic speakers, has been adequate within the **welfare** services of this country.

* They are demanding **welfare** services, as the Minister knows.

* As the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr lnnes)  said, there are far too many bureaucrats here in Canberra and far too many people in supervisory roles in the State offices of the Department of Social Security who are responsible for the provision of migrant **welfare** services and who are not familiar with what is going on in the field.

* The Minister will be aware of the great dissatisfaction among ethnic organisations with the administration of the grant-in-aid **welfare** workers scheme.

* He will know that it is the traditional, establishment **welfare** organisations which have grabbed that money and which have not geared up in order to provide services to migrants.

* It has stolen Opposition policy, as expressed in the booklet 'The Way Ahead', virtually in every area, including the economy and social **welfare**.

* The Minister mentioned that in the past his Government has increased social service benefits only to see the State governments reduce their **welfare** benefits by an equal amount.

* We must look at social **welfare** in a wider context than that of dispensing charity to the disadvantaged.

* I have been told by every responsible social **welfare** organisation in the country that this is an area of need.

* The Minister, instead of smirking or smiling, should note that action in the area of child endowment has been recommended by the Henderson Committee and by all responsible social **welfare** organisations.

* Maybe the **welfare** organisations could be deputed as agents to pay the money out in trust and then substantiate their claims with the Department of Social Security.

* In the 1973-74 Budget the increase in social security and **welfare** payments was 18.4 per cent; the overall expenditure in all of the other items was 20.2 per cent.

* No matter how much the Minister comes into this House and says: 'Look what we are doing in the area of social **welfare**', what he got for his Department in Cabinet in the Budget was less than the Minister for Tourism and Recreation got.

* To be fair, in the 1974-75 Budget the increase in social security and **welfare** payments was 38 per cent, but nevertheless it was less than the increase for education, for urban and regional development, for culture- whatever that means, and we know that there have been massive increases in expenditure in the name of culture in recent times- and indeed for recreation.

* The Agreement provides that, during each of the 5 years commencing in 1973-74, the Commonwealth will make advances at low rates of interest to the States for **welfare** housing purposes.

* The Agreement therefore provides that not less than 20 per cent nor more than 30 per cent of the **welfare** housing advances by the Commonwealth to a State in a year shall be paid into a home builders' account to be lent to prospective home-owners through cooperative terminating housing societies or a lending authority of a State approved by the Commonwealth.

* However, at the request of a State Minister and in respect of a State in which its annual allocation to its home builders' account in each of the 2 financial years ending on 30th June 1973 has exceeded 30 per cent of total new advances for **welfare** housing, the Commonwealth Minister may approve an advance to its home builders' account in a year in excess of 30 per cent of the total Commonwealth advance in that year.

* In line with our policy of ensuring that our housing advances for **welfare** purposes benefit the more needy, applicants eligible to receive home builders' account advances will be families consisting of a married or engaged couple, or a single parent or guardian with one or more children, where the average gross weekly income of the main breadwinner, inclusive of overtime but excluding child endowment payments, does not exceed about 93 per cent of average weekly earnings, plus $2 a week for each child beyond the second.

* Coir intention is that our **welfare** housing advances will not be part of State programs approved by the Loan Council.

* During the process of negotiation of this Agreement, all State Housing Ministers sought certain assurances in respect to borrowing to be approved by the Loan Council and the minimum allocation for works, including any housing other than **welfare** housing.

* However, as the Government wishes to be in a position to offer the States advances for **welfare** housing from 1st July next, it is important that the legislation to authorise it to enter into this Agreement, and make advances, be approved by the Parliament during the current sittings.

* Let me assure the honourable member for Oxley that Sweden is in deep trouble with too much social **welfare** being at the root cause of its troubles.

* When are the champions of social **welfare** in the Labor Party going to realise that there is nothing free in this world?

* It empowers a full bench to make a relevant declaration where it is satisfied that two persons have in the past been engaged in industrial action- for example, a ban- which has had a substantial effect on the **welfare** part of the community.

* Much of what he- had to say is very vague, but millions of people who have been aided by Labor's **welfare** and education programs would, in my view, have a lot to worry about.

* There have also been great increases in the field of social **welfare** to meet the ravages of poverty that exist in our community and that are inflicted chronically- not just for a time- on one and a quarter million people if we are to believe the survey on poverty which the Opposition, when in government, reluctantly set up at our behest.

* Our people want employment, not **welfare**.

* Private investment has been falling away rapidly and in the long term, particularly now that a tax has been placed on people who have made an effort in the past to be thrifty, this will cripple our ability as a nation to meet those payments of scale to our **welfare** programs, our health care programs and also to education.

* The funds set aside for preventive medicine are relatively small by comparison with the enormous expenditure on health services and social **welfare** payments provided in this Budget.

* Members will be aware of the sacking of Joseph Califano Jnr, the former Secretary of State for Health, Education and **Welfare** in the Carter administration in the USA.

* We are not getting the return we ought to be getting, a return which can be ploughed back into the community in many ways such as investment, as better **welfare** provision and as better consumption standards for people in the community.

* No assessment had ever been made to establish whether these payments should be provided, whether they should be continued or whether the taxpayer should be required to continue paying to surrender some of his living standards so that in some cases a particular powerful supporter could continue to get what can be fairly termed as a **welfare** payment at the expense of the rest of the community.

* Originally the advocacy of protection was closely related to the view that national independence and the **welfare** of wage earners in this country would be promoted by the effect of tariffs in redistributing income from the owners of land to industrial labour and capital.

* If that investment is taking place in the wrong parts - that is, if unwise decisions are being made not according to rational economic criteria but according to the pay-off that can be achieved in the back room deals between the Country Party and the people, who are its backers, or it hopes will be its backers - we will not achieve the sort of growth we should achieve; we will not achieve the sort of progress and prosperity we should achieve; and we will not achieve the living standards that should be provided in the community and the **welfare** services that should be achieved.

* He has acted as a volunteer house father for the Elizabeth Family Home which cares for disturbed children and is organised by the State Department of Community **Welfare**.

* He acts as a handyman in a handyman's scheme run by volunteers through the Department of Community **Welfare**.

* Because of that it contributes greatly to the progress and economic **welfare** of country towns and the people who reside in them.

* There are not too many people in Australia who are unduly concerned about the difficulties faced by the people who live in these areas and who contribute so much through the wool industry and other primary industries to the **welfare** of Australian people.

* But there are on the island a group of people who have not accrued those rights in some other country and it is proper that this Parliament and the Government here in Canberra should be concerned about the **welfare** and the security of those people.

* The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Requests for financial assistance which my Department receives from organisations or persons acting on behalf of migrants fall generally in 2 areas - those which relate to assistance in acquiring land or premises for the establishment of ethnic clubs and those which relate to funds to support the employment of persons engaged in **welfare** work in the migrant community.

* Community agencies engaged in direct **welfare** service to migrants may apply for a grant to meet the salary costs of a social worker to further expand such work.

* Fourthly, will the Corporation's operations lead to a net increase in the national **welfare** to an extent not otherwise possible?

* Most people enrolled in the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan probably have done so as a result of extensive publicity campaigns conducted by my Department and health insurance organisations, and through - contact with social workers and other **welfare** organisations.

* In this context, my Department is presently examining ways of making greater use of social workers, charitable organisations, and other appropriate **welfare** groups in motivating and assisting eligible persons to enrol  in  the Plan.

* At the heart of the problem is a conscious and planned assault on living standards, a wilful contempt for the **welfare** of the people and those most in need.

* No government with such a record can win the people's confidence in the struggle to restore our economic **welfare**.

* It gives me considerable pleasure to speak on the Aged Persons Hostels Bill this afternoon, and at the outset I offer my sincere congratulations to both the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  and the Government for what they have done in this field of social **welfare**.

* July 1977- The Western Australian State Departments for Community **Welfare** and Mental Health Services; 
ofthe 1959 Annual Report of the Western Australian Depanment of Native **Welfare**, on 20 March 1979, as a result of it being quoted in the report mentioned in (c) below; 
of the 1976 report by the Western Australian Department for Community **Welfare**, on 18 November 1976.

* The Labor Party's policy is that, having regard to the present unresolved economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of nuclear power in particular, until Australian sovereignty, the needs of our environment, the economic **welfare** of our people and the rights and wellbeing of the Aboriginal people are understood we will not assist in any way the Government's actions to carry out uranium mining in the Northern Territory.

* Conference recognises that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic **welfare** of our people, and the rights and well-being of the Aboriginal people.

* The Priorities Review Staff Report on Early Childhood Services tabled on 30 July 1 974 refers to ' a scheme for classifying local government areas according to need' developed by the Social **Welfare** Commission, and went on to give some examples of local government areas for the three categories of highest priority as put forward in that scheme.

* The table below sets out by State and by time period of the initial approval related to each particular centre, the number of centres approved for assistance under the Child Care Act 1972 in each of the three categories of highest priority of the five-point rating scale developed by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* If so, is there any reason why the law should not be amended to provide that persons or organisations affected by aircraft noise at all hours of the day and night should be entitled to take similar action against the Government or the airline companies responsible for this menace to their health, homes and **welfare**?

* There is also the matter that relates to the size of aid projects and their nature, which in the case of voluntary agencies are sometimes small and of a **welfare** nature rather than a developmental nature.

* However, the Orana Regional Rehabilitation and Social **Welfare** Council which is located at Dubbo, in the Electorate of Darling, was provided with the $2,000 Initiating Grant in 1974-7S under the Plan.

* What has been his response to representations made to him on 28 October 1977 by the NSW Local Government Community Workers' Association in which concern and dismay was expressed about the drastic curtailment of funding for the following Government responsibilities: (a) **welfare** workers under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, (b) Family Law Court Counselling Service, (c) education programs, including after school care, child care and other family care programs, and migrant classes for adults, (d) health care services including community health centres, domiciliary care services and women's health centres, (e) unemployment and unemployment relief schemes, (0 housing, in particular housing for the aged and invalid people, (g) pension and benefit reductions in real values and proposed transfers of responsibility for these, (h) 470 community programs funded under the Australian Assistance Plan, (i) programs for the handicapped, (j) the Legal Aid Commission Bill, (k) Aboriginal affairs, (1) grant in aid services for migrants and interpreter services, (m) Australian Government printing services, (n) national co-ordinating bodies for youth affairs, (o) women 's refuges subsidies reductions and (p) Australian Bureau of Statistics processing.

* I point out also that, as in the case of that other area of social **welfare**, the Australian Assistance Plan, the Minister's policy almost falls upon barren ground because of disputes that have arisen over the boundaries that are being forced upon local committees under this plan for regions that was put before the Parliament last year.

* The evidence of this need for increased assistance is obvious to anybody who has some involvement with voluntary **welfare** organisations.

* I think it is indisputable that the States have both the historical and practical background in broad social **welfare** functions which is simply not going to be utilised.

* The AAP, to my knowledge, does not provide financial assistance to State government **welfare** bodies and this Bill specifically excludes it.

* It seems to be most incongruous that States should be able to receive financial assistance for education and health programs for handicapped people but not for social **welfare** programs.

* They want their services delivered by local **welfare** organisations.

* While it is vital to increase the effectiveness of voluntary organisations, it is also important to increase the effectiveness and build on the experience and practical wisdom of the State **welfare** departments.

* I know the limitations of State **welfare** departments.

* I doubt that local government bodies in Australia have the historical or the practical background or framework upon which to build hastily complex **welfare** service structures.

* Secondly, as I understand it, it is departmental policy to insist that programs for handicapped people be funded by the handicapped persons **welfare** section of the Department of Social Security and not through AAP funds.

* The 2 previously mentioned Acts recognised that to establish health and education **welfare** services is a major undertaking and too great for some communities to initiate at all or to initiate within a reasonable period.

* In his second reading speech the Minister spoke in most glowing terms about the relationships between the statutory and the private and voluntary sectors in **welfare**.

* Because this Government has a deep concern for the **welfare** of pensioners, particularly after 3 years of massive inflation which did more to damage pensions and more to damage the position of pensioners than can be conceived by people who have not been in that situation.

* What is more, they can be made to serve as a basis for the sound formulation of social and **welfare** policies.

* Many of Australia's most urgent needs are in the fields of education, health and public **welfare**, urban development, and financial assistance to underdeveloped countries.

* To name but a few the Government has introduced tax indexation, export incentives, family allowances, automatic indexation of pensions, abolition of estate and gift duties, lowering of Division 7 taxation on private companies, a major improvement in the facilities for migrants and improved social **welfare** services.

* It will open up new concepts of **welfare** care with far less rigidity than we have seen previously.

* The **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration has a substantial collection which is to be made available to the Territory Museum and Art Gallery Board for display, etc.

* As part of a continuing programme over many years the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration, the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies and linguists have recorded and catalogued a considerable amount of oral literature and history from Aborigines in the Northern Territory.

* Can any honourable member tell me that the social **welfare** POliCY of the Labor Party is not different from the social **welfare** policy of the Liberal Party?

* The **welfare** of whole communities depends on this industry.

* The answers received have been more concerned with legalistic matters and an alleged reluctance to legislate for a small distinct section of the community than with any essential approach to the considerations of human **welfare**.

* He is well known to you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  for his research and his dedication to the **welfare** of retired miners.

* -Pursuant to section 34 of the Services Trust Fund Act 1947-1973 I present the annual reports of the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund, the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund for the calendar year 1 974, together with financial statements and the report of the Auditor-General on those statements.

* The **welfare** measures announced under the household support provision also receive the support of the Opposition.

* Having seen more than 2000 farmers on the dole in its time of tenure or office, the Government is duty bound to provide suitable **welfare** proposals to maintain the income of farmers who are judged to be nonviable, up to the level of unemployment benefit prevailing in the community at large.

* Finally we found that they had a **welfare** problem on their hands.

* This is the essential issue as has been pointed out by the distinguished and honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Allan Fraser)  who, like myself, has a deep and vested interest in the **welfare** of studs and the people who arc associated with them.

* There is a tendency for many people in Queensland to believe that we lead the Commonwealth in the provision of community health, hospital and **welfare** services.

* Labor governments in the 1940s and 1950s gave primacy to the development of community health and hospital services and displayed a great concern about **welfare** services.

* There is a lingering belief that, because a system of free hospitalisation was preserved in Queensland, that State still leads in the provision of community health, hospital and **welfare** services.

* That is the level by which standards in that important area of community health, hospital and **welfare** services have fallen short of those provided in States like South Australia 
Let us see what such a cut in expenditure would mean for individuals who are very much dependent, in a very real and essential way, on the sorts of programs we conduct for the maintenance of their living standards.

* So, in fact, the policy of the Opposition in regard to social **welfare** represents a very severe cutback in the wideranging programs administered by the Department of Social Security.

* I think he is the spokesman for the Opposition on **welfare** matters, although one can never quite detect who is really the spokesman for the Opposition on such matters.

* The Government also has under study a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** which has made recommendations on this matter.

* No doubt the people in receipt of increased payments will be very delighted  -  I shall deal with that matter in detail later - but their feelings of pleasure could easily be dampened by the overall effect on costs, prices and general productivity caused by the Labor Government's **welfare** state policies.

* Of course, they are concerned not only about the **welfare** policies of the Labor Government but also about its defence and security policies.

* The policy speech delivered by the then Leader of the Opposition in the recent Federal election campaign stated that a Labor Government would be prepared to take the financial aspects of **welfare** out of budgetary considerations.

* It is a completely irresponsible and even dishonest approach for the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to claim that his Government will ignore the financial considerations of **welfare** provisions in the national Budget.

* However, I am informed that the Victorian Department of Community **Welfare** Services, through which Commonwealth Community Health Program funds are channelled, has advised the solicitors administering the deceased estate of the terms of the Commonwealth's approval for funding of this refuge under the Community Health Program.

* I believe there is a real and pressing casefor decentralisation of authority and that local governments will best perform many governmental functions in such critical areas as **welfare**, culture and the environment.

* There now appears to be a general agreement that local government is the most appropriate unit for the planning, administration and delivery of a wide range of community **welfare** services and facilities because it can take account of the different needs, values and preferences of individual communities and because it is the political unit closest to the communities being served.

* The Liberal-National Country Party Opposition in its October 1975 social **welfare** policy speech, under the heading of 'Local Government and Community Participation', provided: 
A Liberal and National Country Party government views local government as the focus for service delivery, since **welfare** services provided at the local level will be very responsive to users' needs and wishes.

* A Liberal and National Country Party government will assist local governments to utilise these inherent advantages and potentialities effectively to meet the contemporary need for citizen participation and **welfare** provision by: 
seeking to have States Grants Commissions consider the diverse **welfare** needs of local government in allocating them equalisation grants.

* This proposal would have served as an important incentive to assist local government authorities to provide social **welfare** and other services which are most needed in some of the less fortunate municipalities and shires of this country.

* 1 ) What restrictions are placed on financial assistance made under the States Grants (Home Care) Act for the employment of **welfare** officers.

* Have any restrictions caused inflexibility and difficulties in municipal social **welfare** departments if so, how many councils have complained of the problem.

* In the same way - to come more directly to the present Bill - we have to understand that in social **welfare** we now have an altogether different starting point on which to base our judgment of future programs.

* In the past: - as any review of Hansard will confirm - our social **welfare** debates dealt very fully with all manner of things but very little with social **welfare**.

* Look at the record of the past 23 years and try to extract what the then Government saw as its social **welfare** philosophy - its long term aims.

* Indeed, if any social **welfare** aim at all could be found in the Liberal Government it was the aim to keep social **welfare** spending to a minimum.

* It is all very well to agree - as most people probably now do - that money payments alone are not the beginning and end of a decent **welfare** program.

* It is precisely for this reason that the present Bill is important not only for what it provides, but for what it represents - the first step towards a long term commitment to reasonable money payments for **welfare**.

* The same thing can be said about the so-called poverty line around which so much social **welfare** discussion has centred in the last 5 or 6 years.

* The opportunity and indeed the challenge will then be faced of tackling questions of greater complexity, such as how to integrate cash benefits with community **welfare** services and health services, housing policies and education programs, to mention just a few.

* In other  respects,  a re-allocation of existing **welfare** expenditure could well be helpful - for example, from tax deductibility for dependent children to increased, child endowment, or from the current housing component of pension requirements to an accelerated program of pensioner housing construction.

* What it will probably mean is the introduction in Australia of specific social **welfare** contributions to finance the social **welfare** system.

* But they must not be allowed to obscure what will be far more generally true, namely that the social **welfare** program which this Bill sets in motion will be regarded by Australians of the future as needed as much for our self-respect as for our comfort, as long overdue and certainly as irreversible.

* The major areas of government expenditure are as follows: Defence, 8.7 per cent; education, 8.8 per cent; health, 10.5 per cent; social security and **welfare**, 27.2 per cent; and States and local government, transfer of payments, 21.8 per cent.

* We should direct funds to the needy in the public expenditure areas of health, education and **welfare**.

* There is no point in handing out government **welfare** benefits to those who do not need them.

* Among the many task that 1 have as a Minister, at the present time there is nothing more important than the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* There has been a tremendous increase in activity and **welfare** devoted towards Aboriginal people throughout the whole of Australia, and I believe that this Government has taken a tremendous interest in these problems.

* My predecessor has done so much over the years to improve the **welfare** of these people, for whom we must have great care.

* In the manner in which government is conducted Australia faces a parting of the ways between those who believe that one can go on and on expanding the public sector and those who believe that the constant emphasis upon the use of general taxation revenues and the expansion of the public sector will lead to a collapse of public service such as social **welfare** in this country.

* We in the Liberal and Country Parties take the view that what is needed in Australia is a mix of public and private expenditure in all these crucial areas of social **welfare** which are so near to the hearts of Australians.

* The community will lose control over the services it is receiving and individuals will cease to have sufficient responsibility for their own care and **welfare**.

* Complete figures were not available for South Australia, but the Department of Social **Welfare** and Aboriginal Affairs reports that 94 Aboriginal children are known to have attended pre-schools in 1969.

* As at 30th June 1969, 342' children were known to the Commissioner of Native **Welfare** to be attending pre-schools in Western Australia.

* In 1969, 540 Aboriginal children were attending Administration (**Welfare** Branch) pre-schools in the Northern Territory; 150 were attending mission pre-schools and 79 were attending community pre-schools operated by the Department of Education and Science - a total of 769 children.

* It is now becoming obvious to anyone with half a brain that with a rising long-term bond rate the pegged concessional rate of interest is producing serious inequities and the benefits of those obtaining **welfare** housing compared to the rest of the community, especially including those without any house at all, are staggering.

* I believe that this Agreement has also created serious social problems because of its discriminatory effect upon those persons in the community unfortunate enough to have to pay the market rate of interest, which may be perhaps 11% per cent or 12 per cent It seems to me to be totally unfair that the action of this Government has forced the majority of home buyers and home builders to pay 4 per cent or 5 per cent more in interest than the select few who will be able to purchase a home as a result of this so-called **welfare** housing agreement.

* The Labor Party 's housing policy states: ... the integration of all housing policies with urban, regional and social **welfare** policies in such a way to ensure that every family can secure accommodation of its own choosing appropriate to its own needs.

* A social **welfare** policy administration will assess claims and provide benefits and allowances.

* It will set safety and health standards and co-ordinate activities across the full range of the social **welfare** area.

* That principle is the need to establish the most rational, just, humane and efficient procedures to administer any social **welfare** scheme from which the whole community benefits and to which the whole community is obliged to contribute.

* What the Fraser Government has sought to do is reverse the historic consensus of a generation of Australian politics, the principle adhered to by successive Labor and Liberal governments, ever since the Second World War that the prime responsibility for social **welfare** and security, and for all reforms and initiatives in this field, rests with the Federal Government.

* As I pointed out last week, that was the underlying motive of the Government in appointing the Bailey and Holmes inquiries into aspects of social **welfare**.

* Expenditure from the National **Welfare** Fund on pensions and benefits payable under the Social Services Act is estimated to be $7390m for 1979-80 which will be an increase of $650m over expenditure in 1978-79.

* The American Health, Education and **Welfare** Committee, which published its report early this year, reached the same sort of conclusions.

* Education and **Welfare** issued on January 31 1971, titled 'Marihuana and Health'.

* We cannot expect and get increased social **welfare** benefits, reduced taxes and other concessions - be paid more and then work less.

* the provision, adequacy and viability of pregnancy support services, adoption services, counselling and other forms of assistance for families, mothers and mothers-to-be, given the social, economic, medical and social **welfare** problems in which they may find themselves involved.

* We are faced by a rising tide of human misery for which our present social **welfare**, health and law enforcement agencies can provide no remedy.

* This would aggravate the fragmentation of community **welfare** services, weaken the capacity for co-operation between such bodies, and defeat the objective of community involvement in regional decision-making on such matters.

* 1 published by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* My Government has also reviewed important aspects of social **welfare**.

* The effective development of an adequate social **welfare** system, to which I have pledged my Government, depends heavily on a good working arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States.

* Too frequently, through shortage of qualified applicants, nonprofessional **welfare** staff has to be appointed.

* At the local level the social worker can provide that human contact which is so essential in any **welfare** program.

* Close to the grass roots, they can mobilise the voluntary organisations already in existence, they can initiate new programs, and act as the pivot in the development of local social **welfare** complexes which may well include **welfare**, officers, youth co-ordinators, home help services, meals on wheels services and so on.

* These Bills support the social **welfare** concept of this Government's policy.

* Conversely, a program of financial assistance in the field of education to provide training facilities is a waste if social **welfare** lacks vision and planning.

* We want increased technology to advance the **welfare** of the whole of the country, but we have to plan for its introduction.

* 1; that is the first report to which the honourable gentleman referred - the Social **Welfare** Commission, .

* Yet just recently the honourable gentleman, referring to the Social **Welfare** Commission's report, said that it was tabled yesterday.

* Does the honourable gentleman also say that the Social **Welfare** Commission report which was tabled on Tuesday is different from the Social **Welfare** Commission report of last year?

* When the Prime Minister announced on 18 February that the Government had asked the Social **Welfare** Commission to examine the Fry Committee report he made this announcement in this House.

* Whilst this may have meant a few weeks' delay, and whilst we have been getting a second opinion on the matter and also asking the Fry Committee to discuss this question with the Social **Welfare** Commission to see what can be done to accelerate the whole program the whole intention of the Government is to accelerate.

* The Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia of May 1971 noted the absence of accurate data on the numbers of handicapped people', in Australia.

* It stated: 
Certainly, if this situation could be improved, then it would mean, not only a reduction in the Government's social **welfare** commitment, but greater production and higher productivity.

* 10 per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public inquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* The composition of the cases in the area is as follows: Deserted wives 335; unemployed 193; people on sickness benefits 51; husbands in gaol 11; temporary crises 174; pensioners 302; unmarried mothers 64; advice only needed 273; referrals from other agencies 28; home visits by Smith Family **welfare** officers 111; migrants 870; food parcels as family hampers 206; food parcels as small hampers 98; clothing issued 694 families; furniture issued to 86 families; and food vouchers for perishables issued to the value of $146.

* While I do not knock that, I point out that because an agency was set up to help people who need social **welfare** $87,000 was obtained for 26 people.

* A pre-school teacher and a **welfare** officer will visit the child care centres on a regular basis and instructive pamphlets will be distributed to parents and child minders.

* I will be largely concentrating on the impact of this Budget and of other Government decisions on agriculture, on country towns, and on the economic and social **welfare** of rural people.

* I wish to touch on the social and economic **welfare** of people living in rural areas.

* Their commitments include the education of their children, looking after the health and **welfare** of their families, paying off their homes and providing their families with what most Australians would consider to be the standard of living to which they are entitled.

* Some of us had hoped that the appointment of a new Minister for the Navy who comes from Sydney would see a mellowing of the old hard line which characterised the attitude of some of his predecessors from Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, none of whom could be expected to have the indigenous interest in Sydney's **welfare** of the present Minister for the Navy  (Dr Mackay).

* I also attended a Conference of Child and Social **Welfare** Ministers held in Tasmania in March 1971 for which the particulars sought were given in my answer to Question No.

* Parramatta Branch of the Young Liberal Movement is active in all matters affecting the **welfare** of young people in the western area.

* It should be compared with what the honourable member for Parramatta says about  Mr Eric  Butler whom he invited to address the Young Liberal Movement in Parramatta and whom he said would inform it on all matters affecting the **welfare** of young people in the western area.

* The Phoenix **Welfare** Association Limited- R. A. Bender, W. T. Schacht, R. Stobbs, R. Pettigrew, J.

* It is not fit to administer the **welfare** of this country if it cannot be honest and open.

* That was the Social **Welfare** Commission- for an outstanding document and I extend my appreciation to the Minister for embracing it and its philosophies.

* A commitment to continue the AAP was in the social **welfare** policy of the Parties.

* Ten per cent of Comonweallh revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries. '

* I would like to refer to the book containing the constitution, rules and platform of the Australian Labor Party and particularly to page 20. which under the heading 'Social **Welfare**' deals with pensions.

* I was dealing with page 20 of the document setting out the Labor Party's constiutiion, platform and rules under the heading 'Social **Welfare**'.

* He worked tirelessly to improve and develop New Zealand's **welfare** state, already one of the most advanced and humane in the world and largely a memorial to his country's first Labour Government.

* He was a man whose own goodness and decency were reflected in the quality of his public life, in the greatness of his leadership and in the dedication he showed in all his words and deeds to the **welfare** of his country and its people.

* So far as the Australian end of the operation is concerned, again a number of special measures have been undertaken which include special language training facilities to assist Turkish migrants to understand and acquire a knowledge of the language, citizenship education courses and an increased number of Turkish speaking **welfare** officers.

* He mentioned that social **welfare** benefits in this country were the rights of certain people.

* I think it is also incumbent on any society, regardless of whether it is affluent or not, to sharpen up in the provision of its social **welfare** benefits, because otherwise we are in danger of creating a **welfare** state.

* I want to look particularly today in speaking to the Social **Welfare** Commission (Repeal) Bill at the role of the Commission and its association with government and also its association with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle).

* I want also to look at where the Social **Welfare** Commission went wrong.

* The honourable member for Maribyrnong mentioned some of the background to the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Some of its activities in the social **welfare** context were referred to the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration.

* A little later I would like to refer to the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration in the context of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* I remind the House that it was the decision of the Labor Government to abolish the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* This should not be underestimated in understanding the rationalisation of establishing bodies such as the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Significantly, although the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Australian Assistance Plan which was generally associated with the Social **Welfare** Commission, he made no mention of the Commission at that stage.

* The Leader of the Opposition's rationalisation for utilising commissions is best summed up in his statement on the establishment of the Children's Commission, when he said: 
It should be noted also that the Social **Welfare** Commission was established as a statutory body, and it must be differentiated from the numerous other advisory committees or task forces.

* I turn now to the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973 which outlines the basic functions of the Commission.

* They are as follows: 
1 ) To ascertain the social **welfare** needs of the community and report these to the Minister.

* To make recommendations for the establishment of a nationally integrated social **welfare** plan including: 
Co-ordination of **welfare** activities- State, local, voluntary 
It is significant to note in the Social **Welfare** Commission report covering the period to 30 June 197S that the Commission chairman, Marie Coleman, said at page 10: 
However, unlike the Universities Commission and the Schools Commission, the Social **Welfare** Commission has only advisory powers and cannot exercise executive powers.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission was directly responsible to the Minister for Social Security.

* The report reads: ... the Social **Welfare** Commission regards social **welfare** as a basic integrated institution in society ensuring not only the provision to all of primary material needs, but also genuine opportunities for social and cultural satisfaction.

* I think it is quite pertinent to quote from page 21 of the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission: 
If one looks at the reasons for the abolition of the Commission I think they can be pin-pointed to two main areas: Firstly, the Minister for Social Security may have found the Social **Welfare** Commission dysfunctional and duplicating work done by the Minister's department, and may have found its reports contributing little to the area of social **welfare**.

* Indeed, the Commission instead of rationalising social **welfare**, only contributed further to the fragmented nature of social **welfare**.

* Although the Commission talked a great deal about regionalisation of social **welfare**, it was the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration which conducted practical experiments into this procedure, which were done at Ringwood, Victoria.

* It was not the Social **Welfare** Commission which did them.

* Thus, the Social **Welfare** Commission received a charter which apparently was intended to give it authority to review the whole field of **welfare** programs and to advise on their rationalisation both from the point of view of policy content and administration.

* It proposed an amalgamation of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Health Services Commission.

* I think that the quotation from  Sir Robert  Menzies' speech is very pertinent to this debate today for the repeal of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act.

* and (2) The number of claims for Social **Welfare** Benefits received in the Australian Capital Territory in 1970-71 (1,749) as compared with 1966-67 (1,352) had increased by 29.4 per cent.

* During the same period the mean population of the 
The increase in total Social **Welfare** Benefit payments between 1966-67 ($16,466) and 1970-71 ($53,226) amounted to 223.3 per cent.

* and (5) Social **Welfare** Benefits are intended primarily to help people awaiting statutory aid, such as deserted wives with children, or persons who are unable to qualify for Commonwealth pensions or benefits and for various reasons cannot support themselves and their families.

* The total amount of $53,226 paid in Social **Welfare** Benefits in the Australian Capital Territory in 1970-71 was distributed as follows: 
In Australia 30 per cent of taxes go to education and social **welfare**.

* Foreign policy must serve the interests and promote the **welfare** and security of the Australian people.

* The total Asian-Pacific partnership is crucial to any efforts we might make to ensure Australia's full and effective contribution to international stability, progress and **welfare**.

* We are, of course, very concerned about the **welfare** of the people who live in these areas.

* I "believe that the Aboriginal community ought to be consulted much more than is being done on matters affecting the **welfare** of that community.

* Before I resume my seat, I would like to bring some **welfare** matters to the notice of the Government.

* As a general rule, the free market forces may be effective in generating an adequate degree of economic **welfare**.

* This was a proper action to take to reduce the demand for housing in the private sector back to the level where supply was able to "cope with demand - for building resources - and also to try to divert resources in into the **welfare** housing field and through the housing money made available through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement.

* I abhor the fact that in doing this in the public interest, at the cost of their own **welfare**, members of the Builders Labourers Federation found that their organisation was deregistered.

* We all know that this Government does not give any thought at all to the vital role our exports play in this nation's economic **welfare**.

* There are a great many middle income earners, single people and wage earners, whose children are self supporting and who will be sacrificed in the name of 'the **welfare** state'.

* We all want to provide proper, progressive and adventurous social **welfare** policies, but we do not want to make Australia a social **welfare** state in its worst form - as England faced.

* This method easily lends itself to being jacked up again for the **welfare** state.

* The Government must recognise that a shorter working week coupled with increasing costs of materials and labour and recurrent strikes will cripple us and remove our capacity to improve health, education and social **welfare** standards in Australia.

* There is to be no increase in funds for **welfare** housing.

* Japan's future course lies in pursuing peace and **welfare**.

* The traditional course of economic growth through massive private equipment investment and exports should be replaced by one with the key emphasis on public investment and **welfare**.

* Of course, there always will be a small percentage which imposes on a social **welfare** benefit.

* So much for the new deal in health and **welfare**.

* It was supported on the limited ground that the bounty would help farmers adjust to higher superphosphate prices and would provide some temporary **welfare** relief.

* All 3 commissioners agreed that the adjustment and **welfare** benefits of the bounty would be achieved by more direct measures at lower cost.

* The Government cannot see that **welfare** measures which assist those least in need are irrational and self-defeating.

* There is a grave difference between the theories of academic economists on tariffs and what we should consider having regard to the **welfare** of the people.

* This is a different criterion from that which the Government has to take, which is to maximise **welfare**.

* Economics is only one part of **welfare**.

* But we believe in protection based on intelligent planning and intelligent economics as applied to the Parliament or the nation, not to the academic textbooks, which completely ignore the **welfare** and the economic lives of people.

* It had been opposed, predictably, by the Left, local government, education and **welfare** lobbies and unions, and also by politicians of both sides, by the Press and by big business.

* The same freeze applied to **welfare** benefits.

* The freeze on **welfare** and public service salaries should be viewed in context.

* **Welfare** payments were generous- perhaps too generous- and public servants enjoy very high pension entitlements at the expense of other taxpayers.

* A declaration may be made if it is held that industial action is adversely affecting the health, safety and **welfare** of the community.

* But it is not necessary to show that industrial action is having an adverse effect on health and safety if it can be shown simply that a strike is against the **welfare** of the community the certificate has to be issued - 
I accept that but I will show that even with those words injected into the provisions of the Bill the situation is still the same.

* If there is a strike involving shipping, transport, the post office or any public facilities, it can be easily argued that the **welfare** of the community is affected by it substantially.

* The legislation subordinates the **welfare** of wool growers to those who thrive on what we call the free enterprise system of marketing.

* This Government has a record of selling out the interests and the **welfare** of the Australian wool grower.

* The efforts that this Government will be putting into getting a satisfactory, worthwhile solution to the various problems in the **welfare** housing field shows that the Government regards this as an absolute top priority.

* The Government believes that many people enjoying the benefits of the **welfare** housing programs in the various States are in a financial position to make more of a contribution towards either the rent or the repayments on the homes they are occupying.

* It is all very well for members of the Opposition and State Labor Party Premiers to mischievously claim that the Government is determined to increase the rents for people in **welfare** housing.

* What this Government believes determinedly is that the people who should have first access to the **welfare** housing units and the people who should be paying nothing more than the minimum repayment or the minimum rent should be the people who have the greatest need.

* We have heard nothing in this regard except abuse in the Press from State Premiers who are taking cheap political points on **welfare** housing by claiming that the Fraser Government is seeking simply to increase the repayments and other dues of people who are in needy circumstances.

* The article in the AGP Journal, contributed by  Dr Kerry  Burrow headed 'Rent a Digger for Two Bucks' is false, untrue, publicly mischievous, misleading, unprofessional, in bad taste and capable of damaging the reputation and future financial **welfare** of the Home.

* of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973, I present a progress report by the Social **Welfare** Commission entitled  Social **Welfare** Manpower.

* But I think we should do a ' number of things to enlarge the provision of health **welfare** services in a way which will absorb or eat up the enormous amount of accumulated reserves which these funds have, and quite unreasonably have, given the fact that the money has been contributed for the provi sion of health services in the community.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* Another misconception is that a Labor government is the only government which can possess an enlightened social **welfare** policy.

* I had referred to the magnanimity of the previous Government in matters of social **welfare** and I was asking how magnanimous was it when it created the highest level of unemployment since the Depression.

* Further, how enlightened was the Labor Government's social **welfare** policy when that Government's permissiveness caused the highest level of inflation in this country's history.

* Where is the enlightened **welfare** policy in a government which imposes that rate of inflation on pensioners?

* That figure was expressed in 1973-74 money terms and did not include all Labor's **welfare** programs.

* I am prepared to admit that in the past both Liberal and Labor Governments have not treated **welfare** recipients as well as they might have.

* Surely that is a desirable economic and **welfare** objective.

* Even the nature of the pension itself should be considered periodically and outside the constraints of contemporary or conventional **welfare** thinking.

* I am pleased to support both Bills and the thrust of the Government's social **welfare** policy generally.

* The thrust of the policy is, firstly, to concentrate resources on areas of need and secondly, to preserve the real value of pensions and other major **welfare** benefits.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* Is there any evidence that the Premier of Queensland will in future change the habits of a lifetime and place the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people before other considerations?

* This Government has done nothing to lift the standard of the **welfare** structure, including child endowment.

* I have said nothing about the people who are kept down under our social **welfare** structure.

* On the other hand, there is no reason why we should discriminate against it especially as, as has been pointed out by many of my colleagues, we are dealing with a social **welfare** question- the right of every Australian citizen, regardless of his income, or whether married or single, to have a decent house and to make decisions which are to their advantage and therefore to the advantage of the community.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought intoline with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* As this debate has proceeded over the past few weeks, I have become increasingly concerned that the **welfare** of the people who are caught up in the middle of the wrangle that is going on between the Commonwealth and the State- that is, the Aborigines- is in some danger.

* The **welfare** of the Aborigines is of paramount importance.

* So the **welfare** of the Aborigines is of paramount importance.

* In those seven decades governments, State and Federal, took little interest in the **welfare** of those people.

* The family allowances plan obviously, therefore, has a dual benefit for the country: Firstly, it introduces a very real measure of social justice into our **welfare** system and, secondly, together with the impact of" personal income tax indexation, it will redirect resources to people in the community who have a much higher propensity to consume.

* Only the remainder will be provided as a new direct subsidy to social **welfare**.

* Secondly, I believe, and my Party believes, very strongly in the principle of a right to **welfare** benefits according to need and not according to any pompous and selfrighteous moral judgment as to the cause of a person's deprivation or disadvantaged position.

* and (2) The Australian Assistance Plan will be developing in response to community reaction to the concepts and procedures outlined by the Social **Welfare** Commission in Discussion Paper No.

* In accordance with the guidelines laid down in the discussion paper it is required that the composition of the Council be as pluralistic as possible thus widening the cross-section of the community which takes decisions on local social **welfare** problems.

* Section 2.3 of the Australian Assistance Plan advises* that: 'Each Regional Council should involve representatives of the Australian, State and Local Governments, trade unions and employer groups, **welfare** consumer groups and non government bodies concerned with social **welfare**.'

* So far within the pilot phase of the Plan the Social **Welfare** Commission has selected a total of 20 regions to be funded to establish and operate Regional Councils for Social Development in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia.

* Of these, 4 will receive in addition block grants paid on a basis of $2 per capita for the support of **welfare** programs proposed by the Regional Councils.

* The excessive consumption of alcohol by a large proportion of Aboriginal people is having a deleterious effect on general **welfare** .

* I would dearly love to have the opportunity to speak about other aspects of this report which relate to Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The belief that government expenditure is evil or wrong or has an insidious effect upon the community's **welfare** is totally wrong.

* This is the very basis of the supply of all our social needs- education, health and all **welfare** services.

* It will allow for a more sensitive application of funds for social **welfare** benefits and the more efficient use of our huge resource of dedicated volunteers in the charity field.

* The facts are that there are not viable plans for solving inflation, that there is not a solitary care for unemployed people, that there is no semblance of planning or concern in the fields of social **welfare**, health, urban planning, Aboriginal affairs, the aged or education.

* Take this as an example: 
I now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will always guide your deliberations and further the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* Despite the imposition of external pressures on the negotiations, particularly on the Aborigines, by people who were pushing their own barrow and who had no interest whatsoever in the **welfare** of Aborigines but only in their own hysterical opposition to uranium mining, I think it certainly says a great deal for all sides that the negotiations were successfully completed.

* I agree with the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  who recognised and who stated in this House, albeit indirectly, that many people who were interfering in the Aboriginal negotiations had no basic interest whatsoever in the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people and were involved in this matter simply to further their own particular cause.

* The State Social **Welfare** Minister,  Mr Dixon,  telegramed two Federal Ministers warning of the possibility of family breakdown if the benefits were not paid.

* The State's Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Dixon,  said: It's stupid to use unemployment benefits as a possible lever in an industrial dispute and such a move would be ill-advised and ill-considered.'

* This afternoon we have heard Opposition speakers very clearly illustrate that the Government cannot continue to pass the buck in regard to responsibility for Aboriginal **welfare**.

* I believe that he had a genuine interest in the **welfare** of these people and certainly a genuine interest in the social work that  Mrs Wilding  was carrying out.

* Yet I suggest that it was the influence of this gentleman in particular, who has taken action in the past to prevent  Mrs Wilding  from receiving the assistance that may have been accorded to her by the Department for the carrying on of the very essential and valuable work that she had undertaken at Mount Gravatt, which has driven her to resign and driven her out of the hostel in order to illustrate the frustrations which she has faced, in working for the **welfare** of Aboriginals, through the incompetence of the Government.

* The Minister who at present administers the Department must bear a heavy responsibility for the failure to see the problems not only in this field but also in other areas of Aboriginal **welfare** in Queensland which are developing so quickly that it is almost too late to overcome them.

* Aged or Disabled Persons' **Welfare** Program which provides assistance to

* To make grants to eligible national **welfare** organisations to assist in their operations.

* is to establish Regional Councils for Social Development whose function is to stimulate interest and activity in the broad field of social development, to give added impetus to initiatives within the region, to provide a wider range of **welfare** services and to test innovative programmes for service delivery.

* To extend direct migrant **welfare** services to areas of need within the community which could not readily be covered by the Department's resources.

* the salaries of **welfare** officers of Senior Citizens ' Centres employed wholly or mainly in caring for the aged.

* As set out in the Homeless Persons Assistance Act grants and subsidies are payable to approved non-profit, local government non-profit organisations and government bodies providing approved services (meals, accommodation and social **welfare** services), at a centre wholly or mainly devoted to homeless persons.

* Grants have been made available under a pilot program to five organisations in Sydney and five organisations in Melbourne for the appointment of a **welfare** rights officer to provide ethnic and other disadvantaged groups with information, referral and advisory services.

* Grants are payable to community based **welfare** organisations to assist in the establishment of 12 new community information centres.

* Financial assistance is available to community **welfare** agencies in financial need due to increased administrative costs or decreased revenue from other sources.

* Under the AAP, Capitation Grants (at the annual rate of up to $2 per head of population in the region) are available to twelve Regional Councils to fund approved social **welfare** projects in their respective regions.

* Projects proposed by individual groups or people in the community are required to be of a social **welfare** nature and to be recommended for my approval by the relevant Regional Council.

* already engaged in migrant **welfare** or prepared to undertake this work; 
unable to extend otherwise its **welfare** service because of existing financial limitations; 
The AAP was proposed by the Social **Welfare** Commission as a Discussion Paper 'pilot' program, funds for which were included in Appropriation Bills No.

* (a) The Aged Persons **Welfare** Program is widely publicised by way of information booklets, brochures, various other governmental publications and promotional drives by Departmental officers, backed in some cases with publicity films.

* I tabled in the Parliament the Social **Welfare** Commission's Discussion Paper No.

* Regular consultation has been maintained between the migrant **welfare** staff of the State Offices and voluntary agencies active in providing a **welfare** service to the migrant community.

* Migrant **welfare** staff in the normal course of liaison work with ethnic groups have made known the provisions of the scheme.

* (a) Applications lodged under the Aged for Disabled Persons **Welfare** Program are as follows: 

 Mrs M. Nott who is suitably qualified, conducted the research into community **welfare** needs in isolated parts of the Jericho Shire.

* The research program was to ascertain the social **welfare** resources and needs of Shire residents.

* These seminars enable various aspects of expanding and improving Meals on Wheels and other **welfare** services to be explored and also provide a forum for varying viewpoints to be expressed.

* The Government's **welfare** reforms.

* Involving, as it does, the **welfare** of tens of thousands of Australian families, this matter of urgency is of the utmost importance.

* The passage of almost 2 years since its introduction in January last year has dramatically highlighted in the most compelling way the failure of a system whose objective is not the **welfare** of people, but the protection of property and profit for vested interests in the medical insurance business and the propagation of party dogma at any expense to the community.

* Did he receive advice from the former Minister for Immigration that it was proposed to establish in the City of Parramatta an office of the Department of Immigration to assist particularly in the fields of local migrant **welfare**, information, education and the issue of passports 
If so, what proposals does his Department now have to provide a specialised service for migrants in the Western Suburbs in the special field of migrant **welfare**.

* It will be required to conduct its operations in a proper and workmanlike manner and, in accordance with good industrial practices, to look after the safety, health and **welfare** of persons engaged in those operations.

* The Budget will provide for taxation reductions, pension increases, social services, the lifting of the means test, housing, health, education, child **welfare**, estate duty, Aborigines, defence, shipping, airlines, gift duty, nursing homes, special grants and fares for the unemployed.

* He mentioned the figure of $375m and I assume he was referring to **welfare** housing.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* Personal income tax receipts are decreasing whereas social **welfare** payments, which this Government, unlike the previous one, has indexed, are increasing.

* The proposed scheme is concerned with the **welfare** of children, with particular emphasis on the **welfare** of those children in special need of alternative care while their parents are working, sick or otherwise unable to care for them.

* I emphasise again that it is directed towards the **welfare** of children, especially those who face disabilities which could affect their full development as individuals.

* In all, these measures, taken together with other matters of a **welfare** nature, will involve an expenditure in excess of $2,000m.

* This benefit will be of enormous assistance to all those pensioners and widows with dependent children, and indicates the concern of this Government to provide for their **welfare** and assistance.

* After 23 years of Liberal rule, during which time the Minister for Civil Aviation was a Queenslander and so much neglect was apparent in Brisbane, it is astounding to hear these people suddenly take an interest in the **welfare** of Brisbane and its people.

* I should like to quote the Speech of the Queen in regard to social **welfare**: It stated: 
The betterment of Australia's social **welfare** system remains a major objective of my Government.

* Surely the Government, with its social **welfare** scheme, will not be able to generate the sort of capital that is necessary to dig trenches, to build drains, and to service blocks of land.

* All of these points have been detailed in that sample survey which has been submitted to the poverty inquiry and I repeat that I hope that very soon I can release that report so that we can kill some of this most obnoxious, unfair and in too many cases thoroughly dishonest misrepresentation which has been broadcast in the community in an effort to discredit the development of a comprehensive system of social security benefits and social **welfare** services which are based on a truly liberal philosophy in which the dignity of the individual is respected and his right to self-realisation and achievement in society is fostered in every reasonable sort of way.

* Its achievements in social **welfare** services and benefits to date, in really such a short time, are so significant and are such an advance on what has gone before that the public confidence and respect in identifying the Labor Party in this way is clearly well placed.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has indicated that he is prepared to engage in discussions between the returned soldiers and the Regular Defence Forces **Welfare** Association on aspects of these matters as the Government's decision is studied.

* Pursuant to the provisions of the Services Trust Funds Act 1947-1950 I present the annual reports of the Australian Military Forces Relief Trust Fund, the Royal Australian Navy Relief Trust Fund and the Royal Australian Air Force **Welfare** Trust Fund for the year ended 30 June 1973, together with the reports of the Auditor-General on the books and accounts of the funds.

* Benevolent trusts, **welfare** organisations, parent bodies and other groups will be involved.

* In their minds there will never be a time for **welfare**.

* Concern has also been expressed by local **welfare** workers and a host of other people.

* However, I know, as I think other honourable members know, of particular examples which indicate that some savings can be made in the proper administration of **welfare** services.

* Similarly, where people have been able improperly to receive unemployment benefits, we need to have a system that is capable of catching those people who take advantage of our **welfare** systems.

* I do not think that anybody can logically disagree with that, although the very nature of the way in which we approach these matters demands some sensitivity particularly for the people who are in the unfortunate position of having to need **welfare** payments.

* We will see demographic changes in Australia which will necessitate a much more fundamental review of our **welfare** systems.

* I believe that greater regard has to be had to the needs and the aspirations of those who have to pay the **welfare** benefits- the taxpayers.

* I think that they demand that we look responsibly at the **welfare** programs that we undertake in Australia and set about reaching the needy people as distinct from those who are able to get in on the act.

* I heard the honourable member for Batman  (Mr Howe)  tonight arguing about principles in relation to **welfare** payments, equality of opportunity and need.

* He really did not apply the principles but used them as a basis for arguing for a much wider **welfare** system than the one we have.

* In the broad areas we need to come to grips with the total situation of the people who are claiming **welfare** benefits.

* In considering programs as a Government and as a Parliament we have to look at need not with a broad brush approach adding a little to the lot of everybody who happens to be a **welfare** beneficiary but, as has been done in this Budget, we have to be prepared to look much more conscientiously at the needs of people.

* Instead of increasing broadly across the range of **welfare** benefits, we have to develop specific programs to meet those needs.

* the Attorney-General, the Director of Counselling and **Welfare** or their officers; and 
proceedings before the Full Court under the provisions of section 94.

* ( 1 ) Where a party to a matter before a Family Court or a court discharging the functions of a Family Court so requests, the Director of Counselling and **Welfare** shall assign an adviser to him.

* The betterment of Australia's social **welfare** system remains a major objective of my Government.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission will develop the Australian Assistance Plan.

* Will the National Commission on Social **Welfare** wait until the National Compensation Inquiry and other **welfare** inquiries have been completed, so that it does not examine areas that specialist committees are investigating.

* It is the **welfare** problem.

* There can be no question that a **welfare** problem exists in the beef industry.

* Certainly, when the Opposition was in Government it never faced up to the problem of rural poverty and rural **welfare** payments in this situation.

* They did nothing at all about rural poverty or **welfare** payments to the rural sector when the situation became crucial.

* Social **Welfare** Commission (Repeal) Act, 1976 s. 8 
Child **Welfare** Ordinance, 1957 s. 14(2) (c), 14(3) 
-Melbourne is the third largest Greek speaking city in the world.

* In the third largest Greek speaking city in the world there is a migrant service **welfare** section eroding away in the Department of Social Security.

* The two specific matters to which I wish to refer are the migrant services **welfare** section and the migrant English classes conducted at the Church of All Nations in Carlton, in my electorate.

* Migrant **welfare** courses were begun under the Labor Government and proved extremely successful.

* We know who else is losing in this tug of war- the working class migrants whose **welfare** has been long forgotten.

* Whenever the Minister for Social Security and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic affairs are challenged they quote figures for the whole branch rather than for the migrant **welfare** section.

* There is also concern among trained migrant **welfare** staff about new staff replacements.

* It is a reflection on the Government in reiterating its disregard for migrants by placing their **welfare** in the hands of unqualified staff.

* For instance, the migrant services outreach program has been taken from a competent migrant **welfare** officer and placed in the hands of a woman with no casework or community work experience with migrants.

* As there is a greater influx of clients to migrant **welfare** there is a decrease in **welfare** personnel and services are impaired.

* It is reflected in the section's channelisation into the benefits and pensions issue of **welfare**, rather than the integration and settlement areas which are the section's responsibility.

* This is apart from concern about the amounts of money which have been set aside for social **welfare**.

* What steps has the Government taken to develop a program to implement the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** in its report 'Drug Problems in Australia-an intoxicated Society'.

* In real terms, spending on Aboriginal housing has fallen by 28.5 per cent since the last Labor Budget; on Aboriginal health by 28.7 per cent; on Aboriginal education by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs by 20.3 per cent; on Aboriginal employment programs by 5.9 per cent; on Aboriginal **welfare** by 4.9 per cent; on Aboriginal enterprises- that is, selfmanagement by 70.5 per cent; on town management and public utilities by 50.5 per cent; on cultural and recreational funding by 33.8 per cent; and on legal aid by 15.8 per cent.

* He has placed mining ahead of Aboriginal **welfare** and well-being.

* How many **welfare** officers are now subsidised under the Act.

* Are any subsidies paid in respect of the salaries of **welfare** officers or social workers employed by local government authorities.

* Indeed, it has reduced the amount available for **welfare** for aged people and young people.

* I think it is proof that all parties in this Parliament are co-operating for the **welfare** of the Aboriginal.

* The churches are also heavily committed to assisting Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The guilt feeling which had been building up for some time found its expression in the referendum of 1967 when nearly 90 per cent of voters supported the proposition that Aboriginals should be counted as Australians and that the Federal Government should have power to make laws for their **welfare**.

* It is a tragedy that he will not be able to follow these through, but I am sure that the honourable member will never lose his intense interest in the **welfare** of the Aboriginal race.

* Some people restrict this concern and emotional discomfort to the **welfare** of race horses.

* We are worried about the **welfare** of the people of the Territory.

* This is one of a number of matters at present being considered by a Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Since 1 have had the honour of being a Minister I have always appreciated their dedication to the **welfare** of ex-servicemen.

* There are also pockets of depression within our rural industries and, I suppose, not only within our apple industries, where one must suggest that some sort of a **welfare** payment be considered.

* Social **Welfare** Commission (xiii) 
The Social **Welfare** Commission was abolished in 1976.

* If you were to say to these people who find a burden the amount that they are now paying in rates out of their weekly wage that they should in turn provide themselves with their own social **welfare** programs it would seem very incongruous.

* I think that those of us who have been interested in Aboriginal **welfare** will agree that it is not easy to get the more vociferous Aboriginal spokesmen to work within what might be termed the Public Service structure.

* In hospital and health care in the central coast electorate of Robertson over $6m has been spent in education it has been $3m; in **welfare** $1,650,000; in seen and telecommunications work almost $3m; in sport and recreation facilities $2.3m; in tourism $3.3m, with the acquisition of shares in the Old Sydney Town project; in major drainage works $1.5m; curbing, guttering and footpath paving- a lot of these projects carried out through the Regional Employment Development scheme- in excess of $lm; in water reticulation, $1,124,000; and in recreation, council parks and gardens, nearly $700,000.

* We are following up every possible avenue such as in the fields of postal services and telecommunications, education, sewerage and social **welfare**.

* Public benevolent institutions, including those concerned with the **welfare** of blind persons, are entitled to exemption from sales tax on goods acquired for their own use and not for resale.

* We must remember that the Australian Council of Social Services is an organisation of **welfare** people who are involved with the poorer sections of the community.

* Dr Sax,  who was the head of that Commission, did an excellent job and has now been appointed as the head of a new social **welfare** policy secretariat.

* That emphasises the relationship between health and social **welfare**.

* We are talking about the relationship between health and social **welfare** because we know that ill health is one of the main contributing factors to persons finishing up on invalid pensions and on other kinds of pensions and benefits, including unemployment benefits and special benefits.

* The purpose of the Bill is to provide for direct matching grants for the States for a range of home care services and for the salaries of approved **welfare** officers employed at or in association with senior citizen centres.

* The Act broadly provides three forms of assistance: One, the home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance to aged persons in their own homes; two, the building and equipping of senior citizen centres; and three, the employment of **welfare** officers by or in association with senior citizen centres.

* The legislation also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre.

* The intensely political nature of the lobby and political groups concerned about old people's **welfare** is one of the things that strikes the politician.

* On television last night he was asked about his undertaking that education, health, **welfare** and urban programs would be retained.

* By promising that health, education, **welfare** and urban programs would not be curtailed in the present financial year the Government was able to disguise its intentions for subsequent years.

* 1 ) What is the current establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* These areas are in government expenditure, wages and salaries, and social security and social **welfare**.

* His  last Minister for Social Security conducted an attack on voluntary **welfare** agencies and took away the basic support which they need to do work which is invaluable in the social security and **welfare** areas.

* The Government's approach to social **welfare** is based on the Government's commitment to the value of each person, to each person's right to dignity and self-respect and to his right to make his own decisions.

* It is based also on the Government's recognition that there are limited resources to devote to the general **welfare** area and that those resources that are available must be devoted, first of all, to helping those who are disadvantaged.

* There are within St George a great many charitable organisations, benevolent associations, the Red Cross and a large number of similar groups working for the **welfare** of the community.

* Of course I agree that the construction of the Monduran Dam and the associated works and weirs on the Kolan and Burnett Rivers are essential for the **welfare** of the sugar industry in the area.

* The arguments relating to the environment and the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people are tremendously compelling.

* There was a demurrer from the Priorities Review Committee and one from the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* If the honourable gentleman wishes to quote from the speech of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  let us go on from the part where he refers to the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Priorities Review staff.

* The report which the Prime Minister had long before I did, and which I call the Coleman report or the Social **Welfare** Commission report, refers to the need to spend $130m.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission report speaks about the areas where it considers priority would be given.

* Later I shall outline the multitudinous problems that a society such as ours creates when its elderly citizens, both superannuitants and pensioners, after a lifetime of contributing to the **welfare** and prosperity of Australia, are given a small1 pittance to eke out a subsistence living and are then forgotten.

* lt is a measure of the Government's inability to get to grips wtih the problems of aged people that we now see another few small attempts to patch up the present creaking social **welfare** legislation.

* We also talked with council officers, school teachers, local graziers, business people, police, a doctor, a Child **Welfare** officer, ministers of religion and publicans.

* Figures we were able to collect were as follows, and these are only estimates, as no accurate figures appear to be available: 
The honourable member referred to the 87.75 per cent increase in social **welfare** funding in the 
The humanitarian arm of the nation's migration policy has only latterly been strengthened to deal with the situation that we ourselves have created.

* The council in that area has done more in social **welfare** at the grass roots level than the State and Federal governments put together.

* It is not my intention to enter in any detail into the multitude of aspects that apply in these particular areas of health and **welfare**.

* I have no doubt that they will continue to contribute to the **welfare** and development of this country.

* The Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  has made clear a number of times that in his recommendat.ons in the field of social **welfare** he was determined to beat the levels which Professor Henderson has described as th: poverty line.

* Reading the publications of the Australian Government Social **Welfare** 
I have always advocated very strongly the decentralisation of the activities of both Commissions.

* I resent very much the accusations that are often thrown by the Opposition at members of my party, in particular that we lack appreciation of the needs and **welfare** of the working people in country electorates.

* I have available a quotation which I have not used to political advantage but which I am prepared to use- 
We understand that the Department of Social **Welfare** refuses to accept that the husband's liability has been established and has asked  Mrs X  to obtain independent evidence.

* Private investment is essential for the **welfare** of the economy and the maintenance of full employment.

* Australia's history is characterised not by examples of people seeking more and more dependence on government but by people with the courage, the ambition and the common sense to improve their lot, and in so doing play their role in contributing to the national resource- the fund from which general standards in health, education, **welfare** and other avenues can be improved.

* There are others that might have been, such as the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission went very wrong.

* Those who reflect on the history of the Social **Welfare** Commission will be able to see how, if I am right as to the structure that these bodies ought to have, the Social **Welfare** Commission was wrong as it was put forward originally.

* 1 149 on the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health  (Hansard,  12 October 1976, pages 1784-5).

* She receives child **welfare** assistance but no medical subsidies, which are so essential for any person with young children.

* If she were over 50 years of age she could qualify for a B class widow's pension, but the ludicrous situation is that the B class pension is less than what would be paid to her in child **welfare** assistance.

* We should make the **welfare** of the.

* I am sure that if we were to be as diligent and spend so much money on the **welfare** of those people better results would be obtained.

* In return it imposes regulations concerning safety and other matters, including the **welfare** of passengers and crew.

* The subsidy provisions stand in isolation as **welfare** measures which will' discourage the forms of rural adjustment proven to be necessary.

* The wool price subsidy can be justified on economic and **welfare** grounds only if the collateral provisions to promote restructuring are substantially more far reaching and effective than the current reluctant attempt to admit the need.

* If the problems of individual **welfare** and political considerations are to determine eco.omic policies for rural industry the result will be chaos, increasing charges on the taxpayer and a progressive loss of export market outlets.

* The trust will give consideration to giving financial support to any proposals put forward by community organisations which are designed to involve young people in the life and **welfare** of the community.

* It has now entered the wider role of providing **welfare**, which is urgently needed in the Australain community.

* The honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  made, in his ministerial capacity, direct subsidies available to his own local government area in the form of a subsidy to a **welfare** officer.

* But the Warringah Shire Council was able to attract from the Commonwealth Government a part subsidy towards the salary of a **welfare** officer.

* Firstly,  1  should like to thank the Minister for the Interior  (Mr Nixon), Mr Giese  and the officers of the **Welfare** Branch in all the places that we visited for their co-operation in making a fairly short visit to the Northern Territory as informative and educational as possible.

* I intend to devote the rest of my time tonight to speaking about the situation at Wattie Creek near the Wave Hill **welfare** settlement where a group of Aboriginals have been living for several years.

* In August  1966  there was a strike, for award wages, on many pastoral stations in the Northern Territory and at that time a group of Aboriginal people - most of them were Gurindjis - went to camp near the Wave Hill **welfare** settlement and later to their present site at Wattie Creek.

* The annual report of the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory for  1968-69  makes this comment: 
Although the **Welfare** Branch ascribes motives with which I do not agree, it agrees that the Aboriginals at Wattie Creek have a strong attachment to the land in that area.

* One of the problems throughout all of these situations is that the **Welfare** Branch of the Northern Territory Administration, the State Department of Aboriginal Affairs, or whoever the administration might be, always knows best.

* But it is not without its disadvantages as well and I will quote from the report of the **Welfare** Branch for 1967-68 in which it said about Wave Hill: 
Wave Hill **Welfare** Centre is situated 280 miles south west of Katherine, near the Wave Hill Police Station.

* I believe the reason that they choose to live at Wattie Creek is that they desire to be independent from the cattle properties, particularly Vestey's, and the **Welfare** Branch for part of the year.

* I again turn back to reports of the **Welfare** Branch in recent years.

* In 1967-68 it had this to say: 
That is the **Welfare** Branch - for assistance in recruiting Aboriginal labour.

* Again in the following year in the **Welfare** Branch report we find the comment that the labour demand was strong.

* The report stated: 
Is he able to say whether similar surveys are carried out in other advanced countries; if so, do these surveys form the basis of **welfare** policies in those countries.

* If the position is as stated will he direct that this important survey be conducted and repeated at reasonable intervals so that the **welfare** policies of Australia can be continually improved by regular comparison with other comparable countries.

* The membership should consist of three - a mother experienced in social **welfare**, a medical practitioner and a criminologist.

* The commissioners should have access to the records of all Federal authorities, including health, social security, matrimonial causes and income tax authorities, and should have power to seek the cooperation of the respective State authorities in these jurisdictions, including the State law enforcement and child **welfare** agencies; as far as practicable, the commissioners should comprise a mother who is experienced in social **welfare** work, a medical practitioner and a criminologist; and the commissioners should be assisted by senior counsel and have power to sit in camera.

* I accept that as I assume we all do as social justice which has motivated not only modern social **welfare** states but many other earlier and even ancient societies.

* Considering the importance of international relations to the future **welfare** of this country, the contributions made tonight by the leaders of the Opposition have been, to say the least, pitiful.

* Above all, the Government is responsible for the future **welfare** of our own people and has demonstrated that at all times it is prepared to support the interests of the people of Australia.

* We saw the change of the very generous Commissioner for Housing loans scheme from a general incentive scheme for relocated public servants to a **welfare** scheme aimed predominantly at helping the people who are most in need of assistance.

* We have seen rents on government housing increased to ensure that it is a **welfare** scheme for those who need help rather than a handout to some people who have no claim to subsidised accommodation.

* But there have been increases in essential community service areas such as servicing and caretaking of government dwellings, recreational, cultural and community services, fire brigade and bus services, maintenance of parks and gardens, lighting and cleaning, police and- of very great importance- social **welfare**.

* In fact, the Seaman Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission estimated that the cost of building an aged persons home in Rockhampton- my friend from Kennedy  (Mr Katter)  might support me in this- is 40 per cent higher than the cost of building an aged persons home in Brisbane.

* The American Samoan delegate commented that delegates 'must consider the **welfare** .

* Inflation menaces the **welfare** of every Australian citizen.

* In concluding my remarks on the rural section I point out that the essential difference between the Government's policy and the Opposition's policy is that the Government endeavours to implement the policy of the primary producers expressed through their elected representatives, while the Opposition in a blatant vote catching exercise supports generally the dissentient minority without regard to the **welfare** of the industry and those engaged in it.

* **Welfare** politics in Australia today is currently dominated by powerful lobby groups representing the interests of the aged, the invalid and the veteran.

* In 1 974, the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission made it quite clear that the Commission does not see itself as a social **welfare** agency.

* This we should do because the **welfare** of any individual is a function not so much of his own income but of the combined income of the family or household of which he or she is a member.

* It says that it is concerned with economic stability, economic **welfare**, proper uses of resources and, of course, the **welfare** of the whole country in terms of defence.

* Whilst the decrease in unemployment figures since the election of the Labor Government indicates an improvement in the economic **welfare** of the country, does the Minister have any figures indicating whether the reduction in the unemployment figures is the total measure of the buoyancy of the economy and the benefits that flow to those seeking work?

* His  creed was based on two fundamental principles: The Catholic Church tended one's spiritual **welfare**; the Australian Labor Party protected one's temporal **welfare**.

* Did the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** submit its.

* This raises the very vexed question of the extension of **welfare** provisions to the island and the concomitant extension of taxation laws.

* In our view, this can be done only if we extend the Australian **welfare** system to the island.

* Once the fairly elaborate **welfare** system which exists in Australia is extended to Norfolk Island, then the unavoidable consequence is that we must also extend to the island the taxation laws which apply on the Australian mainland.

* Again we have a situation on Christmas Island where there are no **welfare** provisions for residents, except a very unsatisfactory ad hoc arrangement.

* Again, we find that the Government baulks at the question of the extension of taxation and **welfare** provisions to Norfolk Island, still leaving it with a no-man's land relationship with Australia.

* -The provisions of the two Bills fulfil the stated aims of the Government in regard to this area of health and **welfare**.

* Despite a hostile Senate and a media partial to the Liberal-Country Party coalition, the Labor Government after assuming office on 2 December 1972 had a magnificent record of achievement particularly in regard to social **welfare**, child care, education, health, legal aid and direct monetary grants to local government.

* Firstly, I will mention social **welfare** which has top priority because many age and invalid pensioners reside in my electorate of Sydney.

* It will be recalled that previous LiberalNational Country Party coalition governments saw fit to discriminate against various recipients of social **welfare** benefit.

* The Government has always displayed a general disregard for the **welfare** of the  4i  million men and women employees of the nation's workforce.

* Yet when there is the possibility of export rape seed, field peas, feed barley, and six-row barley we find that investment and effort have not been put into the production of seed crops, some old and some new, which could very welt have a marked effect on the future export potential and **welfare** of this country.

* We say in our advertisements that that is because Medibank, like other social **welfare** services, will be financed by money from taxation revenue.

* We state unequivocally that Medibank is free in that sense because like other social **welfare** services it will be financed by money from tax revenue.

* Unlike the year by year ad hoc-ery of Liberal-Country Party attempts, the Budget is drawn up around carefully framed programs- education programs, health programs, social **welfare** programs, urban improvement programs and others.

* These are vital questions that should be considered by the Committee and for that reason, among many others, including the **welfare** of the people, I consider this as a vital matter.

* **Welfare** must be taken into consideration - the **welfare** of the people of the north and of our original Australians, the Aborigines, who have a special claim for attention and consideration by the Committee.

* He saw both as obsolete obstructions to his vision for an Australia united for the **welfare** of all Australians wherever they may live or wherever they were bom.

* There has been too much glib talk about what has been described as the escalation of allocations to the social **welfare** budget.

* I have been interested to observe the way in which a large number of countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development have tended in recent years to move in a similar direction in their social **welfare** policies.

* We have to be very careful when we transfer hidden or disguised social **welfare** payments that are delivered through a reduction of tax liability that would have been payable but for the concession to a particular category of person.

* It has become quite clear that it is very difficult to compare the position of one country with another in terms of percentages of public expenditure as against the gross domestic product when one country pays social **welfare** benefits not only to the needy in the sense that they are poor, but to the needy in the sense that they have dependent children whatever their level of income.

* The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is finding that it is terribly difficult to compare the position of one country this year with its situation last year because countries are changing the proportions of their social **welfare** packages which they deliver by way of explicit payment as compared with those that they provide through a tax rebate or tax concession.

* Because there is not an adequate realisation that one can achieve the same social **welfare** goals through these alternative means, we sometimes find that governments through their income tax system pursue policies which are contradictory to those that are pursued through their social **welfare** system.

* I suspect that one of the grave problems that confronts many families in Australia is that that very paradox exists in Australia today where, through the social **welfare** system, we are seeking to do one thing and we are undermining the attainment of the goals we are trying to achieve by the sort of tax system that we are operating.

* Therefore, I presume that when the honourable member for Perth said tonight that he agreed with **welfare** payments being made to people who were poor, who were in need, then he takes a very narrow definition of need.

* Is it not better to expose the whole social **welfare** program so far as children are concerned by paying cash benefits.

* The point I want to make is that we have a confused debate about the quantum of resources being spent on **welfare**.

* What were the names and portfolios of the Ministers who attended the Conference of Child **Welfare** Ministers in Hobart on 18th March 1971?

* Indeed, we seek to have more government information centres, such as the Northwest One-stop **Welfare** Centre which is covered in the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet made available in country areas.

* Perhaps he could be invited to open the new Community **Welfare** Centre, one suggested.

* I turn now,  Mr Speaker,  to some account of the restoration and problems associated with matters such as communications, accommodation, transport, health, Aboriginal **welfare**, port facilities, works and services, education, business, social **welfare** services and sports and entertainment.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* In answer to an interjection of mine he said that he received his information from the Government members Health and **Welfare** Committee.

* I suggest to the honourable gentleman that the Health and **Welfare** Committee does not know what the Government is going to do.

* We have provided subsidies for **welfare** workers.

* He also mentioned in some detail the situation of **welfare** workers and social workers in relation to grants administered by the Department of Social Security.

* The honourable member mentioned the matter of **welfare** workers but he should understand that until recently the rules of the scheme did not permit **welfare** workers  to  be employed.

* However, if he reads the statement made by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on Budget night he will see that agreement in principle has now been obtained for **welfare** workers to be employed under this scheme.

* It is expected that a small number of grants for **welfare** officers will be possible this financial year.

* Can the Minister for Immigration inform the House what measures are being taken by the Government to overcome the drastic shortage of interpreters to assist migrants with little or no English in such matters as contracts, court cases and government **welfare** services?

* We are constantly being criticised on our social security and **welfare** policies.

* Yet within the context of overall economic responsibility the Commonwealth Government has continued to give high priority to income security and social **welfare** needs.

* Total spending on social security and **welfare** will increase by 9.6 per cent to $8,900m in 1979-80.

* The total expenditure on age pensions is estimated to rise to $3, 530m, almost 40 per cent of the total **welfare** budget.

* Most of us believed that economic circumstances were such that it would not be possible for the Government to go ahead with the development of these social **welfare** policies.

* For the information of honourable members I present the first report of the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission covering the period 3 April to 30 June 1973.

* I have sought to highlight that the **welfare** of Australia as a whole and Australia's capacity to care for the social and **welfare** needs of her people increasingly will depend on the economic prosperity of northern Australia.

* I think that all honourable members on this side of the House, and I am sure quite a few honourable members on the other side, would agree that there is a need for a much more comprehensive programme for the **welfare** and housing of Aboriginals.

* So the people who are concerned with **welfare** matters at the reserve are faced continually with the problem of finding sufficient housing for Aboriginals.

* These are significant and perhaps more dramatic steps than many of the others which have been taken, but the other measures in this social **welfare** Budget - and that is what it is - are also sensible and helpful.

* It is a social **welfare** Budget.

* This Budget is charting a course in social **welfare** which cannot ever be reversed.

* Let the Opposition's mates, the people like the friends of the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner),  be put aside because what counts here is the people of Australia, not Woodside Burmah, not a particular company, not interstate rivalries, not inter-party rivalries, but the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* Should this policy be pursued recklessly, as I fear that it may be, the ultimate benefit to the people of New South Wales- the employment situation, the **welfare** of many employees within the State- will be greatly damaged by that Government's policy.

* The first is in connection with the appropriation by the Government for what is erroneously, I think, described as **welfare** housing.

* I should not like anybody in this Government to say to anybody in the Australian Capital Territory that this Government is spending more on **welfare** or government housing.

* The way I work it out is that in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory there will be a loss of 600 dwellings this year in the so-called **welfare** section.

* The greatest gift that all Australian Labor Party members could give this nation would be to give up their seats, but I do not see them rushing in to make what would be their sole valuable contribution to the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* Although I have had considerable disagreement with him in the past on certain subjects, I am firmly convinced that he - like the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  who also struck stormy times - is a man who was sincerely motivated in his interest in the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* I now come to the provisions of the Bill which are specifically oriented towards the family and the **welfare** of children.

* No worthwhile government will ever feel that it has solved all the social **welfare** problems which confront it, but it will always seek to deal with them as best as it can within available resources.

* This Government places its greatest emphasis upon improvements in social **welfare**.

* It is depressing, but not especially surprising, to learn that the Fraser Government's attitude towards public funding and support of culture and the arts in Australia bears the same shortsighted, cynical and ultimately irresponsible hallmarks as do the Government's other policies such as those to do with the economy, the social **welfare** structure, education, migrant **welfare** and so many other areas.

* -I enter this grievance debate because I am concerned about the **welfare** of the people of Australia and particularly about the **welfare** of the people of my electorate of Stirling.

* As I have said, I fear for the **welfare** of the people of my electorate of Stirling because I fear that the coming Budget will be a harsh one.

* As a consequence of the inflationary problem the Government is putting measures in train to overcome the fundamental economic problems, and provide a more sound basis for improvements in social **welfare**.

* I have to remind the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  that despite what he has outlined as a wonderful social **welfare** programme, the simple fact as contained in the Budget papers themselves indicate that this year we will be spending an only slightly higher proportion of our total domestic outlay on social **welfare** compared with expenditure in the 2 previous years.

* The Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who preceded me in this debate, had a lot to say about social **welfare** programmes, but he did not say what was being done in the Budget about the unemployment benefit.

* I hope that very shortly the 48 multi-lingual **welfare** officers will complete their training and be in the field, bringing to the migrant settlers, particularly those with language problems, therange of help and guidance that is available.

* But speaking generally, I hope that the extension of the emergency interpreter services, telephone services, the appointment of the 48 multi-lingual **welfare** officers who will shortly be in the field, and steps like these will put the shysters out of business and give the newcomers a better deal.

* The Minister for Social Security has informed me that  Ms Learner  was appointed on 27 May 1975 as a consultant to the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* Her  appointment is for a period of two years to establish whether there is a need for a body such as a National Council for Social **Welfare** Education in Australia to co-ordinate **welfare** education.

* We know that the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health Services specifically recommended in its first report that if devolution of Commonwealth programs to the States was to be successful the basic arrangements as to capital and operating expenditures should be outlined clearly in an agreement.

* Is it because honourable members opposite care one jot about the **welfare** of the District Commissioner in Rabaul?

* The fundamental question today is not whether the District Commissioner was on leave: it is the miserable effort by honourable members opposite to use a public servant in Papua and New Guinea in order to foist something on this Parliament - to drag the issue of Papua and New Guinea down to this single incident instead of allowing us to discuss matters affecting the general **welfare** of the people of the Territory.

* They could not care less about the **welfare** of the people of Papua and New Guinea.

* The people who are on charge this afternoon with having maltreated and disregarded the **welfare** of the district commissioner service of Papua and New Guinea are those who initiated the debate.

* As a **welfare** measure the bounty was inequitable as the bulk of it went to the larger and wealthier farmers who needed it least.

* The Government has had available to it reports on **welfare** programmes in countries comparable to Australia and what has happened in those countries.

* Honourable members opposite have only to go across the Tasman Sea to get literature on the New Zealand system of social **welfare** and after a glimpse at those documents they will see the shocking inequalities that they render unto the people of Australia.

* More people are entering this group each day but they enter this **welfare** sector realising that they are joining the ranks of the poverty stricken.

* These are the 'problem' families who frequent public and voluntary **welfare** agencies with a variety of social disabilities, such as alcoholism, children at risk, employment instability, marital problems and so on.

* It can be argued with respect to the social problems of these families that housing authorities are not social **welfare** agencies and are not organised to solve the social disabilities of problem families.

* The priorities which this Government has adopted insofar as the **welfare** of the community is concerned have been very poor indeed.

* 6m for **welfare** housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* It will be distributed among the States as follows: 
**Welfare** housing is an area to which the Government attaches high priority.

* They will also be some 2% times greater than the allocations for **welfare** housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government which were $16 1.5m in 1971-72 and $ 163.2m in 1972-73.

* This is the real measure of the importance attached to **welfare** housing by the present Government in comparison with our predecessors.

* The decision to limit the **welfare** housing advances for 1975-76 to the 1974-75 level has been a difficult one for the Government to take.

* It was appropriate for public housing activity to be stepped up above the original allocations in order to increase the output of **welfare** housing and also to use resources that otherwise may well have remained idle.

* Although the allocations for 1975-76 are limited by the budgetary constraints aimed at achieving greater economic stability and the control of inflation, they by no means reflect an intention to divert from a course that will ensure further improvements in **welfare** housing standards.

* Nevertheless, although it may not be possible to maintain commencement of government dwellings at the same level as in 1974-75, the still substantial advances to be provided in 1975-76 will allow the completion by the State housing authorities of a much higher number of **welfare** dwellings than has been the case for many years and this will be occurring along with the recovery in private housing now in train.

* In other words, the Treasurerwill be authorised to continue payments to the States for **welfare** housing in the period from 1 July 1976 until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament.

* Too often in Australia recently in too many ways we have seen a few people disadvantage by prejudicial and intransigent attitudes the **welfare** of the entire community.

* In this case they are even prejudicing the **welfare** of their colleagues.

* In other words, it is in fact a social **welfare** programme of a certain kind.

* People are becoming unviable, so we are talking in terms of a social **welfare** proposition essentially to get these people into a reasonable operation of one kind or another or, for that matter, as far as fruit growing is concerned, into non-operation if that is in fact their alternative, to get out of the industry.

* I think the Government's decision, uneconomic as it seems to be, to go into an area of social **welfare** provision in relation to the fruit-growing industry is probably well taken because the omens are not very hopeful.

* Country post offices are an integral part of the **welfare** of all rural areas; they have provided essential services to rural communities for almost as long as those communities have existed.

* If he does not it will seem that he has lost interest  in  the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* In any event, incentives to have larger families could be very costly, even to the point of drawing resources away from other **welfare** programs.

* It is a move made by the group themselves who arc deeply concerned about and for the **welfare** of the Tolai people as a whole.

* The group was formed entirely on the initiative of the Tolais who composed it and, as they have said themselves, its only concern is the unity and **welfare** of the Tolai people.

* These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and **welfare** organisations to social and recreational clubs.

* Registered newspapers and periodicals published by religious, charitable and **welfare** organisations, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles about their activities or about religious, charitable or **welfare** subjects; and by educational, scientific, technical and agricultural organisations whose principal object is the dissemination of knowledge, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles on such subjects, will pay 6c for each 12 oz, on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of lc.

* Despite that, we have met major commitments in defence, in social **welfare** and in the development and support of Australian industry.

* Is it any wonder that the **welfare** bill has grown as a result of those figures?

* So, we are providing for national goals in areas of social **welfare**, in defence and in support of industry.

* That represents massive support for Australian families and a major social **welfare** innovation introduced by this Government.

* Some time ago in one of his regular articles he was pointing out that no really worthwhile tax cuts could be made without a corresponding cutback in **welfare** services.

* 1 per cent of government outlays; health, 2 per cent of government outlays; social security and **welfare**, 25.4 per cent; and payments to the States and local government authorities, 21.1 per cent.

* I hope that the Government does apply the same cnterion when it is thinking of cutting expenditure on education, health and social **welfare** and when it is increasing the problems we face by ensuring that the numbers of students at our schools and tertiary institutions are maintained at much higher numbers than is necessary because of the lack of opportunities it creates for them.

* I begin my contribution to this very important debate on the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill by acknowledging the work of the Minister for Minerals and Energy  (Mr Connor)  and of  Mr T.  M. Fitzgerald who prepared a report on the contribution of the mineral industry to Australian **welfare**.

* Mr Fitzgerald  pointed out that the first economic task of any government is to raise the standards and the **welfare** of the people, and particularly those sections of the people who have been most disadvantaged.

* Indeed, many of the needs for a better quality of life cannot be charged for at all, and resistance to the further use of these methods- the paying for **welfare** and the wellbeing of the people- as  Mr Fitzgerald  points out, have become as strong as the public desire for social improvement.

* For Australia an exceptional opportunity for improving standards of **welfare** and wellbeing of our people did open out in the 1960s with this great unsurge of mineral discoveries.

* The nature of the foundations laid in the formative years of the mineral revival would have effects on Australian **welfare** lasting for decades or (as it turned out) for generations.

* small in relation to the big values of high quality mineral resources being extracted and exported, the mineral industry is not contributing to the supreme task of raising **welfare**.

* The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will not be operating in some declining and unprofitable field, into which public enterprise is normally allowed to function, but it will take a leading part in safeguarding and developing the vast mineral wealth of Australia, as the heritage of the people, and as one of the main sources of the **welfare** of the people for many generations.

* Only Labor can ensure that our national Wealth is used for the **welfare** of the people and not for the enrichment of just a few.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.'

* It reflects not a justifiable concern for the **welfare** of family farms impoverished through no fault of their owners, but the servitude of the Minister for Trade and Industry to large scale and corporate farming interests and the servitude of the Prime Minister to the banks.

* Perhaps nothing so clearly demonstrates the bankruptcy of the Government's social **welfare** policy than its gesture on pensions.

* If $406m of **welfare** housing or $306m of educational building is engaged in, as is provided for in this Budget, are there no private builders who are employed in these constructions?

* It demands that unless we become greater producers of other natural assets we as a Government and as a people will have to transfer financial resources from some of our priority areas- these could well be in the **welfare** sectors- towards greater costs of the basic fuel research and development of and providing for alternatives.

* When will the House debate the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons.

* While the imposition of any excises or any indirect taxes is a distasteful action for any government to take, the fact of the matter is that additional amounts cannot be spent on education, **welfare** and in other areas without making an additional collection to see that there is not any more net amount of money moving into the economy to aggravate the inflationary situation and by that factor in fact very much diminishing the value of money going into the pockets of working people throughout the length and breadth of Australia.

* We could not chop back expenditure on education, social **welfare** and all those other things.

* When we look at the massive additional expenditure on health, social **welfare**, housing and all these other things, I think that for the man in the street the increased fuel charges, which probably could be absorbed by the petrol companies anyway, and the increase on spirits and cigarettes is only a very small price to pay for the additional services given to him through health services, to his children through better education and all the other facets of Government expenditure in the way that they affect people.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for the construction of a pre-school centre at Jerramungup, Western Australia, submitted by the Gnowangerup Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* I cannot accept, for instance, that pensioners or people dependent on **welfare** services should be those who should bear an unreasonable burden in the economic management of this country.

* The Committee recommends that the RAAF carries out a comprehensive survey throughout the Service and in consultation with Service **welfare** officers to establish what recreational facilities are suitable to a modem integrated defence force.

* It is significant and important for the Australian community to realise that the total outlay on social security and **welfare** in this Budget has been increased from $5,0 12m in 1975-76 to $6, 187m in 1976-77.

* Naturally the maintenance of existing handicapped persons' **welfare** services became of paramount importance to the Department and full attention was given to this essential pan of the program rather than, with a few well deserved exceptions ...

* I wish to congratulate the Minister for Social Security and the Government for responding rapidly to the **welfare** needs of our community.

* I believe that they will mean significant improvements in social **welfare** and social security protection for the Australian people.

* Matters relating to adoptions fall within the social **welfare** responsibility of State and Territorial administrations, consequently the answer to the right honourable member's question has been delayed because of the necessity to obtain the information from those sources.

* So whilst there is in Australia a diminution of our involvement in State housing - it is on the skids and going down as fast as can be - we find that in other comparable countries such as the United States which I have just mentioned, but there are others which I could mention if more time were available, housing is being considered more and more in the **welfare** context and greater assistance is being given to people to overcome the competitive situation regarding the availability of finance.

* The Bill enables State and Territory child **welfare** officers to be used as **welfare** officers for the purpose of the Act.

* It also enables other persons, including **welfare** officers employed in the Australian Public Service, to be used or appointed as **welfare** officers.

* Whether it will be necessary as a matter of good administration to use **welfare** officers other than State and Territory **welfare** officers remains, of course, to be seen.

* The Methodist Church, like the municipality, is concerned about the need for the provision of social services and social **welfare** in the area.

* The centre is to be used to provide for the social **welfare** of the people in the area and, according to the surveys that have been made, there is a very great need for such a service.

* Churches of other denominations in the area are providing part-time social workers, and the Victorian State Government has provided a full-time **welfare** officer.

* 1 ) Has the Government had regular information from a variety of sources on the level of fighting and the state of the **welfare** of the people of East Timor ever since Indonesia's invasion in 1975.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* All laws on marriage and divorce ultimately affect the **welfare** and happiness of everyone in the community and, indeed, the **welfare** of the whole society.

* I refer to the separation of Family Court matters from those courts which necessarily deal with criminal offences; the provision for divorce proceedings to be conducted in closed court; the emphasis on the paramountcy of the child's **welfare** in custody proceedings; the attempts to improve counselling and reconciliation faculties; the proposals for a continuing study of matters affecting family stability, the working of divorce law and legal aid- provided, of course, this study is conducted in a genuinely representative way.

* I believe that on this relationship the very stability of family life rests and most particularly does the **welfare** of the children rest.

* She may be more cautious about making a home and providing for the home care of her children- or in having children at all- if these interfere with the anxiety of ensuring her own financial **welfare**.

* She can have little confidence that under this Bill the law will protect her dignity, much less her financial **welfare**.

* I do this because as far as I am aware - although I have from time to time made representations in this Parliament on matters concerning the **welfare** of these people - the peculiar problems which apply to a very small section of the community but, nevertheless, a very important one have never been placed on record.

* But there are substantial **welfare** problems flowing from the existence of this unique people.

* These can take the form of implied threats to deny **welfare** benefits or other assistance to islanders unless they leave Cape Barren and go to Tasmania.

* In saying this 1 do not criticise the efforts of State Government employees who look after the health, education and social **welfare** of the islanders.

* These are problems similar in many ways to those encountered by Aboriginal people in other parts of Australia - problems of housing, social **welfare**, education and employment.

* His work is social **welfare** work; it does not give any medical cover to people on Cape Barren Island.

* According to the list contained in attachment B, a total of $1,628,699 has been distributed over the past 3 years to organisations administering Aboriginal **welfare**.

* Looking at the wide range of grants made to **welfare**, social and sporting clubs and to individuals for **welfare** assistance to Aboriginals, it is disappointing that Tasmanian Aboriginal people should be neglected.

* I spend a good deal of time discussing the problems confronting Aborigines both with the Aborigines and with the people who are concerned with their **welfare**, such as **welfare** workers and child **welfare** officers..

* T went along with one **welfare** officer who had a talk to an Aborigine living on the river bank.

* The **welfare** officer said: 'You will probably get a bit more work later on'.

* But the thing that concerns me is that there can be a conference of officials of the State Department of Aboriginal **Welfare** in my area and 1 will know nothing about it.

* Before we look at what assistance they need and what the Opposition is now saying about them, let us look at some of the hopes to which honourable members opposite have referred that the Government has raised and consider whether it is a legitimate exercise to raise the hopes of people in Australia and to attract a greater community participation in government enterprises, in government initiatives and in being able to see that government moneys are spent in **welfare** areas.

* Let us look at other social **welfare** programs, such as the programs for single mothers, deserted wives, women's shelters, women's clinics, nursing homes and so on.

* Of course, it is relevant to what the Opposition is saying about Government expenditure in the fields of social **welfare** and education to bear in mind what the Australian Country Party, with the support of the Liberal Party of Australia, is saying about primary industry.

* I welcome this Commission, as I welcomed the Social **Welfare** Commission, because it brings the operations of government out into the open but, as the honourable member for Hotham has pointed out, we do have some reservation about the way in which this particular Bill is going to achieve these ends.

* In the Social **Welfare** Bill passed by this House a little time ago, section 16, referring to the Social **Welfare** Commission, provides: 
The knowledge needed to make possible the better achievement of Australia's goals is largely controlled by foreign companies that claim the right to exploit that knowledge in Australia as they see fit.

* Australia should strive to develop its own scientific and technical knowledge to enable it to maintain its defence and **welfare** standards.

* Calling it the Department of Repatriation and Compensation could be the thin edge of the wedge that will eventually mean the disappearance of the Repatriation Department and those 800,000 surviving ex-servicemen and women will see the disappearance of their specialised department which devotes itself entirely to the **welfare** and treatment of these ex-servicemen and women.

* I assure the ex-servicemen and women of Australia that we in the Country Party and the Liberal Party will continue to show a vital interest in the future **welfare** of the exservicemen and women of Australia.

* They will play a vital part and will look after their **welfare**.

* It was something about which civilised men - Australians who have the **welfare** of Australia at heart - could sit down and say: 'Here is something we can give to you because it is proper and correct.

* This redistribution of social **welfare** assistance will not be as costly to the community as many people may think.

* To sum up, it means that the new approach to social **welfare** will go where the need is greatestthat is, to the lower income group and to the disadvantaged.

* In this way it is much more effective and much more equitable than any single social **welfare** measure introduced by the former Labor Government, despite the fact that that Government claimed a great deal of credit for what it did in this direction.

* It is also claimed that the Australian Labor Government's plans, its intentions, much of its thinking and its history require it to redistribute resources away from areas of lesser importance towards areas of great national need - areas that include social **welfare**, the relief of poverty, education, health and the solution of quality of life problems in the cities - and that this will have an adverse effect on business in Australia.

* A strong and growing business sector is one of the keys to achievement of Labor's social **welfare** program.

* There is the tempting path of increasing activity levels through increased Government spending, but on closer examination that can be seen to be an irresponsible way which no Government concerned for the medium and the long term **welfare** of the community would follow.

* The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the committee which works with him are most anxious that the regional presence of the Australian Government should be established as quickly as possible in centres throughout Australia, that we should co-operate with those State agencies which are able to fulfil their function as an agent for the Commonwealth in a particular State, and so that we might be able to gain value from the expertise of the people who have served the States in the role of Aboriginal **welfare** officers so that these people might be incorporated into the Australian Government organisations in order that we might benefit from the wealth of knowledge that they have available.

* There are other areas of Aboriginal **welfare** about which the Government is gravely concerned.

* It will be very difficult to convince them that probably the best thing for their **welfare** is for them to be located where we can provide these opportunities for them.

* It is too serious a matter, but I will not see imperilled to the least extent the name of this nation, its integrity, or indeed the **welfare** of its people because of the posturing of any State Premier or, indeed, the  president  of any political party.

* Here we are dealing not merely with the future of the lives of the people and their **welfare** and happiness; we are dealing with the **welfare** of generations to come.

* I do not think we could choose any better field than that of health and social **welfare** in which to put so much money.

* The health appropriation works out at just on 12 per cent of the total Budget outlay; social **welfare** expenditure represents a massive 23.5 per cent of the total Budget outlay.

* We realise, and the people of Australia are going to realise, that we have the **welfare** of all the people at heart.

* In the first sittings you will be asked to give priority to legislation affecting the immediate **welfare** of the people, and to matters in which my advisers believe delay would mean damage to the nation or unwarranted neglect of the people's wishes and mandate.

* Determined as they are to maintain strong defence forces, my advisers are deeply aware that the basic strength and **welfare** of the nation depends on Australia's ability to develop the skills and talents of her people.

* An Australian Assistance Plan will be set up to develop and co-ordinate **welfare** services provided by government and private agencies.

* A National Commission on Social **Welfare** will be set up to advise the Government on all aspects of social **welfare**, integrate national programs and to evaluate the success of programs.

* They will insist, however, that the over-riding consideration must be the **welfare** of the patient and are determined that the mandate given to them will be carried out.

* The **welfare** of migrants to Australia will receive the closest attention.

* The emphasis of my Government's immigration policy will be on the reunion of families and the **welfare** of migrants already in Australia.

* My Government believes that measures to improve the **welfare** of deprived sections of the Australian community, or to promote equality within the whole community, however far-reaching and valuable in themselves, will ultimately fail unless basic and urgent attention is directed to the places where the people live and must live.

* The extensive program of educational, **welfare** and urban and public transport reform and renewal planned by my Government can only be achieved on the basis of sound economic growth.

* But as soon as this Government came in it decided that of that $18m, $1 1.1m in the 1975-76 Budget was too much for the general **welfare** of the community of Australia.

* In July of that year he had established the Task Force on Coordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* It will create chaos in the industry in the name of social **welfare** because it was in the name of social **welfare** - or so-called social **welfare** - that the Government changed these dairying industry policies.

* What we can see, in any case, is that neocapitalism, with its pretensions to have found the answer to Marx, was the expression of a temporary situation, borne along not by its own dynamic but by the upwards wave of the economic cycle; but the vision of a society dedicated to **welfare**, not to power and profit- the only vision that makes sense in today 's circumstances- still eludes us, and will do so until another crisis, even more crippling than the crisis that is brewing today, brings home to the whole world the perils it faces.

* He also believes that until we begin to think about it we will not solve the problems of dealing with inflation or the problems of **welfare** because there is a jack-up on **welfare**.

* In regard to the social **welfare** and the social justice aspects of this Budget I refer to the great strides that are being made to overcome very important deficiencies in the educational and social **welfare** needs of our community.

* That is why I say that this is a social **welfare** Budget.

* The Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  has authorised me to make this announcement: A joint meeting of the Caucus Economic and Trade Committee and the **Welfare** Committee, of which I am the Secretary, was held today with the concurrence of the Treasurer and with his agreement has recommended to Cabinet variations in the proposed legislation which would ensure that retired people and sick and infirm people earning a moderate income from property will not suffer any hardship whatsoever.

* The 3 Bills before the House tonight are all concerned with the **welfare** of the aged.

* I think the Minister for Social Security  (Mr 
I agree that the increasing of the share of the salary subsidy for **welfare** officers is desirable.

* I have had experience in my electorate of finding that because, **welfare** officers are appointed by many departments, their communications are not as good as they should be and there has not been the support and the service given to the community which could result if we had great co-operation.

* In fact he is saying that he does not know what the costs are, and that is not an unreasonable situation when trying to calculate the cost of **welfare** services or many other aspects of public responsibility.

* The Government was supposed to spend $2.Sm a year on a comprehensive programme covering home care, paramedical services, senior citizen centres, **welfare** work and nursing homes.

* I think that one of the reasons why **welfare** services in the community have been under-developed in many ways is that the Commonwealth has tended to take the easy way out by tying its expenditure allocations to some sort of formula which requires a commitment from the States in a fixed capacity or in a fixed amount.

* I make the point that as far as funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is concerned there will be as much available to the States this year to fund **welfare** housing as there was last year, but it depends upon State effort.

* If the States make the effort and the contribution that I believe they will make, then in no sense will **welfare** housing suffer during this financial year.

* I must point out to him that these funds are an important part of **welfare** housing funding in Australia.

* We appointed the social **welfare** commission and did other things.

* This proposal to increase interest rates on **welfare** housing loans has caused intense anxiety and alarm throughout Australia.

* They have always kept interest rates for the **welfare** housing program at a high level, generally providing only a one per cent advantage against the bond rate.

* Mr Neilson  of Tasmania accused the Federal Government of turning its back on **welfare** housing for low income earners generally.

* Mr Hayes,  the Victorian Government's spokesman on housing, said that the adoption of the proposal would mean State governments paying 10.5 per cent on money borrowed for **welfare** housing.

* I know that this body, an academic body, has a world importance outside Aboriginal **welfare**.

* But it has also a tremendous amount to contribute to making a successful policy on Aboriginal **welfare** because, without understanding, whatever money we spend will be wastefully spent.

* This, again, I think is related very much to a successful approach to these problems of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* I do not know whether the Northern Territory itself should handle Aboriginal **welfare** or whether this should be a national responsibility handled directly by the Federal Government.

* My own personal view would be that the Commonwealth should have control at all times over the future **welfare** of these people.

* I would like to see this happen in Queensland and in all States of the Commonwealth because I believe that this would be the best way in which the **welfare** of Aborigines would be looked after from a national point of view.

* It is a part of a government's total **welfare** program.

* There is no reason why poorer families who are being looked after under **welfare** housing should be forced to pay more for their shelter than is paid by the rest of the community.

* It wants to claim credit for getting higher income tenants out of **welfare** housing and it wants the States to pay for it.

* This shift to the private sector ignores the basic fact that the provision of **welfare** housing is a public responsibility.

* The financing of **welfare** housing should not be considered in a way which contributes to profit in the private sector.

* However, I do wish to speak about the management of money and particularly of **welfare** funds by the Federal Government.

* It is my unfortunate duty to draw to the attention of the House this evening the very critical position in which an innovative **welfare** project in my electorate has been placed as a result of a Government decision communicated to that group today.

* The project also serves as a communication facility for the parents, to put them in contact with each other, to help them plug into the **welfare** services which are so puzzling.

* It is highly erosive of the confidence essential for the creation of wealth in this country so that we can afford all our laudable programs for social **welfare**, education and health out of our earnings and not further deplete our capital.

* I think the Federal Government must indicate clearly that it will bear the full burden of caring for the **welfare** and the relocation of anyone whose livelihood is at stake as a result of this decision.

* The Government this year will be spending a massive 25 per cent of its total outlay in social security and **welfare**.

* This imposes on the Government a responsibility to ensure, so far as it can, that passports are not issued to persons likely to threaten the national security and public order of another country or the rights and **welfare** of its citizens.

* In brief, these are, with certain exceptions, persons who are not married and who have not reached the age of 18 years, unless the consent of persons having custodial rights has been obtained; persons in respect of whom the authorised officer has reason to believe that there is in force a warrant for arrest issued in Australia; persons whom the authorised officer has reason to believe are required to remain in Australia under a court order, or under a condition of parole or of recognisance, surety or bail bond; persons who owe money to the Commonwealth as a result of circumstances arising from previous overseas travel; persons whom the authorised officer believes already to be in possession or control of an Australian passport in force- unless there are special reasons- and persons in respect of whom the Minister has decided that issue of a passport would threaten security or **welfare** in another country.

* In conclusion, I wish to assure honourable members that substantial effort has been expended to produce a Bill which provides just and equitable treatment for Australians wishing to travel overseas; which provides the maximum protection for the **welfare** and convenience of those travellers; which nevertheless pays due regard to our responsibilities toward those countries to which they travel, and which brings passport legislation into line with the modern and liberal philosophies of this Government.

* In fact, if honourable members will reflect back on the report on homeless men I think they will acknowledge it was one of the better reports that has come out of the social **welfare** field in recent .times.

* More importantly with a conservative government in the past, spending on education, social **welfare** and the public infrastructure was inadequate and this was at a time when we were supposed to be able to afford to spend in such areas.

* Care.fully reading through the last one one gathers that the Liberals if they were in government would wipe the Department of Urban and Regional Development, restore a few subsidies and throw aU **welfare** programs into reverse or hold except in those areas where there might be a few votes.

* First of all, an officer of the **Welfare** Department of the NT Administration is responsible to decide whether liquor shall or shall not come onto an Aboriginal reserve.

* His name is Cyril Cecil  Allom,  a Regional **Welfare** Officer with the NT Administration.

* It disclosed a disgraceful situation where the **welfare** officer gave no evidence to assist the court, where the applicant had no concern whatsoever for the Aborigines - he merely wanted a hotel licence to do what a storekeeper did on the other side of Arnhem Land - where there was talk about the accommodation of visitors whereas the mine discourages visitors and where every point of view was taken into account except the interests of the Aborigines.

* But judging from the non-specific nature of the proposals for action and worse the indication that even more dependence will be placed on 'non-government migrant resource centres' any migrant with any insight can only conclude that little or nothing will be done for 20 per cent of the population suffering disadvantages through barriers of language, in areas or health, **welfare**, education and job opportunities, just to name a few.

* If this is so, why has the Government changed the whole administrative arrangements for migrants by once again concentrating all power in all areas of migrant **welfare** in the most centralised department of all, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs?

* The advantages of administrative arrangements instituted by the Labor Government- advantages in the dispersal of **welfare** services, support for the migrants, health services, education and so on provided for all Australians, many of whom are migrants, some of 50 years standing- now have been destroyed.

* I would go so far as to say that people would be sleeping in the open, in parks and the like, if it were not for the magnificent work that is being done at present by the voluntary social **welfare** agencies such as St Vincent de Paul even by professional social workers working after hours and by the churches.

* The need is clearly established when we look at the figures supplied by the **welfare** groups in my electorate, again using the definition of emergency housing that I used before - meaning a need for housing for the immediate night or the immediate week.

* The investigation that was carried out by social workers and **welfare** organisations in the municipalities of Springvale, Dandenong and Berwick showed that the groups most affected were, as one might imagine, the one parent families, particularly deserted wives; families who were evicted from their houses; the elderly; and also, in areas like those centred in Dandenong, quite a large group of young people and families who come to those areas in the expectation of easy employment because cities such as Dandenong are reputed to be boom cities.

* In doing so I am well aware that, he as the Minister has been responsible for negotiation with, the States whereby allocations for **welfare** housing have been higher than ever before.

* I continued to press his case after his induction and his psychiatrist in Perth, on hearing that he was in the Army, wrote immediately to the Department saying that it was his opinion that this lad should not be in the Army because that would be extremely detrimental to his health and **welfare**.

* -During the second reading debate it was unfortunate that the gag had to be applied to someone who knows something about the life assurance industry, someone who has made his living as a salesman in that field and someone who had the **welfare** of the policy holders of the company for which he worked at heart.

* I see it as an intrusion into the rights of the individual who has a right of free choice to protect his life's savings and his **welfare** in his declining years.

* So, let us dispense with this mockery of the Government's when it says that it is caring for the **welfare** of Australians.

* and (2) Neither ibe Department's staff of 15 social workers nor the 25 social workers employed with community agencies engaged in **welfare** work amongst migrants (whose salaries are financed by the Commonwealth) include a Finnish speaking social worker.

* Moreover, many of the integration problems encountered by migrants do not require the services of professionally qualified social workers, but can be handled effectively by trained **welfare** staff.

* It is also endeavouring to increase its **welfare** staff for which bilingual officers can more readily be recruited.

* This decision mirrors the Shire Council's concern for the **welfare** of all families living in its district.

* The cost of nursing home care is perhaps the most serious problem in the whole structure of community **welfare** services.

* So, the effect that the deterrent charge will have will vary according to the degree to which the doctor is prepared to compromise his patient's medical **welfare** in order to safeguard the patient's financial **welfare**.

* Who will be legally responsible for the **welfare** of the refugees following arrival in Australia.

* The item which possibly has been discussed more than any other in this debate is social **welfare**.

* The allocation for social **welfare** in this Budget is SI, 820m.

* The 3 items I have mentioned, payments to the States, defence and social **welfare**, represent about 72 per cent of total expenditure for this financial year.

* This allocation represents almost a quarter of the estimated expenditure for this financial year, lt is a pretty fair figure for any nation to be allocating to social **welfare**.

* Health benefits and other items within the social **welfare** field also give them security and this is what they need.

* The present conditions influence not only thos: people on fixed incomes, such as recipients of social **welfare** payments about whom I have been speaking, but also industries which earn their returns from exports.

* It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre.

* Expenditure under the national **welfare** fund on accommodation and meal subsidies for the period from 13 December 1974 to 30 June 1978 amounted to $2.6m.

* Salary subsidies were paid for 37 social **welfare** workers.

* We shall certainly follow up the work that has already been done by the CSIRO and by the Government Analyst in another part of the Department of Science in ensuring that the health and **welfare** of the people of Tasmania are fully safeguarded.

* Both Parts have been referred to the recently established Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat for advice; aspects of the Report are also under consideration by my Department.

* I respect him for his interest in social **welfare**.

* More importantly they can become citizens who are happy in themselves and who contribute to the common good and **welfare** of society.

* The Australian dairy farmer is a quite competent farmer and has contributed in a most meaningful way to the **welfare** of Australia.

* This will be detrimental to the **welfare** of the people engaged in the industry and to the industry itself.

* Does the Minister agree that this mythology that is now common in folklore in Australia that Aboriginals are receiving up to '$200 a week merely by going down to the social **welfare** departments and putting out their hands is injurious to the race relations that we hope to improve in Australia.?

* I believe it should be stated that there has been criticism that increases in the number of departmental staff have led to a lucrative business for **welfare** workers and administrators.

* A report tided 'Rural Poverty in Northern New South Wales' by the Poverty Commission of Inquiry noted that if the 1973-74 expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** of $1 17.4m had been given directly to Aborigines, then estimated at 140 000, it would have meant $838 for every man, woman and child.

* Government **welfare** programs must not be allowed to become a lucrative business either for professional **welfare** workers, researchers or consultants.

* Professors S. B. Hammond and R. F. HendersonMacquarie University-The role of local authorities in the provision of **welfare** services' (1971 $26,500).

* Downing and  Mr W.  J. Byrt- University of Melbourne- 'Use of manpower in social **welfare** services'.

* The only social **welfare** programme administered, by my Department that has not yet become operative in ail States is that authorised by the States Grants (Home Care) Act 1969.

* The legislation, which was assented to on 14th June 1969 grants financial assistance to the States for the provision of Home Care Services, Senior Citizens' Centres and the employment of **Welfare** Officers by Senior Citizens' Centres.

* The amount available for Senior Citizens' Centres and **Welfare** officers' salaries is subject to annual appropriation.

* Land prices will go on soaring and social **welfare** and security programs like Medibank are under threat.

* Unemployment does not matter; social **welfare** does not matter; depressed and needy industries do not matter.

* There is no increase in **welfare** housing funds.

* The purpose of the Embassy was to bring to the attention of members of Parliament and others, matters of complaint concerning the **welfare** of the aboriginal race and in particular their 'land rights'.

* Some of these are employed in the provision of direct casework service to the public whilst others are involved in national **welfare** policy and program matters.

* Social **Welfare** Workers employed by the Department of the Capital Territory are involved in the following functions: General family casework; adoption, preventive and remedial work with juveniles, including services to the Children's Court and supervision of probationers; adult probation and parole services; foster care; child care; and institutional services.

* Questions relating to the functions of Social **Welfare** Workers employed by other Government Departments in the A.C.T.

* I cannot find too much evidence of the Government's good intentions and we may well ask this question: Is it good intentions which prompted the Government's decision to tax social **welfare** beneficiaries such as accident victims who are being rehabilitated?

* Finally, we have also been determined -  they showed great courage-  to find room for measures having merit on broader grounds of social **welfare** and equity.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* I note that a former Minister for Social **Welfare** has returned to the chamber in the backbenches of the Government.

* Another aspect I wish to raise is the overall achievement in the field of social security and **welfare** by the Labor Government.

* I do not believe that we created a soft society by taking so many initiatives in the field of **welfare** and providing more generous benefits in the field of **welfare**.

* It is not the sort of **welfare** initiative which gets votes but it is the sort of **welfare** initiatives which satisfies one greatly because one realises that one has discharged a very important moral obligation in society to do something for the very serious social casualties that we do have in our community, and to help the very worthwhile people who dedicate their lives to helping the men and women who are homeless and who are drifting in the community, often in a situation of that nature because of some sort of crisis that has occurred in their life.

* In 197 1-72 when we came into office the percentage of gross domestic product spent on social security and **welfare** was 4.4.

* I think it is a very harsh, a very brutal and very insensitive society that does not accept the point of view that there are people in this community who, in spite of all we did, are still not being reached by the programs of **welfare** which are available, and that more needs to be done, not the least of which is the introduction of some sort of guaranteed income concept.

* Spending on essential education, health and **welfare** programs will be protected against inflation.

* Special migrant **welfare** services have been reduced by 12 per cent in real terms.

* The present Prime Minister promised: 
and (4) An Interdepartmental Committee was established by the previous Government to examine the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in its report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia.

* The Interdepartmental Committee did not complete its examination and report on the 'Survey of Handicapped Children' and therefore it was never presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**.

* The report of the separate survey of Invalid Pensioners aged 16 to 20 years m New South Wales and Victoria headed ('Handicapped Children in Australia') was submitted to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** and was incorporated in its Hansard of 1 970-7 1 .

* What was the intended role of the Social **Welfare** Commission as at 2 December 1972. 
to examine the awareness of specific learning difficulties among the community generally and among the medical, health, teaching and social **welfare** professions in particular; 
Are there any adjectives left in the dictionary?

* Expenditure on social security and **welfare** is next, and then there is health with an increase of $196m or 25 per cent more than was provided in 1972-73, followed by transport and communications.

* It can perhaps be questioned whether social **welfare** will be greatly reduced if we wait another year or two for some steps along the road.

* I base my statement on the incontrovertible fact that our future social **welfare**, health, environmental and cultural development depend on the extent to which our effective growth and development are expanded to meet the demands of an impatient society, a society entitled to expect to benefit from and to share in the good things of life.

* It is an approach based on economic rationality and the need for **welfare** assistance.

* The premises for such a policy also include: That get big or get out is inadequate as a policy for all farmers; that there is no once and for all size of farm business likely to ensure all time viability; that drought, flood and other natural disasters should attract realistic, not confused, financial assistance; that the **welfare** needs of rural communities and towns must be accurately perceived in social terms separate from handouts; that society, through government, has the responsibility to ensure employment opportunities for every man to earn or to have a minimum income but not to guarantee every man security in the occupation of his choice.

* On the surface, the bounty had only marginally improved the **welfare** of the small dairy man, when it is considered that the bounty has been a factor pushing up the price of land and other inputs.

* It considers other matters more important than the employment and **welfare** of the community of Australia.

* Not only has the honourable member forgotten this, but obviously he has not made a close study of the policy speeches of leaders of the Australian Labor Party who have from time to time during election campaigns - in  1953, 1954  and  1955  in particular - made enormous gestures towards a **welfare** state in Australia.

* These are matters vital to the **welfare** of Australia and matters which over the next 12 months the Government must consider carefully.

* In his critical speech yesterday I would have expected the Leader of the Opposition to concede that in this Budget there was an enormous diversion of resources to the States and to assert that these were insufficient, which is the usual Opposition line of attack, or that too much money was being diverted to the States and that from the vast sums going to the States funds should be diverted for social services and **welfare** payments.

* It is an issue that in my own electorate has caused those constituents who are pensioners to be concerned about our social **welfare** objectives and our direction.

* I too have felt that the withdrawal of this benefit may cast doubts on our overall aims in social **welfare** policy, but I know that the Government faces severe economic problems.

* Although I support the decision now I have this to say: I urge the Government in its next review of social **welfare** benefits to look very closely at the gap that has been left by the withdrawal of this benefit.

* I have to say that I believe it is only the first bite at achieving our social **welfare** objectives.

* For these and other reasons the proposed publication has been listed, amongst others of a developmental nature, for consideration as part of a long-term **welfare** services directory program.

* In the short-term a factor which inhibits any immediate prodduction of such a directory is that the manner of provision of **welfare** and health services by the Commonwealth Government is currently the subject of a major review following the report by the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **Welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* The Budget provides for an increase of $340m in social **welfare** benefits but it is not in fact a social **welfare** Budget because its specific benefits will be largely offset by the effects of inflation.

* It lashes out wildly in all directions, making savage attacks on the industries that produce the financial resources on which all advances in the **welfare** of the Australian people must be based.

* What this Government must understand, and what the Australian people must understand, is that if this nation's free enterprise foundations are weakened too much the whole structure of the community and all the Government's **welfare** and other programs will be endangered.

* No-one questions the good intentions of the Treasurer in rapidly expanding Government spending on **welfare** services, education, health care and similar matters.

* Let us have a corporation representative of people who use the postal service and who are interested in its **welfare**.

* Under the State Grants (Home Care) Act it would be acceptable for a local governing authority to employ a social worker or **welfare** officer in connection with approved **welfare** services for aged people within its area and to seek the Commonwealth grant of half the amount of the person's salary.

* It is not necessary for a **welfare** officer to be appointed to each Club, in order to qualify for subsidy.

* What ought to be a measure of social **welfare** has become a commercial procedure dictated by calculations of profit and loss.

* Where society should be primarily concerned with the **welfare** of the accident victim and his family it is more concerned with legal concepts of evidence, negligence and fault.

* Treasury, the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Repatriation and Compensation.

* The Labor Party gave the primary producer the opportunity to live as he should - as a human being with a good return for his products, a fair return to the worker, and in every way take his place in society not as a debtor but as a proud man adding his contribution to the **welfare** of this country.

* We realise that we should have their **welfare** in mind.

* The same honourable member for Blaxland had this to say: ... a scheme like the current one which is production orientated gives the larger grower a larger proportion of the funds available and the smaller grower receives only a small amount of the funds available which, in many cases, just becomes a form of **welfare** assistance rather than viable support - 
Our problems are not just those which can be titled in economic terms, the problems extend further.

* That social problem is one of a **welfare** society.

* In the period during which the Labor Government was in office many initiatives were taken in the field of social **welfare** and many improvements were made.

* Overall, responsibility for social **welfare** loomed much larger than was the case with any previous government of the previous two decades.

* Pensions and repatriation benefits have again been increased and social **welfare** spending in the current year is estimated at $2,095m.

* But they are sufficient to indicate that the whole intent of the Liberal-Country Party Government is to further the advancement of our nation and the **welfare** of its people.

* Social **welfare**, as I mentioned a moment ago, will this year absorb $2,095m, and education $346m.

* These 4 items alone - payments to the States, social **welfare**, education and defence - account for $6,983m out of a total anticipated expenditure of $8,833m.

* In speaking to these setimates which deal with social security, **welfare** and health, I want to remind the Committee and the people of the nation that of the $24,32 lm estimated total Budget outlay, social security and **welfare** will account for $6, 187m or 25 per cent of the amount.

* That is a tremendous amount of money for any nation to spend on social **welfare** and health, particularly when we compare it with the education expenditure of $2, 204m and the defence expenditure of $2, 178m both of which represent approximately 9.6 per cent of the gross national product.

* I realise that we are debating the health and social **welfare** areas.

* Training scheme and the Community Youth Employment Training programs, but also, importantly, to a big rise in social security and **welfare** payments.

* He nominated social security, **welfare** programs, health and education.

* Unemployment is not simply a **welfare** matter that is irrelevant to the whole question of productivity and the question of getting the economy moving; it is integrally related to the problems of Budget deficits.

* This Government has been a recessive government which has driven the country into a recession which is having massive **welfare** consequences.

* One can look at what has happened in terms of national housing policy and the attempt to eliminate **welfare** housing.

* One can look at the kinds of cutbacks that have occurred in almost every public sector activity that affects the **welfare** of average people.

* 000m per year in hidden costs, as the Minister said in his announcement, because they cannot be readily dissected from total community spending on facilities such as education, social **welfare**, provision of water, sewerage, roads, hospitals, etc.

* One need hardly add the present deficiencies that exist in the field of education, social **welfare** and health, coupled with the spiralling cost of land and housing - and we have just had an example of how little is being done for people such as pensioners - to know that a continually increasing population has created a gap for many millions of Australians between the myth of the affluent society and the reality of the deficiencies they are facing in almost: every facet of their day to day existence.

* Under an arrangement between the Department of Social Services and the **Welfare** Branch of the Department of the Interior, the **Welfare** Branch will make, in cases of need, immediate cash payments to applicants for social service pen sions or benefits.

* The **Welfare** Branch is subsequently re-imbursed from arrears  of  benefit  or  pension, subject to the  applicant's  authority being obtained.

* As Ministers of his Government, especially the Minister for External Affairs, have been enunciating passionate concern for the **welfare** and rights of people in other countries, will he extend this with some consistency by now publicly condemning and denouncing the treatment of these political prisoners in Greece?

* Since the inception of the North West Regional Council for Social Development over the last 3 years or so activity in the **welfare** field has increased dramatically to the benefit of the people in such areas as the development of the central services and the raising of the quality of life in the area.

* It has successfully initiated many programs in the fields of health, **welfare**, child care, education, ethnic affairs, recreation, youth, environment and community information and media access.

* There are neighbourhood centres, community health centres, municipal **welfare** committees, a legal service and ethnic culture activity officers have been appointed.

* The Council has also taken up issues where they arose and has worked in areas that have not been covered by other organisations in the **welfare** field.

* The basis of the Government's policies is Australia's belief that the **welfare** of the inhabitants of the Islands is paramount.

* Liberal-Country Party politicians and officials whether in New South Wales, Canberra or the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, have realised that their policies on such issues as development, **welfare**, education, financing of health services, rural problems, defence and foreign affairs are obviously not supported by the electorate.

* Also, it has said that the Vietnam war was won in 1967; that the statement of the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton)  that his main concern was improved social **welfare** was satisfied by an increase of 50c in pensions; and that the means test for non-contributory pensions was essential and fair, except in the case of $7,500 pensions for those who had rendered special services to the Government.

* This makes even more amazing the fact that the present Government, a government which is portrayed by its opponents as having been heartless, has managed to increase expenditure in the field of social **welfare** from the previous Labor Government expenditure of $5,000m to more than $6,000m.

* That means that this so-called heartless Liberal Government, in times of great economic difficulty, has through good management been able to increase the expenditure in the field of social **welfare** by some 25 per cent to over $6,000m.

* Pensioners or people reliant on social security or **welfare** payments equal almost one-third of the work force.

* In the field of social **welfare** it has already been announced that we would fund the Australian Assistance Plan for another 12 months and that it would then be handed over to the States for them to decide the future and for them to fund it.

* Councils are expected - I believe rightly - to concern themselves increasingly in cultural and social **welfare** and recreational activities.

* Today we expect local councils to provide facilities over a wide new field, such as infant **welfare** centres, pre-school centres, libraries, a multiplicity of sporting facilities, meals-on-wheels, family guidance clinics, open space, home-help services, social workers, **welfare** officers and youth workers.

* On the one hand the Government is being berated for being a spendthrift government and for causing inflation by the mammoth amount of money it is spending on **welfare** - **welfare** includes ex-servicemen in particular - and on the other hand the Opposition is asking the Government why it does not spend more still.

* We are castigated often as not being interested in the **welfare** of servicemen.

* Housing is vital to the **welfare** and happiness of the individual family.

* This Government preens itself on what it terms its dedication to social **welfare**.

* For them Labor's social **welfare** dream has become a social **welfare** nightmare.

* At that time there was also a plan to provide other kinds of assistance for the **welfare** of aged people, but I will not dwell on that at the moment.

* I know that this paper deals principally with the aged persons homes scheme, but there are other allied schemes that do have an impact upon the **welfare** of the aged.

* Care) Act that bad a 3-pronged approach to the matter of looking after the **welfare** of aged people.

* Likewise, there was provision for **welfare** officers in the senior citizen centres.

* The estimates under consideration are not merely those of the Department of Immigration because our Department covers not only immigration but also emigration, settlement and **welfare**, citizenship and population.

* Of course the reason for this is the new emphasis on **welfare** and settlement services.

* But there is also an increased expenditure on migrant education, a considerably increased expenditure on **welfare** services and in addition to that we have appointed 48 multilingual **welfare** officers as another part of the new effort to ensure happier and more successful settlement.

* Even if there were, a policy that subordinates jobs and individual **welfare** to corporate profits and investors ' dividends is an inhuman policy.

* What sort of economic recovery is it that requires hundreds of thousands of Australians to go without work and to sacrifice their dignity and self-respect and the **welfare** of their families?

* No government can ignore the immediate challenge it poses to human **welfare**.

* He criticised the form of support in this legislation, which is on what I call the productive unit basis, as not being as advantageous as what he called **welfare** assistance.

* If this form of assistance is not the most beneficial and somehow or other the claims of the Australian Labor Party that **welfare** assistance is better are true, could members of the Opposition suggest what they would do?

* In the time they were in office they did not introduce any successful **welfare** measure for agriculture, including a most important one, that is, the provision of unemployment benefits for self-employed people.

* To our discredit we also have not introduced any measure to overcome this most unjust provision in our social security legislation that self-employed people are automatically deprived by regulation of any form of assistance through the **welfare** system and, in particular, unemployment benefits.

* What I would like to see the Government moving towards is a resource tax raising $ 150m; to eliminate the crude oil levy windfall gain to the oil development companies of $340m; to impose a capital gains tax on gains in excess of $200,000, raising $300m; to adjust the highest levels of personal income tax to raise $200m; to abolish the investment allowance, $400m; to abolish tax avoidance through family trusts, $100m-$l,490,000 as against the imposition of the direct increases in personal tax and denying pensioners and employment beneficiaries and other social **welfare** beneficiaries of benefits amounting to about $l,140m.

* This provision enables Commonwealth medical benefits payments under the Health Insurance Act 1973 to be paid out of the National **Welfare** Fund, as are similar type commonwealth benefits, such as pharmaceutical benefits, and covers unforeseen circumstances such as large-scale epidemics.

* First, the great bulk of students are committed to high academic achievement which will enable them to make long term contributions both to Australia's and their own **welfare**.

* The executive 's pre-occupation with itself, and the promotion of its extreme political views and its lack of concern for the **welfare** of average students is clearly demonstrated in a breakup of this budget.

* Against this expenditure only $1,000 was applied to the solution of a problem such as the tertiary education assistance scheme, an issue, of course, which affected the **welfare** of most students.

* It can effectively represent students in the genuine needs which they have and not be purely an extremist political organisation concerned with promoting extremist political views in the community to the detriment of the overall community and, of course, to the detriment of students who depend on that body for their **welfare**.

* The court shall regard the **welfare** of the child as the paramount consideration.

* The court should not give a damn about the parents when it comes to the **welfare** of the child.

* But, of course, in the consideration of the **welfare** of the child the conduct of the parents is relevant.

* We recognise that many of its provisions in respect of education, social **welfare** and urban development are considerable.

* In fact, on the best estimates and advice available to us of the position in the last financial year, the total amount available, from all the sources in public **welfare** funding for housing was about the same as that for the previous year.

* The evidence shows that during the period of the Labor Government we had the longest waiting list in the history of this country of people seeking assistance from governments for **welfare** housing.

* Our policies have started to bite and the numbers on these **welfare** housing waiting lists are falling.

* We know what the reality is in relation to **welfare** housing.

* This Minister is a weak Minister and the result is the situation which we have in **welfare** housing.

* So we have the Shelter organisation in New South Wales talking about what is a vast and overwhelming need for emergency accommodation, 100,000 people around the country are on waiting lists and the Minister is attempting to defend what is a massive reduction in funds for **welfare** housing.

* He speaks about the recent Commonwealth-States housing finance agreement as representing some kind of progress in a sense that it will now be possible under the agreement to remove- from housing commission accommodation people who he says are well over and who I would say usually are marginally over the criteria that have traditionally been provided in relation to **welfare** housing.

* The sooner that he can be removed from the Ministry, the sooner the people in **welfare** and public housing will get a reasonable deal in this country.

* This Bill provides for the payment to the States in 1977-78 of the sum of $390m as advances for **welfare** housing under the provisions of the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* Over the five year period, 1973-74 to 1977-78, the States will have received concessional interest rate advances totalling $ 1,734m for **welfare** housing.

* This Government's aim, however, continues to be to maintain activity in the **welfare** housing area on an even keel.

* Information on **welfare** housing activity in 1976-77 provided by the States indicates that loans made from Home Builders' Account moneys were responsible for completion or purchase of 9,475 homes and, in addition, the State housing authorities commenced 9,420 dwellings and completed 8,530 dwellings in the year.

* This provision will enable the Treasurer to continue payments to the States for **welfare** housing after the expiration of the current Agreement on 30 June 1978 until legislation for a new agreement, and an appropriation measure for 1978-79 pursuant to the new agreement, are passed by the Parliament.

* At the same time, the strict conditions laid down in that scheme whereby only social workers can be employed and not **welfare** workers have meant that many of the positions have not been filled and many useful people who could be employed by the agencies have not been employed.

* Or is it the job of the Government to try to equalise opportunity and take out the ups and downs in income and provide basic levels of social **welfare** for farmers along with every other person in the community?

* Although I do not think breeding herds would be sacrificed, farmers would not get any cash flow and assistance would have to be made directly on **welfare** grounds unless in the meantime some form of credit can be instituted.

* While they represent an energetic breakthrough, **welfare** services have been neglected for far too long for us to rest on our laurels.

* I am pleased to see that this Government is determined to provide adequate finance for the expansion of **welfare** housing.

* The emphasis running through the Governor-General's Speech was on social **welfare** and care and consideration for people.

* We are a nation rich enough to provide for the **welfare** of our people.

* We aim to curb it, but we do not aim to throw away the great program of reform and change that this Government introduced into our community starting in 1972- the programs we have been following through steadily since in education, in community health, in social **welfare**.

* The only honourable members who so far have mentioned social **welfare** are the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  and the honourable member for Wide Bay  (Mr Millar)  who commented on this Government's insistence on financing an extravagant social **welfare** program.

* It is aU too clear when we look at its track record and it is all too clear when honourable members opposite did not bother to mention **welfare** matters in their reply to the Budget.

* The new system of tax is simpler, fairer, more flexible, more efficient and is in keeping with the Government's social **welfare** programs.

* The Labor Party stands where it has always stood- firmly on a platform of social **welfare** and firmly in support of the principle that the people's needs come first.

* There was a commitment to people in the **welfare** area who through some misfortune become the have-nots.

* The Government is reducing the public sector so that the people no longer will be able to obtain a reasonable 'social wage' in the form of public transport systems, urban renewal, regional development, housing, education, health, and **welfare** assistance for the disadvantaged and the unemployed.

* He worked most vigorously with the Defence Forces Retirement **Welfare** Association on all matters and became its consultant on amendments and suggestions to the Government on how the Act should best be altered for the **welfare** of the Services.

* I have here a circular from the Regular Defence Forces **Welfare** Association.

* It has the housing problems and social **welfare** problems that unfortunately often attend those communities.

* Commission on Social **Welfare** headed by that distinguished social worker,  Mrs Marie  Coleman.

* Will he indicate, by reversing this decision, that the **welfare** of all the people of Tasmania is far more important than the profitable trading of the ANL?

* -The Fraser Government is notorious for its many broken promises affecting the lives and **welfare** of the Australian people.

* But we are concerned also as employers for the future and **welfare** of our employees and our own children.

* With increased community wealth governments can spend more on pensions, schools, roads, health and other **welfare** programs and on government administration.

* I welcome the Government's emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* I am delighted that it is recognised that voluntary **welfare** agencies are a critically important part of the **welfare** system.

* He made what I called an excellent statement to this House on 30 August when he tabled the report of the Interim Commission on Social **Welfare** together with the Australian Assistance Plan.

* This Bill is to establish a social **welfare** commission.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission is working, people are being paid salaries, letterheads are printed and letters are being written for an institution which purports to be a statutory corporation when the Parliament has not yet authorised its establishment.

* The Interim Committee of the National Social **Welfare** Commission was appointed on 3 April 1973.

* Since that time a specific number of matters has been referred to it by the Minister, including the Australian Assistance Plan, the Aged Persons Homes Act, the home care program, the Senate Standing Committee's report on mentally and physically handicapped persons in Australia, emergency relief and multi-purpose **welfare** centres.

* The plan has as its stated aim 'to assist in the development, at a regional level within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of **welfare** services, complementary to income support programs and **welfare** - related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies.'

* It is also recognised that the suggested composition of these councils - involving representatives of the Australian, State and local governments, trade unions, employer groups, **welfare** consumer groups and non-government bodies concerned with social **welfare** - rests on an untried assumption, and more needs to be known about what might be a desirable composition.

* Evaluation of the appropriate population level for the planning and provision of **welfare** services will be necessary.

* In addressing a recent **welfare** conference in Melbourne the Minister made the following observations: 
Nor do we want to see a situation in which **welfare** agencies proliferate and are nationally organised in such a way that there are too many incentives for empire building, demarcation and territorial disputes, and, amongst the personnel, for self-maintenance and career improvement at the possible expense of the rights of the people the system is supposed to be helping.

* Theoretically, a council will have to work in liaison with the Australian Department of Social Security or the State offices of it and up to 13 other Australian Government departments, such as Aboriginal Affairs, Attorney-Generals', Capital Territory, Education, Environment and Conservation, Health, Housing, Immigration, Labour, Northern Territory, Repatriation, Tourism and Recreation and Urban and Regional Development; the State Government in its various departments concerned with **welfare** services; local governments - there are 900 of them; the Australian Council of Social Services and the State Council of Social Services; various planning boards in existence and to be set up; and local bodies and charities concerned with **welfare** services.

* The exceptions are: the development and implementation of policies for the advancement and **welfare** including education of the Aboriginal people in the Territory; land surveys; acquisition, leasing and management of land and property on behalf of the Australian Government and administrative servicing of the Northern Territory Police Force.

* It struck me as an anomaly, as I was listening to the Minister talking about the expansion of the Budget and the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat, that we have an increase in the Budget of 33 per cent.

* That is a 33 per cent increase in the budget of the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat.

* The Minister then went on to talk about allocations to national social **welfare** co-ordinating organisations such as the Australian Council of Social Service, the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled and the Australian Council on the Ageing.

* Yet the amount of money going to the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat, a part of the Government's bureaucracy, has been increased by 33 per cent at the same time.

* I commend the changes, as far as they go, that have been announced tonight as far as the social **welfare** policies are concerned.

* -The honourable member for Oxley  (Mr Hayden),  who just spoke, referred to the great achievement of the Labor Government in increasing the percentage of gross domestic product spent on social **welfare**.

* He also referred to what he believed was one thing that the Labor Government had done; it had not made Australia a soft society in spite of this increase in social **welfare**.

* Also, if one looks at the increase in the percentage of GDP spent on social **welfare** one sees that a significant percentage of that increase was spent on unemployment benefits which was made necessary by the massive increase in unemployment through the maladministration of that Government.

* So one can agree with the honourable member but still look for the real cause of soft societies which spend a great percentage on unemployment benefits and on social **welfare**.

* In many cases government expenditure has not achieved the same degree of **welfare** assistance that could be achieved by a closer look at people going into the homes and by the proper priority of capital expenditure in the first place.

* The Government has shown a callous disregard for the **welfare** of people living in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, which is located in my electorate of St George, and people living in the electorates of my colleagues the honourable member for Barton  (Mr Reynolds),  the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith  (Mr Lionel Bowen),  and the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly).

* This callous disregard for the interests and **welfare** of people living in the St George electorate and surrounding areas has to stop.

* As part of this approach, the Government will place great emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* The 
Honourable members, I put it to you that this coalition Government sitting here today is not one that is concerned with the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* Rather it is concerned only with the **welfare** and interests of those few among us to whom poverty is unknown.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* The first and most apparent one is that this Bill is another instance of **welfare** service being provided by instalments.

* I feci that this is not the way in which **welfare** services should be provided in the community.

* There should be a full explanation of the overall objectives of **welfare** service policy by the Government, not only in terms of what it has implemented and how that is evaluated in terms of service to the community but.

* how this meshes into a broad long-term plan proposing adequate **welfare** services for the benefit of the whole community and of the whole man.

* This has not been done so far, nor have we had a philosophical explanation of the basis upon which the Government promotes its **welfare** services.

* This, in turn, throws up the inconsistent manner in which we develop our **welfare** services, not only at the Federal level but at the State level too.

* Italy now leads us by roughly 30% in the field of social **welfare**.

* The United States, with due respect to it, was one of the few countries, until the Kennedys came to light which never thought much of social **welfare**, heads Australia by 12% at 66.6%.

* That is a damning indictment of the Government's policy - the slip in social **welfare** in this country after 20 years of administration by it is shown by the fact that we have dropped behind countries that never thought of having a social **welfare** scheme in days gone by.

* That is why today I condemn to some extent the Minister for his failure to see that we lead other countries, as we did when Labor was in office, in the field of social **welfare** and that the needy and the deserving get the assistance to which they are entitled.

* At the same time I think we have an obligation to pensioners from one end of this country to the other to get up and condemn the Government that spends unlimited funds on everything one can think of except social **welfare**.

* I think it is about time we measured our achievements in terms of people and **welfare** and not money and statistics.

* The economic **welfare** of the Australian people deserves better than this sort of charade.

* They affect people in receipt of social **welfare** benefits, pre-school education and migrants.

* They affect the services provided by **welfare** programs which depend on supplementary advances from the Government.

* What percentage of the gross national product was spent on health, education and **welfare** and what percentage was spent by (a) all public authorities and (b) all private sources, during each of the past S years.

* Can he state for the latest years available those countries in which the total expenditure on health, education and **welfare** expressed as a percentage of their gross national product exceeds that of Australia.

* I have been approached by the Federal Council of Polish Associations in Australia, supported by the Polish branch of the RAAF Association, the RSL Polish Branch, the Polish Club Ltd, the ExServicemen's Association of the Polish Home Army, the Polish Association in New South Wales and the Polish Educational Society in New South Wales about the **welfare** problems facing the Polish community in Australia.

* They want a detailed survey of their needs; the establishment of a Polish-oriented psychiatric unit; the urgent appointment of an interpreter to the New South Wales Health Commission as an interim measure until the establishment of the psychiatric unit; the appointment of a full time Polish speaking social worker under the GIA scheme and funding for the Polish **Welfare** and Information Bureau in New South Wales.

* Because they were independent people, they generally looked after their own **welfare** problems.

* But, at the same time as they are looking at the problems of the Polish people within Australia, they might as well look at the **welfare** problems of the whole of the ethnic communities because most ethnic communities here face problems similar to those faced by the Polish community.

* In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general **welfare** in a democratic society.

* What will be the functions of the proposed multi-purpose **welfare** clinics in Sydney and Melbourne.

* It has flowed from four fundamental considerations: the need to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation; the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy deficient world; the need to protect effectively the environment in which mining development will take place; the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the **welfare** and interests of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers region and of all other prople living in the region and working on the development projects.

* One of the basic recommendations was that the Aborigines **Welfare** Board should be abolished.

* The inquiries and investigations of the committee indicated that the Aborigines **Welfare** Board in New South Wales had not fulfilled its function and had not done the job that it was hoped it would do.

* It was coincidental that at about the time the report of this all party joint committee was presented to the Parliament the Aborigines **Welfare** Board embarked on some improvement projects - and I am speaking from only personal experience here-- at least in one quarter of New South Wales.

* But, of course, there came the time when the Parliament of New South Wales in its wisdom implemented the report of the select committee and said that the Aborigines **Welfare** Board, should be dissolved and its functions taken over by the various departments of State that were charged with the care and responsibility and **welfare** of the rest of the community.

* Therefore, in due course it was decided by the Government of New South Wales that the Aborigines **Welfare** Board would cease its operations and would be in fact dissolved.

* I accepted the recommendation of the Board because this decision was made by the Parliament in good- faith in the belief that more would be done in the field of **welfare** and in the sphere of social advancement.

* The whole burden of work in this quarter of the State has now been given to an officer of the Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare** Department who has already been called upon to cover a tremendous area and to tackle very many complex problems.

* It is our objective to increase our aid commitment as far as we can possibly do so, keeping in mind the fact that we have to run the Australian economy, deal with the numerous social **welfare** problems that we have in Australia, as well as pull our weight internationally and assist those countries, many of which are far worse off than ourselves.

* The low foreign exchange earnings of those nations and the huge foreign debts which they have regrettably had to run up since independence will continue to remain a major difficulty in their overall economic **welfare**.

* Under this Bill, once a certificate is issued by the Conciliation Commission to the effect that there is a stoppage of work in a particular union which affects the **welfare** of the community, the Minister will have the right to declare that particular members of that union shall not be eligible to continue to hold office, or that particular members of the union shall not be eligible to contest a ballot for office, or that particular members of a union may not be eligible to record a vote in an election for union officials, or that a particular member or members shall be prohibited from attending a union meeting, voting at a union meeting or attending a meeting of workers on a particular job.

* Many men and women in the community break the law not because they are promiscuous and irresponsible but because they are married, over stressed and desperately seek abortions as the only way out in a perfectly respectable family situation where an unexpected pregnancy threatens the health or **welfare** of the mother and her whole family.

* There is also movement between Wattie Creek and the Wave Hill **welfare** settlement.

* Let me now mention briefly some of the achievements in Aboriginal **welfare** in the Northern Territory.

* Total expenditures on Aboriginal **welfare** in the Northern Territory have risen from S6.7m in 1965-66 to an estimated SI 5.7m in 1970-71.

* You are assembled at this Second Session of the 27th Parliament to consider and decide on matters affecting the security and growth of the Australian nation, and matters concerning the **welfare** of the citizens who constitute that nation.

* And now, as we enter this new decade of opportunity for Australia, I leave you to the discharge of your high and important duties in the faith that Divine Providence will guide your deliberations and further the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* Within the terms of appropriate legislation governmental control seeks to set broad parameters within which a country's shipping business is to be conducted having regard to the safely and **welfare** of its participants.

* I referred to the recently publicised proposals of the Government's health and **welfare** committee as one such possibility.

* The honourable member for Blaxland, who poses as the great friend of primary industry, who stands in this Parliament and claims to have a vested interest in the **welfare** of primary industry, is on record as having said last year that he regarded this sort of stabilisation scheme as a form of **welfare** assistance, a dole for the fruit growers, a hand-out.

* Senator Gietzelt,  the Opposition spokesman on primary industry matters in the Senate, made a magnificent contribution to the **welfare** of the fruit industry when last year he said that the Opposition would not oppose the legislation- not that it supported it, but that it would not oppose it.

* On the other hand, after making a modest allowance for inflation, the Budget gives less to Canberra in total social **welfare** appropriations, education appropriations, health appropriations, and the construction budget for the National Capital Development Commission.

* In fact, condemnation is more in order as **welfare** spending will actually drop.

* In a Press interview, quoting figures about some individuals representing the party's interests, the Minister for the Capital Territory said that congratulations had gone to the Government for the apparent fact that social **welfare** expenditure in the Territory is to rise.

* Condemnation is probably more the order of the day as **welfare** spending in the Australian Capital Territory will drop.

* Only the allocation for **welfare** spending by the Department of the Capital Territory rose in this Budget.

* In that respect the social **welfare** allocations made by the Government are somewhat of a subterfuge.

* It is changing the picture as to what in fact happens with the funds as it proceeds to subsidise what should have been the responsibility of the Government- to maintain the level of expenditure in relation to those organisations which deal with people who are not in a position to help themselves in the social **welfare** area and to encourage those organisations to maintain their services.

* Last year the Department of the Capital Territory was allocated $5.93m for **welfare** expenditure.

* The Department of Social Security contributed $ 1.32m and the revenue from poker machine funds added close to $ 1 m. Total **welfare** funds for the Australian Capital Territory were therefore $8.25m.

* He said that the Social **Welfare** Commission was set up without parliamentary approval.

* The aim of the Australian Assistance Plan is to assist in the development, at a regional level within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of **welfare** services, complementary to income support programs and the **welfare**-related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies, having regard to the following matters: 
That local residents and **welfare** consumer groups are encouraged to participate in the planning and provision of **welfare** services.

* When he was Minister for Social Services I wrote to him repeatedly and asked for information and statistics about the depth and the amount of poverty that existed, the lack of housing and the lack of **welfare** services to the community.

* In my State of New South Wales the State departments operating in this field include the Department of Housing, which administers the State Housing Commission, the Department of Youth and Community Services, which was formerly the Department responsible for social **welfare**, the Police Department and, to name one other State office, chamber magistrates.

* This is what is wrong with the social **welfare** system.

* He said that his Party believed in voluntary involvement in social **welfare** services.

* The sight of voluntary workers being forced to beg in the streets to provide basic health and social **welfare** amenities I find intolerable as, I am sure, do most sections of the community.

* We should not depend on voluntary helpers to provide all needs including the massive finance that is essential to make our **welfare** system function.

* There is no co-ordination throughout the whole community to analyse and to dissect the **welfare** and health problems and what is required in a total community program to bring them to fruition over a period to meet the requirements.

* I see the Australian Assistance Plan as the beginning of a program to create a proper integrated **welfare** system in Australia.

* We wish to assist their vested interests by obtaining and maintaining for the Australian people the best **welfare** service available by way of a scheme whose application is practical.

* It has education proposals and proposals for pre-school and child care, a superannuation scheme, a compensation scheme and social **welfare** schemes.

* Let me add two further points about the Chifley social **welfare** programme.

* On the other hand, we must talk about it because the contents of this Bill, and especially the way in which the Bill was foreshadowed, raise fundamental questions as to what our attitudes should be on not only pensions but also the whole social **welfare** system in Australia.

* Instead of discussing the social **welfare** aims appropriate in an affluent democracy and instead of discussing need, all of us too often have been content to deal in statistics, averages, percentages, tables, indices and summaries and having exhausted all these things, in reciprocal abuse.

* While tourism is unlikely to have a dramatic effect on community health and **welfare**, it is in a unique position to foster and develop the community's knowledge of Australia and the Australian heritage.

* I have never at any time questioned his sincerity or his intense interest in Aboriginal **welfare**.

* lt is true that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is taking over the control of and the responsibility for the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people, lt will be through that channel that most of the administration will be undertaken.

* Whether a government spends money on pensions, on industry, on **welfare** or on Aborigines, the department concerned should program its expenditure so that it accounts for its actions.

* Aboriginal administration traditionally has been concerned with policies of protection, control, and **welfare**.

* These policies are essentially static in their purpose and intent, and their required administrative personnel, police, doctors, **welfare** officers and clerks.

* It is no use asking the **welfare** officers: 'What have you done to assimilate the Aboriginals today?'

* As the Minister for Housing  (Mr Les Johnson)  advised the Parliament in his second reading speech the Bill has four main purposes: Firstly, to make provision for the extension of the war service homes scheme to include those members of the forces who have completed a specified period of defence service; secondly, to make provision for an increase in the maximum loan under the scheme from $9,000 to $12,000; thirdly, to make provision for the granting of war service homes benefits to certain unmarried female persons with qualifying service under the Act; fourthly, to provide for the extension of eligibility to certain persons who served overseas with the Australian forces in the 1939-45 war, or in war-like operations subsequent to that war, as accredited representatives of a **welfare** organisation.

* This Bill not only gives belated justice to the women in this category, but also gives justice to those members of **welfare** organisations who served overseas.

* The provisions in this Bill will not only enable the scheme to continue making an important contribution to the national **welfare** by assisting eligible persons and their families in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain homes but will also bring the privilege of these benefits and restore justice to many who were previously deprived.

* The **welfare** housing provisions of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement now make housing available to those earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings.

* If we are to have a social **welfare** service and if the aged are in need in one area, surely that need is reflected in all other areas.

* This may be the reason for the scarcity of **welfare** workers in Western Australia.

* I was appalled to find that the subsidy claimed by local government Authorities in Western Australia for **welfare** workers was only S5.475 for the period from 1 July 1969 to 30 June 1973 and for home care aid for the same period $26,000.

* The Government boasts of significant increases in expenditure in various areas of immigrant **welfare**, but the truth of the matter is that it is the immigrants themselves who will now be paying for the services the Government has appeared to offer so generously on the prompting of the Gal bally report.

* Not only are immigrants now asked to pay for the administrative costs they incur at a time when they are least able to pay for them, but they are the ones from whom money is to be taken to pay for the supporting programs designed as immigrant **welfare**- the props and supports designed to give immigrants greater equality with other Australian citizens.

* Insofar as there is now a significant component in the immigration **welfare** program which is really directed at and for refugees, one could claim that immigrants generally will be paying for their own postarrival **welfare** and for that of refugees.

* Foremost among the points of agitation is the contention that the social **welfare** system in Australia is relatively inferior to the systems in other parts of the world.

* The whole sorry story, the whole historical cavalcade of events, makes a laughing stock of any sincerity which the Government claims about its concern for the **welfare** of our migrant community whose desires and interests have been denied.

* I remind honourable members that when we talk of the United Council of Immigrants, the Council whose policy has been embraced today completely and unambiguously by the Australian Labor Party, we are speaking of the Central Council of Croatian Associations in Australia, the Italian **Welfare** Centre Co., the Netherlands Society of Sydney, the Association of Australian Slovaks, the Swiss Club of New South Wales, the Ukrainian Society of New South Wales, the Federal Council of Polish Associations, the Estonian Society in Sydney, the Hungarian Council of New South Wales, the Maltese Community Council of New South Wales, the Latvian community in Sydney, the Lithuanian community in Sydney and the Australian Romanian Association.

* The announcement came as a shabby kind of repudiation of all the protestations by the Government, at the time of the introduction of the Budget in August of last year and in a debate only a couple of weeks before this measure was introduced, that no more money could be found for pensioners or for any form of social **welfare**.

* That is the contribution that is made for pensioner **welfare** in the face of ever increasing costs in the community.

* The European Economic Community countries pay out 15.2 per cent of their gross national product in social **welfare**, Scandinavia pays 10.9 per cent, Canada 9.9 per cent, the United Kingdom 8.6 per cent, Switzerland 8.2 per cent, New Zealand 6.6 per cent, the United States 5.9 per cent and Australia, with a means test loaded on to it, pays 5.5 per cent, trailing all those countries with which we ought to be able to compare ourselves.

* There was a time when Australia was either in front or near the front as far as its social **welfare** provisions were concerned.

* It is a poor show that many of the grants which the Government makes to help pensioners in the provision of housing, senior citizens centres, domiciliary services and **welfare** offices are conditional on local governments or State governments matching those grants.

* In my view, it is extremely difficult to get away from that feeling of involvement with both parties, particularly where the **welfare** of a child is concerned.

* Quite obviously, the **welfare** of the child is the most important issue.

* I am pleased that in most of the decisions that have been brought to my attention the judges who have been appointed to this jurisdiction have shown a great degree of objectivity in deciding what is to be done for the **welfare** of the child.

* In fact, a social **welfare** approach, whether it was in the form of unemployment benefits or a relief program such as the one I instanced, combined or separately, assumed major influence in the local economy and I would suggest that this was rather an unhealthy sort of situation to have occurred.

* They need support from health and **welfare** services at the community level.

* We need health and **welfare** services to help many of these people.

* He was suggesting that the Liberal Party decides matters behind closed doors and closets itself away to make decisions affecting the **welfare** of the nation.

* We are rapidly approaching the **welfare** state.

* That is Orwell's '1984'; that is the **welfare** state.

* Is the Minister not disturbed about the way costs of social **welfare** are already rising in Australia?

* The Prime Minister envisaged a time when the total hand-outs or pay-outs for social **welfare** would represent 12 per cent of gross national product.

* Those plans are so significant that they affect the level of economic activity of the country and the social **welfare** of each of its citizens, and thus the lives of each one of us who lives here.

* They are capable of selection, but in the areas of resource allocation and the setting of appropriate social and **welfare** priorities these budgetary policies have been remiss.

* 3 on page 13 of the Budget Speech documents, under the heading 'Payment to National **Welfare** Fund', discloses a drop of $20,143,000 in the amount expected to be spent on child endowment during the current year - from an actual expenditure of $220,143,000 in 1969- 70 to an estimated $200m in 1970- 71.

* What work is  Mr Harry  Giese, the former Assistant Administrator (**Welfare**), engaged in.

* The other document concerns a statement from the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society.

* It is signed by  Dr Spiro  Moraitis,  President,  and  Mr George  Papadopolous,  Chairman,  of the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society.

* Although many millions of dollars are being spent on **welfare** housing, thousands and thousands of people on or below the poverty line do not receive the benefit of this money and aU the honourable members who spoke today well know it.

* At the Premiers Conference last year the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  outlined the Government's concern for **welfare** housing and the broad guidelines that it intended to adopt to build a new agreement.

* Pursuant to section 16 of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973 1 present a report by the Social **Welfare** Commission entitled  Care of the Aged.

* Of course there is a case for measures of assistance to primary producers, particularly on **welfare** grounds.

* 1 ) How many Aborigines have been recruited as **welfare** officers in the Department of the Northern Territory Development Branch and its successors in each year since 1 970.

* After the Premiers Conference in June we gave the States a virtual blank cheque for the construction of **welfare** housing.

* One thing is clearly implicit in our opponents' proposals- the slashing of basic public expenditure on schools, **welfare**, health and cities.

* I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the details of the achievements which I have summarised and a list of committees, commissions of inquiry and task forces established since 13 December 1973 and reporting to the Government; reports tabled in the Parliament in 1974 on inquiries instituted by (a) the present Government and (b) the previous Government; statements arising from meetings of Australian Government and State government Ministers tabled in the Parliament in 1974; the text of treaties and so on tabled in the Parliament in 1974; the Government's **welfare** reforms; the 28th Parliament-Government legislation program, and the 29th Parliament-Government legislation program.

* My Department and the Office of Aboriginal Affairs have made special efforts to assist the States in determining the most effective ways to improve the health of this section of our community and recently in an effort to determine the major factors responsible for the production of subnormal health, particularly in Aboriginal children, and ways to correct them, convened a meeting or Workshop' at which representatives from the States and Territories and experts in fields of anthropology, nutrition, paediatrics, nursing, **welfare**, administration, public health and medical research were present in Sydney in December 1969.

* Did the Government have before it a proposal which was designed to make the tax and **welfare** system fairer and more equitable?

* The honourable member will also be aware that the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** is currently taking evidence.

* These are as follows: 
It presented a case for an expanded chaner to the Senate standing committee on health and **welfare**.

* The impact of this process of close scrutiny can only benefit a very important area of **welfare** policy.

* The main problem confronting repatriation assistance in the year ahead is the basic problem that will affect **welfare** services in all areas of government spending.

* Any **welfare** policy which aims at a broad coverage is liable to abuse.

* With any **welfare** system the crucial result is what actually goes into the pockets of the persons receiving the benefits.

* Unfortunately, departmental officers are acting under the direct instructions of Government ministers who have made it quite clear that they expect the toughest possible interpretation to be placed on every set of regulations and **welfare** provisions.

* There are achievements in the field of social **welfare** which I would like to see brought to fruition during my time as Prime Minister.

* He has now been Prime Minister for 3 years, but instead of making progress in the field of social **welfare**, his Government has regressed.

* Undoubtedly this is often the result of the activities of left wing socialists and communist union leaders who have little regard for the **welfare** of the people they represent or the community as a whole.

* The damage that could be caused to :he people's **welfare** was demonstrated very strongly in the recent petrol strike.

* Here again we find this problem of industrial disputes causing great hardship, because in that area the wheat harvest, which is very necessary to the **welfare** of the people in the wheat industry, is just commencing.

* I think it is necessary to put the Australian Assistance Plan into some sort of perspective and to point out the extent of government outlays that are involved in social security and **welfare** as functional groupings in the Budget.

* It is interesting to note that in 1972-73 the Government allocated $2, 102m to social security and **welfare** and that in 1975-76 this amount had risen to an estimated $4,772m, which is an increase of over 100 per cent.

* This amount of course will be significantly higher because our allocations for social security and **welfare** are running at a rate of about 20 per cent of our total Budget.

* It is also interesting to note that the Budget Papers reveal that about $87m of the almost $5 billion allocated for social security and **welfare** is to go towards the cost of salaries and administration of the Department of Social Security.

* Commonwealth Government to the State Minister for Community **Welfare**, to the State committee for the implementation of the Plan, to the social planning secretariat thence to advisory committees and regional councils which in turn deal with local committees or projects.

* The first was the need for regional social planning and the regionalisation of **welfare** services.

* He says that he now supports the approach based on the localisation of **welfare** services and social planning.

* A lot of areas need to be looked at in terms of social security and **welfare** in Australia.

* This covers areas such as a uniform income benefit, inquiring into proposals for a minimum family income, looking at ways and means of wiping out the multitude of individual programs which now exist in the social **welfare** system and implementing a single program for which people could qualify in a multitude of different ways.

* I am suggesting tonight that the Government should look seriously at the recommendations in the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission on the Australian Assistance Plan.

* For example, there was an increase of 78 per cent in expenditure on education; $7Sm was provided for pre-school and child care programs; $28m was made available to commence the construction of new hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane; provision was made for home dialysis appliances free of charge; additional funds were provided for nursing homes and for the national drug education program; a further step has been taken in the abolition of the means test for pensioners; increased rent assistance has been given to pensioners; there has been a doubling of the capital subsidy available under the Aged Persons Homes Act; a new handicapped childs allowance of $ 10 a week is to be paid to parents and guardians in respect of a child under 16 years of age who is cared for at home and who, because of the severity of the handicap, is in need of constant care and attention; a 34 per cent increase, which is $67m, is to be made available in grants to the States for **welfare** housing and there is the possibility of further grants should circumstances warrant.

* First, we propose to supplement Consolidated Revenue Fund receipts, and thereby reduce the size of the prospective Consolidated Revenue Fund deficiency, by paying into that Fund unrequired balances held in the National **Welfare** Fund Trust Account.

* Under the provisions of the National **Welfare** Fund Act the balances held by the National **Welfare** Fund Trust Account cannot be spent directly from the Fund.

* The 1952 amendment to the National **Welfare** Fund Act provided a standing appropriation for the automatic replenishment of the National' **Welfare** Fund Trust Account in respect of any moneys paid from the account for social services.

* I intend that the internal treasury bill holdings of the National **Welfare** Fund Trust Account be redeemed.

* Nonetheless, I agree with the honourable member for Mackellar that there can always be a backlash in social **welfare** and social security programs if they seem to be too generous.

* There is always a core of conservative people in the community who resent strongly the provision of what they feel are too generous' benefits or 'too generous' a system of **welfare** services being established in the community.

* I can assure the honourable member for Mackellar that Australia is a long way short of being too generous either in the provision of benefits or of **welfare** services or in the philosophy that motivates the development of these things.

* I think that it is highly fortuitous that he has come into this portfolio to administer a matter which is very important to the **welfare** of ex-servicemen and indeed servicemen who, as a result of initiatives taken by the Labor Government referred to by the honourable member for Reid, are also eligible for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act.

* The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $364.6m for **welfare** housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement.

* We are maintaining this level of spending for **welfare** housing despite our overall policy of stringent restraint on public sector spending.

* Some States are currently experiencing difficulties in maintaining their **welfare** housing programs- difficulties, I might add, that are a direct legacy of the previous Government.

* Funds available to the States for **welfare** housing increased from $ 169.8m in 1972-73 to $2 18.7m in 1973-74.

* The funds made available for **welfare** housing escalated even further in 1974-75.

* In other words, the Treasurer will be authorised to continue payments to the States for **welfare** housing in the period from 1 July 1976 until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament.

* The Bill provides that interim payments may be made for **welfare** housing under the authority of section 5 of the Financial Agreement Act 1928 as advances supplementary to the advances under the approved Loan Council program.

* But I thought a more pointed comment was made by the Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare**, the honourable member for Hotham, on 21 September in Melbourne at a meeting of the Australian Dental Association when he said: 
Will he make a statement to the House on the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**  and  the recommendations touching on the care and education of handicapped children; if so, when.

* It does not matter to the Prime Minister whether **welfare** policies work so long as all power is in his hands.

* In Toowoomba there are 2 **welfare** organisations - the Spastic Centre and the Endeavour Workshop, the latter incorporating Endeavour Farm and Endeavour Manufacturing which are engaged in the training or employment of handicapped people.

* The Queensland Subnormal Children's **Welfare** Association, Darling Downs Branch, controls the Hamewith Day and Boarding School and the Endeavour Farm and Endeavour workshop.

* I am firmly of the view that the best possible service is given and the best outlook obtained by a marriage between government and voluntary **welfare** organisations.

* Those who prefer a glib answer to an accurate one, those of our opponents who prefer some personal or Party advantage to the **welfare** of the people they represent, have come up with quite a simple explanation.

* South Australian Industrial Code Regulations under the Industrial Safety, Health and **Welfare** Act, Section 39, (1972-78).

* But because of its attitude of arbitrarily taking from one section to hand to another section it created a void in the economy with the consequence that it did not have the capacity to carry the extensive and lavish social **welfare** programs which were introduced.

* Nevertheless, we are able to hold our heads high and to show very clearly that we can sustain at least the levels of those essential social **welfare** programs which are indispensable in this period of high costs and at this time of uncertainty.

* -Recently the Coleman Social **Welfare** Commission tabled its report in this House.

* It is the official recognition of that view by the Social **Welfare** Commission which has pleased many concerned members of our society.

* It was with sincere regret that we heard the recent statement made in the Senate by the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Wheeldon)  in which he announced, in response to the recommendations in the Coleman report, that the Government could not afford any significant reforms or developments in social **welfare** within the foreseeable future.

* I suggest that Australia has been very well served by the dual system of broadcast ing, and it is my belief that this newly established Department of the Media will serve as the agency that will ensure that broadcasters of this country, whether they be national or commercial, will be encouraged to look forward to another SO years of successful broadcasting in the interests and general **welfare** of the people of this country.

* What was the breakdown of Regional Employment Development Scheme expenditure in terms of ( a ) **welfare** facilities, (b) sport and recreation, (c) tourist facilities, (d) water reticulation, (e) major drainage, (f) kerbing, guttering, footpaving, minor drainage, (g) hospital and ancillary services, (h) servicing the RED Scheme and (i) other expenditure.

* In the last two or three years I have seen a continuing attack upon this whole attitude, and in listening to my colleagues opposite I find a continual denunciation of education expenditure and **welfare** expenditure.

* If the Honourable Murray Byrne had the interest in the **welfare** of Portland that he pretended to have for the purposes of the election campaign, I would have thought that at least he would have replied to my letter to him dated 27th March, but not a word have 1 heard from the Honourable Murray Byrne.

* There is really no good rational economic, social or **welfare** argument why we should subsidise the users of superphosphate any more than we should subsidise orchardists who use expensive chemicals or poultry farmers who have to purchase very expensive feed.

* difficult to justify on the basis of **welfare** or efficiency.

* In my own State there is the Subnormal Children's **Welfare** Organisation and the Wheelchair and Disabled Association of Australia.

* I pay a tribute to the Minister for Child **Welfare** and the Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Hewitt,  who is a personal friend of mine.

* When in due course the pensioners of Australia read  Hansard  they will be interested to learn that during the debate on these social **welfare** Bills tonight three quorums were called by the Labor Party.

* We are talking about an appropriation of $8,0 15m, an increase of $524m on the actual expenditure last year for social security and social **welfare**, which amounted to $7,490m.

* The numbers on the Labor Party side have increased slightly on this occasion but once again it demonstrates their absolute contempt and their absolute lack of concern for the **welfare** of the pensioners of Australia.

* The next matter I want to - 

 -Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to be rude, but the speech of the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden)  was just crammed full of meaningless generalities, such as the statements that social **welfare** must be paid for and that the health scheme is not free.

* The right honourable member said that social **welfare** must be paid for.

* They want a fortune to be pumped into companies, they want social **welfare** to be improved and they want government spending to be cut, but when we ask them to get down to the kernel of the matter and provide details as to what they would do they are not able to do so.

* As I outlined to the House before, because of the contingencies which arose and because of the shocking neglect of 23 years of ineffectual government before we came to power, the amount of spending in the social **welfare**, education and urban development areas in particular had to be massive; the expenditure outlays had to be massive to overcome the anomalies that were present in the Aus.tralian community.

* He would wreck the social **welfare** system of Australia 
 I believe that the Budget was a sensible proposition.

* It is a compromise between competing loyalties- our loyalties to the **welfare** of the people and our concern for the economy.

* What I said was that when the strike broke out the Aboriginals established a strikers camp near the Wave Hill **welfare** settlement and that subsequently they went to the site of Wattie Creek which was the site of their own choice.

* It does not give me any satisfaction to be saying some of these things, but it is transparently obvious to any person interested in Aboriginal **welfare** in this place that these problems exist.

* None of us would take away from the Minister his sincerity and dedication to the **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* In the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Howard)  and in speeches made by the Minister, the Government has stated that in relation to **welfare** housing the amount of money made available this year is equivalent to the amount made available last year.

* -Nearly 100,000 families are waiting for homes from the Housing Commission and at least half a million people are living in sub-standard housing, and this Government has not only increased the social problems of those elements in the community which need housing and reneged with regard to **welfare** housing, but it has also reneged on the home savings grant scheme.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission (Repeal) Bill before the House repeals the Social **Welfare** Commission Act 1973.

* I should like to look very briefly at one of the more important tasks of the Social **Welfare** Commission which was the evaluation of the Australian Assistance Plan.

* The Plan was an experimental program under which the Government funded community **welfare** projects and the employment of community development officers who were quite often used in projects themselves funded under the Plan.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission evaluated these projects and the effectiveness of Federal funding for local initiatives by them through a variety of voluntary bodies and local government authorities.

* The evaluations carried out by the Social **Welfare** Commission have shown the hollowness of that kind of statement.

* But the clear message of the Social **Welfare** Commission's work is that Federal funding is essential to the continuing viability of the community **welfare** projects initiated.

* The reports of the Social **Welfare** Commission established in my own area the need for many of the projects.

* Many projects funded by the Federal Government under the Australian Assistance Plan and evaluated by the Social **Welfare** Commission obtained a large part of their costs from other Federal programs some of which are still on foot even though the appropriations for them have been cut considerably.

* Those kinds of grants were essential; the work of the Social **Welfare** Commission clearly established that.

* The reports of the Social **Welfare** Commission established that the worthwhile local initiatives and locally administered projects which were encouraged as a result of the grants from the Whitlam Labor Government are now in grave jeopardy.

* The reports of the Social **Welfare** Commission established quite clearly the overlap in indentifying low income families in old, established inner city areas and new settlers in this country.

* The work of the Social **Welfare** Commission which is now to be abolished clearly established this.

* The idea that there is a massive duplication of sources of funding available for **welfare** projects is just not true.

* I was disturbed to note that Queensland is to receive only 8.5 per cent of the total amount of $364m for **welfare** housing.

* One wonders why the Labor Government in framing its Budget saw fit to cut the allocation for **welfare** housing in respect of Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia.

* That is very important because with **welfare** housing we are looking in the main to the disadvantaged and low income groups.

* They are men who develop specialised expertise in a field which cannot be gained anywhere else in the community, and through the way in which their **welfare** is being indifferently regarded by the Government they are being pressured out of the Service.

* It can ascertain from the States the number of people in receipt of child **welfare** assistance.

* I am concerned at the ramifications of the Government's proposed social **welfare** program.

* It is quite clear that the AMP Society, the largest of the life societies in Australia, is conducting a campaign against the whole social **welfare** proposals, not only of this Government but also of previous governments.

* It appears that the insurance industry, through its leaders, is now undertaking a program against the whole of the **welfare** programs which the Australian people enjoy or which they expect.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* One of the great attributes of the Australian Labor Party Government was that it introduced into this nation a very effective early childhood **welfare** program.

* Its establishment meant that there would be new initiatives and programs for the care and **welfare** of young children.

* This is a tragedy for rational and reasonable development of a **welfare** program for the benefit of all Australians.

* I have no quarrel with the text of this letter; it does make the best of a pretty poor case and it is as sympathetic as a letter about a harsh aspect of social **welfare** policy can be.

* This, of course, is not a problem exclusive to repatriation pensioners; it affects all social **welfare** pensions near the margins of permissible assessed income.

* I do not blame the Minister for Repatriation for this; obviously this is a broad matter of social **welfare** policy.

* Further still, we would not find, as we have found for the last couple of years, that a substantial amount of the money provided for Aboriginal **welfare** remains unspent.

* It is certainly a remarkable situation that money allocated to Aboriginal **welfare** should remain unspent when so much is required to achieve the purpose for which the money was appropriated.

* Each of these sections, which require the expenditure of **welfare** moneys on them in some way or another, will have to be dealt with differently.

* According to figures available from the Departments of Health and Native **Welfare**  in  Western Australia, about 13 per cent of the- fullblood Aboriginals in the Kimberleys now have or have had leprosy and, according to  Dr Davidson  of the Health Commission, it is never claimed that they are cured.

* Mr Bill  Ryan, who is an Aboriginal **Welfare** Officer, came along.

* There seems to me to be in the **Welfare** Division in the Northern Territory a pervading intimidatory atmosphere the like of which is not known in any other government department that I know of in Australia.

* It is far more desirable that they should bring in the experienced people who are educationalists or **welfare** officers and expose all this business to sensible examination.

* I have received complaints, and from inquiries I have made it seems that at least some of these organisations are primarily concerned with encouraging people to invest funds in their various business enterprises rather than with the **welfare** of the individuals involved.

* Although it was clearly of a psychosocial origin, I believe that in only 2 cases did a doctor refer the patient for social **welfare** counselling.

* Once we get in to the health centre context in which there is a more ready availability of paramedical services and other supportive services, such as **welfare** counselling, I think we will find that there will be far less recourse to drugs with the consequent problem of drug induced disease.

* In spite of the large amount of public money that is being diverted to these types of ventures, it appears as though there is not really very much return from them by way of the increased **welfare** or health of the community.

* These deficiences need progressive reforms, which have been under intensive examination by the Liberal Party's committee on social security, health and **welfare** over the past several months, and I know also by the Country Party's health and social security committee.

* Some of the major guidelines submitted to working parties by my committee on social security, health and **welfare** are as follows: We believe as a committee that health care reasonably available is a right.

* Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* Under the heading of health and **welfare** the Government evidently does not consider public road safety important enough to receive individual attention in the Budget Papers.

* Nothing is more depressing than to go into primary schools particularly and see evidence of the concept that we still retain that with good parents and teachers organisations and good **welfare** committees certain equipment can be obtained but that if these bodies do not exist a school can go begging for this equipment.

* It is my view that the office of Governor-General must always be occupied by a distinguished Australian who must now, because of the complexities of that high office, be absolutely conversant with every section of the Constitution and ready to implement it fearlessly whenever the overriding consideration of the national **welfare** arises.

* Will the Opposition never learn that it is here not as an official Opposition to the Governor-General but as the duly elected representatives of the people to make some contribution towards their **welfare** and prosperity, a task which continues to elude the Opposition?

* A range of community and **welfare** services is now expected to be provided by local government.

* The total outlay on social security and general **welfare** items is 27.8 per cent of estimated total Budget outlays, an increase from $7,490.3m last year to $8,0 14.7m this year.

* He said: 
Social **welfare** and economic policy are two subjects which are too often discussed in isolation from each other even though it is common for discussions of either subject to pay lip service to the importance of the other.

* The result is that very often economic policy and social **welfare** policy are perceived as being antagonistic when in fact they are necessarily complementary.

* Of course, no one can seriously suggest that since Federation the parties to which honourable members opposite belong, irrespective of what they have called themselves, have given the depth of thought to the people in receipt of social security payments or social **welfare** payments that the Australian Labor Party has given.

* So I suggest that honourable members opposite were only using social **welfare** as a hobby because they had to accept it as part of their responsibility when they formed a national government.

* Think of social **welfare** recipients throughout Australia.

* But it is wrong to imagine that the community's needs for **welfare** are simply met by providing better benefit payments to the individual.

* The community collectively and the people in it individually equally need a comprehensive and adequate system of social **welfare** services.

* It is strange and disappointing to find though that Australia, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, has one of the most undeveloped systems of **welfare** services.

* Gauging the performances of past Australian governments it is clear the promotion of social **welfare** programs was guided by a philosophy that social **welfare** was for the deserving poor.

* We believe that social **welfare** services should be available for all and the worth of those services should not be stigmatised by such class prejudiced and antiquated values.

* Conveniently sited health or **welfare** centres providing a range of integrated services relevant to the community needs in which the centres are set up are as keenly sought by the middle class as the working class.

* Our aim is the provision of a comprehensive range of **welfare** services designed according to the carefully established needs of communities, developed in response to priorities largely set by local decision making procedures which involve the community served as well as agencies both official and unofficial and free of any taint of last century poor house **welfare**.

* We assert firmly that the availability of adequate **welfare** systems which can be brought into operation quickly in response to the needs of individuals or of whole communities, must be seen as a public right.

* That is why we have appointed a Social **Welfare** Commission with  Mrs Marie  Coleman as  Chairman,  whose eminence in this field is well known.

* This Commission is charged with the responsibility of assisting the Australian Government in setting long range objectives in the planning, development and operation of social **welfare** services.

* Today I have tabled the first report of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the first discussion paper prepared by the Commission on the Australian Assistance Plan.

* In this way the Australian Government aims at developing **welfare** services according to a new philosophy appropriate to the expectations and needs of contemporary Australian society.

* The aim of a social **welfare** system is to produce, through a range of social policies, a social environment in which every individual has the opportunity to develop his unique potential and in which various supports are offered to those individuals who, through some inherited or acquired disadvantage or handicap, need special assistance.

* Thus, housing and education policies, policies concerning minimum acceptable income and taxation systems all have social **welfare** implications.

* In recent years the Australian Government's policy towards personal **welfare** services has been to treat them as worthy charitable ventures to be given some assistance by the Government.

* There has not been any recognition that personal **welfare** services, as well as income support, should be treated as a right or as social utilities.

* However, this does not mean that the Australian Government will take over the provision of personal **welfare** services.

* The actual **welfare** services may be provided by a range of organisations, including local government and State government authorities and the traditional nongovernment **welfare** agencies, or by new groups such as groups of **welfare** service users.

* The Australian Government has appointed a Social **Welfare** Commission to advise on the development of integrated social **welfare** programs, and the first report of this Commission, I repeat, has been tabled today, together with the first discussion paper on the Australian Assistance Plan.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission and the Australian Government have noted with interest the recent changes in personal **welfare** service systems in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States of America.

* The Australian Government has committed itself to the concept of forward planning - planning of our cities, our health policies, our education policies and our **welfare** policies.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has been allocated funds to carry out a program of careful evaluation of some demonstration programs before recommending on the final legislative form of the Assistance Plan.

* In this way it is hoped to produce some co-ordination of the **welfare** programs of State and Federal governments.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has appointed to its staff an officer widely experienced in community development programs in Canada and Africa.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission plans to use a number of techniques such as film and video tape to make the details of the various demonstration programs available to groups of interested citizens across the entire world.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission is making arrangements with a number of academic institutions to carry out evaluations of the demonstration projects which will be established in the initial phase of the Australian Assistance Plan.

* In addition, the Social **Welfare** Commission will arrange for special training programs for staff to work in the regional councils for social development, as well as training in community development techniques for other personnel.

* During the initial phase of the Australian Assistance Plan, the Social **Welfare** Commission will itself determine, after consultation with the various State government authorities, State councils of social service and other appropriate bodies, which areas of Australia will be used for demonstration projects.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission has indicated that the final program could cost in the order of $30m a year once established.

* The Social **Welfare** commission is hoping, with the support of the members of this Parliament and the ordinary citizens of Australia, to find some innovative solutions to meet social needs which will involve the community in the meeting of those needs.

* The 2 reports I have tabled in this Parliament today - the first annual report of the Australian Government Social **Welfare** Commission and Discussion Paper No.

* 1 on the Australian Assistance Plan prepared by that Commission - represent a major step forward in the development of social **welfare** services in this community.

* Indeed, reviewing the history of social **welfare** programs in this country, I believe it can be fairly said that to date nothing as important, nothing that can equal the progress which this represents, has occurred in this country before.

* We look forward to a fruitful response from the Australian community and from our fellow parliamentarians and this response will allow us to improve on the very valuable contribution that has already been made and will continue to be made by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* I present the following paper: 
First Report of the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission - Ministerial Statement, 30 August 1973.

* It reduces the national **welfare**.

* It reduces the national **welfare**.

* But the increased social **welfare** payments and other expanded forms of public assistance undertaken by the Whitlam Government are simply illusory money increases.

* The Minister for Housing and Construction pointed out in his second reading speech that the purpose of these 2 Bills is, firstly, to enable the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  to appropriate $3 10m for **welfare** housing in 1974-75 and, secondly, to make certain amendments to the 1973 Housing Agreement.

* Yet even now the Liberals still want to return to the days when **welfare** housing was accorded a low priority.

* If the Opposition had its way the States this year would receive $102m less for **welfare** housing than they will in fact receive.

* What has happened now, in fact, is that the Government feels, because of the calling of the early election, it has not been able to come to a decision on the recommendation of the so-called Bailey report- the report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in Health and **Welfare**- in which it is suggested that there be a much wider homeless persons assistance program incorporated in what is called a sheltered accommodation program and some re-organisation, with the help of the State governments.

* Until that investigation is concluded, I am afraid I can say nothing concrete, except that I hope that in the total conspectus of what we are trying to achieve in the field of social **welfare** this will be one of the areas where we will provide adequate responses to the clear needs in the community.

* It is very easy for a government to win electoral appeal by increasing education spending, by increasing health spending, by increasing social **welfare** spending or by increasing subsidies to a number of industries and concessions to many employment areas in the community.

* There is a need today more than ever before for people themselves to be their own initiators, for people themselves to strive to become independent, for people themselves to become less dependent on governments, but at the same time, there is a need today for governments to keep out of people's lives, except of course in those cases of extreme hardship where the society as a whole accepts a responsibility for **welfare**.

* the economic prosperity and **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* He rejects the concept of lower taxes and a growing private sector as being critical to economic growth and prosperity for all Australians, and particularly for the **welfare** recipients.

* In Perth earlier this year, when talking about lower taxes, he said: 
This Government's policies of restraint have not meant that we have shown no regard for those **welfare** recipients in needy circumstances, although that seems to have come through in many speeches by members of the Opposition in this debate.

* I believe that a sound economy is essential for a sound **welfare** policy.

* I am yet to hear anyone argue that **welfare** recipients can benefit from a country which is confronted with massive economic difficulties.

* The **welfare** record of this Government has been sound during a very difficult time for economic management.

* There have been other **welfare** initiatives of significance.

* At the same time, we are concerned with furthering the **welfare** of the needy in our society.

* I also suggest to the honourable member for Sturt that if he reads clause 14- stronger, as it is, than the old section 43- together with clause 12 of the present Bill, which refers to a child of a marriage who is under 18 years of age, he will see that the Bill enables the court, of its own motion or at the request of either party, to order that the parents attend a conference with a **welfare** officer to discuss the **welfare** of their child and try to resolve any differences between them concerning the matter.

* One can say: There is a **welfare** officer, a psychologist and a child **welfare** expert down the corridor.

* The only alternative would be to savagely prune other government expenditure, for example, education, social **welfare**, defence or development 
Our second problem revolves around unemployment, particularly among young people.

* Have their personnel officers gone out and negotiated with the employment officers and social **welfare** officers in the area in an endeavour to help the young people?

* It reflects the decrease in tax receipts and the increase in **welfare** payments arising out of a recession.

* I commend the honourable member for Grey for his diligence and close attention to the **welfare** of his constituency.

* I turn from **welfare** housing and refer to the private housing sector.

* 1 ) I am advised that the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health is working towards presenting its first report before the end of the year.

* The system of social services, **welfare** and law enforcement aggravate rather than alleviate the problem of chronic unemployment.

* Indeed we want to go much further and introduce a new concept of social security payments and social **welfare** services.

* What has been the Government's performance in the field of social **welfare**?

* That is the net sum total of its performances in social **welfare**.

* It seems to have realised that over-using the money pump or the printing presses will not cure **welfare** problems.

* Cultural and General **Welfare** Services 
Perhaps 1 might sum up briefly by saying that there will be people who may feel that the Government is not expending taxpayers' funds to the best advantage.

* To do more would flood markets and bring ruin to all in the industry; to do less would not take into account the **welfare** of apple producers who are disadvantaged by high wages, high costs and other matters which they believe - and I think rightly so - have come about through no fault of their own.

* Because of the increasing costs to the Labor Government of that time, the 1975 Budget of that Government froze the number of **welfare** officers who could be employed under this Act.

* At that time there were 112 **welfare** officers employed around Australia.

* I understand that there are 67 outstanding applications for additional **welfare** officers.

* By going back to a $ 1 for a $ 1 basis, which applied prior to 1973, we have done one other thing, that is, we have lifted the freeze on the employment of **welfare** officers under this Act.

* That means that we have opened up the possibility for all these organisations with outstanding applications, and possibly some others as well, to employ **welfare** and home care officers.

* When the Opposition was in government it froze the employment of **welfare** officers.

* I challenge its members to say which they believe is more equitable: To continue the freeze on a $2 for $ 1 basis with, as the honourable member for Prospect made the point, the 1 12 **welfare** officers already employed being placed perhaps in the more fortunate middle class type local government areas and not in any of the other 67 areas to be serviced, or to give everybody who is prepared to do something in the provision of these **welfare** services and who believes that they are necessary the chance to take advantage of the scheme.

* The people of this nation have to awaken because we are in danger of slipping into a most undesirable **welfare** state situation.

* We must not have the creation of a huge **welfare** state.

* In the area of social **welfare** one section stands out as being in dire need of immediate assistance.

* The first was education, the second was social **welfare** and the third was health.

* Further there are the areas of social **welfare**, works, the defence Services and so on.

* In the past this responsibility has fallen within the provision of the States and their child **welfare** departments.

* I do not believe, of course, in the **welfare** state as such.

* The **welfare** state has - 
A final point that has to be made is upon the question of legal costs, expensive litigation and the position of the poor in relation to legal services.

* No one can argue that those with a need for legal advice, or with rights to be asserted or defended, should not have access to able lawyers and to the courts but the means of providing, within the **welfare** state, a legal social service is a matter of some debate.

* In both these fields, one cannot but be concerned at those directions which are rather depressing in their familiarity and rather outrageous in their neglect of the **welfare** of the 
Caring for refugees from brutality and murder around the world is a major problem for all free nations.

* These facts effectively counter the unfair criticism from some people whose proper concern for the **welfare** of refugees has led them to the wrong conclusion that Australia is not doing enough.

* In the main this is being provided by the Federal Department of Social Security, backed up by valuable assistance from State and local governments and **welfare** organisations and service clubs.

* A number of voluntary organisations and ethnic groups in Sydney and Melbourne have been approached to establish a **welfare** rights service on a pilot basis for a period of twelve months.

* The organisations concerned have been asked to submit proposals for **welfare** rights services appropriate to the needs of the people they serve.

* A further nine pilot **welfare** rights services will be introduced when the relevant organisations have completed the preliminary planning.

* **Welfare** rights officers will be employed by relevant organisations to assist particular groups of people to be better informed about social **welfare** and related services and to help those requiring help to exercise their rights to such services.

* Training will be determined according to the particular needs of each **welfare** rights worker.

* Professor Zubrzycki, Head of the Department of Sociology at the Australian National University, who is the  chairman  of the Committee; Miss Green,  Chairman  of the Australian Council of Social Service;  Mr Hawke, President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions;  Sir Arthur  Lee,  President  of the Returned Services League,  Mr Lippmann, Chairman  of the Migrant **Welfare** Committee of the Australian Council of Social Service; Air Marshal  Sir John  McCauley,  President  of the Good Neighbour Council of New South Wales;  Mr McRae, President  of the National Youth Council;  Mr Nicholas,  Executive Officer of the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council;  Mrs Reader,  representing the National Council of Women; and  Dr Alan  Richardson, Reader in Psychology at the University of Western Australia.

* These jobs involve telephone exchanges, defence projects, many great projects that concern public **welfare**.

* Bauxite was discovered on their property and, without much regard at all for their **welfare**, agreements were made with a mining company to mine it. 
)

* In what field of **welfare** are they qualified or interested.

* Has his attention been drawn to the work of the Malta Star of the Sea **Welfare** and Cultural Centre in St. Albans, Victoria.

* If so, will he give sympathetic consideration to the request of that organisation to provide a **welfare** worker for the St. Albans area.

* All sections of the community have a role to play in this processunions, employees, employers, both large and small, industry groups, consumers, representatives of **welfare** and social organisations, academics, the Public Service and the Government.

* In so doing, it introduced such a degree of capriciousness and incompetence into government policy making and administration as to destroy confidence throughout the entire community and to destroy the ability of the private sector- large and small business alike- to produce the real resources needed if Labor's social **welfare** and other programs were ever to be fulfilled.

* It is not only **welfare** and social services to which this situation applies.

* That this House, mindful of the principles and philosophy of the Liberal Party to assist those in need, is anxious to protect the family and single people in the lower income groups from the worry of bills and charges for medical or hospital treatment due to illness or an accident, and therefore requests the Minister for Health to advise the medical profession that a confidential letter from a local justice of the peace, minister of religion, industrial chaplain or an officer of the Citizens Advice Bureau, Social Security or **Welfare** or Probation, in relation to any patient, shall entitle that medical practitioner to accept the patient as 'disadvantaged' and refer any charges to the Commonwealth for payment.

* In my opinion, it is not good enough in a wealthy country such as ours to have a gold-plated standard of services, whether they be in health, education, **welfare** or any other field - urban environment is probably the outstanding example - in a national capital such as Canberra and then to find in the capital cities far greater aggregations of the nation's population living in slums or resorting to slum standards of facilities such as our public health services.

* It is a matter which does concern their general **welfare**.

* 1 ) The North West one stop **Welfare** Centre at Coburg, Victoria, is continuing as a co-ordinated **welfare** delivery outlet.

* The recent review of the operation of the Centre indicated that the Centre as it had been organised was effective in co-ordinating the **welfare** delivery efforts of various government and non-government organisations.

* and (4) The question of establishment of further one stop **welfare** centres will be considered in the light of particular circumstances as they arise.

* Does his Department control a fund for **welfare** purposes; if so, what is the limit of the fund.

* How does his Department determine the stage at which a person seeking **welfare** assistance should not seek it as an immigrant but should seek it as a non-immigrant and, in consequence, should direct his inquiries to the Department of the Interior.

* Does his Department publicise the fact that it offers a **welfare** service to immigrants in Canberra; if so, what form does that publicity take.

* It effects a substantial transfer of payments from the productive sector of the economy to **welfare**, social services, health and education.

* The competition can be between government and private expenditure, between wages and profits, between **welfare** and productive resources or maybe between governments themselves.

* The Government is dedicated to increased **welfare**, but it does not realise that increased **welfare** and better provision for the disadvantaged can come only from increased productive resources.

* It is not possible merely to transfer resources from the productive sector to **welfare** without destroying our capacity to meet national aspirations for the disadvantaged in the areas where compassion must be shown.

* I firmly believe that growth is essential to quality of life in Australia, quality in the environment, quality in **welfare** services and quality in compassion for those who need assistance and those who need help.

* Growth in fact results from policies that improve **welfare** because if we want a better life we need greater resources in order to provide for that better life.

* The Minister and I attended a seminar on housing last year in Adelaide and a strong view was expressed at that time that perhaps the way to approach problems in the area of housing, particularly in the area of **welfare** housing, is by making subsidies available to the individual tenant or home buyer rather than to the house.

* Comparatively, the western suburbs are deprived in that they lack a great number of community services such as roads, libraries, child care centres, recreational centres and social **welfare** services.

* As the responsibilities for **welfare** work fall more heavily on the shoulders of local government, so the equity of rate collection becomes more distorted.

* The benefit principle of taxation is more appropriate for most local government services but is most inequitable for social **welfare** services which should be provided from community revenue.

* But the grants recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission would he p to equalise the facilities available in richer and poorer, or highly or sparsely populated, local government areas and would provide a financial topping up for the expanding ro'e of local government into the non-traditional social **welfare** sphere.

* This objective could well be realised as many local councils already co-operate on a regional basis for many services such as regional libraries, social **welfare** and fire protection.

* -I suggest first of all that the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  read the report on drugs by the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** in which it recommended the decriminalisation of marihuana.

* I would like to know, although 1 am not likely to be told and the House is not likely to be informed, why the Budget increases the proposed vote for this body by about 13 per cent, which is a greater percentage increase than was accorded to the social **welfare** sector of the community?

* In the Governor-General's Speech  His Excellency  said: ... the Government will place great emphasis on directing **welfare** assistance to those in real need.

* One would have thought that by now some of the lessons of the old fashioned, outmoded **welfare** state paternalism would have got through to the Opposition, especially as the Wilson Labour Government has clearly learnt this lesson and is carrying out a very stringent program of across-the-board cuts.

* It is believed by the Government that voluntary **welfare** organisations are a critically important part of the Australian **welfare** system.

* Here is the clearest and most far-reaching kind of concept which has so far been ignored by the Opposition, the transferability of staff between the government and the non-government sector, especially in the social **welfare** area.

* The Senate Select Committee on Health and **Welfare** which looked at the subject of handicapped people indicated that there was a great need for clear statistical data on the numbers and needs of handicapped people.

* the industrial action has had, is having, or is likely to have, a substantial adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of the community or of a part of the community, the Full Bench shall make a declaration that it is so satisfied and cause the declaration to be recorded in writing.

* A declaration is made by the Commission to say that the health, **welfare** or safety is affected.

* As the honourable member for Hindmarsh  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said yesterday: 'Forget about the health and safety, just concentrate on **welfare**'.

* It seems to me, however, that he has relegated this problem of inflation, which is growing in this country, to that of a second class problem because he has made a number of statements, the gist of which is that the Government will not let inflation prevent it from getting on with the **welfare** programs that it thinks are important.

* Second, local government is playing an increasing role in the provision of social **welfare**, recreational and cultural amenities.

* If local government is to provide an increasing measure of our community's physical amenities and **welfare** services, as opposed to the more traditional forms of basic economic assistance clearly it requires greater recourse to the nation's general revenue resources.

* Whilst he was in Australia his 4 children were under the care of the Child **Welfare** Department.

* a Special Provision of Capital and Recurrent Financial Assist?ance for Community **Welfare** Agencies experiencing serious financial difficulties.

* An amount of $2m has been set aside to provide 'emergency' assistance to voluntary **welfare** agencies.

* My Department has notified each of its State Head" quarters and requested them to advise details of community **welfare** agencies in their State which come within the category of agency to be assisted under this program.

* Financial assistance under the provisions of this fund is an interim measure only and in the longer term, it is envisaged that the Australian Assistance Plan will provide a source of financial assistance for community **welfare** agencies.

* The major purpose of the fund is to provide financial assistance to worthwhile existing **welfare** community agencies in serious financial need.

* In taking a decision, the union executive must take into account the business situation of the firm concerned, the general economic situation, and the public's  **welfare**.

* The competing demands of social **welfare**, health, education, housing come readily to mind.

* That is almost 40 per cent of the total **welfare** budget.

* The **welfare** budget has taken almost 40c in the dollar of total Government expenditure.

* Over the last 10 years in Australia expenditure on social security and **welfare** has increased almost sevenfold from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, which was the last year of the Labor Government, to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80.

* Even if adjustments are made for expenditure on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, the increased eligibility nevertheless means that expenditure on social security and **welfare** as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76, Labor's last Budget, to 21 per cent in the current Budget.

* That was the reaction yesterday of South Australia's Community **Welfare** Minister,  Mr Payne,  to the announcement by the Social Security Minister,  Senator Guilfoyle,  that the Federal Government would cease to provide funds for the Australian Assistance Plan after 12 months from 1 July.

* [Under AAP, introduced by the previous Labor Government, the Commonwealth provided financial help for community **welfare** programs through the Regional Councils in which there was considerable local community participation.]

* It is tremendously significant to improve the flexibility, the reduction in overlap or duplication and the position generally in a whole range of health and **welfare** services of a federalist nature, as I believe some of these recommendations are, which may be implemented by the Government.

* There are no longitudinal studies at all that I know of that have been conducted in Australia to determine the **welfare** and the progress of the exnuptial child.

* We must accept totally the principle that the long-term **welfare** of the child should be the first and paramount consideration.

* That bureau will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers concerned with specific aspects of the **welfare** of children.

* Rather than criticise some of the aspects of this Government's alternative initiatives to the Social **Welfare** Commission, he should remember that, after all, it was the Labor Government that abolished the Commission.

* It was stated by the Labor Government when the Commission was established that it was to be a bold step in policy formulation, evaluation and accountability of social **welfare** programs.

* I want to quote another reason that was given by the Social **Welfare** Commission in its final report.

* The report states: 
In relation to the coordination and evaluation functions of the Commission, it was not kept informed of policy program initiatives with social **welfare** implications prior to government decisions; it was never given the power to enforce co-ordination nor was it given an automatic right of access to Cabinet submissions on policy proposals affecting social policy, thus placing the Commission's independent review role at serious risk.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission's criticisms of those grandiose proposals, to my way of thinking, brought about its abrupt and untimely end.

* This Government, to its credit, has accepted the need for evaluation and criticism of social **welfare** programs.

* The first step has been to establish a social **welfare** research unit at the University of New South Wales.

* Secondly, the Government is to establish national consultative groups on social **welfare** so that people with special interest at the consumer level or in the private sector generally have an ability to get through to the Minister and senior officials their opinions, views and criticisms.

* I mention ACRODThe Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, ACOSS-The Australian Council of Social Services and the Council for the Aging, all of which play an important role in policy formulation, evaluation and criticism of Government **welfare** programs.

* The Minister for Social Security has an obligation to the Australian community and to people interested in child **welfare** to spell out the answers to the questions.

* I hope that the Minister will be looking at a number of the practical effects of the legislation concerning the regulatory bodies that he has responsibility for in his portfolio and ensure that in the coming review of the trade practices legislation and any other reviews he might be conducting of other regulatory bodies, he will seek to ensure that they are acting consistently and in the best interests of efficiency and the **welfare** of the community.

* Let me return to the claim that it is the responsibility of members of this Parliament to spend the nation's revenue for the **welfare** of the nation.

* At what stage will he consider that there is a danger to the **welfare** of the nation?

* I claim that with 60,000 abortions a year there is already a danger to the **welfare** of the nation, and the taxpayer who believes that this is so should not be forced to pay for a practice that is destroying the **welfare** of our nation.

* Total State and Commonwealth expenditure has risen from $14,788,758 in 1977-78 to an estimated total of $20,744,000 in 1979-80, partly due to an expansion in expenditure on existing services, but additionally from the approval of 25 new home care services and 79 additional **welfare** officer positions.

* First of all, there are the ordinary **welfare** payments, which took up about $6,000m in the last Budget.

* Then there are the socially oriented enterprises, such as health, education and general **welfare**.

* Secondary teachers need to take greater responsibility in the corrective teaching of students and in their **welfare**.

* There is clearly room for administrative improvement in the delivering of services particularly in those areas where medical, educational and **welfare** services overlap.

* That the capital cost of **welfare** works is higher than the amounts which can be raised by community service organisations or local government authorities on a voluntary basis 
Of course we give these matters high priority- higher priority than any previous government ever gave any of the matters in the field of **welfare**.

* These things have suddenly come forward and the number of applications for assistance under this wide-ranging program of benefits in capital and recurrent services for not only the handicapped but also generally in **welfare** has led to a great upsurge in demand for assistance from the Australian Government.

* Without our interest in the field of **welfare** and in the field of need of the handicapped, the psychiatrically disabled or ill dominating our decision making the Minister for Health would not have undertaken a most extensive program of community psychiatric health centres.

* In its efforts to help such groups, the Labor Government's social **welfare** program, as revealed to us so far, is getting to a stage where it is placing impossible burdens on the traditional base of society, the single income family unit.

* It is important also that we take steps to ensure that the standard of a living of a 2 parent family where, the mother, iu the interests of her children, stays at home to care for them, compares favourably with such a family where the mother, due to the age of her children, feels that she can go out to work without prejudice to their **welfare**.

* This legislation recognises that we must reappraise many of our social **welfare** measures to ensure that inherent in them are no side effects which will put impossible burdens upon the normal families in the community.

* That we should direct attention to their **welfare** is urgent.

* Funding for the Melbourne resource centre which is run by the Australian-Greek **Welfare** Society has been provided only up to 3 1 January.

* The dispensing of **welfare** under this Government has been centralist.

* The Budget gives no indication of the stance or direction of social **welfare**.

* The Henderson Report again clearly documents the failure of the **welfare** policies of this Labor Government and clearly documents over pages and pages of its report the dissatisfaction of recipients of those policies.

* What was supposed to be an experiment and a pilot scheme they have made a permanent feature of **welfare** and possibly have set back this exciting area of human progress a number of years.

* I will have the honour in a few weeks to unveil the Opposition's social **welfare** policies.

* I believe that these policies will correct the mismanagement and the chaos into which this Government has turned this most important area of **welfare**.

* in reply-I thank honourable members for the contribution they made to the debate on this Social **Welfare** Commission (Repeal) Bill.

* I join honourable members in paying a tribute to the members of the Social **Welfare** Commission for the work they have already done.

* I believe there has been great value to the Parliament and to all those interested in social **welfare** from the research work and the organisational work that members of the Commission have done to date.

* The honourable member for Murray drew attention to the Government's decision to set up the research unit at the New South Wales University and also the Government's intention to establish consultative committees on social **welfare**.

* The Government is taking steps to fulfil its commitment to provide effective mechanisms for co-operation and interchange of ideas with interested groups in the social **welfare** field.

* A national consultative group on social **welfare** is being established to advise the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  on current issues in social **welfare** which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government.

* Membership of the group will consist of about 12 people including academics from relevant disciplines and other suitably qualified people active in the social **welfare** field, together with representatives of national **welfare** bodies and voluntary social **welfare** agencies.

* Of course in each State and Territory a small consultative committee on social **welfare** will be established to advise the Director-General of the Department of Social Security, through the appropriate State Director of the Department, on administration at the State level.

* With this objective achieved, the focus of the Act switched to the care and **welfare** of returned soldiers and the dependants of those who had died.

* That agreement has led, I believe, to the construction of about 280 000 homes, mainly for those in the area of **welfare** housing.

* The correct and proper responsibility for the States is in that area of **welfare** housing.

* It is an indictment of the previous Government that no national policy such as this was introduced earlier, but now those income groups above a **welfare** level but not in a high enough income bracket to be able to fend easily for themselves are offered a new opportunity to protect their homes.

* At the same time I wish to point out that the **welfare** of the nation cannot be maintained or extended without decentralisation.

* The budget for the study, sponsored by the Social **Welfare** 
A note was submitted by Professor Harris on 30 July 1973 but further research was deferred pending receipt of the 1971 census data.

* The 1971 data are now available and Professor Harris will shortly be submitting a report to the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* This report will contain- 
$14,400 has been paid to the James Cook University, Townsville, towards the cost of evaluating the role of local government throughout Australia in providing personal **welfare** services.

* Let us talk about the other advantages that will flow on and that will allow us, as a government, to be generous in relation to social **welfare**, as we have shown in the statement made by the Treasurer the other night, and that will help the Government to be most generous in relation to social **welfare** in the Budget next August and in subsequent years.

* We will gain additional revenue without having to overtax the people and the additional revenue that we gain will go out to the people in the form of increased social **welfare** payments, increased pensions, better health services and better education.

* I am very worried as to whether our **welfare** organisations are capable of handling the situation that we face.

* Both the church community and the **welfare** authorities in my area have said that there seems to be some misunderstanding as to who is responsible for action in this field.

* As long as this malaise occurs I believe that those who work in the **welfare** field will be at a disadvantage.

* Therefore, I would recommend to the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle),  the Government and the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  that upon the agenda of the forthcoming Premiers Conference there shall be placed without fail, at my request and that of this Parliament, an item requiring that a decision be taken as to who is in fact responsible for the support and funding of family **welfare** organisations in the States.

* Until this is done some people will say that the responsibility to support family **welfare** lies with the Federal Government.

* Sir, it  would not be inappropriate to conclude on this note: You, as the honourable member for Herbert, my honourable friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports  (Mr Crean),  the honourable and gallant member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer), Senator Devitt  and  Senator Maunsell-  3 honourable members from this place and 2 senators from the other placehave continued to show a very lively and a very compassionate interest in the **welfare** of exservicemen and in particular in securing the appropriate adjustments to the pension entitlements of ex-servicemen.

* This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision, as announced by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  on 2 February 1976, to abolish the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* In reviewing the activities of over 50 bodies of various kinds which had been conducting inquiries for the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister said: ... the Government has decided that the Social **Welfare** Commission and the Australian Housing Corporation, should be abolished while the functions of the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the road Safety and Standards Authority should be taken over by Government Departments.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission was established as an interim committee by the Labor Government in early 1 973, and the Social **Welfare** Commission Act received the royal assent in November of that year.

* In reaching its decision about the Social **Welfare** Commission the present Government was mindful of the fact that in June 1975 the then Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  had announced the Labor Government's intention to abolish the Commission.

* It is clear to the Government that the Social **Welfare** Commission is not required in a situation in which the Government, through its Ministers, will be determining priorities and maintaining direct communications on social **welfare** issues with State, local government and voluntary agencies and representatives of consumer groups.

* For example, there are many voluntary **welfare** organisations which are playing an important role in commenting on the formulation of social **welfare** policy.

* I will say a little more about our plans for improved consultation with the voluntary **welfare** sector in a few moments.

* The Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS), the Australian Council on the Ageing (ACOTA) and the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled (ACROD) Will receive- in 1976-77 grants totalling $0.45 m. In addition to the funding of these national bodies the Government supports a variety of other organisations in the **welfare** field.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission did not directly administer any Commonwealth **welfare** programs.

* The Government fully recognises the importance of social **welfare** in the life of the Australian community.

* Accordingly,' in order to ensure that adequate data is available for policy and planning purposes and that the best use is made of available resources, it is proposed to establish a social **welfare** research centre within the University of New South Wales.

* As mentioned earlier, the Government is taking steps to fulfil its commitment to provide effective mechanisms for co-operation and interchange of ideas with interested groups in the social **welfare** field.

* A national consultative group on social **welfare** is to be established to meet with the Minister for Social Security  (Senator Guilfoyle)  and her officers to discuss and advise on current issues in social **welfare** which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government.

* I envisage that the consultative group will have a membership of about 12 people comprising academics from relevant disciplines and other suitably qualified people active in the social **welfare** field, together with possibly one or two distinguished people with appropriate experience.

* It will include representatives of national **welfare** bodies and voluntary social **welfare** agencies, and will be serviced by the Department of Social Security.

* The basic **welfare** needs and problems of people are, in the main, similar throughout Australia but there are differences between States and, indeed, within the States.

* It is accordingly proposed to establish a social **welfare** consultative committee in each State and Territory.

* These committees will provide an input, in relation to the situation of people in each State, on problems or difficulties encountered in the administration of Commonwealth social security or social **welfare** programs at the State level.

* This will ensure that the very valuable contribution which these groups can make in relation to the special needs of women is available to the Government in formulating its social **welfare** policies.

* Further details of the consultative mechanisms proposed will be announced shortly but at this stage I can assure honourable members that our proposals will greatly strengthen our links with people and groups active in the **welfare** field.

* In addition to the continuing involvement of the Department of Social Security in income security issues, routine monitoring and evaluation of **welfare** programs are being developed and upgraded within the Social **Welfare** Division of the Department.

* The Government will continue to support independent inquiries which examine various aspects of the social **welfare** field.

* These inquiries, of which the Poverty Inquiry and the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry are examples, are particularly important in contributing to the development of social **welfare** policy.

* Honourable members will recall that in 1972 the Liberal-Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for child and social **welfare**, a family research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting family disruption and breakdown and changing family patterns in Australia.

* The Government has given undertakings that an examination would be made of activities of the Social **Welfare** Commission to ascertain the extent to which existing research projects and tasks would be continued.

* We have also agreed to the funding of 2 additional research projects and 4 fellowships in **welfare** studies.

* Two major areas into which a number of these projects have a substantial input are the development of services relating to families and social **welfare** manpower planning.

* These studies are complementary to the work of the commission's Family Services Committee on which is represented relevant departments at Federal and State levels, and the voluntary **welfare** sector.

* In relation to social **welfare** manpower planning, present statistics concerning the workforce in the **welfare** field are not satisfactory.

* The meeting of State Social **Welfare** Ministers held in Darwin on 2 1 May 1976 identified social **welfare** manpower planning as of vital importance and the Minister for Social Security has agreed to the Minister's request that the work initiated by the Social **Welfare** Commission in this area be continued, with more direct involvement of the States as they are major users of **welfare** manpower.

* Investigation will continue on the need for a national body to co-ordinate education in social **welfare** in Australia.

* At the Darwin conference of Ministers there was also strong support for standardisation of social **welfare** statistics.

* It was noted that there was great difficulty in arriving at priorities in social **welfare** or making any meaningful comparisons of **welfare** programs without having an adequate data base.

* The Minister for Social Security agreed that her department should undertake work immediately in this area seeking the co-operation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in setting up a working party, comprising representatives of relevant Commonwealth and State government departments, to examine questions of the standardisation and adequacy of social **welfare** statistics and the desirability of convening a national conference on these matters.

* The staff of the Social **Welfare** Commission now occupy Public Service Act positions which are included on the establishment of the Department of Social Security.

* Action will be taken to transfer commission staff to the unattached list of the department on repeal of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act.

* Some officers will be used in activities, such as administering research projects and fellowship awards, servicing the Family Services Committee and undertaking work in the area of social **welfare** manpower planning, responsibility for which will be absorbed by the department.

* The Government is mindful of the work which the Social **Welfare** Commission has undertaken but, for the reasons I have outlined, it is now considered opportune to consolidate advice on and research into social **welfare** matters within the appropriate departmental structures.

* He referred to the National **Welfare** Fund.

* The Auditor-General has to report each year on the operations of the Fund and in that report he said: 
The National **Welfare** Fund was established by the National **Welfare** Fund Act 1943 as a Trust Account for the purposes of section 62A of the Audit Act.

* Moneys standing to the credit of the Fund are applied under the National **Welfare** Fund Act in making such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to be made from the Fund in relation to health, social services and other **welfare** services.

* I would like to begin by asking the Minister Assisting the Treasurer, how closing the **Welfare** Fund off in the way suggested by the Government can be said to be serving the legal purposes of the Fund which are supposed to relate to health, social services and other **welfare** services.

* Broadly, the National **Welfare** Fund was built up in years when we collected more in taxes than we were able to find purposes to spend, so in one sense there now is a logic in doing the oppositewhen we have more expenditure than revenue we simply transfer.

* Maybe the greatest stimulus to consumer demand is more Government expenditure on **welfare** or the reduction of taxes.

* The **welfare** and integration of all its citizens.

* The Minister in his publication 'Immigration in the Seventies' quoted interesting figures on the migrant contribution to our economic **welfare** which should be studied by all people.

* Naturally the Opposition welcomes the Minister's desire to extend the range of migrant **welfare** services.

* In addition, the Opposition parties will be submitting positive and constructive proposals and we hope that those initiatives when put to the House will be seriously examined by the Minister in no sense on party political comment but in the context of what can best be done in this country for migrants and the extension of migrant **welfare** services.

* Perhaps the honourable gentleman does not really care about the **welfare** of British migrants.

* I am sure that this document of Professor Henderson's will be seminal in its influence and valuable in the contribution which it will make to **welfare** programs in Australia and to the relief of relative poverty in the nation.

* I present the following paper: 

 Mr CHIPP (Hotham) &lt;8.38)- The report which the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  has tabled is one for which all honourable members and all parties who are interested in social **welfare** have been waiting a long time.

* This Parliament spends hundreds of millions of dollars on all sorts of subsidies and **welfare** benefits.

* The West Heidelberg Community Health and **Welfare** Centre has been operating for some time in temporary premises.

* The other point I wish to make is the Government's failure to appreciate that these community health centres are not just treatment centres but are out-reaching organisations for the community that deal with many social **welfare** aspects as well.

* A Preston-Reservoir employment action group has been formed with the support of such organisations as the Intra-Church Council, a whole range of **welfare** organisations in the area, the unemployed themselves and local service clubs.

* I have asked  Senator Greenwood  and  Mr Chipp-  the shadow Minister for Social **Welfare**- to examine this matter as soon as possible.

* Children's problems encompass health, education, social **welfare**, recreation and cultural development.

* By contrast, the Children's Bureau under the LiberalCountry Party Government will provide a central source of input to a committee of Ministers who will retain the responsibility for the administration of programs within their specific portfolios- e.g., health, education and social **welfare**.

* An interdepartmental committee has been established to examine in detail the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in its Report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia.

* It is meant to demonstrate, admittedly in just a small way, that we are concerned and that we protest at the fact that in spite of all of the Government's hints, suggestions, promises and implications to the contrary, the Government has still produced no basic rethinking or restructuring of the Australian social **welfare** system.

* I have said in earlier debates that one of our greatest difficulties and frustrations in trying to get to grips with the social **welfare** system as it exists, and as it appears likely to develop, is the lack of definition and purpose.

* If nothing else it would at least clarify the social **welfare** differences between the Government and the Opposition and enable the public to judge our relative positions more sensibly than they are now able to do.

* I believe that it can be realistically said that each one of these concessions meets, or is designed to meet, some social **welfare** aim.

* But obviously social **welfare** aims which are met on this basis will be met haphazardly at best and perhaps not at all.

* If we were clear in our own minds as to what our social **welfare** aims are and confident enough that they were right, we might just pluck up enough courage to say to the electorate something like this- 'Look, we know how much you love a tax deduction.'

* Firstly, the taxation deduction system as a **welfare** instrument is regressive and totally haphazard.

* On that progression it would probably be modest to estimate that the cost to revenue this year will be approximately $l,400m, or $200m more than the cost of our entire social **welfare** programme because, as the Minister for Social Services indicated in his second reading speech, our entire programme for the forthcoming year is estimated to cost only $l,187m.

* In other words, we could double the funding of our social **welfare** programme by re-allocating the sums now foregone in what can roughly be regarded as social **welfare** tax concessions.

* There is the special role of accommodation in any consideration of a social **welfare** system.

* The most recent available document which surveys the types of social security schemes operating overseas is the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare**'s publication 'Social Security Programmes Throughout the World 1967', which gives the principal features of schemes inthe following countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Barbados, Belgium, Bolivia, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burma, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Ceylon, Chad, Chile, China (Nationalist), China (Communist), Colombia, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechoslovakia, Dahomey, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, Germany (Federal Republic), Germany (East), Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Korea (South), Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Luxembourg, Malagasy Republic, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Arab Republic, United Kingdom, United States of America, Upper Volta, Uruguay, Venezuela, Vietnam (South), Vietnam (North), Yugoslavia, Zambia.

* The complexity and diversity of the schemes operating in the countries surveyed by the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** are such that it is not possible to provide a concise and accurate summary, and hence the publication mentioned above is recommended to the honourable member.

* State Child **Welfare** Authorities have advised that adoptions of the Vietnamese children have been completed as follows: 
It is understood that in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia the processing by Child **Welfare** Authorities of adoption formalities for a number of other children has been completed and the applications are awaiting processing by the Courts.

* In practice, the Minister delegates the function of guardianship to the Chief **Welfare** Officer of the competent State or Territorial authority, who in turn arranges for the custody of the children with foster parents with the view to adoption.

* 1 ) Who are the members of the Central Coast Social and **Welfare** Co-ordination Council and what organisations do they represent.

* Child **Welfare** Ordinance 1958 
**Welfare** Department (State)-Mesdames M. Mabb, L. Dixon, L. Chris tensen, D. Brown, F. Gardner, M. Thomas, R. Mansell.

* **Welfare** (State)-Mesdames M. Mabb, L. Dixon, L. Christensen, D. Brown, F. Gardner, M. Thomas and R. Mansell- part-time Aboriginal Homemakers providing personal assistance and liaising with other agencies to assist Aboriginal families who are unable to cope due to social pressures, imprisonment of breadwinner and other related circumstances.

* **Welfare** (State)-Mesdames Mabb, Dixon, Christensen, Brown- Hobart.

* There is a position of Director, Projects and Services Branch in the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration, lt is a new position and has no permanent occupant at present.

* The former Director, **Welfare** Branch, who is now Assistant Administrator, **Welfare** Division, is carrying out the statutory responsibility of the Director of **Welfare** for the time being.

* Complete information is not available for personal consumption expenditure on health and no estimates are prepared for private sector expenditure on **welfare** services.

* Estimates of public authority current and capital expenditure on public health and **welfare** are published jn Australian National Accounts (tables 64 and 74 of the 1968-69 issue), and an estimate of private gross fixed capital expenditure on new buildings for health services is available from the building statistics collection.

* The estimates of expenditure on education and public health in the accompanying table may of course be compared with similar figures for other countries, and the honourable member is referred to the United Nations Yearbook of National Accounts Statistics', which shows for many countries, current expenditure oa education and health, and public authority current expenditure on **welfare**.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* He is remembered by the people of his electorate for his independence of spirit, his devotion to their **welfare** and the great kindliness and friendliness with which he performed his duties.

* Even the Government's own inquiry, which the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has used selectively to justify his apparent disregard for Aboriginal **welfare** has made comments on this matter.

* It points out that, since about 20 per cent of our community are currently 'migrants', a similar proportion of the Commonwealth's general expenditure on education, health, social security and **welfare** and other areas should be for the benefit of migrants.

* Honourable members will be aware of the current Commonwealth programs and services directed specifically to migrants, covering migrant education, migrant **welfare**, interpreting and translation and other programs and services.

* The Review found that the main areas of need -such as for fluency in English and for better communication and information- are common to virtually all areas such as health, **welfare**, education, employment and the law.

* They concluded that the ethnic communities themselves and the voluntary agencies can meet the **welfare** needs of migrants more effectively than government agencies.

* There will also be an increase in the numbers of ethnic **welfare** workers through an extension of the grant-in-aid scheme.

* We will introduce a special program to provide 'once only' grants of up to $5,000 to assist voluntary groups to introduce new approaches to **welfare** service delivery or to restructure existing **welfare** services.

* Similarly, the **welfare** and cultural activities of the nongovernment sector have grown considerably in recent years.

* It is not our responsibility but I would be prepared, as an individual, to suggest and be responsible for a cut right across the board- in expenditure on health, education, **welfare**, culture and urban and regional development.

* What is proposed in the Budget for social **welfare**, urban and regional development, culture and recreation are, in the main, worth while and they bring little criticism from me other than in the broad.

* It is from the free enterprise system that the Government obtains the tax revenue to pay for the very desirable social **welfare** programs that we all support.

* In May 1971 the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** recommended that: 
I would like to make one or two points.

* It is a contribution towards the **welfare** of certain people.

* The grave deficiency as I see it is that the provision of the Meals on Wheels service, like so many other social **welfare** benefits required in the community, is dependent on the response of charitable groups.

* Some areas of need will receive a benefit because the people in those areas are concerned about the **welfare** of others.

* If we intend to develop social **welfare** services, we should identify priorities.

* Are we concerned about the **welfare** of people?

* We are living in an age where human values are supposed to be predominant and clearly it is quite wrong to approach the provision of Meals on Wheels services or other community **welfare** services on this ad hoc basis.

* What is clearly needed is a regional organisation of social **welfare** services.

* There is a grave deficiency in our approach to social **welfare** services in the community if we always approach these things on an ad hoc basis.

* For all we know it might very well be that other forms of social **welfare** service rate  a  much higher priority than Meals on Wheels.

* I  make it only to indicate that we are wrong in plucking something out of the air as  a  social **welfare** service because we think This will be very good for votes at the next election.

* What we need in the Australian community is some sort of inquiry to establish what are our needs in social **welfare**.

* a joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social **welfare** needs of the Australian community'.

* It is regrettable that the Government saw fit a short time ago to vote against the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders in order to allow the setting up of a committee to inquire into social **welfare**.

* The fact that the Committee was abandoned by the present Government's predecessors is one of the most regrettable features of the social **welfare** system of this country because the Committee did commendable work.

* Other Labor speakers on this side of the House have ably supported the honourable member for Oxley in presenting to the Australian people the case for a real social **welfare** programme and not the half baked, patched up propositions brought forward by the Government.

* I thought that all of these attributes fitted him to take his place in this Parliament as one of the great social **welfare** Ministers of our time.

* But the Minister has never been able to give effect in this Parliament to the expressions on social **welfare** which he so ably put to this Parliament in days gone by.

* With all the good intentions in the world he has proved conclusively to the Australian people and to pensioners in particular that the only way to get a social **welfare** programme, to which even he would subscribe, is to elect a Labor government in Australia.

* This Government places its greatest emphasis upon improvements in social **welfare** - under previous Liberal governments we have made great strides and under future Liberal governments will make even greater advances.

* That in itself is a great disappointment to him, to honourable members on this side of the House and to about one million people who thought that **welfare** benefits would be given as they require them.

* I believe that Australians should demand a drive to provide adequate social **welfare** benefits in line with the amendment moved by the Opposition in order that all should enjoy the prosperity and the wealth of Australia which at this time is shared by only the fortunate few.

* Consequently I condemn the broad concept of this Government's social **welfare** programme but not the few meagre dollars that it is handing out.

* When one looks at the record of what this Government has not done in the field of social **welfare** one sees that these handouts are made just tq one section of the community.

* This is the pattern of the development of Liberal policies on social **welfare**.

* Unless there is a government that has a concern for the creation of wealth, this country will not have the resources to meet the **welfare**, the compassionate and the developmental requirements which we all would want to see met.

* The Governor-General's Speech concentrated on what the Government proposes to do for **welfare**, the great cities and one decentralised city area, namely, Albury-Wodonga, lt mentioned nothing of what the Government proposes to do for general decentralisation throughout Australia in a sense that will achieve a real decentralisation of effort and initiative throughout Australia.

* Many of them are in the nature of **welfare** services.

* Those are historical kinds of assumptions, but in later times more  and  more has it been expected of the local authorities that they should go into the fields of health and social **welfare** services.

* For the year 1969 in Brunswick - these were figures given in a 1971 submission - out of a total expenditure by the Municipality of Brunswick of $1,420,000, an amount of 8165,000 - that is, close to 12 per cent of the available income of the Municipality of Brunswick - was spent on health and **welfare**.

* for example, infant **welfare** centres cost, the council in 1970 $18,276 wilh a government grant of $3,700, i.e.

* We on this side of the chamber believe that the **welfare** of all sections of the community is important.

* I believe that the new system is a real advance in our social **welfare** program, bearing in mind that it provides that the taxpayer no longer has the right to claim tax deductions for his dependent children.

* It may well be that there is one and I have missed it, but I still believe that this is one of the most critical areas of need in social **welfare**.

* It either comes from relatives, from some **welfare** organisation, or, as in the majority of instances, it comes from the pension of the patient's spouse.

* I would ask honourable gentlemen to take into account as well that there are any number of qualified people in the community who might not satisfy the test of having been a judge, or having been enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court of Australia or of a supreme court of a State or a Territory for not less than 5 years, who would be suitable through experience in **welfare** work, counselling work or social work.

* These include: the views of Regional Councils for Social Development the Report of the Social **Welfare** Commission on the AAP reports from independent evaluators appointed by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* comments by the Department of Social Security which has been responsible for the administration of the program over most of the pilot period comments from State Governments comments from Local Government Authorities and their Associations comments from voluntary **welfare** organisations and private citizens.

* It is planned to hold conferences with representatives of State Government Departments concerned with **welfare** matters and also with representatives of Local Government Associations in April 1976.

* Surely if a Government member were worth his salt, knowing what was proposed for pensioners in the Budget, and he had any sort of fortitude at all he would have stood his ground firmly, as the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth),  who is not in the chamber tonight, should have done on the matter of social **welfare**.

* I want to reply to the honourable member very specifically on one point, namely, that the Department of Immigration of the Australian Government is advised in the basic principle relating to this matter by the various State Departments of child **welfare**.

* The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the Treasurer  -(Mr Crean)  to make advances not exceeding $327.975m to the States for **welfare** housing during 1973-74 and the first 6 months of 1974-75, in accordance with the provisions of the 1973 Housing Agreement.

* 65m for **welfare** housing by the States for 1973-74, to be distributed among the States as shown in the first column of the schedule to the Bill.

* 65m to be advanced to the States in 1973-74 represents an increase of 26 per cent on the amount spent by the States on **welfare** housing in 1972-73.

* Because advances to a State for **welfare** housing cannot be made until the Agreement is ratified by the State Parliament, funds for this purpose are being provided by way of advances supplementary to the advances made for works purposes under the approved Loan Council program, until such time as the authorising legislation has become effective.

* The Bill, therefore, contains a provision authorising the Treasurer, with the concurrence of the State, to deem any such advances made against a State's loan program for 1973-74 to have been advances for **welfare** housing.

* Whilst it is very easy for the electorate to take the view that in matters of health, education and social **welfare**, for example, governments should be prepared to spend whatever is necessary, it is extraordinary that when we start to debate matters of defence, suddenly we hear the cry from the Opposition: 'What is the Government doing about it?

* Appropriations for defence represented 8.8 per cent of Government outlays, education represented 8.9 per cent, health represented 10.6 percent and social security and **welfare**- wait for it- 27.2 per cent.

* It has been increasing public expenditure on education, housing and social **welfare**.

* The Government had regard for all views, including those of the Northern Territory, during the framing of the Bills and the passing  of  the Acts relating to mining development, the establishment of townships, the protection of the environment and the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people in the Alligator Rivers Region.

* The **welfare** and integration, of all its citizens.

* With the success of the programme have come the problems of education, housing, employment, social **welfare** and a myriad of other problems.

* **Welfare**, health services and local government facilities present grave problems to the Australian people.

* The Industries Assistance Commission considered that the continuation of the stabilisation assistance arrangement for the wheat industry could not be justified on either efficiency or **welfare** grounds and recommended its discontinuation.

* What the modern socialist theory does is to make each one of us ever more dependent on public **welfare** handed out by the government.

* The Kelso plan is completely the reverse because it enables individuals to rely on private **welfare**; that is, **welfare** which they can provide for themselves during their working life, and after that in retirement, from the second income they may earn by sharing the ownership of the productive enterprises of Australia.

* The result of this economic philosophy of providing people with more income- an income beyond what they earn by way of wages- is less **welfare** required from government and therefore less **welfare** costs by government.

* He said: 
1 ) What has been the total expenditure on **welfare** in each financial year from 1965-77. 
)

* How is **welfare** defined in the answer to part ( 1 ).

* What proportion of total **welfare** expenditure was required for administration and delivery costs.

* But I make the criticism quite strongly that this is another example of a disjointed approach to the provision of social **welfare** service in Australia.

* Again I would appreciate a fuller analysis of the facts of the Commonwealth's extension of its commitment to social **welfare** services where there is already a State commitment.

* But as far as  1  can see the situation, when the Commonwealth increases its commitment to social **welfare** services for which the States have already accepted a commitment the tendency is for the States to withdraw commensurately.

* Indeed, 1 propose in a few minutes to suggest that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service as it operates anyway ought to be phased out in favour of an expansion of community **welfare** services.

* In Ontario, Canada, I had the opportunity of discussing with people involved in social **welfare** services their approach to this sort of assistance for people who have received injuries and have to go back into the work force.

* The Labor Party's proposal is to set up, as I have mentioned many times before, regional departments of social **welfare** harnessing the co-operative support of the State governments, local authorities and voluntary agencies.

* We have to ensure - and it is a public responsibility for the regionalised departments of social **welfare** - that the staff serving these sheltered workshops are adequately trained and that where they should be professional people they are in fact professional people.

* Well meaning people can do a good job in social **welfare**, but in those areas where they have some particular ability to serve the people.

* What the Labor Party does is to spurn the piecemeal blight which affects Government thinking in **welfare** services.

* 1 ) The Mackay Council of Social **Welfare** is presently working towards the formation of a Regional Council for Social Development and at present the names of the members are not listed.

* Organisations represented are as follows: Apex Club of Mackay and West Mackay, Australian Red Cross, Birthright, Blue Nursing Service, Catholic 
Mackay Council of Social **Welfare** was approved to receive administration grants only in the pilot period of the Australian Assistance Plan of $17,410 in 1973-74 and up to $40,000 in 1974-75.

* If I remember correctly, the  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that great spokesman on Labor Party matters, quoted defence matters as number 7 on the list of matters which the Labor Party considered as important for the **welfare** of Australia.

* The honourable member failed to say, of course, that the Minister will intervene only when matters such as the safety, the health and the **welfare** of the community are involved.

* Would the honourable member and the Labor Party have us say that the Government should not be concerned about the safety, the health or the **welfare** of the community?

* Would they say that the **welfare** of the community would not be affected?

* It appears to me that the Labor Party is not concerned with the health, the safety or the **welfare** of the community because it would deny the Minister an opportunity to act for the Australian people.

* Honourable members opposite are saying that the Government of Australia is not concerned about **welfare**, safety or health.

* They are saying: 'You allow us to have safety and **welfare**; you allow us to earn our money; you allow us to attend to the wellbeing of our families. '

* After all in our capitalist society- it is a system which has proved quite conclusively when one looks around the world that it is the best system for all people- it is tremendously important to keep money within the system so that the producers and the service industries, the productive people, can have that money for investment so that the **welfare** of our people can always be on the increase.

* As I said, those enterprises after all ensure the **welfare** not only of the people in the work force but also of the underprivileged and of all those other people who are referred to in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gellibrand.

* In the light of the results of the elections held in 1975 and 1977 I wonder whether the Australian people want ever-increasing handouts or socalled middle class **welfare**?

* Or should we not be looking more to a sensible **welfare** policy that looks after disadvantaged people or, as referred to in the amendment, the underprivileged; so that we tax the rich to look after those people but not to look after themselves?

* I will quote from an article in the magazine  Fortune  dated 23 October 1978: 
Advances by the Australian Government for the States' **welfare** housing programs in 1975-76 will not be less than in the previous financial year .

* The initial problems began when the Prime .Minister, at the Premiers' Conference on 19 June 1975 broke with past practice and declined to disclose the amount of **welfare** housing funds being made available to the States, indicating at that time that the details of fund allocations would be announced 'in the Budget context'.

* Equally I have no doubt that he would like to be able to get more funds for **welfare** housing but he has some pretty tough nuts to crack in the Cabinet.

* 1 should also say that, in the light of development in the industry as a whole as the year unfolds, including the availability of resources for housing construction and the ability of the States to put further funds to productive use in **welfare** housing, we stand ready to consult further with the States on the provision of additional advances.

* Because the Commonwealth Government supported the proposition that we should pull all stops out and spend to the limit of our ability, we are now geared through the Housing Commission to expend Slum a month on **welfare** housing .

* But the position is that the State of Victoria now has $ 1 2m left for **welfare** housing and at the rate of $ 10m the State is not going to be able to keep going for very long.

* That is fine; that is the State's priority, but if it had wanted to put those moneys into **welfare** housing it could have done so.

* We would have no quarrel with that.- But the State made a judgment to abolish State death duties instead, and therefore it placed that particular policy item higher than **welfare** housing.

* Increases in overall national **welfare**, however desirable, cannot proceed at a pace beyond the economy's capacity to sustain them.

* Secondly, they have said that the Government should spend more money on health, **welfare**, education or other things.

* Increasingly, he and his family depend on local government to provide a whole new range of basic services in health, **welfare**, sport, culture and recreation.

* This was the time to start looking after the true **welfare** of the migrants already here - the people who suffer most from unemployment, most from the pressure in the state and parish schools, most from exorbitant land and housing costs, most from the decline of the quality of our cities.

* A broader look at social **welfare** activities quickly reveals that the role of voluntary organisations was being downgraded very noticeably at the time of this Government's return to office.

* I was pleased to see such a strong mention in the Governor-General's Speech supporting the role and function of voluntary **welfare** organisations in the community and the strong assertion to continue financial assistance in this area as well as 'placing Public Service resources at their disposal through improving opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector'.

* I trust that the Government will view the Surf Life Saving Association not merely as an activity for the **welfare** of its members but as a self-helping voluntary **welfare** organisation totally deserving of this Government's support.

* We on this side of the House are concerned with the **welfare** of all Australians and I remind honourable members opposite that it was a LiberalCountry Party Government which instituted the Inquiry into Poverty.

* It has been LiberalCountry Party governments which have moved into all new areas of social **welfare** and concern and I am confident that in the years ahead it will still be the Liberal and National Country Parties, with their concern for the individual Australian and for his or her **welfare**, which will lead-and here is the great difference between our parties and the Opposition parties- in conjunction with community organisations to achieve the most effective **welfare** and advantage for' all Australians.

* I suppose the most crying need in my.electorate in social terms and in terms of public debate concerns the child **welfare** scheme, and I compliment some of the actions taken by the previous Labor Government in this regard.

* However, the people of Australia should be constantly reminded that even after 3 years of Labor Government and the criticisms we have heard about child **welfare** and its implementation, we are still operating under a Liberal Government's legislation.

* It would be an interesting exercise if honourable members went through all our social **welfare** programs to see to what extent we are operating under legislation instituted by the Liberal-Country Party Government parties.

* As has been said, you are bringing great dignity to that office and I am certain that the **welfare** of Parliament itself will be enhanced by your occupation of that most important chair.

* 2, 1978, that the Social Development Branch of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has consistently refused to provide residual **welfare** services on reserves as distinct from services at Darwin, Katherine, Gove, Alangula, Tennant Creek or Alice Springs; if so, is there any substance in the allegation.

* So, the cost of the schemes that the Labor Party wanted to introduce in 1969 - its national health scheme, its **welfare** proposals, its education policies and its national development policies - can be met because the money is available.

* So when the Government say that it cannot increase pensions by a few dollars a week or talks about improving its miserable' **welfare** programmes it should be remembered that it has been socking away $500m a year into this fund which is to meet only a contingent liability, a liability which will not arise.

* For years this Government has talked about what it has done with social **welfare** programmes.

* The whole prosperity and **welfare** of Australians depend upon a continuing strong export performance.

* I think that future restraint should be exercised more heavily on transfer payments, by adhering to the principle that resources in the **welfare** area should be more heavily concentrated on areas of need.

* Tax cuts, justifiable on equity and **welfare** grounds, will not have their desired expansionary impact on the economy unless two things happen.

* I would like to spend my remaining time discussing some of the **welfare** aspects of this Budget.

* In the area of **welfare** this Government has a fine record.

* Firstly, its objective of reducing the inflation rate has very substantial advantageous **welfare** implications for pensioners and all elderly, retired people.

* There are other more direct ways in which this Government has protected disadvantaged groups through its **welfare** programs.

* There are two areas in the **welfare** field which concern me particularly and on which I urge the Government to take action.

* I simply say that this is a major anomaly in our **welfare** system.

* The other **welfare** matter relates to the problems experienced by some pensioners who are in receipt of a part pension and some additional income, whether it is derived from superannuation or from some other source, and who are entitled to receive certain fringe benefits.

* At the moment, because of this problem many pensioners are having their **welfare** determined less by changes in their basic income levels and more by the absence of change in their entitlement to fringe benefits.

* The Budget introduced by the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  on 17 September was a reaffirmation of this Government's determination to continue its program of social reform, that is, to maintain the momentum and the thrust in the fields of education and social **welfare** in particular.

* To return to matters of substance, I want to relate most of my comments to the social **welfare** commitment in the Budget.

* In the social security and **welfare** field the Government has responded to the needs and the very legitimate aspirations of all pensioners.

* The decision by the Government to recognise the plight of parents with handicapped children is one of the most pleasing features of the social **welfare** document.

* I conclude with the same sentiment with which I began: The Budget is a document that maintains the thrust and momentum in the social **welfare** and educational fields.

* He suggested that the proposed agency would ensure that greater attention would be given to the way in which our aid program would be administered in the countries to which it was given - that it would be examined to make sure that the effect of our aid was to promote the **welfare** of the people of those countries.

* This is how the total expenditure was broken up:  Major drainage  works, $1,477,220; kerbing, guttering and minor drainage and foot paving, $1,015,510; water reticulation, $1,124,486; council parks, gardens, reserves and public amenities, $656,327; electricity, $39,021; Gosford hospital and ancillary work, $575,869; **welfare** projects, $454,794; servicing the RED scheme, $88,869; miscellaneous, $89,600; and sporting and recreational facilities, $2, 1 54,7 1 4.

* They include an equitable distribution of the nation's wealth, an optimum rate of growth, a healthy balance of payments and a concern with the quality of life or community **welfare**.

* The alternative Budget proposals of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  show that he has a concern neither for accuracy nor for **welfare**.

* Apart from **welfare** considerations we must ask which measures- the Government's Budget or the Opposition's proposals- are more likely to stimulate the economy.

* The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch),  who has just spoken, talks of poverty and the Henderson inquiry yet will not admit that the roots of that poverty he in the 23 years of Liberal neglect of **welfare**.

* One could go on with many examples, but the people would prefer the Opposition to come clean and to own up to where it would make the cuts in government spending which provides the community **welfare**.

* Government spending on hospitals, schools and roads, government purchases and **welfare** payments ends up in the private sector.

* The Treasurer himself, who did not have the good grace to come into the chamber and listen to his colleague this morning, has had to admit that he does not believe in the typical type of Budget, that he does not believe in a Budget setting out the program for the future and in giving the guidelines and the limits within which business, social **welfare** and other kinds of operations can work in the fiscal year.

* He did say- I admit this- that there would be an across the board cut but he went on to say as well- I believe that this must be stated as a matter of accuracy and truth- that priority would be given in the fields of education, social **welfare** and health.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some 9 million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* I understand that last year 2004 homes were completed under the terms of the homes savings **welfare** legislation.

* Side by side with **welfare** housing, let us not forget about the **welfare** housing needs of our pensioners, the grand old people who have been the pathfinders and the trail blazers of yesteryear.

* Quite obviously, any refinement of the **welfare** housing system under the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill 1976 is to be applauded.

* We must be cognisant of the fact that at the last census for which figures are available, that is 1971, well over 41 000 families were living more or less permanently in tents, huts caravans and house boats, and that at present, according to the latest statistics, some 1 10 000 families in Australia are waiting for **welfare** housing.

* What responsibilities do the States have in the area of **welfare** housing?

* Recently the States requested the Commonwealth Government to make available to them $75m more for **welfare** housing.

* It is easy to offer criticism, but, as the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development quite rightly stated in his second reading speech on this Bill, the States are able to make money available for **welfare** housing from their own funds.

* The States have the right to make money available for **welfare** housing out of their own funds.

* An analysis on a  per capita  basis of the funds made available for **welfare** housing under this Bill will indicate that Queensland obtained only $18 per head against the Australian average of $28 per head.

* They covered rent, furnishing and equipment, with subsidies for **welfare** staff members and a subsidised meal allowance.

* As I said before, only a small amount of money has been set aside for expenditure in this area of social **welfare**.

* They have to depend for their **welfare** on charity from organisations such as the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Salvation Army, the Uniting Church in Australia and the Brotherhood of St Laurence.

* This sort of **welfare** assistance should be above politics, if possible.

* The amendment to section 10 of the Act reduces the amount of money payable to the States for the salary of a **welfare** officer of a senior citizens centre from two-thirds to one-half.

* **Welfare** officers employed by local government under these grants play an important role in preventive medicine by assisting the elderly to remain socially active and in touch with community health facilities.

* No new grants have been given in the time of the Fraser Government and the present cuts mean that local government bodies will have to find several hundred thousand dollars, sack their **welfare** officers or put up their rates.

* Honourable members may have read in the last couple of weeks an article in the Sydney  Sun  headed 'Pensioners Hit', which reads: 
The aim of a social **welfare** system is to produce, through a range of social policies, a social environment in which every individual has the opportunity to develop his unique potential, and in which various supports are offered to those individuals who, through some inherited or acquired disadvantage or handicap, need special assistance.

* The next point is that the Commission is advocating a new look at social **welfare** problems.

* No longer does the Government propose to look at social **welfare** only in the context of dispensing charity to somebody who happens to be disadvantaged.

* They then will not participate in any social **welfare** programs and the whole thing is self defeating.

* It is refreshing for a Labor Government and a Labor Minister to be saying that it is not the intention of the Government to take over all social **welfare** activities and that they want to encourage voluntary community involvement, which, if I can be excused for having a small tilt of my own.

* I make a plea to the Minister and through him to the Commission that in involving voluntary organisations, there is an enormous number of amateurs who could be involved in assisting in social **welfare** problems.

* I believe that in most activities of social **welfare** there are great opportunities for the recruitment of such people.

* Therefore, the Commission will give detailed attention to the development in other areas of social policy of an appreciation of the **welfare** implications of such matters as incomes policy, the taxation system, recreation, housing and immigration policy, urban development .

* We also believe, as the Commission believes, that it is desirable in the long term to establish a **welfare** system in which the services are planned and provided at the most decentralised level consistent with efficient administration.

* I can think of nothing worse than, in a certain region of a State the Commission not going into the matter thoroughly enough to determine whether the administration in the area is competent to administer this terribly complex and highly sensitive area of social **welfare**, and the administration in that region collapsing.

* This would be bad for government, bad for social **welfare** and, I am sure, is a responsibility which neither the Minister nor his Department wishes to undertake, that is, to have to organise and administer centrally every social **welfare** program in every region of the country.

* What makes it vital for this Commission to look at social **welfare** - this is why I find its whole philosophy, attitude and recommendations so refreshing and why I compliment the Minister for embracing them - is that we do live in a period of change.

* The Minister referred to the social costs of social **welfare**.

* Certain types of desirable **welfare** assistance which should be given to physically, culturally and/or socially handicapped persons in this modern, affluent society are not available here and would be less effective if recipients were to continue to enlarge families which they admit are now too large for them to care for.

* Let me assure the House that there are husbands who, on their own admission, believe they are entitled to require their wives to do this; yet I have been accused of talking of compulsion when I have suggested certain procedures for the benefit of recipients of social **welfare**.

* However, my critics seem to be bent on twisting my intentions as if I would extend **welfare** as a kind of Nazi racial dictatorship.

* The only possible help will come from State **welfare** departments, which have limited emergency funds and which in some States they are unwilling to hand over.

* The Government has learned nothing from the 1977 four-week Latrobe Valley strike, which threw every **welfare** organisation into chaos from which they were finally rescued by a joint Commonwealth-State grant of $100,000.

* My electorate is a **welfare** electorate.

* This Government fails to realise that high percentages of **welfare** recipients and low income earners are poverty stricken.

* I might say that TAA has genuine concern for the **welfare** of the people who will be affected by the necessity to withdraw Twin Otter aircraft from the Channel and Gulf areas which currently absorb 3000 hours flying per annum, serve 45 ports of call (37 of which will be eliminated) and costs the Commonwealth in excess of $300,000 per annum in subsidy.

* Management, unions and government departments should use migrant self-help agencies and involve such ethnic **welfare** and community agencies in the development of safety and health initiatives on the job.

* The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:  (1), (2), (3) and (4) While no specific mention of the Social **Welfare** Committee was made in 1972, its principles are implicit in the Government's pre- 1972 election statements on the need for a total community approach to **welfare**.

* The creation of the Social **Welfare** Commission in 1 973 is one pan of the Government's program to achieve these aims.

* member's question about the role of the Social **Welfare** Commission and any changes planned for that role, I would refer him to Section 14 of the Social **Welfare** Commission Act, which states: 
to ascertain, and report to the Minister on, the social **welfare** needs of the community and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs; 
to make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement of a nationally integrated social **welfare** plan, including- 
recommendations of priorities in relation to social **welfare** programs; 
recommendations for the development of social **welfare** programs on a regional basis with localised administration; 
recommendations for participation in the implementation of social **welfare** programs by representatives of the persons or agencies to be assisted; 
recommendations for the co-ordination of the social **welfare** activities of organisations, including State, local government and voluntary organisations, involved in the provision of social **welfare**; 
recommendations for the adjustment, from time to time, of social **welfare** programs in the light of changing community circumstances and attitudes and the state of the economy; and 
recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social **welfare** programs and for promoting the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the community social **welfare** effort; 
to estimate, and report to the Minister on, the likely cost of proposed social **welfare** programs and to advise the Minister on the relative priorities to be given to the implementation of those programs; 
to keep social **welfare** programs under constant review and to re-assess and evaluate those programs in the light of experience; 
to propose to the Minister measures to give all organisations, including State, local government and voluntary organisations, concerned with social **welfare** access to available information and technical assistance; 
to consider, and report to the Minister on, measures designed to provide skilled staff for the successful implementation of social **welfare** programs; and 
such other functions in connection with social **welfare** programs as the Minister approves.

* If an industry docs that we will achieve all that tariff protection can achieve so far as the **welfare** of this country is concerned.

* Here I must pause and single out for special mention the Royal Australian Air Force aircrews and maintenance staff who kept their planes flying continuously; the RAAF medical teams who did not falter in their duties; the Navy disaster force which hurriedly assembled for duty, brought needed supplies and swung immediately into action bringing urgently needed assistance and undertaking unpleasant tasks often during times of supplementary volunteered duty; the Army which currently is undertaking a similar task as that of the Navy in the same spirit of commitment; the journalists who reported objectively the situation that Darwin faced; the churches which organised relief efforts through their own social **welfare** agencies; the people who organised funds for those financially wanting to help the people of Darwin; the personnel of Qantas Airways Ltd, Ansett Airlines of Australia, Trans-Australia Airlines, Connair Pty Ltd and SAATAS Pty Ltd, as well as members of the general aviation industry who collected together to make the great evacuation program a success; the men and women of the Royal Air Force, the United States Air Force and the Indonesian Air Force who contributed magnificently; the people down the track from Darwin who gave food and shelter to road evacuees; the personnel of the Commonwealth and 
I hope as I do this that the attention of the Government will focus itself on these objections.

* The Government, in certain quarters, will be aware of those objections and I would suggest respectfully to the Minister, who has the **welfare** of the Northen Territory at heart, that upon reflection the validity of the points made by the Opposition in this debate, as well as the objections put forward, should meet with Government acceptance and would make this a better Bill.

* In addition we believe that beef producers, like any other section of the community which has lost its means of livelihood, should be eligible for **welfare** payments, which even this Government denies them.

* But the present Government has not adopted this course of action and we must accept the continuing high growth of government spending at the expense of the real **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* It is making the job of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Bryant),  who is sitting at the table, far harder than it would otherwise be because this program endeavoured to paint a picture and excluded from the scene anyone who happened to be interested in the **welfare** of Australian citizens whether they be Aborigines or anyone else.

* He could have easily asked one of the members of the committee, some of whom were Europeans, some part coloured, some cattlemen, some **welfare** people, a cross section of the town of Katherine.

* I will not have time to go through them all but some of them were: The running of educational, health and job opportunity functions of the Department; the running of settlements at Hooker Creek, Beswick and Roper River - these places are in the local area and naturally enough the people would be interested in them; the allocation of funds to the Department and the way they are expended; the questioning of the lack of supervision of the spending of **welfare** cheques paid to Aborigines for specific purposes.

* But this reporter did not wish to portray this genuine interest in the **welfare** of the people in the area, not only Aborigines but also whites on the settlements.

* My children would not have been taken to infant **welfare** centres, they would not have been able to find places in pre-school centres, there would have been no open space in which they could roam, no playing fields on which they could participate in team games, no libraries from which they could borrow books, no social workers to advise them and no youth clubs to enrich their recreation, if it had not been for local government.

* Measuring the criteria of particular municipalities against that bench mark will establish how much those municipalities have available for services and facilities such as libraries, road construction, pre-school education and infant **welfare**, and what advantage those municipalities are taking of the revenue sources available to them.

* Other Media- 59,000 leaflets and 520 posters were made available throughout the Wollongong/Port Kembla area by enlisting the support of doctors and chemists, and organisations such as health funds, bank migrant advisory services, post offices, trade unions, local, State and Commonwealth Government Authorities, migrant organisations and social **welfare** groups.

* In addition, kits of information are now being prepared by my Department, and these will be distributed shortly to State Councils of Social Service for redistribution to social **welfare** agencies throughout the Commonwealth.

* He sought to build up a public expectation - he was supported in this by members of his Government - that what he was doing was significant for the **welfare** of Australian's, but it was nol.

* If so, ' will he, when addressing the assembly, justify his Department's consistent refusal to feed certain categories of deserted wives and their children or, alternatively, explain ' why he refuses to ascertain from the New South Wales Social **Welfare** Department why that Department refuses to succour deserted wives at least to the extent provided by law?

* The Government decided finally that health insurance should not be used as the vehicle for assistance to large families because other **welfare** measures such as taxation concessions and child endowment currently provide assistance of this nature.

* We must continue our efforts to ensure that all who are eligible are aware of their eligibility, probably through greater use of social workers, charitable organisations and other appropriate **welfare** groups.

* We must not fall into the trap, which the Opposition evidently finds so seductive, of making this another **welfare** State handout.

* At times when I approach a debate on Bills such as the legislation before us I regret that so many divisions in the social **welfare** field are involved.

* The Minister for Social Security indicated in his second reading speech that we should consider the new allowance in the context of a broad program of education, training and general **welfare** for handicapped children.

* If anything, one thing above all that can be said of the Labor Party,  Sir Thomas  Playford and the Independent  Speaker  in South Australia is that they have been consistent in trying to safeguard the **welfare** of South Australia by insisting on the Chowilla dam.

* They said: 'Let us spend it on **welfare** and cut down defence expenditure'.

* Go your hardest and spend all the money you want on **welfare** and forget about the Services'.

* The system has evolved and will continue to evolve but it is the one which we have now and it is the one which will provide a larger gross domestic product from which social **welfare** programs may be funded.

* The means adopted is that which underlies the **welfare** state in Britain and is really a form of outmoded government paternalism.

* The **welfare** state mentality is irrelevant in Australia today.

* The old-fashioned **welfare** mentality with its paternalism and centralism has usefully focused public attention upon economic and political philosophies relevant to the last quarter of the twentieth century.

* If this extra sitting load is imposed upon members, some consideration must be given to the staffing situation of members in their home electorates, so that persons are available to handle the many problems which occur, whether they concern social **welfare**, post offices or any of the other general matters that crop up.

* His period as Minister for Health and Social Services was of particular importance to the Labor Government of the time and of particular significance for the **welfare** of the people of Australia.

* We have the Social **Welfare** Commission and a number of education commissions.

* As, under the agreement, it is proposed that the Commonwealth Minister will determine the amount of **welfare** housing advances to a State during the next 5 years, the Australian Government will be able to ensure that an increasing flow of finance will be available to the States to enable them to expand the construction of homes for needy persons and families.

* These concession rates represent in effect a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations ranging from religious, charitable and **welfare** organisations to social and recreational clubs.

* It is in the interests of all Australians that Australia should continue to have a vigorous trade union movement fighting for the **welfare** not only of its members, but also of retired people, primary producers and others throughout the country.

* They include the increased expenditure in social **welfare**, education and, of course, the increase in assistance to primary industry.

* When we take into account the increases in salaries and wages that other honourable members have referred to the real level of expenditure on Aboriginal **welfare** has not gone up by a great amount.

* The Budget announced no new programmes in Aboriginal **welfare**.

* There is a need, again in the field of Aboriginal **welfare**, for a programme of rehousing Aboriginals living in the cities.

* In my view, this philosophy could and should be extended to the **welfare** area.

* Unlike the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman),  whose recent criticism of me seems to indicate that he favours more income support for the wealthy, I regard the needs approach to **welfare** as being equitable and compassionate, for three main reasons: Firstly, it permits greater budgetary flexibility, thereby enabling governments to respond more quickly and more generously to newly emerging areas of poverty.

* Secondly, it permits a greater concentration of **welfare** resources on the needy and may allow those resources or benefits to be paid at a higher level and also to be protected from inflation, which often cannot be done with universally paid benefits because it is too costly.

* When I refer to the need for having another look at our method of **welfare** resource distribution, I acknowledge that we are looking at a complex problem with no straightforward solution.

* That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: 'the House condemns the Budget because (a) it breaks the Prime Minister's pledge to Parliament on taking office to bring into effect for 1971-72 a fundamental review of social services and of methods for adjusting them, (b) it contains no proposals to balance the finances and functions of the Commonwealth, the States and local government and (c) it produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.'

* Secondly, I appeal to them on the third ground of our amendment, that is, that this Budget produces no programmes for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* Thus, we have a Budget that provides nothing even in the short term that could be construed as a programme for high national objectives of social **welfare**, economic strength and national security.

* One of the Government's more able and energetic Ministers - the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  who is at the table at the present time - has, as he has said, prepared a scheme for improved social **welfare**.

* I suggest that the way this Government is heading, in scrapping defence and putting emphasis on **welfare**, we will see the day when we will be as ill-prepared to defend ourselves or to honour our commitments as we were in 1939.

* The 2 people in charge of implementing this idea, from the local Community **Welfare** Consultative Council- Gerry Govier and Arthur Mortimer- were able to entertain these 300 people from Port Adelaide, who came from an area which, as I said, has no library, to have a look at the most up-to-date facilities that can be provided for the public.

* The **welfare** of the Australian people was suffering instead of benefiting.

* Without such orderly development we in the Aus.tralian Labor Party cannot hope to achieve the **welfare** policies that we are so bent on achieving.

* I refer to the national superannuation scheme, the rehabilitation and compensation scheme and other **welfare** policies that we want to achieve.

* We want it working for the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* Recent inquiries made by **welfare** officers of Aboriginal shoppers have also indicated that there is no substance to this allegation.

* In a sense, its purpose is largely of a **welfare** nature.

* If one admits this proposition the next logical step is to assess the scheme, using as one's cri* terion the possibility of attainment of the **welfare** objective.

* This is true in the field of health and **welfare** where people carry out very fine research work, but because the results of the research work could be offensive or embarrassing to somebody or to the Government they are suppressed.

* 1 like the practice in Britain where reports are published not only on various aspects of health and **welfare** services but also on the broad span of public responsibility.

* I rise to join in this cognate debate and to support the Government in its moves to improve the **welfare** of those who benefit under this legislation.

* The figures given to the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**, dealing with retardation, in 1971 put the number of mentally retarded Victorians at between 70,000 and 71,000.

* The Handicapped Children (Assistance) Bill opens the way, as I prefaced my introduction, **r local government to contribute to the **welfare** of the handicapped.

* The advice tendered to me by these senior officers, who have had considerable experience in the handling of social **welfare** cases, is that at this stage the facts do not justify the repatriation of that family at Commonwealth expense.

* The point is that we cannot just seek to push for our own development in this selfish fashion, recognising that we have a lot of unemployed that we cannot accommodate, that we have an increasing aged population, that somehow they will have to survive on social **welfare** and that we will have to maintain our own productive sections of the community by bringing in trained migrants.

* Is that the sort of thing that a nation like ours should be doing when it claims that it is trying to promote the **welfare** not only of its own citizens but also of the whole world, because we are part of the world?

* If we deprive India of its doctors, its teachers and so on- I will not include lawyers - 
to ascertain, and report to the Minister on, the social **welfare** needs of the community and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs; 
to make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement of a nationally integrated social **welfare** plan - 
Paragraph (a) states that the Commission is to report to the Minister.

* I have searched the Bill to see whether there is a requirement for this Social **Welfare** Commission - that is a rather awe inspiring concept - to report to the Parliament and not only to the Minister.

* Sub-paragraph (vi) of paragraph (b) states: recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social **welfare** programs - 
This seems to me to indicate the elimination or abolition of some of the existing social **welfare** programs.

* Sub-paragraph (iv) of the same paragraph refers to recommendations for the co-ordination of social **welfare** activities of organisations.

* Paragraph (c) of clause 14 states: to estimate, and report to the Minister- 
Once again there is no mention of Parliament on, the likely cost of proposed social **welfare** programs and to advise the Minister on the relative priorities to be given to the implementation of those programs; 
What is the Department of Social Security for?

* The Department of Housing has officers well equipped and well served wim advice on proposed social **welfare** programs.

* It has been able to advise the respective Ministers and the governments of the day with great expertise on social **welfare** programs and problems, aided of course by information obtained from interdepartmental committees comprising its own representatives and those from other departments.

* It seems extraordinary to me to have a provision in a Bill to give a blank cheque to an organisation such as the Social **Welfare** Commission to set up a committee on any matter and the committee can have any number of members.

* I feel it my duty to point out some flashing red lights and register warnings about what could happen under this particular provision concerning the establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* These must soon damage the whole structure of industry, commerce, banking and finance and social **welfare** activities in this country.

* Real wages are down because the Government has transferred the cost of health, **welfare** and other traditional public expenditure programs to the individual.

* Real wages are down and living standards have been reduced by the cutting of funds in real terms for community programs- for health and **welfare**, transport, road, sewerage, housing, migrant services, education programs and the like.

* Should we reduce the allocation for Aboriginal **welfare** or social security?'

* Another of the reasons why  1  am so against payroll tax being transferred to the States is that I believe this son of taxation should be used specifically for other social **welfare** measures - indeed, let us include child endowment.

* It therefore is quite clear as stated in the Labor Party's proposed amendment that the Budget provides no framework for improving the standards of health and **welfare** and no national plan for our capital cities.

* The following 'Job Description' for community advisers located on pastoral properties was drawn up when the scheme was originally established in1969 by the **Welfare** Division of the Northern Territory Administration, and would have been given to  Mrs Tapp  on her appointment: 
Encourage group cultural, social and recreational activities amongst Aboriginal women and their families along lines tending to conventionally accepted patterns; act as a bridge between women and girls of Aboriginal and European descent providing common activities, e.g.

* school **welfare** associations in which both groups can participate equally.

* No, oversight and assessment has been carried out during periodical visits to Killarney Station by officers of the **Welfare** Division and latterly the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.

* My Department is negotiating with the NT Government on alternative arrangements to meet the **welfare** needs of people living on pastoral properties.

* 1 ) Has the task force into health, **welfare** and communitybased programs sought submissions from all amateur and professional sporting organisations on the role of the Australian Government in the development of sport from the base to the peak of the sporting pyramid.

* The Opposition displays a very narrow focus when it calls for more spending on particular **welfare** areas.

* It fails to appreciate that overall economic policy is a vital part of **welfare** policy, for failure of total economic policy is bound to hit the disadvantaged for whom the Labor Party falsely claims to speak exclusively.

* This is how it responds to the clearly expressed wish of the Australian people in 1967 that this Parliament should have responsibility for the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people.

* My personal experience is that on occasions my office has had to organise child **welfare** assistance and the assistance of charitable bodies, and in fact we ourselves have provided furniture and money on occasions.

* Some of the people who have been concerned with the problems they are facing in Australia and who have contacted me have said that they could go home if they had not sold up, left their positions of employment, bringing qualifications to Australia which would be normally acceptable but because of the current economic trends they are unable to fit into the community and often place a heavy burden on the **welfare** services both official and voluntary.

* The honourable member for Hume  (Mr Pettitt)  said earlier that this Budget provided for a record expenditure on social **welfare**.

* Even if we do not increase any pensions, unemployment benefits, maternity benefits or child endowment, each year we would see an increase in the expenditure on social **welfare** simply because our population is forever increasing and because the number of people who are eligible for those benefits is increasing, So it is just futile and fatuous to talk about record expenditures.

* One of the ways would be to look at how worth while are the provisions made in the legislation and to see how Australia fares in comparison with other countries in the provision of social **welfare**.

* The latest comparative figures available in respect of general Government expenditure on health and **welfare** as a proportion of the gross national product are the figures for 1968.

* They show that as a proportion of gross national product - that is, the value of all the goods and services any country produces in a year - Denmark spends 20.S per cent on its health and social **welfare** programme, the Federal Republic of Germany spends 18 per cent, Sweden spends  Hi  per cent, France spends 16.8 per cent, Italy spends 1S.8 per cent - honourable members will be wondering where Australia comes - the Netherlands spends 13.3 per cent, the United Kingdom spends 11.2 per cent, Norway spends 10.2 per cent, Canada spends 10.7 per cent and Australia spends 7 per cent.

* There is an obvious need to examine the whole hotch potch of our social **welfare** programme.

* I support the Labor Party's programme to set up autonomous regional departments of **welfare** which will involve the co-operation of State, local and Federal authorities.

* We urge too that consideration be given to the **welfare** of the mentally and physically handicapped and I hope that full notice will be taken of the recent inquiry carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** into this subject.

* The Government recently accepted a recommendation by the Committee of Inquiry into Aged Persons Housing, set up by the Social **Welfare** Commission, that homes which have received, or are applying for, subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act be required to forward a copy of their rules to the Director-General of Social Security and that any rule which the Director-General considers to be repressive or contrary to normal civil liberty should be the subject of discussion with a view to amendment.

* On 3 October departmental officers and 2 statisticians briefed the Opposition **Welfare** Committee.

* The debate is catalysed by irregular but frequent changes to health financing arrangements by the Commonwealth Government of the time, sometimes for reasons of community health and **welfare** and sometimes to help balance the books.

* Adverting to the point with which I commenced and which I want to develop, this again is social **welfare** by instalments.

* The needs and priorities of the community have not been established and indeed are being ignored because of this piecemeal way in which the Government approaches social **welfare**.

* This arises because the philosophy upon which the Government largely bases its action in social **welfare** seems to be vote purchasing power which is cynically calculated.

* Professor Brown in the June 1966 edition of 'Australian Quarterly' appropriately then, and equally appropriately now, said: 
This sort of cynical standard ought to be rejected, and we ought to have identified and clearly established the social **welfare** priorities and needs of the community.

* Where are the white papers on social **welfare** generally?

* They are extremely valuable because they create an informed mind and help to develop a suitable climate for more positive reception of proposed changes in social **welfare** thinking.

* In any event, I did quite a bit of reading in the public library in Brisbane, and one of the most influential documents I read was a report on this subject by the British Ministry of Social **Welfare**.

* Given the secrecy which shrouds so much of what is done by Government departments which are noi associated with strategic factors, such as defence - health cannot be put into this category, nor can social **welfare** - and given the fact that when the Government does make an inquiry it keeps its information confidential, it is awfully difficult for ordinary members of Parliament - back benchers on the Government side, and front and back benchers on this side - to delve out the sort of information they need if they are to make valid conclusions on important matters of legislation in this House.

* This just is not good enough and ii is nol the way in which we ought to be proceeding in our deliberations on important social **welfare** policy.

* I cannot expect that he alone will change the situation in relation to resources for private members, but he can do something about seeing that reports are produced regularly on aspects of social **welfare** policy or on social **welfare** needs in the community.

* It is sometimes said of social **welfare** that it is not a question of policy but of politics.

* That is the view of two overseas experts - not people with a political axe to grind if that is the way in which my approach might be interpreted, but people who, out of human compassion and because of their professional training, are concerned about the **welfare** of the mentally retarded.

* Referring to education, I now want to quote from the 15th Annual Report of the Queensland Subnormal Children's **Welfare** Association.

* Is that the measure of the human compassion which motivates the social **welfare** policy of the Government?

* This gives concern to those responsible for their **welfare**.

* What is its disjointed and uneven approach to **welfare** programmes for handicapped children achieving?

* In Queensland it is notorious that when the Federal Government provided age pensions for those people in mental institutions the State Government immediately moved in and charged those people rent and board for occupation of the premises and it did not divert the money released in this way into increased benefits, **welfare** services or activities in the mental, institutions.

* For instance, I believe the Opposition has been effectively taken to task by the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society, which is hardly a front for the Liberal Party.

* In a media release last week, when the Opposition sought to stir issues along, the Australian Greek **Welfare** 
The Society anticipates that  Mr Georgiou  will make significant contributions to the work of the Ethnic Television Review Panel to which he is secretary.

* It is a temporary appointment which meets with the full satisfaction of the  Chairman  of the Ethnic Television Review Panel,  Mr Frank  Galbally, and it is one which the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society has greeted.

* If I might go on to mention one more; the  President  of the Australian Yugoslav **Welfare** Society has also said that that Society fully supports the appointment.

* Is it a fact that the position of Director of Social **Welfare**, Northern Territory Administration, has no permanent occupant.

* Has the Public Service Board been asked to give a certificate in accordance with section 38 of the Public Service Act in relation to the position of Director of Social **Welfare**, Northern Territory Administration.

* and (2) As the honourable gentleman will be aware, the Government has determined that new **welfare** initiatives should be sponsored under the umbrella of the Australian Assistance Plan.

* The multi-purpose **welfare** centres originally proposed for Sydney and Melbourne were envisaged as being of a pilot nature, and would have provided one means of experimenting with ways of rationalising local services.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission will be examining a great number of proposals for assistance under the Plan and will carefully consider the need for **welfare** centres in relation to other proposals.

* I have every faith in the Minister for Social Services and in his genuine concern for the **welfare** of people who are dependent upon the Government for assistance.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* In the name of human **welfare** this Budget contributes towards fundamental disequilibrium within the economy and not towards reformist or redistributive objectives.

* Its range and size of social **welfare** benefits fall far short of its election promises and the increased benefits do not keep pace with the erosion of real money values caused by inflation.

* I make it quite clear that the Opposition welcomes the emphasis placed on education, social **welfare** and Aboriginal advancement but it is unfortunate that these concessions are acknowledged in the context of the erosion in the purchasing power of disadvantaged groups.

* The major requirement of **welfare** programs this time is to protect those who suffer most from high rates of inflation and it is always the recipients of social **welfare** who suffer the most.

* Just as **welfare** recipients have not been the major beneficiaries of the huge increases in expenditure, the major quality of life issues have been neglected.

* -The honourable gentleman is seeking to confuse comments I made last weekend in relation to the question of social **welfare**.

* I stated that Commonwealth expenditure on education, housing, social security and **welfare** will amount to almost $12 billion or about one-half of expected total outlays in this financial year.

* The dramatic expansion of **welfare** programs over recent years is a very important, if not the principal, reason why such a heavy burden has been placed on Australian taxpayers.

* Quite contrary to what I said, the program sought to give the impression that the Government would be looking to cut out those programs that are fulfilling an important role in the area of social **welfare**.

* What must be understood is that the Government has an obligation to ensure that **welfare** programs are not rendered inefficient by excessive administration and delivery costs, such as those that occurred under the former Administration, and that they are not directed towards those in the Australian community who have a capacity to look after themselves.

* Minister for Immigration) - by leave - I wish to inform the House of the measures by which effect will be given to the Government's announced policy of placing increasing emphasis on migrant counselling and selection and migrant education and **welfare** services.

* The Public Service was not going to be slashed, Medibank was to be maintained and essential health, social **welfare** and education programs were to be preserved.

* My electorate is an electorate of young people and unfortunately it is now becoming a **welfare** electorate.

* I quote from a letter by David Scott, the Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Lawrence: 
This Government has shown a consistency of purpose in its adherence to stated and published **welfare** policy no matter what the opposition.

* Above all the Government has demonstrated to those who had any doubts about what was said to be its lavish **welfare** program that such program would be implemented despite the desperate methods used within and without the Parliament to prevent its implementation.

* I raise the issue here, for the disgrace is that the funds for the dilapidated buildings, the branch maintenance funds, originally were allocated by the Parliament to the State on the trust that it would look after the **welfare** of the State citizens- all Australian citizens.

* If the State is not performing the functions entrusted to it the Australian Government should take a closer interest in the **welfare** of neglected people.

* I am, therefore, pleased that **welfare** housing will be a priority of the national Parliament.

* In all areas of maintenance work- painting, structural repairs and plumbing- there is sufficient work to ensure a continuity of employment for some time not in the provision of new homes but in making existing **welfare** homes comparable to the homes supplied by private enterprise.

* Whilst this may have meant a few weeks delay, and whilst we have been getting a second opinion on the matter and also asking the Fry Committee to discuss this question with the Social **Welfare** Commission to see what can be done to accelerate the whole program, the whole intention of the Government is to accelerate.

* One of the inquiries to which I just referred is in the hands of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**.

* The intention of the AMA seems to be to destroy the repatriation system or to water down its **welfare** provisions to such a degree that it forfeits all meaning.

* All social **welfare** systems are open to abuse.

* The system contains more checks and balances than any other **welfare** system operating under any **welfare** law in Australia.

* According to this approach, repatriation is wasteful and unnecessary - it should be dismantled and the money spent on it diverted to other **welfare** schemes.

* Many of the exservicemen, widows and dependants getting war pensions would become eligible for existing social **welfare** benefits.

* Certainly the special rate and intermediate rate pensioners and widows would be entitled to social **welfare** benefits.

* Only this week have we received the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission - the Coleman report - and also the report of the Priorities Review Staff.

* Of course, it takes time to arouse interest in the community and some local government organisations are very tentative at the present time in relation to the support that should be given to embarking  upon any further projects in the social **welfare** field.

* Its failure after more than two years to come to grips with what is fundamentally wrong in the economy is the reason why so much else is  wrong in  the areas of employment, social **welfare**, education, health, migrant **welfare**, farm industry, mining, manufacturing, the motor industry, and Aboriginal programs.

* The terms of this recommendation are now receiving priority attention from the Aboriginal Affairs Co-ordinating Committee Health sub-committee which includes representatives of the Alcohol and Drug Authority, Community Health Services and the Department for Community **Welfare**.

* Agreement has been reached between the State Housing Commission and the Department for Community **Welfare** to give priority in towns where reserve closure is planned and applicants appear to have potential.

* Houses for use as training centres have been offered to the Department for Community **Welfare** by the State Housing Commission.

* The Department for Community **Welfare** has indicated its intention to appoint as many homemakers as are required subject only to the availability of suitable personnel.

* The Commission does obtain views of other agencies, including the Department for Community **Welfare** but does not accept that any other agency can determine standards for tenants.

* These local government bodies are becoming heavily involved in social **welfare**, conservation, child care and the provision of pre-school facilities.

* Under a separate Bill a record amount of money is being provided to the States for **welfare** housing.

* Increasingly, he and his family depend on local government to provide a whole new range of basic services in health, **welfare**, sport, culture and recreation.

* There are few aspects of our environment, our culture or our **welfare** which can be handled adequately without involving local government.

* Today, the municipalities have responsibilities and duties in areas such as infanct **welfare**, kindergartens, emergency social **welfare**, high contributions to road and other facilities including, in Victoria, the fire brigade.

* They have embraced these duties because of their acceptance of social responsibility This is particularly so in some areas of social **welfare**, where the State Govern ment has instructed local authorities that their duties did not extend into those areas.

* because of their  experience  of the deplorab'e state of affairs which would exist in some areas of social **welfare** if they did not intrude.

* We can contend, as honourable members do from time to time, and not only on the other side of the chamber, that we must have more **welfare** provisions and more care for the aged, that we must have more expenditure on education and a wide range of **welfare** requirements.

* We must have a base on which to introduce the proper, decent and sincere feelings that we all manifest in regard to **welfare** provisions before we can bring them into effect, and one of the first things that this Government has to do is try to remove some of the hindrances, to try to gear rural industries to a totally new situation, because there can be no going back to the cost structure of days of the past, and to try to help these constructive industries, dollar earning industries, to get back on their feet.

* If the granting of these conditions threatens to cut off the very lifeblood overseas earnings- on which we found all our expenditure in the **welfare** state, we should look carefully at them.

* Already we have looked at **welfare** provisions.

* The Commission has the power to deregister when it believes that there will be an adverse effect on the safety, health or **welfare** of a community.

* On the subject of the floor price, I believe that there ought to be, in settling this floor price, two separate components, namely, a commercial component which is the responsibility of the new Wool Corporation and based on commercial decisions and expectations alone and, if necessary, a **welfare** component which should be the responsibility of this place.

* A **welfare** component in a commercial operation is a matter of political judgment which should be made in the political environment.

* -In this important discussion of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, I take the opportunity of pointing out to the Committee the very positive advances effected in very difficult times by a very competent Minister for Aboriginal Affairs  (Mr Viner)  and by a government that has demonstrated its concern and compassion for the needs and **welfare** of Aboriginal people.

* I spoke earlier this evening in the discussion on the estimates for the Department of Social **Welfare**.

* I mentioned in the general comments that I made in that area the different needs of Aboriginals and the fact that one cannot apply the normal sorts of criteria for determining the way in which **welfare** requirements and community development needs of Aboriginal communities can be accommodated.

* It is disappointing to me to have to follow the honourable member for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham)  when he merely sees the **welfare** of Aboriginals in terms of the provision of funds and the provision of such funds in greater amounts.

* I do not believe that it has any concern for, or knowledge of, the **welfare** of the Aboriginal people, or for some of the destructive elements that have caused this unique scheme to be developed in consultation with Aboriginals.

* The Government has now abandoned the most innovative and effective self-help social **welfare** program developed in Australia.

* In regard to housing for Aborigines it means a 15 per cent reduction in cash terms; in regard to housing loans by the banks it means a 30 per cent reduction in cash terms; in regard to **welfare** housing payments to the States it means a 13 per cent reduction in real terms.

* The expression 'child of a marriage' has been limited to the natural or adopted children of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63, which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the **welfare** of children of the marriage.

* This would make sure, for example, that the Department for Community **Welfare** in South Australia may continue to take maintenance proceedings on behalf of persons to whom it pays pension.

* Two amendments in the child **welfare** area have been included in the Bill at the request of the former New South Wales Government.

* One of these ensures that a child who is under the guardianship of a State or Territory Director of Child **Welfare** while awaiting adoption cannot be the subject of a maintenance or custody order except in special circumstances.

* At present the Act confines this exemption to children who are under the care and control of a Minister pursuant to State or Territory child **welfare** legislation.

* Some honourable members on the Government side of the chamber, those few who bothered to speak in this debate - and they were extremely rare - attacked the social **welfare** measures in the Budget quite outspokenly.

* Let us have a look at what the Government promised when it came to office, particularly in the field of social **welfare**.

* The Governor-General, who was speaking for the Government, in his opening speech to Parliament in March 1968 said: 
My Government will review the field of social **welfare** with the object of assisting those in most need while at the same time not discouraging thrift, self-help and self-reliance.

* On 21st March the honourable member for Evans made a speech on social **welfare**.

* Local government is required to provide infant **welfare** centres and immunisation campaigns and it is expected to support kindergartens.

* There is a long history of conservative governments being prepared to spend sometimes very significant amounts of money on social **welfare**.

* The reason for that is that, historically speaking, social **welfare** expenditure has operated to a greater or lesser extent as an instrument of social control.

* It was A. J. Balfour, a conservative politician in Britain, the man who later led the defeat of the British General Strike in 1 926, who said: 
That is to say, it is possible on occasions to use **welfare** expenditures as a means of damping down the fires of discontent.

* When we talk about the increased amounts that have necessarily been spent on **welfare** in the time when this Government has been in power, we have only to look at the unemployment statistics to understand why.

* We have had to spend considerably increased amounts of money on **welfare** because unemployment creates a potentially revolutionary situation, a situation in which conflict of very serious proportions is produced in society.

* If we turn to what is being proposed in this legislation tonight in relation to unemployment beneficiaries, we see that it is simply a continuation of that kind of story of **welfare**, not in terms of the achievement of justice, not in terms of delivering to people what is their right, but rather in the form of an attempt further to harass people and make them feel that somehow they have to get more into line and that somehow they are being deviant.

* That has nothing to do with social **welfare**.

* It has nothing to do with **welfare**, and yet that is part of this social security legislation.

* In 1 976, because of the flow-on of enormous amounts of money allocated to **welfare** housing by the Whitlam Labor Government, 12.2 per cent of housing was built by the public sector.

* In 1977-78 only 1.46 per cent of the Budget was allocated for **welfare** housing.

* We need to upgrade the provision of **welfare** housing.

* More houses must be built in the **welfare** section, and there should be an immediate increase in the allocation of funds to the State housing authorities.

* The long term policy should be to put more money into the public sector, because the **welfare** housing sector needs money more urgently.

* If we look back at the advances made to the States for **welfare** housing by the Australian Government we find a dramatic jump in the year 1973-74, the first financial year this Government was in office.

* The last 2 years' allocation will be  2lA  times greater than the allocation for **welfare** housing from State loan funds in the last 2 years of the previous Government, which were $161.5min 1971-72 and$163.2min 1972-73.

* There are of course, very good reasons why the amount of money allocated for **welfare** housing this year does not follow the dramatic increases of the past 2 years.

* I think we can go back to the track record of the previous Government to see what concern it had about **welfare** housing.

* We can be fairly sure that one of the casualties would be **welfare** housing.

* In spite of this, the substantial advances in the 1975-76 financial year will allow State housing authorities to complete more **welfare** dwellings than has been the case for many years.

* Time and time again we have seen that the people who are benefiting from this are the developers and not the people whom we are aiming to help with **welfare** housing- the poorer people in this community whom we are trying to assist to get homes.

* This whole matter of **welfare** housing is of considerable importance to me.

* I welcome this Bill because it approves more than $364m for **welfare** housing.

* Today I had the privilege of presenting to the Parliament a petition on behalf of those people, as did another Western Australian, the honourable member for Forrest  (Mr Kirwan),  requesting that earnest consideration be given to the crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** which exists in Western Australia, that urgent attention be given to providing town housing to all Aboriginal families with a breadwinner, and that further **welfare** assistance in the form of homemaker assistance, that is, a **welfare** officer to guide them in home settlement, be given.

* There are some 364 applications for Aboriginal housing held by the Native **Welfare** Department in Perth alone.

* We can only hope that the State Housing Commission or the Native **Welfare** Department can help them for they and others have walked the streets of Perth and met with refusal after refusal.

* Must we tolerate such a situation that when a doctor prescribed to an invalid pensioner, a native, that he leave Narrogin in the country to go to Perth to receive weekly treatment at the city hospital the patient was told by some bureaucrat in the Native **Welfare** Department to return to the country reserve as there was no hope of city accommodation?

* Though appreciated, it underlines our laxity in this field and without question leaves this country open to international criticism in the field of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* But what amazes me is that the people responsible for the **welfare** of these Aboriginals accept this as a matter of course.

* Party politics prevailed and the **welfare** of the people became secondary.

* Every school above kindergarten looked as though it would be promoted to a degree conferring institution in order to meet the political requirements of the Victorian Government without any consideration at all of the educational status and standing of the degrees which were conferred or the **welfare** of the students who were subjected to this type of economic or political expansion of these facilities.

* The aim of the Government's overall policy for agriculture has been to ensure the economic **welfare** of the rural industries and those associated .

* Their demands are much less on the public purse than those of the shipbuilding and car manufacturing industries and those unproductive **welfare** areas where relief is a greater reward than theirs for working 50 to 60 hours a week.

* Professional **welfare** recipients account for, I believe, some 60 000 of the total number of unemployed in Australia today.

* For some of these unemployed **welfare** payments are permanent.

* The honourable member made the point about what he called migrant **welfare** courses begun under Labor.

* I have been checking to find out about these migrant **welfare** courses and I find that the reference is probably to a course of training for bilingual **welfare** officers who were to be recruited to the Department of Immigration.

* I am told that no further training took place during the Labor Government's term of office or since December 1975 because no new group of bilingual **welfare** officers has been recruited.

* Recently in this House I have raised by way of questions and in debate the very extreme plight that age and invalid pensioners find themselves in as a result of the callous attitude displayed by the Liberal-Country Party Government towards those members of the community who are reliant upon social **welfare** handouts.

* Added to the number receiving social **welfare** payments are those in the community who are in receipt of some form of fixed income.

* The Labor Party said that abolition of the means test and national superannuation are inseparable aspects of a truly modern **welfare** system.

* It also said that the whole question of **welfare** and pensions must be taken out of the electioneering atmosphere engendered by the Liberal Party's cynical  $1  rise on election eve.

* We said that Labor would enact legislation ulong the lines of the Canadian Assistance Act, to develop along with the States, local government bodies and voluntary agencies a new, regionally based pattern of social **welfare** arrangements.

* I conclude by stating that the Government is discriminating against most of the people by ignoring their needs, their **welfare**, their protection, their health and their security and imposing at the same time a taxation burden from which the country gets scant and reluctant government benefit.

* In the social **welfare** field the Government is accused of denying benefits to the aged, the sick and the handicapped, to prevent inflation.

* When this and schemes such as the home care programme, the aged persons homes scheme, the sheltered employment scheme and the Commonwealth rehabilitation scheme are taken into account it is clear that the Government is most concerned about the **welfare** of the less fortunate members of our community and has taken effective action to improve it.

* Her opinions conflicted with those of representatives of the Northern Territory **Welfare** Branch.

* 3m and that could be doubled if all the recommendations of the witnesses which conflicted with the views of the **Welfare** Branch were implemented.

* The **Welfare** Branch is trying to discourage this practice but I think more vigorous efforts could be employed to abolish it.

* There have been broken promises on **welfare** and social security.

* I have said repeatedly that essential programs in health, education, **welfare** and urban development will be maintained.

* But, as I have said, the Labor Party wants to degrade it because it wants it to be a **welfare** organisation.

* The Bill would provide for the Minister for Mines to have authority to consent or withhold consent from mining activity taking place on Aboriginal reserves after consideration of a recommendation from the Minister for Community **Welfare**.

* The Western Australian Government has indicated its intention to amend the AAPA Act to give the Minister for Community **Welfare** final authority on the issue of reserve entry permits.

* The State Social **Welfare** Minister,  Mr Dixon,  telegrammed two Federal Ministers warning of the possibility of family breakdown if the benefits were not paid.

* The State 's Minister for Social **Welfare**,  Mr Dixon,  - 
In supporting the amendment I want to make a few points about the Bill.

* It seems to me that we have reached the situation where the Government rarely accepts full responsibility with regard to any field of social **welfare**.

* Over the years governments have relaxed this policy slightly by giving such groups a 'modest subsidy, but without ever being prepared to accept responsibility for the organising, financing and running of the whole range of **welfare** services.

* In England rand other countries the government's social **welfare** policies are constantly under review.

* In the past 25 years there has been only one major review of any social **welfare** policy.

* The present, therefore, is not a suitable time for implementing significant structural changes- however necessary such changes may be to improve the **welfare** of Australiansbecause the immediate cost would be further temporary disruption to employment and a resulting increase in deprivation for employees.

* This will leave the Government free to deal with questions of long term assistance in a way which promotes the long term **welfare** of the community as a whole and in accordance with the industry assistance policy expressed in the Commission's statutory guidelines.

* This will provide the Government with advice on the availability of general measures to support the complementary policies being developed to facilitate structural changes, to ease their private adjustment costs, and to develop those low cost industries which contribute most to efficient use of the community's resources and, thus, its general **welfare**.

* Having in mind the balance which the Government must hold between the national **welfare** and the effect of changes on individual **welfare**, I should like more attention to be directed to this general approach which appears to provide a sound base upon which to encourage at a. manageable rate the greater efficiency, and with this the greater prosperity, of Australian industry in the interests of the community as a whole.

* Many countries conducted official surveys of family or household incomes and expenditure, and it is understood that the results of such surveys are useful in connection with **welfare** policy and administration.

* The Bill does raise some important questions about the future of the Government's **welfare** and housing programs.

* The Bailey report recommended that it be included in a comprehensive **welfare** housing scheme.

* The Government might use this program to reduce the criticism which very substantial changes to the long accepted **welfare** housing policies will bring.

* It may well be that the recommendations in the Bailey and Holmes reports are sounder in **welfare** terms than what the bureaucracy is proposing and the Minister should not cut off these options.

* Reports from the Pre -School Committee and the Social **Welfare** Commission were examined.

* Does the Prime Minister feel that his Government's reluctance to take any positive steps to assist in Timor is consistent with his own and his Government's proclaimed concern for humanitarian causes and the **welfare** of the developing world?

* Subsidiesthis is mainly the area in which such a scheme has been criticised- become necessary only to sustain a price stabilisation scheme where the marketing organisation deliberately incorporates a **welfare** component in its floor price.

* The Whitlam Government's lack of concern for the **welfare** of rural industry was demonstrated by its reluctance to back the Wool Corporation's floor price plan.

* Accordingly one could fairly say that this in itself represents a form of **welfare** benefit.

* If it is now its proposition that there should also be a substantial commitment through the Budget to this sort of financial outlay, which involves a very large amount of money, I repeat the challenge to the Opposition: If that is the sort of **welfare** program it wants, where is it going to get the money and at whose expense in terms of cuts in programs affecting the rest of the community?

* The thing that bothers me most is that nobody in Australia is settling down to look at the whole field of handicapped children, let alone the whole field of general **welfare**, and asking: 'What are rights of the people that we should be looking after?

* The Commonwealth has made a survey of Australia's needs in education and it should be able to do this in the field of social **welfare** and assistance to handicapped children.

* That child's parents probably need a social **welfare** worker.

* There should also be social **welfare** workers available to be able to go around and visit families so as to assist the parents in educating handicapped children if the parents are undertaking this task.

* The Liberal Party ought to talk about its social **welfare** conscience!

* I believe that his association with social **welfare** and with people in this area has most likely awakened him to the needs, but I do not believe that it has awakened the leadership of his Party to those needs.

* I assume that if what the honourable member for Hotham says is the policy of the Liberal-Country Party coalition were to be carried out, as he said, immediately upon its assumption of office, we can add another $ 1,000m to the expenditure on social **welfare** because that is the sort of money he was talking about this afternoon.

* This is a social **welfare** area and some serious examination should be undertaken of the means by which such children can be placed on the same basis as other children.

* National Commission on Social **Welfare**.

* The National Commission on Social **Welfare** will, no doubt, have regard to other **welfare** inquiries that have been, or are being made.

* That Department has direct outlays in the field of social security and **welfare** for this year estimated at some $4,772m.

* Direct outlays on social security and **welfare** in 1975-76 are equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlay.

* Because of that huge responsibility to our genuine areas of **welfare** and because of the costs involved, it is most desirable that stringent procedures be developed that remove existing anomalies and also remove the abuses that are being perpetuated in the system.

* I believe that only by close scrutiny can we ensure that the **welfare** areas are supported fully and adequately and can be broadened.

* May I just say in closing my remarks that the success of any social **welfare** program is dependent not on the Government but upon the ability of taxpayers to fund the necessary schemes.

* Expenditure on social **welfare** and repatriation now constitutes the largest single item of expenditure in the Budget.

* In conclusion, I repeat that no government should be expected to take over the entire responsibility of caring for those in need while members of their families contribute little to their **welfare**.

* The goals set by the Government of the Liberal and Country parties, on the other hand, in the framing of this year's Budget are designed to build a better Australia by promoting balanced development as well as the economic and social **welfare** of all Australians.

* The goals set by the Government, on the other hand, in the framing of this year's Budget are designed to build a better Australia by promoting balanced development and the economic and social **welfare** of all Australians.

* The firm agreement to abolish the means test within 3 years means that throughout the Australian community people will .henceforth be able to benefit from the range of social **welfare** to which they contribute through their taxation payments.

* Consequently hundreds - perhaps thousands - of Australians could be thrown out of work; yet this is a man who claims that he is concerned for the economic **welfare** of the Australian worker.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* But, of course, in real terms the economic **welfare** of people who do not belong to unions often depends upon the action of trade unionists.

* We seek to understand : and recognise that the gross national product is not necessarily an accurate measure of how much the **welfare** of the community is improving.

* This is a  completely  new **welfare** proposal.

* Let us look at the type of **welfare** proposal that has come from the Government.

* Yesterday the Family **Welfare** Bureau in New South Wales had its annual meeting and closed its doors.

* I regard the closing down of the Bureau, a voluntary social **welfare** organisation in New 
South Wales, as a national disgrace.

* It was formed to provide **welfare** for ex-servicemen and their dependants.

* The Family **Welfare** Bureau in fact did receive grants from numbers of Government departments.

* It is a sum which in the social **welfare** field I believe we cannot afford to lose.

* I know from my own involvement in the Provisional Committee in Parramatta that the social worker from the Family **Welfare** Bureau was endeavouring to assist in the promotion of that plan in the Parramatta district with a view to participation in it.

* Although the late  Mrs Henry,  who I understand was one of the senior officers in the department in Sydney, discussed these matters at length with the senior officers of the Family **Welfare** Bureau, no means could be found whereby money could be made available for social workers to be maintained in their present positions and for this valuable organisation to be able to continue to exist.

* It may well be in the plan of this Government that voluntary organisations should be done away with and should be seen as being no longer important in the plan of things for providing and meeting **welfare** needs.

* They privide a difference in the style of things in providing **welfare** needs.

* The previous Labor Treasurer said in his Budget Speech- this is something that might appeal to honourable gentlemen opposite- that to introduce tax indexation without cutting education and social **welfare** commitments would be 'to ask the impossible'.

* We have made real increases in education funds and even greater increases in social **welfare** funds; yet we still managed to increase full tax indexation.

* We allocated $5,389m for our continuing commitment to maintain and improve social security benefits and **welfare** services.

* I hope it will provide the Government with a new mechanism to make **welfare** housing sensitive to the needs of the users rather than those of the planners.

* The Government will be closely monitoring the progress of this important **welfare** reform.

* Without a comprehensive survey of the social **welfare** needs of our nation we do not know, to the extent that we should know, just what other services such an organisation should be giving to the elderly people of our nation.

* It was my privilege to meet Miss Taylor when we were both appointed as the first members of the Social **Welfare** Advisory Council in South Australia which was set up under the Labor Government's new Social **Welfare** Act in 1965.

* It is interesting to note that it was with Miss Doris Taylor on the Social **Welfare** Advisory Council in South Australia that I first came across the great need for a social **welfare** survey.

* The emphasis placed on the paramountcy of a child's **welfare** in custody proceedings is important.

* The Government is determined to provide adequate finance for an expansion in **welfare** housing which has suffered severely because of inflationary conditions.

* Of that increase, $2 10m was for social security and **welfare**.

* Is there any member of the Opposition who says we should not have provided $2 10m in the field of social security and **welfare**?

* We have cut taxation by a commonsense $430m, consistent with our economic and **welfare** programs.

* The fact is that nearly all families will benefit in areas of education, health and **welfare**.

* Labour and materials that would have gone into erecting city office blocks later to be only half tenanted can be diverted into public programs such as schools, hospitals, **welfare** housing, local government and regional development, community building and sewerage works.

* 1 ) As the Acting Prime Minister announced in his press statement of 23 July when releasing details on the establishment, including the Terms of Reference, of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health, the members of the Task Force are: 
Against the background of the Government's Federalism policy and its concern at the proliferation and overlap of Commonwealth services and programs in the health, **welfare** and community development fields, the Task Force shall examine and report on- 
the identification of particular services and programs, currently being undertaken by the Commonwealth, in the health, **welfare** and community development fields, which could be better delivered by a State, local government or voluntary agency and the administration of which could be transferred to the States; 
the possibilities for elimination of individual programs and consolidation into broader based programs in a manner which enables more efficient and economic delivery whether by the Commonwealth or the States, and the establishment of appropriate consultative arrangements with the States, local government and voluntary agencies on future policy planning, administration and service delivery in the health, **welfare** and community development fields; 
take account of views expressed by consumer groups and voluntary agencies, noting the Government's support of the concept of maximum realistic community participation in health/**welfare** programs funded by the Commonwealth.

* The Commission believes that problems of adjustment and **welfare** are, in general, best dealt with by specific measures rather than by input subsidies.

* Let me emphasise, in closing, that these Bills are not **welfare** measures, an idea which the Labor Party chooses to promote.

* I think members of the Opposition have proved conclusively that they view them as **welfare** measures by referring to them in relation to limited tonnages.

* Those references indicate clearly that they regard them as **welfare** measures.

* In fact the minority report of the Industries Assistance Commission proves conclusively that in their opinion they are **welfare** measures.

* As the Minister said in his second reading speech, this is an anomalous situation which discriminates against people acquiring homes from the **welfare** housing authorities when people acquiring privately built homes with Commonwealth finance are not disqualified.

* The Labor Government did build up enormous goodwill among people who benefited from **welfare** housing under the Commonwealth-States Housing Agreement.

* The Speech lists very important matters such as social security which will affect the basic **welfare** of Australians.

* As with social **welfare** matters the mark of a good, just, and great society is the way in which that society treats those of its members who are less fortunate than the average.

* I think in those short words in this Estimates debate I have shown the vital significance of the policy of interdependence for the **welfare** of Australia's overseas trade.

* Commonwealth Government grants to autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations in Australia for capital purposes totalled $14m in 1969-70.

* In his election policy speech he said that the Labor Party's child care program reflected the recommendations of the Australian Prc-schools Committee, the Australian Social **Welfare** Commission and the Priorities Review Staff.

* Were the recommendations consistent with those contained in the report of the Social **Welfare** Commission which advocated an expenditure of $130m in the 1974-75 year?

* It is humanely and economically senseless to spend $ 1,000m this year on **welfare** payments to unemployed people while there is so much important socially useful work that needs to be done and which could provide gainful and satisfying jobs for the unemployed.

* These recurrent sums, whether or not the States draw the whole$1 9.62m are 55 per cent to be spent at the States' discretion and 45 per cent to go for curriculum research and development; the training of professional staff; the development of a central resource centre; publicity to raise the level of community awareness of the opportunities available; counselling services and social work; staff to direct and oversee safety measures - here I might interpolate that the low standards of safety in many technical colleges would not be permitted for one minute in factories - health and **welfare** of students; in-service training; for the formation of a unit to develop educational specifications for buildings; site plans; and master plans for capital works development and re-development; and for staff for statistical collections concerning student and teacher population and related matters.

* My next point is that the Opposition should be asking itself a third question - whether it is right that, when men are called out on strike, no regard should be paid to the **welfare** of their families, who have to do without the take-home pay and consequently must live in a state of distress while the strike continues.

* The honourable member for Griffith has asked the Government to 'restrict the effect of inflation on people with low incomes receiving superannuation or receiving **welfare** payments'.

* Let us consider the level of **welfare** payments made by the Labor Government.

* I believe that this is something that the Opposition must squarely and responsibly face in the near future if it is not to cause not only problems affecting **welfare** payment recipients but also problems which will cause the widespread unemployment of people who are employed by government or who are dependent on government purchases and contracts for their incomes.

* In those circumstances one would expect that the Opposition Parties would have a better **welfare** policy to put in the place of our policy.

* I would briefly like to cover some ground in respect of the relative performances in the field of **welfare** payments.

* In other **welfare** areas the increases have been even greater than 80 per cent.

* I think that here the Leader of the Opposition has let the cat out of the bag by making repeated statements which clearly show that it is his aim if he ever, God help us, becomes Prime Minister of this country to take government out of the field of providing services and just completely confine any **welfare** activity to transfer payments.

* I think it is quite clear that the payment of pensions and other benefits is the most important part of a **welfare** policy.

* I think there is something to fear in a pernicious doctrine which has now crept into the Liberal Party's philosophy of the voucher system which has been espoused by the Opposition's spokesman on education in another place who talks about an education voucher policy and by the honourable member for Hotham who talks about **welfare** vouchers.

* I hope that if we ever see the day when our political opponents are restored to government they will not allow the Leader of the Opposition to proceed with their absolutely reactionary and archaic policies which would result in a retreat into the 19th century and a reliance on market mechanisms to provide **welfare** services or any other basic services for people.

* resources and no end to the chronic **welfare** problems that the capitalist system has to face.

* For the purposes of this Act, there is hereby established a Commission by the name of the Social **Welfare** Commission .

* I believe that the people of Australia should have been informed that a social **welfare** commission would be established if the Australian Labor Party was elected, because this would have indicated that another government department would be established entailing the appointment of the head of the department,  deputy  heads and various other personnel.

* But the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  made no mention of a social **welfare** commission in his policy speech.

* He said that an Australian assistance plan would be introduced but he made no mention at all of the fact that it would be necessary to establish a commission by the name of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* This is going to be a function of the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* It has sent out loose leaf notices telling people to write to the Social **Welfare** Commission if they want further reports.

* It is actually asking people to write to the Social **Welfare** Commission, which has not yet been established.

* So we need this **welfare** housing and we need it desperately.

* If the restraint comes to housing I guess it will be in the field of **welfare** housing because this is the area which those opposite have consistently neglected.

* There is an absolute and urgent necessity for **welfare** housing.

* Far from the States not spending their allocations under **welfare** housing provisions as happened last year when they returned to the Treasury an amount of $25m, I am pleased to see that the builders are now co-operating and tendering for the construction of **welfare** houses.

* However, the needs of such people are far from placated, and all the other desirable features of a comprehensive social **welfare** scheme are ignored.

* The article refers to the proportion of gross national product which is expended by a number of countries on social **welfare**.

* The Scandinavian countries spend 10.9 per cent of their gross national product on social **welfare**; the member countries of the European Economic Community spend 15.2 per cent; Canada 9.9 per cent; the United Kingdom 8.6 per cent; Switzerland 8.2 per cent; New Zealand 6.6 per cent; the United States of America 5.9 per cent; and in Australia the figure is down to 5.5 per cent.

* The Canadian pension plan was introduced in 1968. lt is a comprehensive **welfare** programme.

* shelter, vocational training, household supplies, tools of trade, health care and **welfare** services.

* It is not related to a national **welfare** scheme.

* I believe that we have reached the stage in this country where there is a need for a royal commission to inquire into the whole question of social **welfare**.

* It is due ultimately to excessive wage increases and these in turn arise from the selfish, if not anti-social, behaviour of militant trade unionists who are prepared to put the economic **welfare** and the job opportunities of their fellow workers at risk in a narrow minded attempt to increase their own real income.

* In Warilla-Shellharbour the objective is to provide facilities for a rapidly expanding area with sparse health and **welfare** facilities.

* I believe that the average Australian is concerned about national **welfare** and the overall interests of the nation.

* We are one of the governments in the world which have acted to reduce their spending, to cut the size of the Public Service and to cut down on the open ended claims which people can make on **welfare** and other services.

* I think it is to these people that we owe a special concern which lamentably has not been forthcoming from the Victorian Department of Aboriginal Affairs to which so far their **welfare** has been entrusted.

* I raise the question of their **welfare** tonight because the takeover of the affairs of Aborigines in Victoria by the Australian Government is now so imminent.

* I believe there is a special requirement on this side of the House to represent those views in this House, to stress to those people that this is the home of liberalismliberalism with a small L- not the home of authoritarian do-goodery, not the house of determined pressure on the society, where they will do what is good for them whether they like it or not, not the forced enema approach to **welfare**.

* The entire social security and **welfare**, and housing expenditure by the Commonwealth comes to $2,975m.

* This health scheme would drag away all of that expenditure on those items of social security and **welfare** and of housing.

* It would all be terribly entertaining and it would even be enjoyable if it were not for the fact that its consequences have already been so damaging and are so potentially disastrous to the **welfare** of this community.

* Let them judge the Senate for its extraordinary and reprehensible lunge for power; taken regardless of national security as exemplified by its rejection of this defence Loan Bill; taken without regard to national political stability, without regard to the national economy and without regard to individual **welfare** either; as exemplified by the salaries which will not be paid to the armed forces, nor to the Public Service; as exemplified by pensions which will not reach pensioners and social **welfare** payments which will not reach social **welfare** beneficiaries.

* If the honourable member for Bendigo wants to complain that that is not true let him explain, given the admitted, special appropriations for social **welfare** payments, how he will ensure that those pensions and social **welfare** payments will reach the beneficiaries given that the requirements of Public Service manpowereven the very postage amounts to something like $100,000 per week- will be met without appropriations.

* This madness, this adventure with the nation's **welfare** has gone far enough.

* As is the case with all social **welfare** programs since 1975, this allocation is reduced in real terms.

* I believe that any system of legal aid should have funds to devote to law reform and preventative law, through working arrangements with social **welfare** agencies of the shop front style of legal aid to bridge the gap between those who understand the maze which is the legal system and those whom the system abuses and ignores.

* This was driven home to me after I had the good fortune recently to investigate mental health and social **welfare** services overseas.

* Australia has the highest standard of health and **welfare** policies in the world.

* The main problem is arising probably because of a failure to mesh in the mental health services concept with the concept of social **welfare** services, also on a community basis.

* Rice in a publication 'Estimating the Cost of Illness', issued by the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** in 1966, estimated that mental illness alone in the United States cost $7 billion in 1963.

* Day by day we see the efforts that are made in respect of this and other matters of social **welfare**.

* There is one other matter which I think is a crying shame when we consider social **welfare** requirements.

* Token advances were made to 2 bodies to be established for the purposes of dispensing social **welfare** to migrant people in this country.

* If recommendations were accepted in full and one result was the establishment of the Australian Universities Commission to oversee the continuing **welfare** of the universities.

* It is rather remarkable that this should bc so because  the  Government has been in office for nearly a quarter of a century and until about a fortnight ago had seen little virtue in having inquiries in'.o various aspects of **welfare** needs in the community.

* Why not inquire into the broad aspect of social **welfare** in the community into which the needs of the family dovetail very neatly although representing only one section of a vast range of high priority needs in the community.

* If the inquiry into this particular area dealt with by the Minister is to be meaningful, just as an inquiry into the broad aspect of social **welfare** services in the community is to be meaningful, questions must be raised about fundamental philosophical values, about the role of society, the relationship of people within society, the position of the productive system and what its purpose is within our society.

* After the next election, when Labor is in office and sets up a broad committee of inquiry into social **welfare** we will do what we hope this Government would do in framing the terms of reference for the matter dealt with by the Minister.

* The States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill seeks to advance moneys to assist the **welfare** of Aborigines.

* I think it is a great pity that it has used Aborigines and the **welfare** of Aborigines to chastise the Queensland Government on a matter that can only be an opinion.

* 1 ) What is the current status of the North West one stop **Welfare** Centre (the NOW Centre).

* Will provision be made for further one stop **welfare** centres.

* Will the Minister establish a one stop **welfare** centre in the City of Northcote, Victoria.

* I hasten to add that local authorities in the United States and Canada have responsibility, of course, for functions such as police and justice, health and **welfare**, housing and urban renewal and in some cases, education which Australia does not have.

* I refer firstly to the Municipal Association of Victoria and its approach to the first Bailey report from the Commonwealth Task Force on co-ordination in Health and **Welfare**.

* I respectfully agree with the Municipal Association m its conclusion that the implications of the Bailey report recommendations are wide-ranging and of substantial significance to the delivery of health and **welfare** in this country.

* Local Government is now involved with planning for **welfare** of the whole community.

* An increasing range of grants from Commonwealth and State sources nas expanded the role of local government in social **welfare**.

* It works from the general policy position on local government encompassed in its Federalism and social **welfare** policies.

* The Bureau provides assistance to the sponsored students in various matters relating to their education, training and **welfare**.

* Who is conducting the research into community **welfare** needs in isolated parts of the Jericho Shire.

* After all, in its own way this is a **welfare** measure.

* A major consideration in any proposal to expand the present benefits is the additional burden which would necessarily be placed on Australian taxpayers who, in 1970-71, provided from the National **Welfare** Fund $427m for expenditure on National Health alone.

* I think it is true to say that for very many years it was believed that it was the responsibility of the Government to reduce or to eliminate freedom from fear and freedom from want and that consequently the pensioner should be entitled to have confidence in the fact that he would in moments of anguish and trial be assured of a base pension that would cover, first of all, the basic necessities and later on the conventional necessities such as housing, food and clothing, health and **welfare** services and similar types of necessities.

* In the rather general way in which one talks about **welfare** support programs, that is a **welfare** support program.

* **Welfare** housing policies of the previous Labor Government ignored those within the community who were in greatest need.

* The honourable member for Reid mentioned **welfare** housing.

* My electorate is one of the first to feel the chill of a government which puts social justice at the tail end of its priorities- a government whose harsh policies are actually fermenting social disorder, a government which directs its public servants in the **welfare** area to stick to the letter of the law and to throw compassion and decency to the wind.

* As far as I know no one in Australia has come up with scientific evidence on the relationship between an intangible, such as work incentives, and the way it is affected by the availability of **welfare** benefits.

* The general conclusion is that for other than a minimal number of people there is little data to suggest that there is a strong link between nonparticipation in the work force and the provision of **welfare** benefits.

* Provision is made here for the general **welfare** services and community activities of $1.5m to provide for the maintenance of State wards and other children, assistance to missions for the care of children, maintenance of mental patients and the care of those people in necessitous circumstances.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* In the area of social **welfare**, are we really doing much to encourage self-reliance by the way the social services system is structured, with a claim being made, an examination of the claim, followed by a straight payment of money?

* We have become so preoccupied with the need for social **welfare** and support of one means or another that we find now that there is virtually a social **welfare** establishment.

* We have now given such an impetus to the social **welfare** establishment that we run the risk of encouraging a dependent mentality.

* We should be examining, for instance, why it is that almost every day in this place- at least in my case- we are deluged with reports and surveys of one sort or another on matters of social **welfare**.

* We should be examining the subjects of health care, social **welfare**, education and many of the other sacrosanct areas of government expenditure to see whether there is a better way of achieving the same desirable end- a method of helping those who really need help, yet at the same time encouraging their self-reliance.

* The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Nixon)  in his second reading speech said that the Industries Assistance Commission considered that the continuation of the stabilisation assistance arrangements for the wheat industry could not be justified on either efficiency or **welfare** grounds and.

* The terms of reference of the IAC inquiry into wheat stabilisation were: 
If granted permissive residence the Administrator of Papua New Guinea usually arranges settlement away from the border and adequate provision is made for housing, **welfare** and employment.

* Permissive residents and their families are also free to utilise the same **welfare** benefits that are available to other Papua New Guinea residents.

* I indicate the importance of this matter because many of the policy initiatives which the Minister for Immigration claims to have introduced in relation to the **welfare** of migrants in Australia were policy initiatives formerly announced by my colleagues the honourable member for Barker  (Dr Forbes)  or the honourable member for Flinders  (Mr Lynch).

* Such policy initiatives, which the Minister claims to have introduced, as the development of new and expanded **welfare** services, the schools program, the examination of the problems of over 60 inner city schools in Melbourne, the emergency telephone service, expanded facilities for teaching English, the policy of re-union of families - which was announced in 1968  -  and expanded migrant counselling services were all announced before the Minister came to power.

* The young people are also taking over the production of a community newspaper, run previously by the Rockhampton Social Development Council and directed at social **welfare** readers.

* I have said repeatedly that essential programs in health, education, **welfare** and urban development will be maintained.

* Medibank- intended as a full, automatic free service for all Australians, the birthright of all Australian citizens, the entitlement of every migrant to Australia- will become a second-best **welfare** scheme for a minority only.

* This Bill authorises the Treasury to advance to the States for the current financial year $364.6m for **welfare** housing.

* Some States are currently experiencing difficulties in maintaining their **welfare** housing programs- difficulties I might add, that are a direct legacy of the previous Government.

* The Housing Agreement was a great milestone in the history of **welfare** housing in this country and I hope to see a lot more Government enthusiasm about its future than we have seen today.

* I am told that the annual State budget of the administering authority - the Maternal, Infant and Pre-school **Welfare** Division of the Department of Health - will be about $5m this year.

* I think it is true to say that most of the blame- if 'blame' is the right word- for that rests with his colleagues rather than my own because one can look at the record of the Tonkin Labor Government in Western Australia and see that long before there was a massive provision of federal funds in the field of Aboriginal affairs the Tonkin Labor Government had managed to make great strides in terms of Aboriginal policy and Aboriginal **welfare**.

* Most of the **welfare** activities of that Department were taken over by the Department of Community **Welfare**.

* Alongside this **welfare** network was set up the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority, which anticipated or at least pre-dated the approach that the Australian Government is taking in trying to regionalise Aboriginal affairs.

* It included interviews and questionnaires to (1 ) new settlers, (2) ethnic and **welfare** organisations, (3) key organisations in the field of health and medical **welfare**, (4) key individuals in migrant **welfare**.

* The whole modernisation of Australian **welfare** services and community activities will be brought down if the State governments succeed in their attempts to preserve such activities on a centralised State basis.

* Commonwealth expenditure on health and **welfare** has increased from $1.4 billion in 1967-68 to $10.2 billion in 1977-78.

* In the current financial year, 1978-79, expenditure on health and **welfare** is expected to rise to $10.9 billion- almost $800 for every man, woman and child in Australia.

* So this Government is meeting a very substantial commitment for the health and **welfare** of the Australian people and, in particular, for the aged population of Australia.

* In a year of budgetary restraint- this year- the **welfare** budget rose by 7 per cent.

* So, let that fact give the he to those honourable members who claim that this Government is responsible for substantial cutbacks in social security benefits and **welfare** expenditure generally 
I repeat that in a year of budgetary restraint there has been an increase of 7 per cent in the total **welfare** budget.

* I want now to comment on some of the remarks that have been made from time to time about so-called cutbacks by this Government in the provision of social security and **welfare** benefits.

* The orientation of our society towards the qualitative aspects of growth and towards broad aspects of **welfare**, however, does require a close integration of science policy with social and economic policy, especialy in relation to long range human objectives of social development.

* We must constantly keep in mind that the proper aims of technology and applied science are the **welfare** of the consumers and the betterment of the human condition.

* The experience includes environmentally relevant work relating to water, sewerage, soil conservation, transport, industrial wastes, air pollution, biological ecosystems, urban planning, mathematical modelling, **welfare** economics, health physics, radio-activity, agriculture, forestry, fishing, plant pathology and natural history.

* What steps have been taken, as recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in its report tabled on Stb May 1971 on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia, (a) to co-ordinate those functions relating to the health, **welfare**, education and employment of handicapped persons at present being exercised by the Departments of Health, Social Services, Labour and National Service, Interior, Education and Science and Repatriation, and (b) to collaborate with the States on legislation and services for the handicapped.

* For a start I wish to read a few extracts from the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** entitled: Drug Problems in AustraliaAn Intoxicated Society?

* The opening paragraph says: 
Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public inquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standards of the most advanced countries.

* I refer the House to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare**.

* At page 1 , the report states: 
In Australia, we have little idea of whether our health and **welfare** efforts are appropriate, effective, efficient, or equitable.

* That is a judgment made by a majority of Government supporters about the Government's health and social **welfare** programs.

* Let me repeat it: 
In Australia, we have little idea of whether our health and **welfare** efforts are appropriate, effective, efficient, or equitable.

* one sees in health and **welfare** in Australia a system out of control- 
In order to achieve an efficient, effective national and equitable health and **welfare** system, it is necessary to conduct on going evaluation ... the consequences of not evaluating are possible indiscriminate cuts in funds, indiscriminate handing out of funds, continuance of the present ad hoc decision making process, perpetuation of the present inadequacies in the health and **welfare** system, and a possible lack of alternative solutions to problems in health and **welfare**.

* What has emerged is the decision to slash, cut and rend health and **welfare** policies.

* The decision to slash, cut and rend our social **welfare** and our health policy schemes is what this legislation is all about.

* It is interesting to note that the Minister for Social Services, as a backbencher in many of his contributions to social **welfare** debates, was a fervent advocate for the abolition of the means test.

* Paragraph (6) states: a  joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social **welfare** needs of the Australian community.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally, concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have closed the border into India.

* So much productive and useful work could be done in that area in the public sector rather than having people paid out in social **welfare** benefits.

* In the field of **welfare** housing, in Victoria there are waiting lists of 1 8,000 people who have to wait four or five years for such housing.

* However, I understand that officers of  my  Department co-operated to the fullest possible extent with the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** and supplied it with all information that was required and that was available.

* What is the reason for not allowing the Health, Social **Welfare** and Repatriation Committee of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to see the video-taped programme.

* I am greatly honoured and, in gladly assuming the responsibility, I would like to say that the **welfare** of every person within the electorate shall at all times be my total concern and care.

* It is gratifying to know that long before these Bills were introduced the Government had shown its concern for the **welfare** of the people and had provided this help.

* There would have been no need for the receipts tax if the national Government had accepted at least as much responsibility for civic finances and functions - in land acquirement, in **welfare**, in culture, in transport, in pollution - as national governments in any comparable country, in either federal or unitary systems, already do and have done for decades past.

* There is not one aspect of the many sided task we have to do in New Guinea - in defence, in development, in commerce, in **welfare**, in education - in which the value of the Australian contribution will not be enhanced when we cease also to be rulers.

* New  initiatives  will be undertaken concerning Aboriginal health, alcohol abuse and juvenile **welfare**, and the Government looks forward to the fullest consultation with the National Aboriginal Conference and the Council for Aboriginal Development on these and all other issues affecting Aboriginals.

* Research in these fields is being undertaken in universities, government departments and agencies, voluntary health and **welfare** agencies and private commercial organisations, as well as by private individuals.

* it does not pay due regard to the nature and extent of the **welfare** housing needs as between the various States'.

* But the Australian Labor Party does intend to demonstrate that the Government's proposals for allocating **welfare** housing funds are inadequate.

* It is exactly the same amount as has passed to the States for the provision of **welfare** housing in each of the last 2 years.

* In the first year of the Labor Government we allocated $2 18m to **welfare** housing.

* We had agreed that if the overall situation had not improved in the second half of the financial year we would increase the allocation for **welfare** housing to those States where there were large resource surpluses.

* The provision of funds for **welfare** housing was one of the Labor Government's major achievements in changing the resource allocation in our economy.

* Yet the Australian Government deliberately aggravates the problem in Western Australia and Tasmania by increasing the amounts given to those States for **welfare** housing, thereby adding further to the strains on the dwelling sector in those States.

* There has been no increased allocation for **welfare** housing in that State which needs industry assistance, needs more employment opportunities and needs more **welfare** housing.

* The Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare**; 
I agree that this is perhaps a change of some magnitude in the procedures of the Parliament and that perhaps it should not be entered upon lightly, but I believe also that the proposition contains no real dangers to the parliamentary institution.

* So the following divisions are suggested: A standing committee on foreign affairs and defence, a standing committee on finance and trade, a standing committee on health and **welfare**, a standing committee on primary industry and national development, a standing committee on transport and communications, a standing committee on education, science and the arts, and a standing committee on legal, home and internal territory affairs.

* I think these innovations have been of great benefit not only to the building industry throughout Australia but also in all fields of **welfare** housing.

* It is not true that a drastic cutback has been made in advances this year to Victoria for **welfare** housing.

* Certainly the entire **welfare** housing advance this year to Victoria is the same as last year- it is $98.

* What will happen to the **welfare** housing money?

* How will the smaller States then make up the amounts which they are going to need for their **welfare** housing if the money will have to be raised through extra taxes by the States themselves?

* I hazard a guess that **welfare** housing will come a pretty bad last if it is to be left in the hands of the States to raise the money.

* in the exercise of his rights everyone shall bc subject to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing recognition nf the rights of others and of meeting the requirements of morality, public order and the general **welfare** in a democratic society.

* Briefly, the conference proposed the setting up of an elected body representing Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders on a regional basis to take over the administration of their affairs, their **welfare** and also the disposal of government finance.

* I think it is high dme the Minister had support from the Cabinet and from this party to assert that the values that are important to Australians are not those represented by Vestey's which is getting land for a few cents a square mile, but the interest of human **welfare**.

* Despite the difficulties the Fraser Government has introduced the most radical social **welfare** reforms since the introduction of the old age pension.

* Incidentally, these are all groups which the previous Labor Government of compassion and concern, to use its own well-known phraseology, ignored and oppressed even further because of inflation of its own making and because of its construction of a **welfare** bureaucracy which ensured that the minimum of money, in fact, reached those most in need.

* Let those honourable members and others in the community who are concerned for the Aborigines in Australia take note of this: Of every dollar spent on Aboriginal **welfare** only 13c ever reached the Aboriginal people.

* We have pruned Government spending by a projected $2 billion without disturbing essential **welfare** programs, as we promised in the campaign of last December.

* -Last financial year the Government made available $2 18m- I think some 26 per cent more than in the previous year -for **welfare** housing and of that amount $16m was unspent by New South Wales and $9m was unspent by Victoria, making a total of $25m.

* The Government has been very concerned that funds made available for **welfare** housing have remained unspent considering that there has been such a large number of outstanding applications for Housing Commission homes.

* South Australia: Minister for Community **Welfare** 
Western Australia: Minister for Health and Community **Welfare** 
State: Office of the Minister for Ethnic Affairs, Education Department, Housing Department, Health Services Department, Social **Welfare** Department.

* Housing Commission, Treasury Department, Department of Community **Welfare**.

* It was said in a leading daily this week that Australia's future development, Australia's wealth, the money that we get to spend on all of the other items contained in the Budget whether they be **welfare**, education or whatever else, comes from the pastoral and mining industries.

* Those States are responsible for a balance of payments and an export market which provide for the **welfare** and health requirements of southern Australia.

* Instead of private members being active in the Parliament to examine legislation, to discuss reports, to discuss ministerial statements and so on, there is a tendency for them to want to be back in the electorate serving the social worker or **welfare** worker functions there.

* The reservations we hold have been caused by the recent allegations of misuse of public funds set aside for the **welfare** of Aborigines and islanders and by the report of expenditure which was tabled on 11 October last by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.

* Expand social **welfare** program in the Kalgoorlie area, $17,600.

* Are these projects viable and of value for the assistance and **welfare** of the coloured people?

* I have mentioned before that the Government's policy on Aboriginal **welfare** is a piecemeal affair, with no apparent direction or control and I think, the report tabled by the former Minister proves my contention.

* In previous debates I have mentioned what I think is a definite need in the field of Aboriginal **welfare**.

* -I know the honourable gentleman to be most solicitous of the **welfare** of his constituents.

* -The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:  (1)1 understand that in September 1 978 the United States Department of Health, Education and **Welfare** (DHEW) began an extensive campaign to promote the seeking of second opinions before surgery, particularly for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.

* While the Government was stimulating the private sector, cutbacks were occurring in health, education and **welfare** areas of the Budget.

* Education showed a continual shift to the non-government schools, and in **welfare** there was a freezing of many of the extra benefits; for example, supplementary benefits which have been unchanged since this Government has been in power.

* They there has been simply the fact that the electorate looks very seriously at reductions, particularly at reductions in the **welfare** area.

* -I turn to **welfare**.

* A 9.6 per cent increase on last year's expenditure is proposed in terms of **welfare** expenditures with a 10 per cent inflation rate expected at least.

* We have seen a massive cut in **welfare** housing buildings with 93,000 families now on the waiting list.

* I suggest to the Government that it look at some of the articles that have been published dealing with its own social **welfare** program and the comments of people like Professor Downing on its proposals for compensation schemes and expenditure on a national superannuation scheme and on whether we can justify that sort of expenditure when there are other people in the community with real needs.

* This provides a clear indication to young Australians that this Government has a concern for their **welfare** and that it will not put a mortgage on their future opportunities just to solve our present economic problems.

* It is a case of pontics before the **welfare** of the nation.

* One might have come, to expect from this Government by now that when it brings down social **welfare** legislation of this kind it would present to the Parliament some kind of social survey of the community indicating the basis - of need, where it is located and what kind of methods are going to be used to meet the need.

* One would have imagined that in a piece of **welfare** legislation of this kind we would have been setting out in some way to remedy the deficiencies, or the most obvious deficiencies, that exist.

* **Welfare** workers attached to Meals on Wheels services in my own area have indicated to me that they would be strongly in support of the provision of meals at such centres.

* People who are involved in this business of providing Meals on Wheels, particularly **welfare** officers who are employed by such services, feel that a lot more should be done to advertise the existence of Meals on Wheels services, not only to attract good civic minded people to come and help in the provision of such meals but also to bring this service to the notice of a great many more people.

* The point was made to me also by these liaison officers and **welfare** officers that provision ought to be made for a good deal more communication and discussion between **welfare** officers and the like from different areas.

* It was called the Old Peoples **Welfare** Council.

* The **welfare** officers do not feel that this is sufficient.

* As the extent of this service apparently will build up, they believe that there ought to be more opportunity for discussion and liaison between **welfare** officers so that they might get ideas about how each of them runs his or her service, how the services are financed and how volunteers are attracted to carry out the work.

* Just recently the honourable members for Capricornia  (Dr Everingham),  Bendigo  (Mr Kennedy)  and myself, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party's **welfare** committee, went to Newcastle to have a look at the scheme operating there.

* I indicated before that the Government had gone off half-cocked on many of these **welfare** schemes.

* The Commonwealth offered a 50% subsidy for services that cared for people in their own homes, a subsidy towards the building and extension of senior citizens centres, provision of **welfare** officers to be employed at such centres, the provision of para-medical services for old people, such as chiropody services, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy.

* So over the last 2 financial years, an average of $3 75m has been spent on **welfare** housing.

* The provision of funds for **welfare** housing was one of the major achievements in the changing of resource allocation in our economy.

* One of the major reasons for that situation is that the acquisition of a home, particularly in New South 
This matter was discussed within the Cabinet of the previous Government and it was thought that if it was necessary to make more funds available to the public sector in the field of **welfare** housing those funds would be made available if resources, men and material were available.

* But of course we know that the last thing that the present Government would ever do would be to increase government expenditure, particularly in the field of **welfare** housing.

* I think that in the long term, if money continues to flow from the Australian Government to the State Governments, the **welfare** housing program will receive a much better deal.

* It is my personal view that the sector that will suffer greatly under the present Administration will be not only the public sector but also the **welfare** sector which is a most needy sector in our community.

* The Bill provides that interim payments may be made for **welfare** housing under the authority of section 5 of the Financial Agreement Act 1928 as advances supplementary to the advances under the approved Loan Council program.

* I believe that a stimulus to the public sector, particularly in the **welfare** area, would provide a stimulus to the economy.

* I present the Second Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health entitled 'Consultative Arrangements and the Co-ordination of Social Policy Development'.

* Honourable members will recall that the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  tabled the First Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health on 17 February 1977.

* This second and last report of the Task Force covers those terms of reference not reported on in the First Report and makes recommendations in these major areas: Firstly, it recommends a new approach to consultative arrangements across the fields of health, **welfare** and community development involving the establishment of a new national consultative council; secondly, better co-ordination of social policy development through a small social policy unit for a separate department under a senior Minister and a Cabinet committee with a supporting officials committee; and finally, the need for a review of co-ordination of health, **welfare** and community development services in the mainland Territories.

* On 19 December 1977 the Prime Minister announced that a social **welfare** policy secretariat would be established and that it would work through a Committee of Permanent Heads to the Social **Welfare** Policy Committee of Cabinet.

* The Government has decided that the new Secretariat should be responsible, through the Permanent Heads Committee to the Cabinet Committee, for follow-up, as necessary, of any outstanding matters on the First Report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* I have no doubt that that policy pursued is in the great interests of the **welfare** of our economy and of the Australian people.

* Despite a weak and ineffective attempt to discredit the Budget, they have found it difficult, if not impossible, to launch an assault upon this Government's imaginative and comprehensive range of **welfare** provisions.

* All 3 Bills should be seen against the backdrop of the work at present being carried out by the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission and the proposed Australian assistance plan.

* The inclusion of home care services, the building of senior citizens centres and the employment of **welfare** officers in association with these centres could only be applauded as one of the more enlightened concepts of the previous Administration.

* It is to be tragically observed by all who concern themselves in community **welfare**.

* I do, however, share the Minister's concern regarding the restrictive use of such centres and would earnestly hope that practical **welfare** and paramedical services could increasingly become a major factor in their development.

* Finally, I should like to comment on the amending legislation regarding the Federal Government's subsidy increase from one-half to two-thirds of the salaries paid io **welfare** officers.

* I am, however, far from satisfied with the piecemeal manner in which social workers or **welfare** officers are subsidised within the range of the related subjects of immigration, repatriation, social security and other social **welfare** needs.

* To obtain a subsidy this municipality must, like all others similarly placed, meet the requirements and restrictions which are appropriate to the various departments sponsoring **welfare** programs.

* I am, of course, aware that other municipalities have, notwithstanding the difficulties I have mentioned, appointed social workers and **welfare** officers to work in the general field.

* I must, however, concede that a more integrated program of **welfare** services, such as that outlined in the Australian Assistance Plan prepared by the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission recently tabled in the House, is likely to be much more beneficial to the municipality I have instanced.

* to the creation of a society which offers equality of opportunity, security and assistance to those who suffer from special disabilities ... we want to create a system of **welfare** services and benefits which is not class tainted and whose provisions are not stigmatised as charitable concessions to the deserving poor.

* I must confess to some difficulties in understanding what the basic aims and goals of the present Government are in the fields of social **welfare**, health, and related areas.

* The record of this Government during a period of nowprolonged recession portrays an incredible insensitivity to the social consequences of Government economic decisions and has been marked by the beginning of the process of running down **welfare** services, which honourable members will remember was the characteristic trait of the Menzies years, of the 23 years of Liberal rule which preceded the Whitlam Government.

* It cannot be stressed often enough in this chamber that in 1972 Australia was one of the poorest served countries in the developed world in terms of access to health, education and **welfare** services.

* According to a publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development entitled  Public Expenditure Trends,  published in June this year, in the early 1960s Australia was spending 9.6 per cent of its gross domestic product on public **welfare**, compared with the average for OECD countries of 13.2 per cent.

* At that time no other countries, with the exception of Greece and Japan, were spending less on public **welfare**, which included health, education and social security expenditures.

* In the early 1970s, despite the so-called 'extravagance' of the Labor Government, Australia was spending only 12.8 per cent of its GDP on public **welfare** expenditures, compared with an OECD average expenditure of 18.8 per cent.

* This Bill, which repeals the Sheltered Employment (Assistance) Act and the Handicapped Children (Assistance) Act, consolidates and extends the Australian Government's programs of assistance to voluntary organisations that have assumed responsibility for the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* The broad details of the new measures were contained in an announcement I made earlier this year, when I outlined a 1 5-point program for the **welfare** of handicapped people.

* Although the Australian Government provides for the general economic **welfare** of the disabled, it is the voluntary organisations that are able to help, in a way not always possible for a Government department, in the personal day-to-day care of many mentally or physically handicapped people.

* In regard to the vital rail projects further out along the eastern rail route the Victorian Government was insufficiently interested in the **welfare** of the people of that area to provide the Bureau of Transport Economics with the information on which alone an allocation of funds could responsibly be provided.

* The Social **Welfare** Commission in its report entitled 'Project Care- Children Parents Community' put greater emphasis on the urgent need for good quality custodial care and other childhood services, especially for those in greatest need.

* As pointed out by the paper on family **welfare** published by the Social **Welfare** Commission, Australia lacks a coherent family policy.

* How many graduates have enrolled to undertake Ph.D. courses in (a) physics, (b) chemistry, (c) biology, (d) geology (e) geography, (f) psychology, (g) social **welfare** and (h) mathematics at each university in Australia in each of the last 10 years?

* I pay a tribute to the local **welfare** committees in these areas.

* They will help the progress and development of Aboriginal people; they will help also in providing housing and Aboriginal **welfare**.

* This can be advanced into our Aboriginal population - I feel it cannot go very quickly but still it is going - and these people deserve a pat on the back for the efforts they along with the **welfare** committees in these places are making.

* Such work includes water supplies for villages; construction of classrooms; electrification of hamlets; construction and improvement of hospitals; the building of 500 houses for regional force soldiers and their dependants; miles of road construction; medical assistance; and education, agricultural and social **welfare** work in many different areas of the province.

* Who are the members of the Broadmeadows **Welfare** Advisory Committee and what organisations do they represent.

* This motion calls for expenditure in respect of social **welfare** benefits.

* This Government has been accused of spending too much, particularly on social **welfare**.

* Of course the simple fact of the matter as everybody knows is that more has been done for social **welfare** beneficiaries under this Government than was done under any previous government.

* In my view our whole scheme of social **welfare** needs to be much more flexible.

* But at the same time we are getting various calls not only in the matter of social **welfare** but also in relation to education, primary producers, secondary industry, the promoting of exports, the building of houses and in the alleviating of problems of those people who suffer from natural disasters.

* This Budget also engages in the dangerous tactics of cutting expenditure on **welfare** and pennypinching in its expenditure on socially disadvantaged groups.

* The Government's mentality and priority in relation to **welfare** housing demonstrate clearly that it has set out not only to create great problems within the housing sector but also to aggravate severely the enormous suffering and social problems within the Australian community.

* Its attack is so brutal that it can be understood only by examining the amount of expenditure on **welfare** housing as a percentage of all Government outlays.

* In the 1974-75 Budget $385m was spent on **welfare** housing, or 2.16 per cent of Government outlays.

* This year, $330m will be spent on **welfare** housing, representing 1.1 per cent of Government outlays.

* The first was payments to or for the States, the second was **welfare**, the third was development and the fourth was assistance to industry and so on.

* The next section worthy of mention is that of **welfare**.

* Of course, many honourable members on this side of the Committee and on the other side have a great deal to say about the national **welfare** section of the Budget Papers.

* This year the increase in the **welfare** field is an additional $131m over the figures of 1969-70.

* So, in the 2 areas that I have mentioned - Commonwealth payments to or for the States and the **welfare** section - there has been a grand total of increase of expenditure over the last year of $422m.

* Repayments received from autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations, and overseas aid recipients were negligible.

* Grants to autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations and overseas aid recipients totalled $169m in 1968-69, while transfer payments in the form of cash benefits to persons, subsidies to enterprises and other overseas contributions were $1,664 million.

* Advances to autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations and overseas aid recipients were negligible in 1968-69.

* He mentioned **welfare** housing but did not mention the amount of the reduction in expenditure on **welfare** housing in Tasmania.

* Public housing or so-called **welfare** housing allocations in the Budget have been reduced by $69m.

* Some time before the Budget the Minister for Housing and Construction announced that there would be no cutback to the States for their **welfare** housing purposes.

* The cutback in **welfare** housing therefore will affect very seriously those on low incomes and those presently without accommodation.

* The purpose of **welfare** advances to the States is to assist in this area, and the reduction in these advances in the Budget has meant that the housing commissions will be unable to continue at the same rate to build housing or rental accommodation for low income earners.

* Section 5 of the National **Welfare** Fund Act, 1943-52, appropriates moneys required to pay age pensions and associated allowances at the rates authorised by the Social Services Act 1947- 72.

* The reasoning behind them have no sound basis, they are prejudicial and reveal an appalling lack of thought given to the value of the services provided by civil aviation to Australia 's economic **welfare** and development.

* This leads me to the general principle, but a false belief, adopted by some people that, because a country devotes a certain percentage of its gross national product to social **welfare** payments, the people of that country are better off.

* I think that a distinction must be drawn between a person's **welfare** in absolute terms and a person's **welfare** in relative terms.

* There is no doubt that if a high percentage of a country's GNP is devoted to **welfare** in relative terms it could be said that those people are better off than are other people in the community.

* But if, because of the overall financial policies of the government of a country, that country stagnates and real improvements in standards of living and **welfare** do not proceed as promised or as hoped, the actual **welfare** of those people in absolute terms is slipping behind all the time.

* But the comparison was made that the people who were complaining - industrial workers, particularly in the Los Angeles area - in absolute terms were far better off and were achieving an improvement in **welfare** at a faster rate than were the average workers in Britain.

* I agree that it is important to have relative **welfare** within a community.

* But this cannot be achieved with complete disregard for absolute **welfare** and for overall improvements in standards of living in a country which the policy of any government can effectively ruin.

* I think that this story illustrates the difference between absolute improvements in **welfare** and relative improvements in **welfare**.

* States who was making the point that an American worker was better off than his British counterpart because America believed in absolute improvements in **welfare**.

* We have to be careful also that in some areas our social **welfare** payments are just to all in the community and that the penalties we impose on certain sections of our society do not outweigh the justice we are doing to others or, put another way, that we do not give to one section on the one hand and take away from another section on the other.

* We want to remember and this would worry me very much if it happened - that unless we take into account all these aspects when considering an overall social **welfare** policy the same thing could happen here as is happening in at least one other country, at the present time.

* There a backlash has developed against social **welfare** which is now acting to the detriment of those who deserve and need social **welfare**.

* We are talking about $5m in the one instance and a considerably lesser sum in the other instance, the **welfare** officer situation.

* In whole areas of public policy- schools, health, the environment, industrial conditions, the National Estate, social **welfare**, local government- no body of fact or evidence existed.

* A wholly misconceived strategy for dealing with inflation has become a pretext for attacking public **welfare** and social reform- the real targets of the Prime Minister's vengeance and contempt.

* Where do all these economies- these real and illusory and foreshadowed cuts in **welfare** programs and public spending- leave the States?

* It lifts the social **welfare** horizons of our nation and it clearly shows a path ahead under a Liberal and Country Party Government.

* We also have made great concessions in the social **welfare** field.

* This year social **welfare** payments will add an extra $377m to demand.

* We seek to secure the dignity of man by our social **welfare** policies which provide for all those in need.

* I want to refer to social **welfare** and then to taxation.

* The Opposition has challenged our policy on social **welfare**.

* 1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for hospital improvements at the Boddington Women's Hospital submitted by the Boddington Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* Can the Minister give an assurance that the Cabinet's decision will take into consideration the social and **welfare** implications of any economic adjustment to the industry and the decentralised communities it supports?

* In addition, there is one position of Clerical Assistant, Grade 6, **Welfare** Officer, at Alice Springs Hospital in which at least 10 per cent of the occupant's time is spent dealing with clients in a language other than English.

* Such a situation will lead to considerable effects in relation to the provision of **welfare** housing.

* More rental accommodation is needed, not less, if the waiting lists for **welfare** housing are to be reduced on an overall basis.

* There is a need to establish a uniform minimum standard for **welfare** housing, regardless of the State in which a person in need may live.

* Housing costs account for a large proportion of the income of tenants of **welfare** housing.

* The cost of the rebate would be paid by the Commonwealth Government, just as it now meets the cost of other uniform **welfare** payments.

* Why cannot the Commonwealth meet the same situation across the board as it does in relation to **welfare** payments.

* In 1974-75, $385m was advanced to the States by the Commonwealth for **welfare** housing.

* I have shown in written form the real value of the money for **welfare** housing this financial year.

* We had the Social **Welfare** Commission's report of about 1975 and a year or so later this Government appointed a task force to comment on that.

* We have offered them money for a variety of social **welfare** purposes and again some States, particularly New South Wales and Queensland and to a lesser extent, I think, Victoria, have not taken up these offers and the people go without.

* I mention in this context the effect of interest rates on housing, which is a social **welfare** area.

* Galbraith who, as I mentioned, is the apostle of the more modern theory I referred to, argues that Budget policies are similarly non-selective - at least as they are practised by non-Labor governments - that they are capable of selection, but in the areas of resource allocation and the setting of appropriate social and **welfare** priorities these budgetary policies have been remiss.

* What are the social **welfare** proposals within that necessary economic constraint of expenditure?

* I have been intrigued to hear this afternoon the similarity between the proposals put forward by the Opposition and the proposals for a social **welfare** programme made by the Opposition's other partner in power, the Austraiian Council of Trade Unions.

* It has neglected the economic analysis, with a fair assessment of how appropriate social **welfare** is to social justice within the context of the Australian economy.

* A social **welfare** policy can be pursued only with a certain type of social engineering.

* The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Donald Cameron)  pointed out that the growth in the Australian work force has been a most significant engine to enable social **welfare** development to proceed.

* I regret very much that, as the very basis for the determination of a social **welfare** policy, the Opposition has adopted policies with respect to Australian family codes and immigration, which is itself an addition to the work force, which run counter to every tradition that we have had in Australia.

* That Party talks about social **welfare** and redistributist responsibilities while at the very base and soul of Australia's development it has adopted principles which are contrary to 70 years of its own history.

* These are involved in social **welfare** policies.

* They may be outside the precise considerations of the National **Welfare** Fund but they are concerned in Australian social **welfare**.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees 'hat have crossed the border into India.

* the parties have considered a reconciliation with the assistance of a marriage counsellor, an approved marriage guidance organization or some other suitable person or organization nominated by the Director of Counselling and **Welfare**; or 

 (Mr Enderby)-In sub-clause (6) (a) after '**Welfare**', insert' of the Family Court'.

* The Australian Assistance Plan, which is a program for community based regional social **welfare** programs administered at the local level, retains a high priority with the Government.

* I resent and reject strongly the efforts of the spokesman for the Opposition on **welfare** matters, the honourable member for Hotham, to denigrate this very important initiative- 
The Committee was set up to advise the Government on the proper measures needed to facilitate desirable structural changes in the Australian economy, particularly in the areas of adjustment assistance, training and relocation, and social security and **welfare**.

* -There has recently been both parliamentary and public comment on the principles of **welfare** disbursement.

* I believe that it is possible to urge a needs approach to **welfare**, both in the interests of the needy and in the interests, of responsible budgetary management.

* From the time I made my maiden speech in this place 1 have constantly said that we go about this objective in the wrong way- in a way which is against the best interests of the disadvantaged- by moving increasingly towards universal **welfare**.

* This tendency towards universal **welfare** is rather new.

* Firstly, the universal method of disbursing **welfare** funds leads to Budget inflexibility.

* Secondly, selectivity permits a greater concentration of **welfare** resources on the needy and may allow those resources to be paid at a higher level and also to be protected from inflation, neither of which can be achieved with universally paid benefits because it is too costly.

* Thirdly, needs based **welfare** would certainly mean that society could be permitted to lower taxation levels, thereby helping to create employment and further increase overall living standards.

* I want to emphasise that we do not require a simple adjustment to **welfare** principles.

* I also think it is quite interesting to note that those who speak out strongly against handouts, high government expenditure and high taxes are so often the same people who receive **welfare** assistance from the Government without being in the kinds of circumstances which make such assistance imperative.

* This is my own view: First of all, the child's **welfare** is paramount.

* I said: 'First of all, the child's **welfare** is paramount, but I cannot possibly be asked to solve that sort of question in this sort of situation'.

* My own position is such that I will take every possible step to ensure Nola's **welfare** in the future.

* Human rights and the **welfare** of the people themselves will be mv first concern.

* They were obliged to admit that those considerations had to be included when one looked at the **welfare** and custody of children and appropriate amendments to that effect were made during the course of the Senate's deliberations on the Bill.

* Under the provisions of the States Grants (Home Care) Act, the Commonwealth pays a subsidy to the States of up to half the salary of approved **welfare** officers who are employed at, or in conjunction with, senior citizens' centres and who are employed wholly or mainly in providing a **welfare** service to aged persons.

* At present the Commonwealth subsidises a total of 1 12 **welfare** officer positions throughout Australia.

* Since October 1975 financial constraints have precluded the approval of new **welfare** officer positions for subsidy under the Act.

* With additional funding provided in the 1978-79 Budget I was recently able to announce that the Commonwealth support could be extended to an additional 79 **welfare** officers bringing the total to 1 9 1 positions.

* In addition the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Galbally Report regarding the appointment of ethnic **welfare** officers to work specifically among the ethnicaged.

* The Government has appropriated $0.1 lm for the salaries of 1 0 new ethnic **welfare** officer positions in 1 978-79; to be followed by five positions in 1 979-80 and 1 980-8 1 .

* Some local government authorities in Victoria have been under a misapprehension that the **welfare** officers whom they employ in accordance with the Act must devote their full time to the **welfare** of aged persons.

* The flexible use of **welfare** officer staff is possible and no change to the guidelines used by my Department is seen to be necessary.

* In the middle 1960s less than 1 1 per cent of the total government outlays were directed towards **welfare** for the aged.

* -Total expenditure on **welfare** for the aged has increased from 1 1 per cent of government outlays to 1 9 per cent.

* The Government and, through it the Australian people, has given that **welfare** to the aged.

* At the present rate of increase between 23 per cent and 24 per cent of total government outlays will be spent on **welfare** for the aged by 1984-85.

* Knowing that there is that justified drawing power in relation to **welfare**, we have heard a confession of the general taxation policy of the Opposition.

* The Leader of the Opposition poured scorn on the late Richard Crosland who argued that **welfare** could be delivered by means of greater economic growth; that greater economic growth would generate the resources that were able to be redistributed.

* It is not surprising, therefore, that at the Australian Labor Party Conference in Adelaide on 18 July 1979, having listened to the Opposition's oil policy which was decided subsequent to the discussions on economic policy, the Premier of New South Wales said: 
I can well appreciate the honourable gentleman's concern about the reports because I suppose that nobody has illustrated greater concern for **welfare** housing than he has.

* New South Wales will receive for **welfare** housing in this financial year an amount of $123,41 1,000.

* So the criticism of this Government's provision for **welfare** housing has come about as a result of an increase of 122 per cent in the amount actually allocated as compared with 1971-72.

* Last year the Australian Government advanced amounts to the States for **welfare** housing that were consistent with their capacity to spend the funds; in other words, every cent that they could spend was allocated to them.

* In 1973-74 the New South Wales Government had to carry over an amount of $ 17m which had been allocated for **welfare** housing because it did not have the capacity or the ability to spend it.

* The New South Wales Government has shown over a period of time that it has severely neglected the people in need of **welfare** housing, particularly in respect of community services.

* In particular, they are detrimental to the **welfare** of the women who are dependent on this shelter.

* The South Australian Community **Welfare** Minister,  Mr Payne,  said in State Parliament: 
The next point that I want to make before dealing at some length with the proposal is that while we on the Opposition side of the House do not oppose the amendments, this should in no way be interpreted as an indication that we wholeheartedly endorse what has been proposed.

* The improvement involved in the amendments is only minuscule in comparison with the needs for major overhaul in social service and social **welfare** provisions in the community.

* This is especially so if the structure of the social **welfare** programme is to penetrate into the heart of what is called the poverty environment and overcome want and deficiency, and to help people to lift themselves up and participate at a level in the economy which will give them self respect and adequacy.

* The rigidity of the present system of social services and the discontinuities in the various forms of social **welfare** facilities available only consolidate people in the area of poverty and in the marginal area near that threshold.

* For anyone with a sense of moral commitment for the **welfare** of one's fellow beings in the community who are in an area of want, we have what should be an intolerable situation.

* It is just as well for the physical and mental **welfare** of the Minister that I proceed beyond these notes.

* This leaves only $3.09 a week for food, clothing and travel, including travel to the nursing home, because obviously one spouse, who is not committed to an institution, will want to visit his or her mate to see how that mate is proceeding and how that mate's **welfare** stands.

* Only 1 child in 13 in Australia is able to attend a child **welfare** centre which is up to government standards.

* Indeed, the Opposition would have given wholehearted support to the Government if it had broadened out the debate by proposing to restructure completely the pattern of social **welfare** provided under the Social Services Act.

* She is in the situation where she is not only devoid of financial support from her husband but is having to contribute financially to his **welfare**.

* In future every mother will be able to plan for her family's **welfare**, more confident in the knowledge that a Reserve Bank cheque will be paid direct to her in accordance with the scale.

* The Citizens Advisory Service also acts as a focus for other **welfare** services.

* Central Coast Social and **Welfare** Co-ordination Council  (Question No.

* Here the overwhelming part of the gross product is comprised of wages and salaries paid to government employees in such areas as education, health, law, **welfare** and so on.

* Pensions and **welfare** are relative.

* The weekly pension figure tells only half the story of the **welfare** of a pensioner.

* Opposition: Do they not think that the price of things that people have to pay for, legislation dealing with social **welfare** and the numerous Bills that we have before the Parliament are equally as important as this issue.

* This assistance is useful because a number of organisations are working in various social and sporting fields, undertaking **welfare** work and the like.

* What sum specifically for capital expenditure has the Commonwealth (including its banks) in the last financial year (a) spent, (b) transferred as grants or loans direct to (i) State, local or semigovernment authorities, (ii) autonomous health, education and **welfare** organisations and overseas recipients and (iii) private industry, including all compensation and capital subsidies and price support to private industry except by way of relief of temporary natural disasters, and (c) received, as grants or loans, from other countries.

* Its fundamental tenet supposedly is the freedom of the individual, but it is highly noticeable that in its application it would not only preserve but also would greatly extend the **welfare** and influence of the most privileged sections of our society.

* There can be no denying that the Fraser philosophy is more concerned with corporate **welfare** than with social **welfare**, more concerned with preserving the economic system than with preserving the people it victimises, more concerned with the promotion of selfish acquisitive values than with the humanitarian values such as concern for one's fellow-man.

* The relatively low incidence of direct taxation in Australia was reflected in government expenditure on such items as education and **welfare**, or was until this Government came to office.

* The same picture emerges in relation to **welfare**.

* In a scathing attack on Australia 's appalling disregard for social **welfare**, the London  Financial Times  of 10 March 1971 showed that the proportion of Australia's gross domestic product expended on **welfare** was appallingly low in comparison with other developed countries.

* His program, in order to have any semblance of economic responsibility, would have to tear the heart out of the Government's education, **welfare**, health and urban development and recreation programs that are designed to provide equality of opportunity, income security, good health and a more pleasant environment for all.

* The destruction of programs which have this aim would substantially impair the living standards of the overwhelming majority of wage earners, **welfare** recipients and their families in Australia.

* Sometimes people on this side of the chamber are presented as being raving radicals who, when they argue for the rights of the unemployed, for example, are somehow taking a position which cannot be defended on rational grounds, a position which is not supported by groups which have status and standing and which represent all the **welfare** interests in Australia, certainly in the voluntary sector and partially in the government sector.

* I want to quote at some length from a statement issued, after the introduction of the Budget, by the Australian Council of Social Service, a body which represents **welfare** organisations throughout Australia.

* I sometimes shudder when elderly people come into my office and tell me that they are re&lt;-c&gt;v  -r&gt;  n social **welfare** pension and have to pay $20 or $30 a week to live in some room &lt;.-.

* I do not accept the proposition that **welfare** agencies in the Australian community or the aged people who are dependent upon this program are representative of the soft society, that this measure is necessary so that people will be saved from the moral degradation which flows from being victims of the soft society.

* The community **welfare** agencies which very grandly and proudly maintain these sorts of services, will find that financial assistance which we would have provided- we would have guaranteed that the program would have been finished in less than 3 years- in fact may not come within 5 or 6 years.

* It is significant that the first **welfare** initiative by the Government was to reintroduce the superphosphate bounty for wealthy graziers like the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser).

* When I was Minister for Social Security I used to sit on the front bench at question time and wonder why I received so few questions from the then Opposition- the LiberalNational Country Parties- on such a range of important **welfare** issues for which I was responsible.

* In all these **welfare** issues that have been debated in the Parliament, I have noted that he has derived great hilarity from the concern expressed by the members of the Opposition about people affected by the discrimination and the unfairness of the burden which has been imposed on these sections of the community.

* This Bill moves into the area of the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States for the provision of **welfare** housing and assistance to the States in the housing area.

* The editorial states: 

 Mr Newman claims that **welfare** housing benefits are being misused and the whole system exploited.

* The traditional form of **welfare** housing in Australia is that the Federal Government channels money to the States, which then use housing commissions as construction and allocation agencies.

* Many of these tenants are reliant upon Commonwealth social security and **welfare** payments and, indeed, are in need of assistance in providing a home for their families.

* For example, it had considerable exposure to the education system, to other churches, to the American political system, to the media generally, to the social **welfare** organisations, to the legal system generally and to lawyers, and somehow it never failed the test.

* We can only conclude that in the current Budget the **welfare** voices in the Cabinet were not heard.

* The Government allows that to happen and then does not correct its mistakes in the social **welfare** side of the Budget.

* In the last Budget the amount allocated to Aboriginal **welfare** rose from $3 1.3m to $53.2m, an increase of approximately 70 per cent.

* Let me return very briefly to the question of Aborigines deciding primarily the conduct of their **welfare** or future negotiations between themselves and the Commonwealth Government.

* Its purpose is to establish formally the Social **Welfare** Commission and to set out its powers and functions.

* These reports referred to the preparations for a comprehensive Australian social **welfare** assistance plan.

* I believe that in this very important area of social **welfare** for the nation, particularly the provision of assistance at the local level - a concept which is a new and exciting one - it is imperative that this Parliament should give of its time.

* We can work in conjunction with these organisations in regionally planned councils and gain the very best in a social **welfare** scheme.

* In this way the social **welfare** needs of Australia will be released from the heavy hand of centralism that for too long characterised the programs of the past Government.

* I know that the social **welfare** needs of my outer suburban electorate are vastly different from the needs of the electorate of, say, the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Willis),  which is an inner suburban area.

* It is not wide enough to meet the wishes of the Council for Social **Welfare** which has ardently sought a comprehensive survey into social services.

* I remember the Prime Minister, once removed, having said that he was ardently opposed to abolition of the means test and that a lot more attention should be given to those people on the lower rungs of social **welfare**.

* Bill to establish a stable relationship between pensions and an index of community **welfare**.

* It simply means that when people come to your office you have to refer them to the State **Welfare** Branch to get some kind of urgent relief pending the processing of a claim.

* The Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** furnished  a  report on mentally and physically handicapped persons about IS months ago.

* Further, will he urge the same Minister to ensure that the appointment of **welfare** officers by such organisations, as is proposed in the same annual report, is funded by the Government in addition to, and not in lieu of, assistance under the existing migrant social worker grantinaid scheme?

* It is the transfer of funds from the National **Welfare** Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

* I hope that in transferring funds from the National **Welfare** Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund no opportunity is taken to give a false idea of what the deficit would actually be.

* Insofar as the funds which go into the National **Welfare** Fund were originally revenue, they have been invested in treasury bills at some modicum of interest- one per cent or so.

* We have $3, 000m on the statement of the Treasurer  (Mr Lynch);  we have $470m-odd from the National **Welfare** Fund; and $700m will be available under the defence loan procedures.

* The purpose of my speaking tonight is to assist the people of the Kilcoy area and that shire in their appeal to anybody who will help and to Brisbane's Lord Mayor to consider their safety and their **welfare** and to open, certainly under control, the flood gates to get the water level down.

* Because these dams supply water to Brisbane and because they are for flood mitigation for Brisbane, it is no wonder that my people are disturbed, alarmed and incensed at the manner in which their **welfare** has been disregarded and their property damaged and put at risk.

* Much of the current thought on future planning stems from the many recommendations made at a Workshop on Health and Nutrition in Aboriginal Children held in Sydney in December 1969 and which was .attended by representatives of Universities, Public Health Departments and workers from **welfare** and social organisations.

* Other **welfare** organisations have also been contacted.

* There was a lot of correspondence and consultations between the Department of Native **Welfare** and the Department of Health in Western Australia, the AMA and the Commonwealth departments concerned.

* It could provide work in community services, essential services for non-profit making bodies such as community **welfare** agencies or local government bodies.

* The proposals envisage the delegation of wide policy and executive responsibility for important functions such as health, education and **welfare** services, public transport, the Australian Capital Territory police, municipal services, the present government housing operations and many other services of government in the Territory.

* It should be expected that the Government would be looking to the same general processes of refinement in high expenditure areas here including education, **welfare** and health.

* Indeed, it affects the whole economy of the State of Tasmania and the future of the **welfare** of so many of the people of that State.

* 1 make an appeal in this speech for a total freight freeze for the Tasmanian fruit industry and, if not a freight freeze, then a subsidy to protect the economy and **welfare** of the Tasmanian people.

* He went on to say: 
The apple and pear industry in Tasmania has made a very great contribution to the **welfare** of this nation, and the people in that industry want the opportunity to continue to do just that - and they have every right to continue.

* The Government's decision to cut its contribution towards home-help services and the salaries of **welfare** officers employed by local councils would not save money.

* Professor Henderson accused the Government of leading local councils 'up the garden path' by offering subsidies for **welfare** schemes and then not continuing to pay for them once they were operating .

* 'Local government is going to stop providing **welfare** services because it has become fed up being left holding the baby', he said.

* One would have to say that we are a country which, particularly in the **welfare** area, has developed highly complicated and complex structures.

* But we know that in this specific area, the co-ordination of **welfare** services, it is very difficult, for example, to define a homeless population.

* On page 3 these words appear: 
The Minister explained to Parliament that 'the Government is in favour of making the Act more effective in meeting the needs of a wider range of homeless people (but) has not yet reached a decision on the proposals of the Task Force on co-ordination in **welfare** and health, one of which is that is that the homeless persons assistance program should become part of a wider 'sheltered accommodation program', administration of which might be devolved to the State governments'.

* One of the purposes of **welfare** housing or subsidised housing surely must be to provide housing for persons who have great difficulty in purchasing a home.

* During the Government's term of office the number of companies that control the **welfare** and the destiny of millions of people has fallen remarkably.

* The economic **welfare** of the system depends upon the decisions of individuals to invest or not to invest.

* It will mean that the much larger public sector can maintain planned and ongoing investment and **welfare** expenditures, and thereby reducing the vulnerability of the economy as a whole to the stops and starts of international capitalism.

* There is a huge increase in outlays on education, a large outlay on public hospitals, and more funds for **welfare** housing.

* It is a reflection upon the Government's lack of concern for human **welfare** in its over-riding attempt to make cut-backs in expenditure.

* I suggest that money spent on aid is much more conducive to the peace and future **welfare** of this nation than money spent on defence in many respects.

* The new family allowances are probably the most far-reaching **welfare** step taken by any government since Federation.

* I say to all Australians, particularly to social workers and to people in the **welfare** field, that we really care.

* I say that we are more concerned about real **welfare** than any other Parry in Australia.

* Our social **welfare** policy and approach seek to enhance the security, dignity and self-reliance of each individual.

* We therefore welcome the substantial moves in recent years by several States into the provision of more comprehensive family and community **welfare** services .

* much of the administration of **welfare** should be carried out by local communities under the leadership of local governments, but the responsibility for ensuring that no one in any locality is neglected is a State responsibility.

* It is quite clear that the Australian Government has a mandate for the **welfare** of children.

* It has the constitutional facility to provide **welfare** opportunities to children.

* But when members of the Liberal and Country parties come into this chamber they forget about the **welfare** of their constituents.

* It is no wonder that those people whom I have mentioned in the motion, such as Australia's Catholic bishops, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the responsible Minister in Victoria,  Mr Dixon,  and all the social **welfare** agencies throughout Australia, can point to the Government the problems that are being confronted specifically by the young people but not only by them.

* Why should not the Catholic bishops, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and all the other social **welfare** agencies that carry this enormous burden speak up?

* Section 10 of the Social **Welfare** Ordinance provides that it is the duty of the Director of Social **Welfare**, inter alia, to provide such assistance as in his opinion may be necessary or appropriate to promote the physical well-being of persons who, in his opinion, are socially or economically in need of assistance, and to exercise general care in matters affecting their **welfare**.

* Availability of **Welfare** Grant monies- or 'Capitation'- is not an essential requirement for the functioning of Regional Councils.

* It should not be used to make people increasingly dependent on **welfare** systems.

* It aims to slow the rapidly escalating **welfare** budget through activities that: 
start bringing about value changes that will result in a more harmonious community.

* 4 Availability of **Welfare** Grant monies- or Capitation- is not an essential requirement for the functioning of Regional Councils: 4.1 Three year experience by Regional Councils that failed to gain capitation funding has indicated that this in no way precluded effective functioning.

* 5 Lack of certainty regarding the future of Regional Councils is destroying three years effort at establishing community networks: 
It is proposed that a fund of $500,000 be established for Community **Welfare** projects.

* 7 We propose that the Federal and State Governments both acknowledge that Regional Councils facilitate involvement and effectiveness for their programs, and hence should be JOINTLY funded by both levels of Government: 
The Committee considered that the Commonwealth now had to discharge a responsibility of government which did no; exist when the Constitution was originally framed, namely, to safeguard and promote the economic **welfare** of the community of Australia.

* in reply - I should like to commend the Opposition spokesmen on health, the honourable members for Hotham  (Mr Chipp)  and Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth),  and the honourable members for Robertson  (Mr Cohen)  and Holt  (Mr Oldmeadow)  from this side of the House for their thoughtful contributions to the debate on the Social **Welfare** Commission Bill which is now before the House.

* In other words, there will be an effort to tie together comprehensively the **welfare** services which exist and which should and will be developed in the Australian community as a result of the work of this Commission in order to meet the requirements of the people in the community.

* The Opposition spokesman on health and **welfare** matters, the honourable member for Hotham  (Mr Chipp),  raised questions about clauses 7 (4) and 17 (4) of the Bill.

* The case of State members of Parliament was raised in relation to 
This is a very vital aspect in any consideration of what educational programs can contribute in **welfare** services.

* Of course this is much more broad than merely the concept of poverty; it covers generally the requirements of people who call upon **welfare** services where there is some sort of attendant educational requirement.

* I concur with his assertions about the valuable role of voluntary agencies in the maintenance of any community based **welfare** program.

* It is not a program, as was suggested unkindly by the honourable member for Indi, to centralise **welfare** programs at Canberra but rather it is a program for the Australian Government to take up responsibility to fund adequately the development of these programs out in the community - out in the regions where people live - but more importantly to have those people, as much as this is possible, identify what are the priorities in those areas.

* In other words we are aiming at a very flexible approach to the development of this program in the community - an approach which will encourage people rather than push them towards achieving the objectives which will best serve the needs of the community in the provision of social **welfare** programs.

* State governments are made up of good men and true who have regard for public **welfare**.

* It can come only from health, education and **welfare** spending which together make up nearly half of the Budget expenditure.

* That is a figure which has no regard for the present economic and employment situation in Australia and which certainly has no regard for the way in which we will see to their **welfare** once they get here.

* Certainly we did not do enough but we were working on significant new directions in migrant **welfare** and community relations when the present Government conned its way into office on the pretext that it could run everything much better.

* That was the real ethnic affairs branch of the 
The Government is going through a public relations exercise of establishing concurrently 2 experimental migrant resource centres, one in Melbourne, which is to be operated under contract by the Australian Greek **Welfare** Society, and one in Sydney.

* Those centres are supposed to provide all sorts of services to migrants, to assist social workers and **welfare** officers, and to draw attention to the particular problems of ethnic communities and individual migrants requiring government action.

* They tended to form tightly-knit communities but they were diligent and thrifty, and they had an uncommon regard for the **welfare** of their children.

* Instead of some indication that the Government will assist the many children and adults with learning difficulties the Treasurer offers the prospect of further massive reductions in social **welfare** expenditure.

* Some of the important matters which the States administer include housing, decentralisation, urban development, education, health, social **welfare** and transport.

* He has attempted to undertake this therapy by doing **welfare** work in the service of others.

* He was the  President  and  Chairman  of **Welfare** of all branches of 'Shiralee' the association for divorced, separated and deserted men and women.

* He was also a contact and **welfare** offiicer of the Good Neighbour Council of South Australia.

* He has also assisted with other types of **welfare** services in the community.

* The position is that this gentleman is not allowed to claim, for taxation purposes, any of the money he has spent on doing **welfare** work for others in the community.

* I think that one ought to recognise that for 23 years there was a Liberal Party government in this country which certainly did not talk about multi-culturalism, which certainly did not introduce programs on migrant education, which certainly did not support centres like the Ecumenical Migration Centre or the Migrants Clearing House and which left voluntary agencies with limited resources to fight alone in the whole field of migration **welfare**.

* But, having said that, one ought to recognise that migrant **welfare** cannot be separated from the whole question of the **welfare** of the community in general.

* State Ministers who criticise the level of advances provided by the Commonwealth for **welfare** housing conveniently ignore the range of funding sources provided under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement.

* The total Commonwealth advances of $3 16m this year, would make possible total State expenditure on **welfare** housing of the same order as in 1 977-78.

* I am just as concerned as the States are about housing, and about **welfare** housing, but let us look at the facts and see what capacity the States have.

* So the States themselves do have the capacity to direct further funds to housing, and to **welfare** housing in particular.

* I want to indicate briefly that the total amount of funds available for **welfare** housing in the States is at least as good as last year, on the figures we have.

* He said that the Government is ignoring health schemes, social security programs, **welfare** and so on.

* Following the increased allocation in the Budget for expenditure under the States Grants (Home Care) Act, all outstanding applications by State governments for new **welfare** officer positions and new home care services could be approved.

* It also will need increased money to pay for the city's **welfare** worker.

* She said that the cutbacks would mean that councils would have to raise rates to maintain the quality of existing services and that the Federal Government was paying lip service to the needs of **welfare** while taking money away from it.

* We stand at the cross-roads in many respects in the provision of **welfare** services.

* One of the by-products of the Labor Party's unfortunate difficulties was that much **welfare** housing was cut back and that in turn helped to cut back some of the building industry activity itself.

* Nowadays we need to ensure that we spend our money on **welfare** matters in the best way.

* It has a massive problem facing it in getting the economy going and directing **welfare** to areas of need.

* The total **welfare** package is being developed by this Government to ensure that compassion is maintained.

* Ten per cent of Commonwealth revenue to local government for general activities which now include social **welfare**, health, conservation and other community needs.

* Royal Commission or other form of public enquiry into Australia's social **welfare** structure that Australia may be brought into line with accepted world standardsof the most advanced countries.

* I have discussed these matters with  Mr Knox  at a Liberal Party convention in Queensland where I made it quite plain that if the Queensland Government wanted to devote more of its own funds to public works and **welfare** housing it had the capacity to do so and it could have done so.

* But if the Queensland Government believed that it was a higher priority to put more funds into **welfare** housing or other public works, it was entitled to make that judgment.

* 1 ) How many social **welfare** workers are there in each State and Territory.

* What is the ratio of population to social **welfare** workers in each municipality of each State and in each Territory.

* What is considered a desirable ratio of population to social **welfare** workers.

* On the one hand we have allegations that there have been cut-backs in social **welfare**.

* On the other hand we have assertions from some interest groups that social **welfare** spending is out of control.

* On the one hand groups are saying that there have been cut-backs and condemning the Government for the cut-backs and heartlessness; on the other hand, curiously, other groups are saying exactly the oppositethat social social **welfare** spending is out of control.

* In Australia over the past 10 years, expenditure on social security and **welfare** has increased almost sevenfold, from $1.3 billion in 1969-70 to $5 billion in 1975-76, and to an estimated $8.9 billion in 1979-80.

* Even if adjustments are made for spending on family allowances, unemployment and sickness benefits, expenditure on social security and **welfare** as a proportion of the Commonwealth Budget has increased from 18 per cent in 1975-76 to 2 1 per cent in 1979-80.

* In the past three financial years some $ 1 15.5m has been spent under the handicapped persons **welfare** program.

* In short, those who say that they are opposed to the cutbacks in the social security budget and in social **welfare** spending generally should specify where those cutbacks have been made and say how much they would increase expenditure in those areas and how the revenue to cover the increased expenditure should be raised.

* On the other hand, those who say that social **welfare** expenditure is out of control, ought to specify where the surpluses are in current expenditure and be prepared to publicly justify cuts when the inevitable criticism comes to government for having taken drastic action to cut back expenditure.

* I believe that this Government has adopted a realistic attitude to its responsibilities in the social **welfare** area.

* In two areas- health and **welfare**- the cost to this nation approaches $ 1 1 billion.

* In other words, about 85 per cent of all personal income tax collected in Australia is spent on health and **welfare**.

* It will not be possible to initiate **welfare** initiatives such as family allowances to a satisfactory level and it will not be possible to index such benefits regularly in order to preserve the real value of those benefits.

* This anomalous situation occurs when selectivity based on need is ignored as the basis of disbursing **welfare** funds.

* So we have a situation where I consider it quite necessary, if we are to preserve equity and indulge in responsible budgetary management at the same time, for **welfare** payment to be more closely associated with a needs basis than is presently the case.

* I implore him to pay attention to those people in his electorate who, I understand, have visited his office from time to time, have written letters to him from time to time and are disgusted because he will not pay attention to their needs as far as social **welfare** is concerned.

* We are a party to international covenants on social **welfare** and the like.

* Can he say what is the comparative staffing in the field of other Departments working in social and **welfare** fields with Aboriginal people.

* On 3 April 1973 I announced that Cabinet had that day approved the establishment of a Commission on Social **Welfare** to make recommendations to the Government on the development of social **welfare** in Australia.

* The need  for setting up the Social **Welfare** Commission is based on the new emphasis we have given to the recognition of adequate **welfare** systems as being a public right which contributes to the well-being of the total Australian community.

* This new philosophy demands a change of emphasis in government policy and in **welfare** programs.

* Because of the new dignity which such a philosophy gives to the recipients of **welfare** services, it is the role of the Commission to evolve strategies which will enable those people in the problem - situation to take part in the planning of immediate objective and long-term goals.

* Moreover it is the role of the Commission to monitor existing programs, institute research projects, conduct public consultations and to ensure that those who use the **welfare** services are involved in the evaluation of the relevance of **welfare** programs to their needs.

* In developing new goals, implementing long term planning and setting priorities in the **welfare** field, the Commission is charged with the task of taking an overall view of social policy, which encompasses such areas as education, housing, health services, emplovment policies and other matters, as well as the more specific issues of income-security payments and personal **welfare** services.

* The concept and role of the Social **Welfare** Commission is a most exciting one.

* In future there will be a rational development of **welfare** programs in the community.

* When the Australian Assistance Plan is fully operational - the Commission is drafting the plan and will test pilot programs and evaluate the need for alternative and supplemental measures - the social **welfare** needs of Australia will be released from the heavy hand of centralism which defined programs in the past.

* I would assert quite firmly that the development of social **welfare** programs in this country to date has been blighted by the way in which past governments as a matter of centralised decision-making determined priorities^ - and not many priorites at that either - and then by implication indicated to the community that if areas were either unsuitable or had no need for these particular programs that was tough luck; they missed out altogether.

* Accordingly the response to the **welfare** needs of these regions has been inadequate and often irrelevant.

* I should also mention that when the Australian Assistance Plan - now being developed by the Government - is fully operational, community based voluntary **welfare** services will be fostered and stimulated with generous sup- port so that the services provided and the organisations providing them are related to, and are identified with, the community in which they operate.

* The only display of centralism in this exercise is the display of responsible decision-making by the Australian Government which has established the Social **Welfare** Commission and which in turn directed the Commission to develop the Australian Assistance Plan according to guidelines set down by the Government in order that the administration and operation of social **welfare** programs and key decisionmaking affecting their direction are very much a local community concern.

* To ascertain, and report to the Minister on, the social **welfare** needs of the community and to make recommendations to the Minister in respect of those needs.

* To make recommendations to the Minister for furthering the achievement of a nationally integrated social **welfare** plan, including: 
Recommendations of priorities in relation to social **welfare** programs.

* Recommendations for the development of social **welfare** programs on a regional basis with localised administration.

* Recommendations for the participation in the implementation of social **welfare** programs of representatives of the persons or agencies to be assisted.

* Recommendations for the co-ordination of the social **welfare** activities of organisations, including State, local government and voluntary organisations, involved in the provision of social **welfare**.

* Recommendations for the adjustment, from time to time, of social **welfare** programs in the light of changing community circumstances and attitudes and the state of the economy.

* Recommendations for avoiding the duplication of social **welfare** programs and for promoting the maximum efficiency and effectiveness of the community social **welfare** effort.

* To estimate, and report to the Minister on, the likely cost of proposed social **welfare** programs and to advise the Minister on the relative priorities to be given to the implementation of those programs.

* To keep social **welfare** programs under constant review and to re-assess and evaluate those programs in the light of experience.

* To propose to the Minister measures to give all organisations, including State, local government and voluntary organisations, concerned with social **welfare** access to available information and technical assistance.

* To consider, and report to the Minister on, measures designed to provide skilled staff for the successful implementation of social **welfare** programs.

* Such other functions in connection with social **welfare** programs as the Minister approves.

* The aim of the Australian Assistance Plan is to assist in the development at a regional level, within a nationally co-ordinated framework, of integrated patterns of **welfare** services, complementary to income support programs and the **welfare** related aspects of health, education, housing, employment, migration and other social policies.

* 1 prepared by the Interim Committee of the Social **Welfare** Commission which I tabled in the House on- 30 August 1973.

* These public reports will serve as a standard by which the Australian people will be able to judge the Government's performance in the social **welfare** area having regard to the information provided and the recommendations made to it in the Commission's reports.

* The establishment of the Social **Welfare** Commission is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to introduce democratic participation into national government.

* But we are confident that the work of the Commission - which will facilitate informed public discussion of **welfare** needs and priorities - will be invaluable in devising new policies and the establishment of a better social **welfare** system for all Australians.

* I ) Has a decision been made on assistance for purchasing equipment for the Nyabing St John Ambulance Association submitted by the Kent Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* He was mesmerised into thinking that it was about Budget deficits which are now being diverted not to **welfare** but to pad the pockets of wealthy graziers and mining corporations.

* The percentage of gross national expenditure devoted by Australia to social **welfare** has fallen since 1961-62 from 3.84 per cent to 3.2 per cent.

* Whereas at the beginning of the century Australia led the world in the introduction of noncontributory age pensions, she now lags far behind comparable countries in **welfare** measures of every kind.

* **Welfare** services in Australia will not operate with maximum effect until their efficiency and relevance are made a subject of public scrutiny and review.

* New **welfare** needs will not be met until the organisations most closely in touch with those needs are given an opportunity to give evidence publicly and make public recommendations.

* A Labor government will conduct as a matter of priority a thorough inquiry into the extent of poverty in Australia and the adequacy of existing **welfare** arrangements as a means of eliminating poverty and allowing all Australians an equal access to our great national prosperity.

* I quote from the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** report of May last year on mentally and physically handicapped persons in Australia.

* The report stated: 
community health and **welfare**, and 
The Interim Committee Southern Regional Council for Social Development currently has 289 members who are either interested individuals or represent organisations such as service clubs, local government and **welfare** groups, etc.

* Denmark has a high standard of living and a very high standard of social **welfare**.

* The article commences: 
Danes will also be discouraged by the less complete social security and **welfare** system provided in Australia.

* The House will well recollect that the inquiry sponsored by the Department of Immigration into the reasons why such a growing higher proportion of migrants are returning home established the major reason as being that social security and social **welfare** services - covering the broad conspectus of these things - in Australia are so inferior to what are available overseas.

* It will be an automatic social **welfare** benefit in the community.

* The present Government has almost $450m of the taxpayers' money isolated and frozen in the National **Welfare** Fund paying only one per cent annual interest instead of the long term bond rate of between 6 per cent and 7 per cent per annum.

* Finally, we commit ourselves to developing **welfare** services in the community, because money alone is no answer to the big **welfare** needs of Australia at the present time.

* If we look at the public housing area- the area of **welfare**- we must recognise the Government's sympathy for those people who do not have the capacity for home ownership and who need shelter, encouragement and provisions for the growth of their families.

* by leaveRecent publicity has been given to situations where residents of Australia have proceeded overseas to arrange adoptions of young persons without obtaining the necessary support of Australian child **welfare** authorities.

* to promote the **welfare** of the child; 
Quite often an Australian resident has adopted a child in an overseas country and sought entry of the child to Australia.

* This sort of situation was considered in May 1976 by a conference of Australian State and Territory social **welfare** administrators which recommended that immigration policy should be reviewed for children subject to foreign adoption orders to allow entry only of those who have been subject to orders likely to be recognised by an Australian Court; who have been subject to orders considered unlikely to be recognised in Australia but where the adopting parents have been approved as suitable to adopt by the adoption authorities in their State or Territory of normal residence; or who have had a child-parent relationship of long standing and where refusal of entry of the child would not promote his or her **welfare** and best interests.

* In accordance with those principles and subject to sound health the entry to Australia of an overseas child is normally approved where the adoption proposal has the support of the child **welfare** authorities in the State or Territory of residence of the proposed adoptive parents, and the authorities in the overseas country in which the child is living are agreeable to the adoption being arranged.

* In all adoption procedures the **welfare** of the child is of paramount importance and so far as inter-country adoptions are concerned the Australian Government will be guided by the views of the State or Territory child **welfare** authorities.

* School submitted by the Katanning Community Committee to the Southern Regional Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* It is obvious the people of Australia are vitally concerned about the **welfare** of some nine million East Pakistan refugees that have crossed the border into India.

* Incomes have risen, not only in terms of real personal disposable incomes but in terms of facilities provided to the whole community in health, in education, in social **welfare**.

* I want to speak first of all about 3 features of the Budget, namely, social **welfare**, education and the taxation proposals.

* What I regard as even more important in the Government's education program is the decision -  (Opposition members interjecting) 
I turn now to the social **welfare** program, so often denigrated by our opponents.

* They have such a brilliant record in this field that they should be embarrassed even to mention the words 'social **welfare**'.

* I turn now to the social **welfare** program in which total direct outlays on social security and **welfare** are estimated to increase from $3,703m in 1974-75 to $4,772m in 1975-76.

* (Quorum formed)  I thank you,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  and I also thank the honourable member for Bendigo  (Mr Bourchier)  for lowering the curtain on Act I. I was referring to the social **welfare** program of the Government and the absence of any statement by the Opposition on what its attitude would be.

* Therefore direct outlays on social security and **welfare** in 1975-76 will be equivalent to 21.8 per cent of the estimated total Budget outlays.

* Honourable members would be fascinated by the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to pensions and social **welfare**.

* The **welfare** of the people was considered with due regard to priorities and in an orderly fashion.

* There is no doubt that the **welfare** of those in need has been cared for.

* 2) 1976- and by an accountant's fiddle with the National **Welfare** Fund balances.

* We raise no objections to the transfer of the National **Welfare** Fund balances to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.

* When one considers the activities of the Commonwealth Government in regard to war service homes and the provision of low interest finance to the State housing authorities for **welfare** housing construction it becomes obvious that the Government has played a very important and necessary role in the housing industry of Australia.

* 1 ) and (2) Grants under the Australian Assistance Plan are not made available to local government bodies to the exclusion of all other community bodies nor to a series of separate community bodies including local government Such an arrangement would aggravate the fragmentation of social **welfare** services, weaken the capacity for co-operation in the social **welfare** field, and defeat the objective of community involvement in regional decision making on such matters.

* 1 distributed by the Social **Welfare** Commission.

* The Budget proves that the Government is concerned about the **welfare** of the oil companies.

* It is concerned about the **welfare** of Utah.

* It is concerned about the **welfare** of multinational automobile companies.

* But what does it care about the **welfare** of low income families?

* What does it care about the **welfare** of the unemployed youth suffering a reduction in the value of his social service benefits through this Budget?

* Can anyone deny that those increased **welfare** benefits did other than increase the freedom of the recipients to live a normal life rather than the poverty stricken existence that was their lot under previous coalition governments?

* In it the Minister for Foreign Affairs  (Senator Willesee)  has this to say about our aid policy objectives: they are to promote through social and economic development, the **welfare** of people in developing countries.

* Although not as eloquently as the honourable member has asked I want to know when debates on social **welfare** will get out of the level of We gave them more than you gave them when you were in office'.

* If we have progressed so much surely our hopes and aspirations with regard to social **welfare** should also have risen.

* 1 believe, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong does, that we should have a national inquiry into social **welfare** and we should genuinely try to remove social services from the realm of politics.

* 1 cannot recall - I am sure that the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  will agree - one Budget when the Press, the television stations and the people of this country have universally said 'What a wonderful Budget for the people of this country' or 'What a wonderful **welfare** Budget this is'.

* Mr Sheridan,  the officer at Wyong of the State Department of Social **Welfare**, had been handling the case.

* In helping this woman he went as far as the State Department of Social **Welfare** can go.

* We need a social **welfare** system with flexibility, one that does not require a person to fit into section A sub-section (1.

* In a proper social **welfare** system the basis for assistance would be need and no other qualification should be necessary.

* On top of that they are expected to assist in meeting the **welfare** needs of the community.

* We recognised that housing was an important part of policy directed towards achievement of our equity and **welfare** objectives.

* It is an essential responsibility of a Federal government because of the vital political importance of housing for the general **welfare** of the nation and because the main factor in achieving housing policy objectives is the supply and price of money for public and private housing purposes.

* This money could be used to provide more **welfare** housing.

* The pressure on **welfare** housing is enormous and this present scheme is going to put even greater pressure on this sector.

* Referring now to the problem of **welfare** housing, when we came to power this question was tied up with the moneys made available under the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement.

* The longterm bond rate was 9.5 per cent when we went out of Government but we were making money available for **welfare** housing at 4 per cent.

* In the last year of the McMahon Government $167m was made available for **welfare** housing but in our last year of office we made $375m available.

* In 3 years we had increased the amount from S167m to $375m and the terms and conditions under which we made that money available were of great assistance to the States in trying to overcome the backlog of **welfare** housing.

* People earning up to 85 per cent of average weekly earnings were able to apply for **welfare** housing.

* The Minister for Social **Welfare**  (Mr Hayden)  has stood up for the rights of long-haired youths to draw unemployment benefits.

* I believe there is evidence to sustain my belief that at this time in our nation's history there is a great opportunity for the major political parties, ibr management and for unions in particular to reach a consensus that the future **welfare** of our citizens will depend to a large extent on giving them the opportunity to work and thereby to live productive and useful lives.

* Despite the enormous achievements of our nation in the last 25 years and despite our extremely high standard of living compared with many countries, the Henderson report identified areas of major concern and deficiencies in the social **welfare** structure, This was despite the universal philosophy of spending money on **welfare**.

* In 1976-77 all levels of government spending reached $2,339 for every man woman and child in this country, out of which social **welfare** alone accounted for over 30 per cent.

* As Australians we must continue to be vitally concerned about the **welfare** of our neighbours.

* The Government's aid programs are but one manifestation of our continuing interest in the **welfare** of these peoples.

* Section 10 (1) of the States Grants (Home Care) Act provides that where a person is employed as a **welfare** officer of a senior citizens' centre wholly or mainly in connexion with the provision of approved **welfare** services by or in association with the centre there is payable to the State, by way of financial assistance, an amount equal to one half of the amount paid to the **welfare** officer by way of salary.

* Incidentally, as the Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech, it is proposed to amend this Act soon to increase the rate of the Australian Government's subsidy to two-thirds of the **welfare** officer's salary.

* A **welfare** officer who devotes 75 per cent or more of his time to **welfare** services for the aged is accepted as being 'wholly' so employed and half of his salary is paid by the Australian Government.

* A **welfare** officer who devotes between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of his time to **welfare** services for the aged is accepted as being 'mainly' go employed and my Department pays half of his salary in respect of the time during which he is so employed.

* Payment of this assistance is usually claimed by the State concerned at quarterly intervals based on records kept by the **welfare** officer in the course of his work with the aged.

* It is understood that the information required is not extensive and should not cause undue inconvenience to the **welfare** officer.

* A detailed report, to provide a basis for assessment of th subsidy payable, is necessary only in those cases where the **welfare** officer devotes between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of his time to aged people's **welfare**.

* At the system level, support will be gwen for innovations aimed at the general improvement of the quality and **welfare** of the schools within the system.

* If we are to detect need in children we must face the fact that families most at risk are least likely to go voluntarily to infant **welfare** clinics, least likely to use child care centres, least likely to have the services of competent medical practitioners, social workers or phychological advisers.

* What was the amount of **welfare** services provided through the Department of Social Security within the electoral divisions of Leichhardt, Herbert, Kennedy and Dawson during each of the years 1973-74 to 1976-77, inclusive, and what were the categories in which they were paid.

* Victorian Social **Welfare** Department as at 1st October 1969 are paid a supplementary benefit.

* South Australia: A supplementary housing allowance of up to $2.00 per week (to the extent that housing costs exceed $4.00 per week) may be paid by the Department of Social **Welfare** to age pensioners who do not qualify for Commonwealth supplementary assistance.

* The allowance is paid by the Child **Welfare** Department.

* Tasmania: The Social **Welfare** Department may gram supplementary benefit to age pensioners with dependent children subject to a means test.

* In addition pensioners residing in country areas may apply to the State Social **Welfare** Department for a free travel warrant to enable them to attend hospital.

* Heating allowances may also be provided by the Social **Welfare** Department.

* For instance, never have recipients of social services been treated with such contempt and such callous disregard for their **welfare** as they have in this Budget.

* But on this occasion in particular the Government has shown complete disregard and complete contempt for their **welfare**.

* This Budget does affect all matters including employment levels, expenditure and social **welfare**.

* Because of this it has become traditional it is even written into standing order 81  -  that the Parliament becomes the forum upon which to debate any issue affecting the **welfare** and happiness of the Australian people.

* We have to look at the **welfare** of the total community.

* That there is a crisis in Aboriginal **welfare** in the South West Land Division of Western Australia resulting from a population explosion, poor housing and hygiene and unemployment and unemployability.

* I should like the Committee and the country to know that the Department of the Navy is seeking on every possible occasion to see where and how any of the timetables can be reasonably cut to ensure that the best possible equipment is provided for those who serve in the Navy and, furthermore, to ensure that the Royal Australian Navy, as it faces the very difficult years ahead, will make the maximum contribution to the **welfare** and security of this country.

* Unlike the traditional concept of a post-secondary or graduate institution providing training of an educational and professional nature towards the granting of degrees to persons of a certain age group, the United Nations University is visualised as an inter-connected world-wide system of academic institutions devoted to advanced research and training, through an interdisciplinary approach, on problems of human survival, development and **welfare**.

* We supported education initiatives, advances in social **welfare** responsibilities, the increasing demands of our people in conservation and environmental matters.

* is of the opinion ( a ) that the membership of the Committee is too closely involved with the Capital market to provide a completely detached analysis of its imperfections and (b) that the terms of reference of the Committee (i) are couched in a way to justify claims of political overtones and (ii) give insufficient attention to the social **welfare** implications of the financial system, particularly its impact on the housing market.

* b) is of the opinion (i) that the membership of the Committee is too closely involved with the capital market to provide a completely detached analysis of its imperfections and (ii) that the terms of reference of the Committee (A) are couched in a way to justify claims of political overtones and (B) give insufficient attention to the social **welfare** implications of the financial system, particularly its impact on the housing market.

* Not only are social **welfare** and equity considerations completely absent, but also no mention is made of the use of the capital market for the purpose of government policy, especially monetary and balance of payments measures.

* In considering regulations of the market, the committee may overlook the important role of regulation in achieving both social **welfare** goals and the objectives of government measures, particularly those dealing with monetary and balance of payments policies, as I mentioned earlier.

* That is the question I raise in this debate, particularly as social **welfare** and equity considerations have not been explicitly referred to in the terms of reference.

* When does he expect to receive the second report of the Task Force on Co-ordination in **Welfare** and Health.

* In fact, the variety of programs shows an active involvement in the **welfare** of the people in the developing nations.

* It ill-behoves any member of the Opposition to take out figures in isolation and to say that, because fewer dollars were made available in this particular year, the total funding for **welfare** housing is less than it was in the previous year.

* Under that legislation we find that the States, as co-operators in federalism and as sovereign States in their own right, are to contribute in certain circumstances on a dollar-for-dollar basis in the area of **welfare** housing.

* If the honourable member for Reid takes time off to do his mathematics and adds up the figures, he will find that money is being made available in the **welfare** housing area for those people who are in need.

* In the area of social **welfare** there is an increase of $ 1.1m.

* I refer now to the **welfare** budget.

* The **welfare** budget has increased predominantly because of the need for higher rental rebates.

* The Government believes that all housing rentals should go up to pretty close to market value but that those people who cannot afford to pay that value should be subsidised on a **welfare** basis by a rental rebate system.

* Dealing further with the **welfare** Budget, in the Territory at the moment the **welfare** branch is under extreme pressure.

* The **welfare** branch needs more assistance.

* lt is purely and solely a matter which concerns only the department responsible for education in each State and only the government of each Stale, or is it something which concerns the interests and the **welfare** of the whole of the Australian people?

* It also condemns the Government for its lack of interest and apathy towards social **welfare**.

* On the basis of past actions by the Liberal Government we could predict just how miserly and meagre the Government would be in its social **welfare** policy.

* It is natural that I should take this interest in the **welfare** of aged people.

* My own view is that council government is one of the ideal areas in which an active role can be played in social **welfare**.

* I have been looking at the Budget estimates of expenditure this year and the amount that has already been spent in accordance with legislation introduced last year to provide Commonwealth participation in a comprehensive plan of **welfare** for the aged and infirm.

* On a comparison of the amount to be spent next year on such things as paramedical services in the home, senior citizen centres and the provi sion of **welfare** officers one will see that the Government has still really not gone very far beyond the old philosophy of putting aged people into institutions and keeping them there.

* The interest of the Liberal Party is not primarily in the **welfare** of the people: it is not primarily in the aim of providing the Government assistance to which we in the Australian Labor Party believe the people are entitled.

* One of the items of expenditure which the previous Minister, I presume, recommended and which was agreed to referred to John Paterson Urban Systems Pty Ltd, who were asked to study this question- 'Time as a social indicator-study of time allocation and preference as an indicator of social **welfare**.'

* I repeat: 'Time as a social indicator-study of time allocation and preference as an indicator of social **welfare**'.

* John Paterson Urban Systems Pty Ltd was asked to study: 'Time as a social indicator-study of time allocation and preference as an indicator of social **welfare**'.

* It would not be like this mumbo jumbo that we are fed with about preference as an indicator in a study of social **welfare**.

* The whole field of social **welfare** is a monumental failure.

* The whole sorry document reveals their anaemic approach to social services and social **welfare**.

* Indeed, the very words 'social **welfare**' are anathema to most members of the coalition.

* It is a reasonable assumption that he ought to be interested in farmers, their **welfare** and their future, although primary producers in my own State of Tasmania have formed other opinions.

* The **welfare** of primary industry has for too long been ignored by this Government and primary producers are to stage a protest march in Canberra.

* The business of this Parliament and the members of this Parliament is the **welfare** of the Australian people.

* With respect to **welfare**, is there less **welfare** distributed as a result of this Budget or as a result of this income tax measure than there was hitherto?

* Unless the growth of output is maximised, a government has neither income taxation concessions to confer nor **welfare** to confer.

* Countries with low rates of growth have no **welfare** to confer.

* Do not members of the Opposition know that the problem with the British taxation system after the war was that insufficient incentive to the people subject to that taxation system was allowed and while the British Government devoted itself to **welfare** in the years immediately after the Second World War, British growth was retarded right throughout the 1950s because that principle was forgotten.

* More measure is made in order to draw distinctions between people at different income levels in relation to their contributions to Australian **welfare** than occurs in almost any other country in the world.

* It is no use talking about **welfare** on its own.

* We talk about nothing if we talk about **welfare** on its own.

* In the Australian Labor Party platform on tax, the Australian Labor Party never mentions these most basic principles that must animate any taxation system.- I refer to the Platform, Constitution and 
**Welfare** cannot be administered in a vacuum.

* It simply means that if **welfare** is to be administered with respect to taxation, if taxation is to be reduced - and this has been the **welfare** programme of the Government - one can apply oneself only to the 29 or 30 per cent of the increase to which I have referred.

* Using the fact that in a recession government expenditure automatically rises through increased **welfare** payments, and receipts fall through lower tax receipts, calculations are made to obtain what the budgetary position of present expenditure and receipt patterns would be at the position of full employment.

* These are consistent with our philosophy of concentrating **welfare** towards those in genuine need.

* It introduced the Medibank scheme, community health centres, **welfare** rights officers, and translator and interpreter services.

* Why was the Australian Council of Trade Unions the only organisation with an interest in the work of the National Commission on Social **Welfare** given the right to nominate a representative.

* For instance, if we take the question of **welfare**, which the Minister seems to believe is an area which can develop over a number of years, it seems to me that the **welfare** of the people of Norfolk Island at this time is of major concern to the people of Australia.

* That is another area in which I think we have to assert that Australia as a whole must insist that at least a minimum standard of **welfare** should apply on Norfolk Island.

* A similar situation exists in relation to the police, corporate affairs, prices and rent control, industrial safety, mining and minerals, public and private land, environmental protection, child, family and social **welfare**.

* We have to try to assess how far the basic services of Meals on Wheels, pensions, housing, health and **welfare** services are specifically designed and effectively directed towards meeting the needs of old people.

* What is the priority of these **welfare** steps?

* How many of our **welfare** services are adequate and, indeed, how many are grossly inadequate?

* Canada had a Senate select committee looking into the problems of **welfare** services for the aged.

* The local council, with an enlightened outlook on social **welfare**, was already providing home help services and many other **welfare** services.

* However the finance for **welfare** services was already overstrained and the council had to look for a local charitable organisation to raise the money that was needed to meet the capital cost of the scheme.

* In this respect it is noteworthy that of an estimated outlay for 1976-77 totalling $24,320.9m almost half is made up by health expenditure of $2,908.7m, education $2,204m, social security and **welfare** $6,187.1m- and I might mention that constitutes 25 per cent of total outlays- and culture and recreation $253.

* Our **welfare** is a matter of considerable concern.

* That is not a blanket condemnation of **welfare** programs.

* There is perhaps a parallel to be seen in the treatment of government funding over several years in the field of Aboriginal **welfare** where all too often we find that, notwithstanding the expenditure of unbelievable sums of money, the immediate problems of the ultimate beneficiaries appear unrelieved.

* Government leaders are constantly stating that **welfare** should be based on need.

* Continued adherence to universal **welfare** payments is bad **welfare** policy.

* This Government should have taken the opportunity in this Budget at last to adopt selectivity based on need as the basis of expenditure on **welfare** which at present costs taxpayers in excess of $8 billion per annum.

* First of all, the ability of governments to move constantly towards lower taxes is limited by universal **welfare** payments.

* Finally, of course, if governments did decide to base **welfare** payments solely on need there would be the opportunity for governments to introduce tough budgets such as this one without, at the same time, being forced to implement penny-pinching measures involving social injustices such as reverting to annual adjustments of pensions.

* I hope that the Minister for Special Trade Representations  (Mr Garland),  who is at the table, will convey my suggestions to the Government on this particular philosophy of disbursing **welfare** payments.

* So in all these areas I think all the members of this Parliament should recognise that social **welfare** payments should be based solely on need.

* In proposing that matter for debate I quoted the documents which had been prepared by the Church of England social **welfare** authorities in the diocese of Sydney - at Redfern and at Mount Druitt.

* These were his opening remarks: 
The other suggestion which has been made by the Australian Labor Party and by the Australian Council of Social Service is that it is too much for any one man or any one woman to conduct as wide ranging an inquiry into social **welfare** as this country needs.

* the honourable member for Mitchell  (Mr Irwin)  and he should know the deprivation which is suffered in many fields of social **welfare** by the people who live in so far flung an area as his area on the outskirts of the metropolis of Sydney.

* Having obtained such an order, she has to go very many miles to a branch of the New South Wales Department ofSocial **Welfare** before she can get the forms of assistance available from that Department.

* It was an area similar to the area in the electorate of Mitchell which the Anglican social **welfare** workers showed to me when I made my visit early in May.

* It may be that in some terms they do not have a low income, but when one takes into account the amount of money they have to pay to buy a block of land, to pay off their house when they get one and to spend on fares to get to and from work, and the amount of time they have to spend in getting to hospitals or to **welfare** agencies* it can be seen that these are people who are deprived even if they have an income which is larger than that which Professor Henderson regards as the poverty line.

* All that one finds either from the Minister, for Social .Services or members such as the honourable member for Mitchell is that they blame the States for every social shortcoming, every municipal shortcoming and every **welfare** shortcoming in this country.

* He had always made the excuse that it was not for Federal authorities to inquire into matters of **welfare** or social services, that these were academic matters which were better discharged by the researchers at the universities such as, of course, Professor Henderson.

* They are to be discouraged from looking after the **welfare** of their employees but price rises which disregard the public interest arc to he ignored.

* They distress in particular pensioner householders for whose **welfare** the Commonwealth should have a special concern.

* This is the point I am making to the members of not just the Labor Party but also my own party and anyone who is interested or thinks he is interested or tries to be interested or, if I may say so, tries to bluff other people that he is interested in the **welfare** of Aborigines.

* Was the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and **Welfare** in respect of mentally and physically handicapped persons in Australia tabled in Parliament 15 months ago - in May of last year?

* Did this report recommend a variety of educational, health and **welfare** measures for the benefit of the handicapped and their families?

* The Conference of Child **Welfare** Administrators.

* The Conference of Ministers of Child and Social **Welfare**.

* (a) The Conferences of Child **Welfare** Administrators have been held since 1939.

* Originally only State **Welfare** Departments and the Department of the Interior (as the body responsible for **welfare** in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory) were involved.

* The Conference of Ministers was first suggested in April 1967 in an invitation to the then Minister for Social Services from the New South Wales Minister for Child **Welfare** and Social **Welfare**.

* The conference was first held in 1970 and was originally restricted to State Government **Welfare** Ministers and the Minister responsible for **welfare** matters in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, (formerly Minister for the Interior, now Ministers for the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).

* Administrators- Senior Officers of the Australian Department of Social Security, State Government **Welfare** Departments and the New Zealand and New Guinea **Welfare** Departments.

* Officers from the former Department of the Interior, (now Department of the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory), as the body responsible for **welfare** matters in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory have also attended.

* Ministers- The Australian Minister for Social Security, State Government **Welfare** Ministers and **Welfare** 
Administrators- Generally, to allow for an exchange of ideas between the participants on matters of common interest in the field of child **welfare**.

* Ministers- Generally, to allow for an exchange of ideas between the participants on matters of common interest in the fields of child **welfare** and social **welfare**.

* However, it was the experience and expertise in the areas of social **welfare** and family law possessed by the persons - and bodies that have expressed support for the proposed ground of divorce, as well as the strength of their numbers, that convinced the Attorney-General of the desirability of this reform.

* To protect the **welfare** of the children, who are the real victims of broken marriages.

* There will be attached to the court a specialist staff, notably marriage counsellors and **welfare** officers, to assist the parties at any stage- and even independently of any proceedings.

* Parties will not be driven to the court by their own despair as a last resort; they will be encouraged to come to the **welfare** and counselling staff of the court whenever they have a matrimonial problem, even if they are not contemplating proceedings of any kind.

* There is to be a director of counselling and **welfare** and such other counsellors and **welfare** officers attached to the court as are necessary.

* The director of counselling and **welfare** will be required to make the counselling services of the court available to any persons who request it, whether or not they have instituted any proceedings.

* The counselling and **welfare** facilities of the Australian Family Court would be available to State Family Courts thus created.

* He or she will merely file a notice in the Family Court, which will bring in the director of counselling and **welfare**.

* I would like to turn now to the provisions of the Bill concerning the **welfare** and custody of children who, as I said before, are the real victims in family disputes.

* The most significant innovation in the Bill is the provision for a compulsory conference with a **welfare** officer between the parties to custody or divorce proceedings to discuss the **welfare** of a child of the marriage, with a view to resolving any points of difference between the parents.

* The court will also have the power to order supersivion of custody and access orders by **welfare** officers and where necessary, it will have the power to enforce compliance with such orders.

* Left unchecked, the rate of price increases would soon erode the gains we propose for pensioner and other social **welfare** recipients.

* The Budget in fact provides for substantial increases in social **welfare**, defence, education and the arts, assistance to rural industries, and other areas of essential activity.

* But let me just mention social **welfare** as one example.

* The Government looked at various possible measures in the social **welfare** field.

* What taxes would the 
Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, my Government has acted responsibly by matching its **welfare** programme to what we have judged can reasonably be raised from taxation and other revenue sources.

* These increases in pensions, child endowment and other social **welfare** and repatriation benefits should ensure a welcome improvement in the standard of living of those dependent on them, even after allowing for the faster rate of price rises.

* I have already mentioned our social **welfare** programme.

* We are also making substantial contributions to Aboriginal **welfare**, to education and the arts, and we have established a department whose functions include examination of environmental problems.

* It is a Budget which will help us achieve our great national aims of economic strength and prosperity, social **welfare**, and security.

* It provides a stimulus to the economy and it includes the biggest **welfare** packet that has ever been brought into a single Commonwealth Parliament.

* It is impossible in the time available to me in this debate to cover all these aspects, and I intend, if I may, to devote my time solely to the **welfare** aspects; but even then I will be unable to cover the full range that is contained in this Budget.

* This Budget contains a combination of what can be achieved in the **welfare** field.

* The vocal social **welfare** groups have made some gains.

* The unemployed, people on sickness benefits and those receiving the rent allowance- the poorest social **welfare** recipients in this country who do not have a voice- have clearly lost.

* They would effectively exclude the Australian Government from the whole of the child care program which is a social **welfare** program as well as an educational one.

* The committee includes  Dr Mccloskey,  of the Victorian Department of Health;  Mr A.  McVeigh, of the Victorian Department of Health;  Mr E.  Ryan, of the Victorian Department of Education;  Mr H.  McPhee, of the Victorian Department of Social **Welfare**;  Mr D.  Neville, of the Victorian Department of Youth, Sport and Recreation; Councillor Portingale, a local government representative;  Mrs Mccaughey,  a community representative and  Mrs Witney  King a community representative.

* Also on the committee were Miss B. Stubbs, an adviser-observer from the Victorian Department of Health;  Mr J.  P. Bradburn, an adviser from the Victorian Department of Health; and Miss E. 
Bennett, of the Victorian Department of Social **Welfare**.

* Why is the Opposition against a **welfare** program that assists people who are in need?

* We spoke to another Minister, a very reasonable man who has an interest in the **welfare** of children.

* Let us look at the whole history of moneys paid by the Australian Government to the States for **welfare** housing.

* Since 1973-74 the Commonwealth, under a new Agreement applying for the 5 years from 1973-74 to 1977-78- this was commenced under a Labor Governmenthas advanced funds to the States for **welfare** housing outside, and in addition to, Loan Council arrangements.

* The truth is that **welfare** housing has been a political football for many years for honourable members opposite.

* 55m to provide rent rebates and **welfare** housing for deserving people.

* In the last year of the McMahon Government an amount of $ 167m was made available for **welfare** housing under the CommonwealthState Housing Agreement.

* In other words, $375m will have been spent on **welfare** housing this financial year and in each of the last 2 financial years.

* The difference is that the former Conservative Government charged interest rates of 7 per cent on **welfare** housing whereas when Labor came to power that interest rate was reduced to 4 per cent.

* In other words, the money was made available to improve the situation of public or **welfare** housing which was an extremely short commodity.

* At that time something like 100 000 people were on the waiting lists for **welfare** housing.

* The Government stands condemned because it has reduced expenditure on **welfare** housing and urban and regional development, particularly in Sydney and in Melbourne.

* The Government has maintained its spending on **welfare** housing.

* This Government attaches great importance to **welfare** housing.

* The amount of $364m- it is really $374m- has been allocated for **welfare** housing in accordance with the 1973-74 Housing Agreement.

* The Government is looking for further improvements in the provision of **welfare** housing.

* More money will not cope completely with the **welfare** housing problem.

* That Government did not even get down to the basic problem or the need for providing **welfare** housing.

* It has also been the practice in Victoria that enormous tracts of land are bought by the Housing Commission out of taxpayers money at greatly inflated prices and the only people who make any profit out of this are certainly not the people who should be benefiting from the **welfare** housing but the developer.

* Much more **welfare** housing should be available.

* If the past governments, State and Federal, had set their sights on the provision of **welfare** housing in their long terms in office we might now be able to hold our heads up as some of the Scandanavian countries can and say that we can provide housing for those who cannot afford to provide it for themselves and we can provide it at a rent they can afford to pay.

* We need to provide a diversity of **welfare** housing to suit all age groups and all aspects of living.

* We, as representatives of the Australian electorate should maintain our concentration on making **welfare** housing available.

* The improvements provided for in this Bill will enable the Scheme to continue making an important contribution to the national **welfare** by assisting eligible persons and their families in all parts of the Commonwealth to obtain homes and I commend the Bill to the House.

* The Labor Party talks about the **welfare** of the people.

* In spite of what the honourable member for Blaxland said, the Government is concerned for the **welfare** of fruit growers and dairy farmers throughout Australia and their ability to gain unemployment benefits.

* I believe this Government has demonstrated that it is genuinely concerned about social **welfare**.

* The second category of support, which again was on a two for one basis, is given to local government to pay the salaries of **welfare** officers at senior citizens centres.

* The **welfare** officers employed by local government under the grants play an important role in preventive medicine by assisting the elderly to remain socially active and in touch with community health facilities.

* The present cuts mean that local government councils will have to find several hundred thousand dollars or sack their **welfare** officers.

* At page 383 of  Hansard  the Minister incorporated a table suggesting that expenditure for home care services and **welfare** officers has been increased significantly this year.

* Subsidies to **welfare** and home care workers have been reduced by one-third.

* It will teach them that once they get involved in **welfare** work with the Federal Government, when the Federal Government originally finances something quite significantly, perhaps to the extent of 90 per cent, its contribution will drop to 75 per cent and finally to 50 per cent.

* Under this Bill funds for home care and **welfare** workers will be cut by one-third even though in many cases local council budgets have been planned on the assumption that the Commonwealth would not renege on its obligations.

* In commenting on this decision by the Federal Government, Professor Henderson, who is well known to members of this House, said that the Government had been leading local councils up the garden path by offering subsidies for **welfare** services and then not continuing their level of funding once these services were operating to the obvious benefit of their recipients.

* This Bill is a major piece of social **welfare** legislation.

* It is one of several social **welfare** measures that are in the process of being passed or have been passed by this Parliament.

* Put together these measures provide outstanding and comprehensive social **welfare** legislation and they make a broad attack on social **welfare** problems in this country.

* It is an indication to the people of Australia that this Government is concerned about social **welfare** problems and shows them where this Government stands.

* The Government has thrown out a major challenge to the Labor Party in the field of social **welfare**.

* With an election approaching it would have been interesting and valuable not only to this Parliament but also to the people of Australia to be told the exact' policy of the Labor Party on social **welfare**.

* The Leader of the Opposition has also previously promised $100m immediate social **welfare** advance.

* -Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill now before the House seeks to authorise the Treasurer  (Mr Hayden)  to make advances to the States for the purpose of **welfare** or government housing.

* I move the following amendment: 
That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading the House is of the opinion that the reduction of $20.8m for **welfare** housing is a breach of the undertaking given by the Australian Government not to reduce the advances to the States below the 1974-75 level and that many low income families will be needlessly disadvantaged as a result'.

* There is no concern for the people who are on low incomes, who are underprivileged or disadvantaged and who will seek what is commonly known as **welfare** housing.

* The amendment deals with the reduction amounting to $20.8m in **welfare** housing.

* But the cutback in the area of **welfare** housing, which is what we are talking about today, amounts to $20.

* 2913 on the notice paper which asks whether he had said that advances for the States **welfare** housing programs will not be less than in the previous financial year.

* The point is that we are saying that in this Budget assistance for **welfare** housing has been decreased.

* In his second reading speech the Minister said that in 1974-75, the year just ended, advances were 2 'A times more than was spent on **welfare** housing in 1971-72 when we were in Government.

* However, in 1971 when we were in Government we produced 15 337 homes with **welfare** money and this Government has produced only 15 228.

* It also enables the Commonwealth to pay 50 per cent of the salary of a social **welfare** worker employed at a homeless persons assistance centre.

* A. Staley, M.P.Minister for the Captal Territory;  Senator the  Honourable M. G. C. Guilfoyle- Minister for Social Security; the Honourable R. I. Viner, M.P.-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs; the Honourable R. Payne, M.P.-Minister of Community **Welfare**, South Australia; the Honourable B. Dixon, M.P.-Minister for Social **Welfare** and Youth, Sport and Recreation, Victoria; the Honourable J. Herbert, M.L.A.- Minister for Community **Welfare** Services, Queensland; the Honourable D. J. Baldock, M.H.A.- Minister for Housing and Social **Welfare**, Tasmania; the Honourable N. E. Baxter, M.P.-Minister for Community **Welfare**, Western Australia; the Honourable R. F. Jackson, M.P.-Minister for Youth and Community Services, New South Wales; the Honourable R. J. Walker, M.P.-Minister for Social **Welfare**, New Zealand.

* (a) At the Conference of the Council of Social **Welfare** Ministers in Darwin on 21 May 1976 I outlined the Commonwealth Government's decision on the Australian Assistance Plan as follows: 'In the light of our consideration of all that has been done to evaluate the Plan, we believe that it is a worthwhile experiment in social planning and local action in determining **welfare** priorities.

* The Commonwealth Government does not propose to make funds available for new community **welfare** projects but commitments on projects already approved, but not totally funded, will be met.

* Beyond this, the Commonwealth does not propose further funding for the Australian Assistance Plan either for community **welfare** projects or for administration or development.

* The truth is that all of the social workers trained by these various courses are all pretty well trained for their job, a job which is so necessary these days in the expansion of social **welfare** services and agencies involved in social **welfare**.

* I am referring now to **welfare** officers and the courses, which would probably be described as subprofessional, which train **welfare** officers.

* These courses are usually at technical colleges as I know is the case in Tasmania, or within social **welfare** departments such as the certificate courses run by the Victorian Social **Welfare** 
Department.

* Tasmania's Mental Health Services Commission runs a course for **welfare** officers.

* I believe that we have to look at the relative place of social workers and **welfare** officers.

* Is a **welfare** officer just a less welltrained social worker, or is a social worker just a better-trained **welfare** officer?

* I think that the time has come to make a fairly generally accepted decision about the type of course required for social workers, the sort of level al which they will operate on graduation and the relationship between social workers and **welfare** officers both in the work they do and in the relative numbers of each, and the relative numbers of each to be trained with governmental support.

* Should the **welfare** officer qualification be used as a stepping stone to a later qualification as a social worker, if desired?

* A lack of co-ordination in this field can lead to a great inefficiency in the use of resources in training and in the employment of workers in the **welfare** field.

* I also feel extremely pleased at the action you have taken in relation to social **welfare**.

* Today, even with a record number of houses built under the **welfare** housing system, there are 108 000 people waiting for houses.

* Funds for the construction industry have been cut, sewerage programs have been cut, as well as allocations for the Australian Assistance Plan and **welfare** housing.

* This year the grant for **welfare** housing is a measly $98m.

* Public benevolent institutions- and these include many institutions that look to the **welfare** of blind persons- are entitled to exemption from sales tax on goods purchased for their use and not for resale.

* As a general principle, concessions granted through the taxation system are regarded as being an inefficient and inequitable way of providing **welfare** assistance.

* So this was an important determining factor when the hard decisions were made by the Labor Government in the last Budget about the sums of money to be available for **welfare** housing in this Bill.

* Let me lead on from this to say unequivocally that if Labor were in power and the same economic conditions prevailed as they do today, a third instalment of funds for the **welfare** housing field would be in the pipeline right now.

* So the valid point is this: If Labor were in power there would have been a third instalment of funds for **welfare** housing, but that instalment would have been less than is necessary under this Liberal-National Country Party Government right now.

* Under Labor, the amount of the third instalment for **welfare** housing would not have needed to be so great as it is today.

* The tragedy is that there is no such prospect for a third instalment for **welfare** housing from the Liberal and National Country parties.

* I understand that only about 5 per cent of the housing needs of  Australians  are satisfied through **welfare** housing Bills.

* More and more of our people are turning to this **welfare** housing sector as the access point to housing mortgage loan funds moves up the income scale.

* **Welfare** housing will never satisfy the existing demands, leave alone satisfy new demands.

* Another point that I should like to make is that at the moment **welfare** housing, in such short supply, is going to a lot of people who do not need it.

* However, in the course of its recent inquiry into drug problems in Australia, the Senate Standing Committee on Social **Welfare** did cover the use of analgesics.

* Our objective is a social **welfare** structure which identifies the most needy in the community and ensures that those who have no other means are provided with enough to live on, in  a  modest self-respecting way, without requiring any other assistance outside the pension.

* That is to say that they involve very often the services of the Commonwealth, State Services, local government **welfare** services, and those of private agencies.

* But their functions are limited and they operate independently of State social **welfare** agencies and other groups.

* Then, of course, there ought to be in the regional council of social service structure provision for a contingency **welfare** fund which would be operated on a regional basis.

* With every regional council of social services, in which the organisations and the State and Commonwealth services are integrated, with the advisory or administrative group and the contingency **welfare** fund that could be invoked in times of emergency, there ought to be also a Commonwealth **welfare** services directory.

* Modern **welfare** theory is based on the belief that problems do not come singly but in clusters.

* So I put it to the Minister that on the basis of three very learned papers presented at the Australian Council of Social Services Conference in Canberra in May of this year, at which both the Minister and I were present, there seems to be very considerable scope for a thorough examination of this new theory about social **welfare**.

* Government **welfare** committees should bc serviced by high grade units skilled in social analysis.

* He contended that we needed a government White Paper on development of local health and **welfare** services.

* When it is all said and done, this is a country which once showed initiative in leading the world in relation to social **welfare**.

* The first objective is to plug a number of gaps and anomalies in the social **welfare** provision in this country.

* The Opposition welcomes most of these efforts at greater consistency and the effort to make more comprehensive and solid the protective social **welfare** framework.

* Thirdly, the package of Bills aims to continue and reinforce the Government's treatment of the unemployed, not merely as second-class citizens but as second-class **welfare** recipients.

* The first objective of these measures is to plug a number of gaps and anomalies in the social **welfare** provision in this country.

* With only minimal administrative changes and relatively small expenditure increases, a much more comprehensive **welfare** floor could have been provided.

* The third and most contemptible of the objectives of these Bills is the further development of this Government's policy of treating the unemployed not merely as second class citizens, but as second class **welfare** recipients.

* The dole bludger epithet may now be rejected in Government rhetoric, but the dole bludger syndrome is alive and active in the reality of this Government's social **welfare** policies.

* If they had received these adjustments, as has practically every other **welfare** beneficiary, their benefit in November would be some $7 a week more.

* This again discriminates against the unemployed as compared with nearly all other categories of **welfare** recipients.

* But these Bills do more than simply tolerate the existing **welfare** discrimination against the unemployed.

* Finally, the Government seeks to further use social **welfare** as an instrument in industrial warfare.

* I would be very interested to know whether the honourable member for Franklin  (Mr Goodluck)  supports that use of **welfare** provisions.

* I believe that this quite savage **welfare** punishment of unionists as the result of the industrial action of fellow unionists is wrong in principle.

* It is quite inappropriate to use social **welfare** provisions in this way.

* However, the redistribution can contribute to social and **welfare** progress in municipal areas in terms of halls, libraries, swimming pools, community **welfare** centres, the community nurse nursing service, the family planning centre and so on.

* In the current rather difficult financial situation, with a Labor Government keen to develop its social **welfare** programs, I would have hoped that the Cabinet would be a little more sympathetic to the claims of the defence forces in this year and in the years ahead, because we all accept that there is a need for a long lead time in these matters.

* The National **Welfare** Fund was established on 20 March 1943.

* The purposes of the National **Welfare** Fund are the making of such payments as are directed by any law of the Commonwealth to be made from the Fund, in relation to health services, unemployment or sickness benefits, family allowances or other **welfare** or social service.

* a joint select committee should be established to inquire into and report upon the social **welfare** needs of the Australian community'.

* The Prime Minister has dishonoured - as indeed has the Minister for Social Services  (Mr Wentworth)  - an important promise to many people in Australia who had been expectantly looking forward to a fairly radical alteration and improvement in the system of providing social **welfare** benefits and services in the community.

* One would have expected too that in this Budget the opportunity would have been taken to define a broad programme not only involving social security payments but actual **welfare** services and mobilising the resources available in the community against poverty in the community.

* This calls, of course, not only for the provision of adequate social security payments but the development of **welfare** services in the community; an appreciation that a complex of services has to be mobilised and integrated within the community to combat this problem.

* I have mentioned before the need for regionalised development of our **welfare** services to back up this sort of programme of which 1 am speaking.

* 1 will not develop that again today but 1 would add that we do need to establish a parliamentary joint select committee on social **welfare**.

* We have not had such a committee since the 1940s with the result that we are still proceeding, so far as the social services and social **welfare** benefits at the federal level are concerned, according to reflexes learnt in the 1940s - several decades ago - and which were the product of people who had been through a traumatic experience of a major world depression that shattered this country and a major world war which also seriously disrupted it.

* Australia now ranks as one of the 4 wealthiest countries and accordingly is in an eminently suitable position to provide much more generous benefits financially and much more adequate services in terms of **welfare** assistance in the field than it has done so far.

* If we had such a joint committee, which I repeat we have not had since the 1940s, there would be an appropriate opportunity to develop something which we badly need - a philosophy behind what we are doing in social **welfare**.

* We will be backing up all that we are proposing for social security with the development of regionalised **welfare** services.

* Australia as the fourth wealthiest nation in the world should be the leader, the innovator the great laboratory of social **welfare** inventiveness, innovation and improvement in the world.

* It is interesting to note that some 25 per cent of total outlays go to social security and **welfare**.

* Something like 37 per cent or $9 billion of a total Budget outlay of $24.3 billion- a lot of money- is spent in the area of social security, **welfare** and health.

* ber of occasions made clear its friendly interest in Fiji and in the **welfare** of its people.

* 1 ) Have pilot **welfare** rights projects been introduced. 
)

* What is a **welfare** rights officer.

* Meanwhile, within the overall framework of the Budget, the Government has been able to restore important social **welfare** benefits.

* The purpose of the Bill is to provide for direct matching grants, with the States for a range of home care services, and for the salaries of approved **welfare** officers employed at or in association with senior citizen's centres.

* As announced at the Premiers Conference, the new subsidy arrangements are to have effect on and from 1 July 1978 in respect of home care services, and for **welfare** officer salaries for a salary period commencing on or after 1 July 1978.

* The Act broadly provides three forms of assistance: 
Firstly, for home care service schemes which provide housekeeping and other domestic assistance to aged people in their own homes; secondly, for the building and equipping of senior citizens' centres; and thirdly, for the employment of **welfare** officers employed by, or in association with, senior citizens ' centres.

* The importance of locally based home care and **welfare** officer services for aged and infirm people is fully recognised by the Government.

* Because of the need for continuing constraint in the Government's expenditure, it has not been possible recently to approve new **welfare** officer positions or new home care services.

* The fact is that the Commonwealth will continue to match every dollar allocated by the States for approved **welfare** officer and home care services.

* Provided that State governments act responsibly within the framework of the federalism policy, there is no reason to believe that there will be any reduction in the level of **welfare** officer and home care services.

* There are currently 1 12 **welfare** officers whose salaries are being subsidised under the States Grants (Home Care) Act.

* The main function of a **welfare** officer is to provide a link between aged persons living in their own homes and domiciliary and other supportive **welfare** services.

* The activities and responsibilities of **welfare** officers vary according to local needs and priorities, but in general include determination of the needs of the aged population and the development of services and facilities to meet these needs; liaison with committees of senior citizens' centres and service clubs for the purpose of establishing or extending the centres' services and facilities; supervision of the services provided; fostering co-operation and liaison among various **welfare** activities for aged persons and encouraging interest in these activities; and providing an education program which will encourage senior citizens' centres to promote purposeful activities.

* Home care services which can be subsidised under the legislation include home visiting, laundry and shopping services, home handyman and related home maintenance schemes, housekeeper and other services which complement health or **welfare** programs designed to enhance the independence of aged and infirm people living at home.

* When was the attention of the Department of Social Security drawn to the findings in the (a) 1959 Annual Report of the Western Australian Department of Native **Welfare**, (b) 1976 report by the Western Australian Department for Community **Welfare** and (c) 1977 report by the Office for 
1 ) Has a decision been made on assistance for extensions to building and provision of telephones at the MurrayDrakesbrook St John Ambulance Sub-centre submitted by the Murray Community Committee to the Southern Region Social Development Board under the Australian Assistance Plan, and subsequently referred by the Social **Welfare** Commission to his Department.

* So we are just trying to present some public relations per se for the benefit of this benevolent Prime Minister who is suddenly seeking to appear to be concerned about Aboriginal **welfare**.

* The Conference is being sponsored by the Council of Social **Welfare** Ministers.

* The Council of Social **Welfare** Ministers has decided to limit the numbers of delegates who are to be invited to attend the conference and the Commonwealth/ State/Territory quota is as follows: 
1 take up the final point that was mentioned by the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  on the question of development because one matter that I feel should be referred to during this debate is the exciting prospect of Australia's natural resource development, which is contingent in part on the economic climate engendered by this Budget, f must also condemn the Opposition for its irresponsible criticism of the Budget by advocating massive spending under what it terms a responsible economic policy.

* Here we have a budget providing for a large increase in essential expenditures, especially on payments to the States, **welfare**, development and assistance to rural industry, including emergency relief for wool growers who have been hard hit by drought and low prices.

* I think the whole philosophy of our approach to social **welfare** and the security of human beings is under discussion here today.

* I think it is nonsensical that people can make millions of dollars and remit them overseas and then make a very small contribution to this country's **welfare**.

* In some areas of social **welfare** Queensland lags.

* One of the disastrous effects of continuous changes in policies and depression of government action is the impact that has upon the professional people who have committed themselves to the social **welfare** area.

* 1 ) When is the Task Force into health, **welfare** and community based programs to submit its report.

* -Today we are faced with one of the most difficult decisions ever to be made by the Parliament, because upon this decision will rest the **welfare** of millions of people.

* Indeed, the **welfare** and standard of living of a vast majority of the people on earth could rest upon this decision.

* In addition health centre workers undertake a wide range of community health and **welfare** activities, other than consultations, which are not usually found in general practice and for which no deduction has been made in the above cost estimates.

* Other workers include District Nurses, an Infant **Welfare** Sister, Dentists, Social Workers, a Social Health Visitor, a Psychologist, a Physiotherapist and Pharmacist.

* But funds in the **welfare** housing field were cut from $175m down to $2 5m.

* The States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill which is before us deals predominantly with what is known as **welfare** housing.

* **Welfare** housing is important.

* There are large backlogs of applications for **welfare** housing, of course.

* **Welfare** housing is only a part of housing; housing is only a part of the building industry; and the building industry is only one section of the general Australian economy.

* We have to see **welfare** housing, which is the subject matter of this Bill, in relation to the whole of the building industry.

* If we can get interest rates down we will be helping the housing industry, not only in the **welfare** sector with which this Bill is concerned but also in the general sector with which the Government is, and should be, concerned.

* I hope that the Government's current obsession with the mythical deficit will not preclude in the future a further advance to the States for **welfare** housing which will enable at least the current level of real activity- I do not speak of activity in terms of money- to be maintained and, I hope, even increased.

* Financial Assistance to Community Associations for the **welfare** of private and sponsored overseas students in Australia.

* The Australian Development Assistance Agency is reponsible for the **welfare** of private and sponsored overseas students in Australia.

* The Agency co-ordinates its community **welfare** arrangements through Co-ordinating Committees comprising representatives of regional community associations and overseas students.

* The broad purposes of the **welfare** program, which is an important adjunct to the training of overseas students, are to foster good-will towards Australia and to contribute to the growth of understanding between Australia and the various developing countries concerned.

* The **welfare** program includes such activities as the reception and induction of new students; host family schemes; the arrangement of accommodation and hospitality; and the provision of counselling.

* Student associations seeking assistance must have a significant and appropriate membership; objectives compatible with the purposes of the **welfare** program; and a capability to assist their members.

* The Australian Government accepted responsibility for the **welfare** arrangements for sponsored overseas students with the inception of the technical co-operation program in 195 1 and has since extended this responsibility to all overseas students.

* Since the establishment of the Agency as an autonomous statutory authority, one of its functions has been to look after the **welfare** arrangements for overseas students in Australia.

* Under Division 256/5-Bilateral Training Programs, provision is made for expenditure on the **welfare** of overseas students in Australia.

* In order that **welfare** funds may be applied for the benefit of as many overseas students as possible, it has been general policy to make grants to organisations rather than to individuals.

* In this way, an awareness of the overseas student **welfare** program is extended to a wide cross-section of the community.

* The total amounts paid or to be paid to voluntary organisations for the **welfare** of overseas students over the last three years were $85,236 in 1972-73, $85,736 in 1973-74 and $35,605 in 1974-75.

* The total amount allocated to meet the **welfare** needs of private and sponsored overseas students studying in Australia in 1 974-75 is estimated at $360,000.

* The location of the overall responsibility for providing assistance to overseas students with the Australian Development Assistance Agency, and the specific nature of the **welfare** programs for overseas students, safeguards any possible duplication of expenditures on this purpose.

* Could the Minister inform the House what devastating effects there will be on recipients of social **welfare** payments and patients in nursing homes, and indeed on nursing homes themselves, should a cutback in his Department of 8 per cent take place?

* Is he able to say whether these surveys normally form an essential basis for the **welfare** policies of most other advanced countries.

* What a curious idea particularly when even the Opposition must by now recognise that it was a failure of the private sector in Australia to earn profits- this was under the Labor Government's profit bashing activitieswhich brought about a diminution in the pool of resources from which we were trying to pay for **welfare**, from which we were trying to meet all the demands of our society.

* If you do not replenish that pool, if you do not provide the money or the national wealth from which to meet the demands of **welfare**, if you keep paying with non-existent Hayden cheques on a nonexistent bank account, then you simply destroy out society.

* It is the extent to which any government's capacity to make **welfare** payments to the needy in the society is being diminished by the massive cost of making those payments, the huge rises in administrative costs.

* An increasing amount of its moneymoney that should be going in **welfare** payments -is now going in administrative costs.

* There were massive increases and, I would submit, to a large degree inefficient increases in the actual methods by which **welfare** was handed out.

* We are seeing money that we would have hoped might have been available for **welfare** ending up in the hands of the postal authorities which are now, of course, in a separate organisation.

* It strikes me that this is a most unfortunate feature of what inflation does to our capacity to pay **welfare** to the community of this nation.

* As a result, $100m of the social **welfare** vote is to go into the area of administration and salaries instead of to pensioners.

* It is obvious that a large proportion of this amount would have to go to the administrators anyway no matter how well organised the payment of **welfare** was in this nation.

* What I do say is that many of the **welfare** benefits that over the years have made up a large part of the spectrum of **welfare** in Australia are inefficient.

* Many **welfare** payments, particularly small once off payments for special historically sound but now economically unreasonable benefits, simply cost too much to administer because of the massive rise in wages that has taken place, particularly over the last 3 years of uncontrolled and irresponsible inflation.

* It strikes me that when we are looking at ways of saving money, or conversely of increasing the proportion of the **welfare** vote that actually goes to pensioners or to others in receipt of **welfare**, surely we should be examining how to make certain that these inefficient benefits can be replaced by efficient ones.

* In other words, I am suggesting that there are many opportunities for looking at the efficiency of **welfare** payments, many of which could well be removed because they involve single one off payments or are expensive to issue.

* In other words, although not taking anything away from **welfare** we should make certain that the bulk of the **welfare** money goes to the people who should be receiving it.

* We cannot afford, and the pensioners of this nation cannot afford, to see such ever increasing proportions of the **welfare** dollar going in salaries and administrative costs.

* When talking about the pool from which **welfare** money is distributed- that is, the pool of accumulated profits of the society and wages earned in the society as a result of active profitability and an active private sector- the PA Consulting Services Pty Limited report on business profitability showed that almost three out of every four industry groups in Australia suffered a lower return on shareholders funds after tax and interest in the latest year.

* It has attacked our capacity to have the resources to pay **welfare**.

* Let us now look at ways by which we can improve our payment of **welfare**, within the constraints that have been set upon us by the chaotic and inefficient economic policy of the last 3 years.

* In the Governor-General's Speech mention is made of the critical importance of voluntary **welfare** organisations.

* They are quite open about their declared policy of phasing out all government **welfare** schemes.

* Those advertisements tersely state its objective and urge support for what it calls voluntaryism and private **welfare**.

* Like the Government, its spokesmen attack the middle income groups as the main recipients of **welfare** benefits, the bureaucrats and **welfare** workers.

* Compare the similar deprecation of the 
The Workers Party spokesmen are more frank than the Government in their attitude to the recipients of **welfare**.

* Politicians, too, are identified by the Workers Party as persons having a vested interest in a burgeoning and inefficient **welfare** system.

* It is argued that new and elaborate **welfare** systems buy popularity and votes.

* There may well be an electoral backlash against public servants, social workers and social **welfare** which is not wholly unjustified, but it extends also to the more vulnerable people who depend on **welfare** to survive, and that is wholly unjustified.

* It is not inconceivable that cuts in **welfare** spending could become extremely popular.

* To set these communities against one another and to set out cynically on an electoral strategy to destroy the **welfare** system because of short term political ends is an ignoble purpose.

* There should be arguments in this House about the effective delivery of **welfare** services.

* He talked of the different views on providing **welfare**- whether it should be a universal or a selective basis.

* The new federalism means dual taxation; it means double taxation; it means the end of the system of uniform taxation which has served Australia well since World War II; it means the withdrawal of the Federal Government from all creative programs and all responsibilities for the people's **welfare** and the nation's advancement.

* Under the Fraser federalism the real creative co-operation between State and federal governments- the co-operation that has been the basis of all new initiatives and all constructive ventures for the people's **welfare** since the War- would be destroyed in reality and in spirit.

* Every initiative in public **welfare** or national development since the war has been taken by the Federal Government or with its participation.

* There was no **welfare** housing in this country before the Federal Government made it happen.

* Uniform taxation was introduced in this country because we recognised, as a nation, that the States were so disparate and diverse, so unequal in their populations and their tax resources, that without a coordinating and overriding Federal responsibility for growth, **welfare** and development, the very ideal of federation would be at risk; pressures and disparaties among the States would produce a grossly unequal and therefore divided nation.

* She made a very notable contribution especially to social **welfare** and to the advancement of Australian Aboriginals.

* The attention of the Government should be directed also to its lack of action in endeavouring to do what this motion suggests, that is, that the Government should take urgent action to ensure that those people who are dependent on superannuation and **welfare** payments are not adversely prejudiced by the economic mismanagement of this Government.

* This Government should take action to restrict the effects of inflation on people on low incomes, people on superannuation and people receiving **welfare** payments.

* People receiving **welfare** payments are in many instances in an even worse position than those on superannuation.

* We know that the amounts paid in **welfare** benefits have increased but it is what those dollars buy that really counts.

* So it is not a matter of just gradually increasing the actual money value of these payments that are being made to people receiving **welfare** benefits and superannuation payments.

* Large scale unemployment brings about the need for **welfare** payments to be made.

* It is directly related to the number of people who are forced into receiving **welfare** payments.

* When these people erode their savings, when they use them up, they simply have to go on to **welfare** benefits.

* The report continues: 
This will involve both direct measures to increase the incomes of.poor people and **welfare** services to prevent poverty, which should be fitted into a long-term policy for the distribution of the growth of national income.

* During this period of very rapidly rising inflation has the Government even considered trying to restore the purchasing power of the pension by adjusting pensions and **welfare** payments more regularly?

* If inflation gets up to around 20 per cent adjustments will have to be more frequent in order to make it possible for recipients to come closer to preserving the real level of income required over a long term for them to have some sort of stability in their **welfare** and superannuation payments, but particularly **welfare** payments.

* However, there should be no real problem in the Australian Government's obtaining the funds required to finance **welfare** programs and to meet their high costs due to inflation because in the economy as a whole money incomes tend to rise rapidly in line with the inflation rate.

* Let those people on **welfare** payments and superannuation benefits remember that point.

* This Government pretends that it is interested in the **welfare** of the people.

* An examination of the Budget will reveal that 36% of the proposed expenditure will go to the States; 14% has been allocated to defence purposes; 23% to expenditure on national **welfare** and repatriation measures; and 2% to external aid.

* I move on now to social **welfare**.

* If we do not achieve this we will crowd out opportunities for expenditure in other important social **welfare**, education and job creation areas.

* There is one guarantee that I can give the House and the nation and that is that the Government will not sit idly by and watch the mounting health bill in Australia consume our social **welfare** dollar to the extent that it has done over the last six years.

* I appreciate the particular concern of the honourable member for Franklin and his deep interest in the **welfare** of the people living in those areas.

* Of course there are things like payments to the States and payments out of the National **Welfare** Fund which are automatically appropriated.

* -The Social **Welfare** Commission (Repeal) Bill entices one to engage in the kind of philosophical discussion that we have been listening to and I would like to proceed along those lines for a short time.

* This Commission, which was established by this Parliament 3 years ago, was a concept that was related to the need to evaluate social **welfare** provisions in Australia.

* It was part of the Labor Parry's enterprise and interest in upgrading the whole emphasis on social **welfare** and maybe it has proved to be other than the best structure or the best way to approach this problem, but it was a most laudable objective indeed.

* They were very great hopes and were held not only by the Commission but also by wide-ranging groups of organisations and individuals involved in social **welfare** programs throughout Australia.

* If the House accepts, as it did in 1973 when the enabling legislation was passed, that there does exist a need for an independent body to examine critically on a continuing basis social **welfare** requirements of government, we should note that the Budget allocation of a mere $75,000 to establish a policy research unit at the University of New South Wales is just not enough.

* No one questions the effectiveness and efficiency of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, for example, in its independent research and analysis capacities, and I suggest no one could question the establishment of a similar bureau to oversee social **welfare** programs.

* Clearly in times of economic constraints the wide and ambitious plans of the Social **Welfare** Commission would have to be modified in the short term, but what must be retained, whatever the cost, is the capacity for such a bureau to offer the Government and the public independent analysis of Government programs and areas of need of a high quality and standard.

* In addition, the membership of such committees is to be hand picked by the Minister rather than made up of delegates representing the organisations involved in social **welfare** undertakingsorganisations which have national, State and regional status.

* Obviously there is a need to have such a counterpart in planning objectivity in respect of social **welfare**, in respect of the social needs of communities.

* It had associated with it some 74 affiliated organisations, service clubs, **welfare** agencies and sporting organisations.

* It organised the preparation of the regional social **welfare** directory and in general terms it rendered a very great community service.

* Finally, mention must be made of Government attempts to kill the Social **Welfare** Commission before the repealing legislation was even drafted.

* I believe that in the short term at least it will provide some kind of on-going program- a link to what might be another Social **Welfare** Commission in a different form, a more effective organisation than the one contemplated at the moment.

* They have been urged in particular to give attention to ensuring that Aboriginals, especially juveniles, obtain appropriate legal representation in criminal matters; to meet the needs of rural and remote area Aboriginals; to improving Aboriginal /Police relations; and to the possibility of using the services and resources of other agencies, where these are appropriate and accessible including those of Aboriginal and community **welfare** organisations, the Australian Legal Aid Office, the Law Society and the Public Solicitor.

* Further, as the Treasurer is a member of the Social **Welfare** Policy Committee of Cabinet, will the Acting Treasurer ask the Treasurer whether he will also refer the proposals for analysis and report by the Social **Welfare** Policy Secretariat which was established by the Government to co-ordinate development of **welfare** policy?

* They are not interested in the **welfare** of Australia, they are not interested in the system of Parliament and they are not interested in the Westminster system of government.

* They should not come in here three years later and complain, because when they were in Government, when they had the responsibility for the **welfare** of the Australian people, they demonstrated a total incapacity to carry it out.

* It was known as the NOW Centre-the North- West One-Stop **Welfare** Centre.

* It was established within the city of Coburg and was designed to bring together the full range of **welfare** services- the services of the Federal Department of Social Security, the services of the State Department of Social **Welfare** and the services provided by some of the voluntary agencies in that area.

* One of the most difficult problems for people receiving various forms of **welfare** is that they are shunted from one to another among a whole variety of officers who deal with various types of allowances or various aspects of what very often is part of a human problem which ought to be dealt with as a whole and not separately.

* My proposition is simply that the Government should consider the establishment in the city of Northcote of a Commonwealth Government centre which brings together the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Department of Social Security, possibly in some type of working relationship with **welfare** services provided by the Northcote Municipal Council and some of the voluntary agencies which exist in that city.

* That RANF take all necessary steps to close hospital beds to all non-urgent cases when properly trained nursing staff are not available for the adequate **welfare** of the patient.

* It proposes a costly, complex, cumbersome and ill-considered new bureaucratic **welfare** system for individuals in the industry, rather than providing assistance for real stabilisation of the industry itself.

* just becomes a form of **welfare** assistance.

* It is only a substitute for social **welfare** benefits.

* The Fraser Government is concerned about the **welfare** of children.

* I want to make it perfectly clear to honourable members in this House that the Government is committed to the **welfare** of children and is concerned with their problems.

* It was  Sir Winston  Churchill who once said, I think in 1938, that one of the great paradoxes of socialist governments is that from the day they assume office they tend to erode the foundations upon which private enterprise functions and thus destroy their own capacity to implement their ambitious social **welfare** programs.

* Its social **welfare** programs had plenty of merit, but in trying to implement them the former Government practically destroyed the whole foundations and the fabric of the Australian economy, which would have rendered impossible the discharge of even the most paltry assistance to areas of need.
