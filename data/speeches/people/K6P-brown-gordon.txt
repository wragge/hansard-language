Has the Minister representing the Minister for Defence seen an article entitled 'Service Wrangle Threatens New Plane' which appeared in the Melbourne 'Herald' on Wednesday, 8th September 1971? Is there any substance in the report that a row between the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army is threatening the future of the Government Aircraft Factories Project N light transport plane? If there is, will the Minister take urgent steps to have the matter resolved quickly and thus avoid any further disastrous effects on the aircraft industry's already under-utilised capacity? 
I think I may be excused for saying that Project N is near and dear to my heart. It was during my term as Minister for Supply that the decision was taken to proceed to build prototypes in the hope that we would be able to create finally a viable aircraft such as the Project N aircraft. Basic to the issue, of course, is the order book. As I have said before in this chamber, the order book is significant enough to justify tooling up for a type of aircraft. Built into this is the hope - it has been the hope all along - that the Service departments would state a requirement. In other words, if the Army or the RAAF says that it has a requirement for X number of aircraft we then have the first hard core of orders on the way. 
I understand discussions are going on within the Services about indicating  a  requirement, but I would not think this matter would be in the order of disputation that the honourable senator has picked up out of a Press comment. In the final analysis it will be the Minister for Defence who will report to the Government on this matter and who will make the decisions on it. I am very confident - I say this now as Minister for Health and not as Minister for Supply - that Project N will have a requirement and that it will prove to be a wonderful achievement on the part of the Australian aircraft industry.
