-The fact that we are debating this Commonwealth Electoral Bill for the fourth time is in itself an explanation of the chaotic position in which we find our economy, our society and our nation- a nation that was described in the Press yesterday as being on the brink of anarchy, a nation that is supposed by many to be tottering on the brink of economic chaos, a country with increasing unemployment, high and rising inflation and an incredible increase in the number of strikes. This has occurred because, rather than have the Parliament consider economic measures, the Government has placed economic management in its 'too hard' basket and concerns itself with electoral redistribution. The Government has charge of the business of the Parliament. The Government could have brought forward other matters if it regarded them as more important. It brought back the Bills which were made the subject of the double dissolution and it deliberately chose matters such as electoral redistribution rather than matters such as trade practices or conciliation and arbitration- matters about which the Government has complained that the Senate has not acted as it should have done. Obviously none of those latter matters was considered by the Government to be of high priority. 
The people of Australia already have had the opportunity to express their view about the importance they place on electoral redistribution in our present circumstances. They were given the chance in a referendum and they very clearly voted no. Yet today we find ourselves here, forced by this Government to debate again, for the fourth time, the question of electoral redistribution for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member for Grayndler and Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  has attacked the Australian Country Party which, as we know, represents many of the farmers of Australia. He has shown that his only interest and the Government's only interest in farming is in farming electorates. This matter has no relevance to solving any of the major problems of the day. 
As the honourable member for McPherson,  Mr Eric  Robinson, has said, the real importance of the Bill is that the Australian Labor Party sees it as a matter of its own survival as a government. On the present basis of distribution and the present system of arriving at that distribution, the ALP has won two of the last three elections. One would have thought that it might be content with that situation and prepared to say: 'In those circumstances we do not want to change it'. One would have thought that bearing in mind the fact that there has to be a redistribution following the census in 1976 it might also say: 'It is so close. Why change it now?' But I think the important point, as I believe has been made earlier in the day, is that the Government faces an election before that next redistribution would be through, and it wants to be able to redistribute to its own advantage before it has to face the electors again, because it knows what the situation is. It knows that the people of Australia are sick and tired of a government that puts economic management into its ' too hard ' basket. 
One may imagine that if we are to have redistributions based on the proposals contained in this Bill it could be necessary to have very frequent redistributions. The Government says, through its speakers here today and elsewhere , that it is really providing one vote one value. That simply is not true. There is no way that can be done. Not even daily redistributions would be able to provide that 
It is a sham, as was just said. It is a sham to say that this Bill or any similar Bill would provide truly for one vote one value. The real question is whether the plus or minus 10 per cent or the plus or minus 20 per cent discretion in redistribution is the better and the fairer. The arguments in relation to that have, I think, been put. From this side of the chamber arguments have been put effectively to suggest that 20 per cent is desirable and reasonable. Again I simply remind people that not only do we believe that that is reasonable but even the present Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  in 1955 believed that it was reasonable. That was before he found it necessary to change his mind. Presumably that was something Caucus did to him as well. Can we trust this Government? 
Thank you very much. Perhaps somebody who says that we can trust the Government would tell us why it is that in relation to the redistribution in the Northern Territory the Government that supposedly believes in open government has not yet told us or anybody else how it will go about it. It has not told us the method of redistribution. It has not told us whether we will there have a true one vote one value or how Aborigines will be treated. We have not heard whether the redistribution will be on a basis of population or on a basis of voters. In fact, we are waiting to hear. Presumably it will be after the redistribution that we will be let into the secret of how the Government is going about it. Clearly the position is that this Government wishes to have a redistribution to its own advantage. As  Senator Withers  so eloquently put it this morning, how could anybody trust the Government? How could the mothers of pre-school children trust it? How could the textile workers in my home city of Launceston trust it? How could anyone suffering inflation trust it when it won an election just a few months ago and promised everyone faithfully that only Whitlam and his Government would be able to save their employment, cure inflation and provide $130m for preschool care and education? Not one of those things has happened in Australia; the very reverse has happened. 
Reference has been made to the situation in Tasmania and the equitable nature of the proposals that are made. At the moment, I simply remind members, 45 per cent of the population of Tasmania has no voice in the House of Representatives of Australia. Forty-five per cent is unrepresented, and it will not make it any better to make the variation in the quota plus or minus 10 per cent as opposed to plus or minus 20 per cent. Some attacks were made on the role of the Senate by none other than the great selfproclaimed democrat, the Prime Minister. He referred to the Senate white-anting democracy, but I simply remind him and others that the Senate has just been re-elected. It has been reelected on a fair and democratic basis and it has been re-elected with a job to do. It has been reelected to keep an eye on a government that the people of Australia obviously are not prepared to trust with the full power over both Houses. 
Reference has also been made to the question of a gerrymander. I thought it would be interesting to contemplate the origin of the word 'gerrymander'. Of course, as many know, it was named after Governor Gerry of Massachusetts in the United States of America who approved an electorate which was so distorted to his Party's advantage that it was in a peculiar shape, looking a little like a salamander. Now, let us bring the situation up to date. The Australian Labor Party, and particularly the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  wants very frequent redistributions- one next year and one in a couple of years time. Presumably he will go down in history as having provided the Dalymander. Let us consider for a moment the role of the Senate. I think  Sir Winston  Churchill is worthy of being quoted in this chamber. In November 1947 referring to the Parliament Bill then being debated in the House of Commons he stated: 
Of course, there must be proper Executive power to any Government, but our British, our English idea, in a special sense, has always been a system of balanced rights and divided authority, with many other persons and organised bodies having to be considered besides the Government of the day and the officials they employ . . .All this idea of a handful of men getting hold of the State machine, having the right to make the people do what suits their party and personal interests or doctrine is completely contrary to every conception of surviving western democracy. 
Yet that is what this Government, and in particular this Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  would have us believe should happen in this country. He would wish to abolish the Senate. He would wish to be able to gerrymander or Dalymander the electorates. He would wish to be able to denigrate the Senate in carrying out its constitutional function which has just been reinforced by the people of Australia in a fully democratic vote. I think that perhaps we can have regard to what Professor Keeton said in his book called 'The Passing of Parliament'. He stated: 
The regimes of both Mussolini and Hitler, it will be remembered, began in exactly the same way, and inasmuch as  Sir Stafford  points out that all opposition to government policy is to be treated as sabotage, it is clear that the dissolution of an effective parliamentary opposition would rank high on the list of priorities. 
This morning  Mr Whitlam  quoted  Senator Wright.  I also quote  Senator Wright.  In the Report of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review he is reported in this way: 
Opposition to any Government view in the Senate is no longer graced with the term opposing view. It is something to be disparaged. It is 'obstruction' by the Senate. 
I think that is the best explanation which can be given of why we have had attack after attack made upon the Senate during the debate today. This debate is irrelevant. This debate will not solve any of the problems of the country. This debate has been brought about solely by the selfinterest of the Australian Labor Party in endeavouring to entrench itself in a way which is in the interests neither of the nation nor of the economy which the Government is charged to administer. Let us concern ourselves with how this Parliament can benefit the nation and not just the Australian Labor Party. Let us get back to the real work. Let us have some proposals for economic management and community development. 
I wish to make a personal explanation. 
-Yes. The previous  speaker, Mr Keating,  has referred to me by name and to a report which, by the Press, has been given partly my name. It is a report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. He has referred to that report as a support for this legislation. That is, in my view, a misrepresentation. Our Committee, I believe, set out to be objective. 
-It is to be regretted that  Mr Keating  of the Australian Labor Party is not prepared to be equally objective. (Government supporters interjecting)- 
The report is, I believe, a very - 
-I do not propose to debate it. 
Thank you,  Mr Chairman.  That is all I wish to say. I claim that I have been misrepresented insofar as my name has been used in any way to support this type of legislation. I believe that the report to which reference has been made is a very strong case for reform of the securities industry, but not for the nationalisation of the mining industry. Any suggestion that I support the nationalisation of the mining industry through this legislation is a gross misrepresentation. 

 Mr KEATING (Blaxland)-I wish to make a personal explanation. 
Opposition supporters- Apologise!
