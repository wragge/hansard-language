Yes, what a sham. A lot of the trouble being experienced in Australia's most populous State is due entirely to the fact that New South Wales had for 24 years a Labor Government that ignored completely the need to initiate a decentralisation policy, allowed congestion of population in Sydney and helped to create one of Australia's biggest social and economic problems today. We are paying a penalty for 24 years of Labor government in the post war reconstruction years when Labor did not attempt in a constructive way to find a solution to the centralisation of growth and population. 
Today we are burdened with the tremendous problem of trying to find a formula for a way out of the urban traffic problem. The Australian Transport Advisory Council has asked the Bureau of Transport Economics to conduct a survey to ascertain the cost of overcoming the metropolitan public urban transport problem. It will cost millions of dollars and involve tremendous environmental and pollution problems. Honourable members should not think for one moment that the Labor Party has had a comprehensive and well thought through decentralisation policy because in New South Wales, my home State, there was no such policy. Since the Liberal and Country Party Government came into office in New South Wales 600 industries have been established in 150 different country centres, some of which may have been small country towns. In the electorate of the honourable member for Hume  (Mr Pettitt)  many industries have been assisted by the State Government. Those industries are essentia] because they provide employment and a more diversified economy in the regions concerned. Of that 600, 145 have been metropolitan based industries that have transferred the whole or a considerable segment of their manufacturing operations to country centres. A further 12 have been overseas firms which have been encouraged by the New South Wales Government to go straight to decentralised locations with the assistance of the Department of Decentralisation and Development. 
It has been extremely carefully calculated that as a result of the policy followed by the New South Wales Liberal and Country Party Government approximately 65,000 men, women and children have been retained in New South Wales country areas who otherwise would have had to find job opportunities and housing facilities in metropolitan areas. That illustrates the difference between what the present New South Wales Government has done since 1965 and what the previous Labor Government did in the preceding 24 years. It is one of the tragedies that New South Wales has had to face. I think we need to keep our feet on the ground and keep the political aspects of this problem in correct perspective. Following the election of a Liberal and Country Party Government in New South Wales, that Stale was the first to appoint a Minister for Decentralisation and Development, the honourable John Fuller. What a tremendous step it was in fulfilling a Country Party objective. 
The Commonwealth Government has been responsible for enormous expenditure in Canberra, Australia's largest inland city, as well as in the Northern Territory where there is a population growth rate of between 10 per cent and 11 per cent. Financial assistance in the form of grants has been given to the States for their respective decentralisation programmes, for the establishment of defence installations in decentralised locations such as Salisbury and Townsville, and through the petroleum prices equalisation scheme which was designed to make the price differential for petrol no greater than the equivalent of 4 pence a gallon in any part of Australia. The whole purpose behind that policy was to make it as attractive as possible for operators using petroleum to conduct their business in country areas. 
Financial assistance has been granted for travel by rural workers under certain circumstances; subsidies have been paid to employers taking more than the normal number of apprentices; goods and services have been provided in decentralised areas by the Commonwealth in the areas of cultural and recreational facilities, public health, welfare and housing. That is the range of measures which have been taken to try to overcome the immediate problem, but there is not the slightest doubt that it will require the co-operation of the Commonwealth, States and local governing authorities to overcome the problem in this very important area of decentralisation or comprehensive balanced development. 
In Orange on 20th February this year  Mr Cutler,  the  Deputy  Premier and Leader of the Country Party in New South Wales, said that despite major efforts on the State level in New South Wales it was obvious that a complete and comprehensive programme of decentralisation was beyond State resources. He continued: 
There is a desperate need for a co-ordinated national programme in view of the large sums of money needed and also because of the intense rivalry between States. 
Parochialism has hindered decentralisation throughout Australia's history and consideration may have to be given to the establishment of entirely new decentralised cities as in Great Britain. 
Census statistics for New South Wales released this month show that approximately 69 per cent of the State's population live in the NewcastleSydneyWollongong complex. 
I think that the Australian people living in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne have realised that if Australia continues to develop along the lines on --which it has developed a serious social and economic problem will face their children in the years that lie ahead. I think that the time is ripe for governments - Commonwealth, State and local - to join hands to overcome what is a very serious problem regarding decentralisation. I have no opposition whatsoever to the concept of adopting a joint approach to this question, but I do object very strongly to the Commonwealth Government pushing itself over the top of the sovereign rights of the States. If the Australian people want balanced development in both city and country areas they must overcome their present parochial attitudes and look for national solutions to this problem. In this the Commonwealth will always be willing to co-operate, but it must be done on a CommonwealthStatelocal government basis. 
One of the tragedies of the non-Labor side of politics in Australia is that it almost invariably stands against the extension of the franchise to its fullest. Today, with the experience that I have behind me in the matters of electoral redistribution and electoral reform, I thought, when listening to the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  and the Leader of the Australian Country Party  (Mr Anthony),  that I was back in South Australia listening to members of the Legislative Council. Apart from the 2 remarks of the Leader of the Opposition relating to the change of mind of the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  and to the capacity that the 20 per cent variation gave for a better allowance, in his view, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country Party simply laid bare the poverty of their parties' attitudes to electoral reform. There is no doubt that on this issue both sides of politics in Australia use different dictionaries. Both sides say that they believe in equal representation, in one vote one value, but then go on to give their different interpretations. If at this stage my view happens to be that of the Bill brought in by a Labor government I am not ashamed to say so. The speech of the Leader of the Australian Country Party was, in fact, a travesty of what he said previously. I shall quote his remarks made in previous debates, if I may,  Mr Chairman,  soon. 
The issue surely is based on 2 facts or 2 studies, the first concerning the justice of the legislation, standing in its own right, and the second concerning the claim of the Government to it. I think they are the 2 issues which are paramount in this debate. It would seem that the Liberal and Country Parties, represented in the debate on the Commonwealth Electoral Bill (No. 2) 1973 in the last session, I understand, by the Leader of the Australian Country Party, speaking for both parties, must have made a judgment that it is better to gain some political advantage by the effect that the wider distribution, the quota variation of 20 per cent, will have on boundaries than to see a reduction in their advantage by the criticism that they stand against the extension of the franchise in this way. It is incredible to me that the Liberal Party, at least, can stand against the full implementation of this Bill. I wonder how any person on the Opposition side who calls himself a Liberal can stand behind the Leader of the Country Party in what he said to the House previously. I say that on behalf of my Party which, in South Australia, is beginning to be widely recognised as a far more Liberal party than those that have gone before. 
The basis of the last election is contained in a number of statements made by leading political figures. The Leader of the Liberal Party,  Mr Snedden,  said on 4 April this year. 
Now is the time to put it to the choice of the Australian people. 
He was speaking generally of the Opposition's dissension with the Government. He went on to make this key statement: 
The people of Australia did not give a mandate to this Government to change the whole nature of the Australian democracy. If that is to happen, it can happen only by the freely expressed will of the Australian people. The only way to determine that is by an election for the government of Australia. 
His colleague the Leader of the Country Party, speaking on the same day in the program called 'A Current Affair', said this of the Government: 
It's exceeded its mandate and I believe the Australian people have a right to reassess their point of view and to affirm or reject the Government that it put into office 18 months ago. It 's a case now of whether the Australian people still feel the same as they did in 1972. 
They were the words of the Leader of the Country Party in setting up the election. 
-The Leader of the Country Party tries to distract me.  His  20-minute speech was a distraction and did not deal with the issues. The Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  in setting up the election, said: 
Why do we take this course of action? The Opposition and the Opposition parties- I hope my friends and allies will not object to my including them in this statement-when the Electoral Bill first came before the Senate last year - 
I interpose to point out that he mentioned the Electoral Bill: decided to vote against it. We knew full well that we were embarking upon a course which could lead to a double dissolution. 
Later he went on to say: 
As far as we are concerned, the sooner the Prime Minister sees the Governor-General and obtains his double dissolution and this matter is resolved by the people, the better . . . 
In setting up the double dissolution the Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate specifically mentioned the Electoral Bill. 
We can have more distractions if honourable members would like to speak of them, but I am dealing with the Bill. It is quite clear that the Opposition parties in both Houses of the Parliament set up the election as a test for the Government. They said so clearly in so many words, and at various times mentioned specific issues. There is no doubt that this Government has a very fair claim to the Bills which it is presenting to this Joint Sitting. Whilst it is somewhat difficult for new members of the Parliament to vote according to that premise, because they did not have a hand in causing the double dissolution, I believe that former members of the Parliament who have been returned certainly should support the result of this Joint Sitting. There is no other way to look at Australian democracy. Not to do so would be to deny constitutional representative government in Australia and to set up a dictatorship in a House which is not based on that form of representation. 
I have a history of involvement in electoral reform in South Australia, as I have said. I could recite the long list of quotations which I have here and which would make honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives think that they were listening to  Mr Snedden  or  Mr Anthony.  They are words spoken by legislative councillors in South Australia who went through the old theme. While they might believe in equality of representation they have a different view of what 'equality' means. They perpetuate the myth, which in itself denigrates country people, that country people are beset with particular disadvantages and therefore should have electoral advantages. I have seen members of a party move through country areas telling country people for decades how disadvantaged they are and at the same time, in a parallel fashion and as a result, they have drawn that countryside down to a position where it has been ridiculed by democrats. It is the result of the Party that has so implanted that undemocratic viewpoint in the minds of country people. I am pleased to say that there are many country districts in South Australia which are now accepting the view that there should be equal value through one vote one value. In the recent byelection which was held to fill the vacancy created when I became a member of the Senate, the Liberal Movement won the State seat on a policy of one vote one value in one of the more conservative country areas in South Australia. It only needs to be held up as a fair thing and people will know and believe it. 
What does the Opposition say outside of this debate and other debates on this Bill? I would like to quote several passages. In a speech on 20 March 1 973, on this same Bill,  Mr Snedden  said: 
Our purpose is to maintain, as far as is practicable and fair, the principle of one vote, one value. We wish to ensure that electoral results will reflect the opinion of the majority. If the electoral processes are manipulated to serve the political interests of persons or parties it would be a denial of democracy and a travesty of the electoral process. 
He then went on to say: 
The potential movement of population is fundamental to the proper establishment of electorates. 

 Mr Anthony, in a speech on 10 July 1 974, said: 
This Bill really represents the latest attempt by the Government to destroy the just and fair principles on which electoral distributions have been conducted since federation. 
He went on to say: 
I believe there is a principle of equal, if not greater importance than the mechanical  theoretical  principle of one vote one value, and that is the principle of equality of representation. 
That is where, in  Mr Anthony's  view, the area of an electorate transcends the value of what people say on their own behalf as individuals. In the last debate on this legislation in this House he spoke on behalf of the Opposition in promoting that view. I wonder how many Liberals there are who will sit subjugated on the Opposition side when the vote is taken today. When we look aside from the justification as to whether a person should have an equal right in respect of Bills of great moment which affect his future and which are passed through this Parliament, and when we look past the basic claim of government after a double dissolution on this legislation, we can look to the more mundane justification of the difference in numbers which has already been referred to today. 
Looking at my own State of South Australia I find that in 1968, which I believe was the time of the first election after the previous redistribution, the number of voters for the seat of Bonython was fixed at 49,000, for Kingston at 51,000 and for Wakefield at 46,000. In Bonython the number has grown from 49,000 to 80,000; in Kingston from 51,000 to 72,000; and in Wakefield from 46,000 to 49,000. Therefore, Wakefield is up 8 per cent, Kingston is up 42 per cent, and Bonython is up 62 per cent. As I am an anti-Labor politician - 
Opposition members- Ah! 
Yes, I knew. As a matter of fact,  Mr Chairman,  I threw that in for effect. I have seen in my State a so-called non Labor party destroy itself because it claimed it was anti-Labor by saying that it had, in effect, the divine right to govern. If those members opposite who sit to your left,  Mr Chairman,  will some day understand that they do not have a divine right to govern but that they have to earn it they might return to this side of the House a lot more swiftly than they are likely to return at the moment because the speeches that have been given here today will not stand the analysis of any secondary school child in Australia. 
I heard one  speaker  from this side of the House- I think it was the Prime Minister- quote a passage from a speech by  Sir Robert  Menzies. There is still a member of this chamber who also had something to say about blockages which are created in the Senate. In 1953 the then  Senator J.  G. Gorton had something to say about blockages in the Senate. All I can say is that as we look out across the disruption in Australia we certainly find that it starts at the top, and it starts right here in federal Parliament. Unless members of the Opposition understand the consequences of the Constitution and the view that the Australian public will have of its consequences, they will certainly be condemned to that side of the House. There is a very real need to understand that these issues are ones to which the Government now has a very fair claim. 
I will vote, if I can move very briefly aside for the moment, against the other measures which the Government will present to this Joint Sitting and that,  Mr Chairman,  is not because of any particular views held by people on your left. I will certainly vote for this Bill and the two other allied electoral Bills. Any person who studies the history of the generation of this Joint Sitting will know that in 1974 anyone who stands against extension of the franchise stands against his own political future.
