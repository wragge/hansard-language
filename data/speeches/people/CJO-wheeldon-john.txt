We have had a most extraordinary performance tonight from my predecessor at the podium the honourable member for the Northern Territory  (Mr Calder).  I am afraid that in the past nobody told me that I should rush down to the House of Representatives to hear him speak, so this is the first time that I have had the pleasure of hearing him entertain us. I thought that perhaps at this late hour, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory, he would have thrown some light on some of the curious performances that we have seen coming from his colleagues with regard the entitlements of the Australian people to vote. I thought that as the member for the Northern Territory he might have been able to explain to us how it is that when the Opposition approaches the voting rights of those people who are entitled to a vote it says that their electorates should be gerrymandered, and when it comes to the voting entitlements of those people who are not entitled to vote it says they should not be able to vote at all. Ultimately we found that  Mr Calder  indicated an intention to cross the floor to vote with us, but not without a valiant effort to get himself thrown out of this Joint Sitting by deliberately provoking the Chair, by deliberately acting in such a way that in any other sitting, if we had not had such a tolerant Acting  Chairman  as you,  Sir, he  would have been ejected from the chamber. Of course, he wanted to be ejected from the chamber so that he would not have to cross the floor and vote with us and go back and answer to the people of the Northern Territory as to why he had repeatedly betrayed them in the Parliament. 
What a sorry performance we have seen tonight. But certainly it was only one of a series of very sorry performances that we have been watching all today. Perhaps in the past it could have been argued that there was something wrong with having the proceedings of Parliament televised. But if ever anyone could be open to the conviction that Parliament ought to be the subject of non-stop televising, today's proceedings would have justified such an argument. Today the Australian people have had revealed to them a series of spokesmen from the Opposition parties whose main goal during the whole of this Joint Sitting has been to deprive the Australian people of the right democratically to elect the Parliament of this country. That has been the whole purpose of their actions today. 
Let us have a look at the proposals that are before the Joint Sitting. These proposals are that there should be 2 senators from each of the Territories of Australia. What advantage is there for the Australian Labor Party in saying that there should be 2 senators from each of the Territories? Are members of the Opposition parties being so complimentary to us as to say that the Australian Labor Party will receive over twothirds of the votes in each of those Territories and thus have its senators elected? Are they saying that we shall therefore obtain a majority by the means of giving the franchise to our fellow Australians who live inside these Territories? Do they say that over two-thirds of the people in these 2 Territories support the Australian Labor Party? If that is what they want to say then let them stand up and say it. 
If that is not what they say, then what are they saying? Are they saying that the Territories should continue to be unrepresented in the Parliament? The people of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are affected by the laws which are made by this Parliament just as much as any Australian citizen living in any of the 6 States. We believe that it is intolerable that any Australian, wherever he may live, whatever his ethnic origin or whatever his educational standard may be, should be deprived of the right to vote in the election of the Parliament of the Australian people. This is what is being resisted today by the Opposition. 
I dare say that members of the Opposition could be suspicious about these matters. I suppose that they think that somebody will play a dirty trick on them because of their experience in playing dirty tricks themselves. Did they not repeatedly inside the Parliament vote against the member for the Northern Territory having a vote in the House of Representatives until the Country Party gained a member from the Northern Territory? Did they not down the years, when the Australian Labor Party proposed that a vote should be given to the Northern Territory, deny the right of the people of the Northern Territory to have a vote? They did this, not because of any democratic principle, but because all they believe in is the gerrymander. They operate under the principle of government by gerrymander. Like all people whose moral sensibilities are blunted they are unable to believe that anyone else has any motives other than the base motives which they themselves have. 
What conceivable difference can it make from a party point of view if there are 2 senators from each Territory elected on the basis of proportional representation? Does not reason suggest that there will be one member in support of the Government and one member in support of the Opposition elected from each of these Territories? Does anyone have any arguments to suggest that we shall gain more than one senator from either of those Territories? If so, it is only because the support for our Party in those Territories must be so overwhelming. I should think that if  Mr Calder  were to be seen frequently by the people of the Northern Territory on whatever television sets there are in the Northern Territory, perhaps he would be correct and we would have 2 senators from the Northern Territory. 
What sort of arguments have we heard today from some of the constitutional sages from the other side of the Parliament?  Senator Greenwood  told us with great indignation how shocking it is that the House of Representatives should have made decisions about the constitution of the Senate when the Senate did not want to have its membership changed in this way. He told us how deplorable it is that a Labor dominated House of Representatives should dare to offer its opinion on the membership of the Senate. I am afraid that I have not heard that argument from Opposition senators when the composition of the House of Representatives has been debated in the Senate. I have not heard  Senator Greenwood  and his colleagues say: 'If the House of 
Representatives has decided that there should be an electoral Bill of a certain type, because we belong to another House we shall abstain from voting on this matter or we shall do what the House of Representatives wants'. What is the point that  Senator Greenwood  was making? It is that the House of Representatives is not entitled to deliberate on the composition of the Senate but the Senate is entitled to deliberate on the composition of the House of Representatives. Although he did not say it, what is the reason? The reason is that in the House of government the Australian Labor Party has a majority to which it was elected, and in the Senate a combination of misfit organisations holds a majority owing to the flukes of preferential voting. 

 Senator Greenwood also told us that we would have to be very wary because the Labor Party would engage in bribery and all sorts of public works would be introduced into the Northern Territory apparently to gain 2 senators. I must say that as a senator from Western Australia I find it mind boggling to hear somebody from the Opposition benches talking about the bribery of electors; to hear the people who gave us the Ord scheme talking about bribery of electors when we well know that the only purpose of the introduction of schemes of that type was to bribe certain electors in Western Australia some years ago when the previous Government was in well deserved difficulties. 
The honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  who has a great reverence for deceased politicians, was at great pains to describe to us what the founding fathers had done for us. I have always been a little mystified as to why the fact that someone was elected to Parliament in 1 899 makes him more sagacious than somebody who was elected to Parliament in 1974. Apparently, if we follow through the reasoning of the honourable member for Moreton, all wisdom ended with the Neanderthal man because anything that came after that is a shocking modern device cooked up by left wing socialists. The Australian Labor Party, whatever it may not be, is at least post-Neanderthal. We are unlike the Piltdown men opposite. I call them Piltdown men advisedly, because it may be remembered that the Piltdown man was constructed artificially. 
The Piltdown men opposite would tell us that, because a group of politicians amongst whom the Labor Movement was almost totally unrepresented, if not totally unrepresented, almost 80 years ago decided to devise a Constitution whose purpose would be to preserve the property rights of the wealthy citizens of that day, to withstand the scourge of the Peasants' 
Revolt of which they had recently read and to allay the fear that the events of the last 500 years might catch up with them, a Constitution of that type is with us forevermore and is never to be departed from, like the Three Estates of King Louis XVI. We reject that also. We believe that the Constitution of Australia has to be changed in order to move with the changes in the circumstances of our country. Since the foundation of this Commonwealth the political Labor movement has developed, giving representation to people who were not represented when the Constitution which we now have inflicted upon us was first presented to an unsuspecting group of colonials. 
The honourable member for Moreton has said that somehow or other, by some extraordinary circumstance, although the population of the Australian Capital Territory is 4 times that of the Northern Territory the Australian Capital Territory will have the same number of senators as the Northern Territory will have. I do not want to labour old points but surely, if population is the basis on which the honourable member for Moreton and his friends approach representation in the Senate, then they would have moved long ago to see that the representation of New South Wales and Tasmania respectively was adjusted. But no, that is sacred. If this doctrine which was handed down in 1895 by men with long white beards that all States should have equal representation is such a sacred doctrine, then surely the Opposition would say that all Territories ought to have equal representation too. 
In fact, we are the people who are in keeping with the founding fathers, not the honourable member for Moreton. But what have we done? What has the Australian Labor Party tried to do? We have tried to see that the people of these 2 Territories are represented in both Houses of the Australian Parliament. That is precisely it. We have done it on a basis whereby there will be 2 representatives from each of these 2 Territories. They are not States, but we believe they are entitled to have some representation. The representation from each of those Territories should be equal. We say that each of those 2 senators should be elected by the proportional representation system on each occasion that the elections take place. This is an inbuilt safeguard against any form of gerrymander. One might say that it is an inbuilt safeguard against any one party gaining both those seats. But why does the Opposition oppose the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill? The Opposition opposes the Bill because it hates the very thought of universal franchise. It is still fighting the wars which were fought before the first Reform Bill of 1832. 1 see that the honourable member for Kooyong  (Mr Peacock)  has apparently heard of it, but by the bemused faces of most of his colleagues apparently they have not yet caught up with it. I tell them that the reason they oppose this Bill tonight is for same reason that they have opposed the other proposals which have been before the Parliament the purpose of which was to see that, as far as was practical, there would be equal representation of each constituency in the House of Representatives. 
The Opposition hates the very thought of equal representation of the Australian people in the same way that it hates the thought of any representation of the Australian people. But, after all, in many respects the members on the Opposition side are quite correct in loathing democratic government. Their loathing of democratic government is not just some mere quirk, some mere eccentricity on their part. The reason they loathe democratic government is that they know that ultimately with democratic government the obsolete ideas and the selfish interests which they represent in this place will be swept away. We support democratic government because we believe that this country should be governed by the people . We believe that democratic government is the only form of government which the Australian people are entitled to have. Democratic government is a goal for which we shall continue to struggle despite all of the opposition of the moth-eaten, moss-backed reactionaries sitting on the left of the  Chairman  of this Joint Sitting.
