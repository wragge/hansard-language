I direct my question to the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister will recall his reply to a question on 20 August in which he said that one very well known and important member of the farming community wanted the Industries Assistance Commission report on superphosphate deferred until it was examined by the industry. I ask: How many other representatives of rural industry have urged the Government to adopt and implement the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission without delay? Why did the Minister choose to refer to the one negative request and to ignore the other positive request?
