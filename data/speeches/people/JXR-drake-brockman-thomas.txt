Before the suspension of the sitting for lunch the Joint Sitting was dealing with the Commonwealth Electoral Bill. The stated purpose of the Bill is to reduce the permissible variation in the number of voters in electorates from 20 per cent to 10 per cent above or below the quota. Before I rose to speak 9 speakers had taken part in the debate. Four of them have come from the Opposition side and the remainder have come from the Government side- or so I would have thought from listening to  Senator Hall.  Immediately before the suspension of the sitting the honourable member for Diamond Valley  (Mr McKenzie)  referred to the fact that he would not like to be a member of the Australian Country Party in this Parliament. I say to him that I have been a member of the Country Party in this Parliament for 16 years, and I am proud of it. My Party has been represented in this Parliament since 1919, and I think its record speaks for itself. The honourable member for Diamond Valley also referred to the significance of the altered tolerance, and he wanted to know why such great importance was placed on it. I will deal with that point later in my contribution. 
The Government has made great play about this Joint Sitting being an historic occasion. Not only is it an historic occasion, but it brings television to the Parliament for the first time. I am very glad that television has been brought to this Parliament on this occasion because it brings the Australian people right into this Parliament and allows them to see the merits and demerits of the Government case and the Opposition case. The people can judge the issues for themselves. I believe that after listening to Government speakers the people will be better informed of what the Government is trying to do by this Electoral Bill. I only regret that the television coverage will not spread into the distant parts of Australia so that those people who have pioneered this country and who are still pioneering it in many areas could, if they had television, hear and see how this Government is ignoring them in this legislation which provides for parliamentary representation in this Parliament. I will refer also to the areas that this Government has overlooked and that this Government is demoralising with its policies regarding the representation of rural people. 
I look firstly at what the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said when he opened this debate. He referred to the obstruction of his Government by the Opposition Parties in the Senate. I would much rather call it tactics, and I am quite sure that the Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, called it tactics when his Party in the Senate delayed, amended and defeated the previous Government's legislation that came before that chamber. We all remember that throughout 1973 and until the federal election in May, the Prime Minister led the Labor Party onslaught on the Senate. During the election campaign he stomped from one end of Australia to the other emotionally appealing to voters to give Labor a majority in the Senate. Day after day he argued that it was undemocratic and unfair that a government should be frustrated by senators who in some cases had been elected several years before Labor came to power. Very few voters in Australia could have failed to hear the Prime Minister's plea for Senate control. Yet what happened in the election? The people flatly refused to grant that extra power for which their Prime Minister asked. The Prime Minister obviously has failed to see the significance of that result. He either does not see or will not admit that the Australian people choose to elect the senators whom they prefer and not those whom the Prime Minister wants. 
Those who have already spoken in this debate have failed, I believe, to explain why there is a necessity for change. I recall that the Government put before the Senate two different Bills, the present Bill and another which was totally at variance with the concept of one vote one value. In other words, when the Senate was considering those Bills the Government had one foot in each camp. Today the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly),  the Minister responsible for this Bill, failed, in my view, to give any explanation as to why he wants to change the present system. I would have thought that the Minister would take the opportunity to explain to the people who are listening in why this legislation is necessary. But what did he do? All he did was stand up and castigate the Australian Country Party, a party that has given great service to this country. The Minister said that the Country Party received only 10.6 per cent of the total vote in Victoria. What he did not explain is that of the 34 seats in Victoria the Country Party stood for only six and won six. It obtained more than 50 per cent of the vote for the seats it contested. 
It has been pointed out time and time again during this debate and in other debates that the existing legislation has resulted in a great gerrymander which was perpetrated by the Country Party. But that is not true. If anyone wants evidence of a gerrymander he should have a look at the position in Queensland in 1949. The Government of the day had a redistribution which resulted in the Labor Government gaining 42 seats in the Parliament with 46 per cent of the vote. Forty-eight per cent of the vote gave the Liberal and Country parties 31 seats. Government supporters now say that in the past the Liberal Party and the Country Party have tried to create gerrymanders. 
I want to recall something else that the Government has said. The Labor Government has said repeatedly that the value of the vote of one citizen should be equivalent to the value of the vote of another. But let us come closer to the core of Labor's disagreement with the present electoral situation. With the 20 per cent variation in the quota, the average number of voters in country electorates is lower than the average number of voters in city electorates. So what the Labor Government is saying is that it is wrong for a country vote to have a greater mathematical value than a city vote. During this debate we have heard a great deal about the concept of one vote one value, but no speaker on the Government side of the chamber has made a prediction as to what difference this reduction in percentage variation will make to country areas. I believe that it will reverse all that country people have tried to do over the years. 
The Labor Government wants to increase the area of the electorate of Kalgoorlie, as the 
Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  said, from about 800,000 square miles to one million square miles. What does this proposal mean? It means a reduction in parliamentary representation for all people who live in that area, which is one of Australia's great areas, and a reduction in the ability of people in the electorate to communicate with each other. I believe that this is a most important aspect of all these proposed redistributions. I wonder what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie  (Mr Collard)  has to say on this matter. We will not know because in this debate up to the present, despite the statement by the Minister for Services and Property  (Mr Daly)  that the Labor Party, the Government of this country, holds more rural seats than any other Party, we have not heard from one Labor member who represents a rural area. 
-Why not? Because they are not game to speak. They know that the policies of the Labor Party have been detrimental to the people who live in the rural areas. There have been 4 speakers from the Government side. All of them, probably with one exception, come from densely populated areas. The one exception was the honourable member for Diamond Valley who represents an urban area in Victoria. I challenge those Labor Party members who represent rural areas to say where they stand on this Bill and whether they agree that their constituents in these vast areas should have a lesser degree of representation in this Parliament than they have now. They have said it in Caucus. Surely if they are game to say it in Caucus they should be game to tell the people, through this Parliament, where they stand. I have agreed not to speak at length. 1 believe that this Bill is a farce. It is detrimental to people living in the outlying areas of this country. For that reason, I oppose the Bill.
