 - Mr Chairman, those members both of this Parliament and of the general public who have followed today's proceedings with particular attention may have gathered by now that, to coin a phrase, this is an historic occasion. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden),  in his quaint way, went even further and called it an historical occasion. I must say that all the speeches confirm my view, which I have long held, that an awful lot of history must have been awfully dull. For that reason, I am grateful to the previous  speaker,  the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen),  who, no matter how abhorrent his politics, never manages to be dull, although tonight he was more concerned with the ghosts of the past than he was with the problems of today. 
What is the Opposition's case against the simple proposition that we put, which is that people living in the Australian Capital Territory and in the Northern Territory, being just as certainly citizens of Australia as are people living in New South Wales or Tasmania, are just as entitled to be represented in both Houses of the national Parliament? 
I will get around to  Senator Greenwood.  Fortunately, as is his wont, he has led with his chin a couple of times, and I will be glad to hang one on him in a moment. Some quite bizarre arguments have been put in support of the Opposition stand against the Government's proposals. Perhaps the most mind-boggling argument that has been advanced was that which was put by  Senator Drake-Brockman  in the Senate on 14 November 1973 when this matter was debated there. He said  ... the Senate is a States House and the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are not States. 
I do not want to debate the question of whether the Senate is just a States House. I suggest that this is a tired old cliche which is constantly being trotted out as some justification for the Senate's existence. I merely ask honourable members to ponder the statement made on 10 April last, the last day of sitting of the previous Parliament, by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,  Senator Withers,  who made a highly instructive remark. 
-He must constantly be reminded of this statement. It is nice to know that he has not repented. He said: 
We embarked on a course some 12 months ago-I am not trying to be provocative- to bring about the House of Representatives election. 
I take it from his interjection a moment ago that he does not resile from that extraordinary confession. Are they the words of a zealous custodian of States rights or are they the words of a jugular vein politician who is determined to use the Senate merely to reverse the freely expressed will of the people of Australia? But forgetting this States House fantasy for the moment, let us examine  Senator Drake-Brockman  's proposal more closely. Does it not come down to this: Because the Australian Capital Territory did not exist and in fact was not even in contemplation, and because the Northern Territory had only a handful of inhabitants at the time that the founding fathers wrote the Constitution, the citizens of these 2 areas of Australia are forever to be denied equality of representation in the national Parliament. What foundation in logic is there for a proposition like that? Are not Territorians people? What is there about living in a State rather than a Territory which makes a citizen - 

 -Mr Chairman, I was about to ask: What is there about living in a State rather than a Territory which makes a citizen need more protection against the depredations of the wicked House of Representatives? Those opposite must either abandon the arguments that were put by  Senator DrakeBrockman  or forget the fiction that the Senate is a States House, a fiction which was well and truly demolished this afternoon by the Minister for Manufacturing Industry  (Mr Enderby). 
In a period when our institutions are creaking at every joint, the last refuge of the idolators of the status quo is an appeal to the founding fathers- those wise men who brought the commandments down from the mount and gave us a prescription for running our affairs, a prescription which  Senator Greenwood  would have is eternal and unchangeable, like the sun rising in the east and setting in the west. In this case, even an appeal to the founding fathers will avail them nothing. As  Senator Murphy  so aptly demonstrated today, it is quite clear that the founding fathers envisaged just such a situation as the Government is facing in this legislation. I do not know whether members opposite have bothered to read section 122 of the Constitution, but it states: 
The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the 
Commonwealth, or of any Territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit. 
What else is the Government attempting to do but to carry out the clear intention of that section? Perhaps it will be argued that the Territories are already adequately represented. I have, in fact, heard that argument advanced in the Senate. 
Just as a matter of arithmetic, what justice is to be found in these figures: 240,000 Tasmanian voters elect 15 representatives to the national Parliament; 95,000 Canberra voters elect 2 representatives to the national Parliament; and 30,000 Northern Territorians elect one representative to the national Parliament? We have been constantly twitted on what the Opposition appears to regard as some great logical inconsistency: that what we are putting up in this Bill represents some sort of departure from the principle of one vote one value which guides us in these things. What is the implication in the denial by the Opposition of a right to vote for the Senate to those numbers I have mentioned? What members opposite are saying is that, so far as the Senate is concerned, 100,000 votes in the ACTU should have no value. I should have said A.C.T. 
The only other argument worthy of the name which has been advanced against the Government's stand on this matter was raised by that doughty traditionalist,  Senator Greenwood,  and repeated, I am sad to say, by a much more worthy representative of this Parliament, my friend  Mr Killen,  the honourable member for Moreton. That argument is that there is some inconsistency in a government whose policy is to abolish the Senate advocating its enlargement. Every day that I spend in this Parliament increases the strength of my belief in the need to abolish the Senate. Despite  Senator Greenwood  's disclaimer of obstruction by the Senate, his Leader,  Senator Withers,  let the cat out of the bag in the statement I referred to earlier. 
On this very Bill some Opposition senators voted differently from their colleagues in the House of Representatives. It will be recalled that when the motion for the second reading of the Bill was agreed to by the House of Representatives on 29 May 1973 it was carried by 78 votes to 43 votes. Seventeen members of the Country Party crossed the floor and voted with the Government, the other 3 members of the Country Party being absent when the vote was taken. Yet, when the vote on the motion for the second reading of the Bill was taken in the Senate all 5 
Country Party senators voted against the Bill. Obviously, despite what their Party thought of the merits of this Bill, the Country Party senators were persuaded by  Senator Withers  to join his squalid conspiracy against democratic government. So much for the question whether the Senate has been obstructionist. Of course it has been obstructionist, and it is quite clear that it will continue to be so to the detriment of democratic government in this country. 
For this reason, and in order that democracy may have a chance to survive in this country, I firmly believe in the abolition of the Senate. I hope that one day the abuse of power by the Opposition senators will persuade voters that the Senate is dispensable. But we have to be realistic, and it is quite clear that that time has not yet arrived. We have to face the fact that the Senate unfortunately will be here for some time. We on the Government side believe that if we have to have a Senate we should try to make it a House which is a little more representative of the Australian people. For that reason, while feeling nothing but disenchantment with the Senate, as I think a growing number of the Australian people are feeling, I support the Government's proposals.
