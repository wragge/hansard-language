I ask the Prime Minister: What survey or what assessment was made of the work value in the office of the honourable member for the, Australian 
Capital Territory before the Government decided to reject his request for additional secretarial assistance? In applying whatever rule or precedent exists, did the Government have in mind that the 125,000 people of this Territory have only one approach to government - through their member in this House of Representatives. They have no government at the State level, no senators and no form of local self government. In the interests of the people of the Territory will the Prime Minister undertake to have this matter re-examined?
