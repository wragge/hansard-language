I am proud to represent the electorate of Canning in this House. I follow  Mr Jack  Hallett who represented Canning in this Parliament for some 1 1 years. Like  Mr Hallett,  my prime interest is in agriculture. Again in common with  Mr Hallett,  I have a vital interest in the wool industry although many of my views on the need for comprehensive wool marketing reform differ markedly from the views he often expressed. I pay tribute to  Mr Hallett  's contribution to this Parliament and his contribution to the electorate of Canning. 
Canning is an electorate of some 49,000 square miles- the ninth largest in Australiacovering outer metropolitan areas within 16 miles of Perth and stretching through the agricultural areas of Western Australia to Esperance some 500 miles from Perth. Sixty per cent of people in the electorate live in rural areas. Their dependence is directly or indirectly on agriculture. I will be largely concentrating on the impact of this Budget and of other Government decisions on agriculture, on country towns, and on the economic and social welfare of rural people. The remaining electors of Canning live in the near metropolitan shires of Arnadale-Kelmscott, Rockingham and Mandurah. Government decisions on shipbuilding and manufacturing at Kwinana, and on bauxite mining and processing at Pinjarra vitally affect them. Also, being rapidly growing residential areas, they are concerned with policies on housing, sewerage, provision of community and sporting facilities and of education. 
I first wish to express my concern at the growing division between the metropolitan areas and rural areas. On too many occasions, the relationship between city and country appears to be expressed in the terms of a grand final football match: That only one side can win; and that a concession or benefit given to one side must automatically result in a disadvantage or penalty to the other side. This division is fostered not only by political parties but also by union leaders and by farmer organisations themselves. It is time that all realised that country and city, rural and metropolitan, are interdependent, and that each has a vital part to play in the growth and development of Australia. One of the virtues of the document 'Rural Policy in Australia' is its examination of rural policy within a context of national policy, to be judged by its contribution to overall economic and social objectives. Whilst the country-city division is promoted by politicians of all political parties for short term political gains, I want to comment particularly on the attitude of farmer leaders. Too often, I feel, farmers rely on the views of the eighteenth century French philosophers and embryo economists known as the physiocrats. The physiocrats saw land as the ultimate source of wealth, and agriculture as the only fruitful labour. Trade, commerce and industry were regarded as sterile, merely transforming the products of agriculture. By promoting such views Australian farmer leaders are ignoring the inter-dependence of all sectors necessary for the development of a strong, vital Australian economy. Acceptance of the inter-dependence of sectors does not place agriculture at a disadvantage. It is still vitally important both in its contribution to the total Australian productive effort and in its contribution to Australian trade and overseas earnings. 
Promotion by farmer leaders and farmer organisations of demonstrations and retaliatory action against governments or unions can only be self defeating. Such demonstrations and retaliatory action can give internal solidarity to an organisation, but the net result is that they widen and give permanence to the existing gulf between farmers and the rest of the community. The resources of farmer organisations can be used much more effectively. Farmer bodies are now operating within a different framework in which there is an Industries Assistance Commission, and in which submissions on rural matters to Government will be reviewed critically within the national context. This is not a phenomenon of the Labor Government, the same was developing under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government and would, I expect, continue under the next Liberal-Country Party Government. Submissions to government and submissions to the Industries Assistance Commission must be of a high order, more professional, more logically argued and better supported by facts and statistics than have been many rural submissions in the past. I see this as the greatest challenge now facing farmer organisations, and it is pleasing to note the number that have already responded to this challenge. 
Farmer leaders and farmer organisations have a vital part to play, too, in making effective and positive contributions in many other areas. Presumably, the Green Paper report has to be adapted to become a set of guidelines for rural policy, and I would hope that vital changes are to be initiated in wool marketing. Although on occasions in the past the Labor Government has shown scant concern for consultation with farmer organisations, I would hope that in the future it and subsequent governments will accept the need for thorough and detailed consultation. Farmer organisations have a further responsibility to put forward experienced and capable representatives for marketing boards and the like, especially in view of the claim by the current Government that it will choose the best man available, although I am afraid this often merely means a union official rather than a rural producer. 
The Government has been inconsistent in its decisions on rural industries. Many Government members have used the Green Paper to support Government decisions but fail to take account of a number of decisions which run counter to the recommendations and spirit of the Green Paper. Many of the Government's decisions on agriculture appeared to be based on the facile slogan 'You've never had it so good'. At the time it was made it may have been superficially true, but the author of that slogan took a very shallow view and made no serious attempt to evaluate trends in the costs of agricultural inputs or of the market outlook for a number of agricultural commodities. Is it any wonder that there was a fierce reaction by farmers and by political Parties on this side of the House, who take a genuine interest in agriculture, particularly when the slogan appears in many cases to be the sole justification for many rural policy decisions? 
The slogan certainly has no validity in the current rural situation. Whilst the outlook for sugar and grain may be bright, the outlook for beef, sheep meats and wool is far from being so. Cost pressures are severe because of uncontrolled inflation, and when this is coupled with a tight credit market the picture, long or short term, is not cheerful. If the Government justifies many of its decisions of 1973 by the buoyancy of the rural sector at the time, it would appear logical and consistent to expect a reversal of such policies and a reinstatement of some concessions, maybe in a different form, in the current poor situation of farmers. This Budget does not do so, and in fact the contribution being paid by farmers by way of levies and taxes is greater than ever before. The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  addressing the National Press Club on 4 July 1974, said: 
The objective of the Government in requesting a Green Paper indicates our general approach to the making of decisions in the rural sector and indeed for other industries. It shows the way a Labor Government will make decisionsafter full public inquiry and free public debate. 
I need only point to the case of the superphosphate bounty to show the inconsistency between the spoken word and Government action. The removal of the superphosphate bounty was an arbitrary decision, not discussed and not investigated. The current reference to the Industries Assistance Commission concerning superphosphate is a narrow reference relating only to new land farmers in Western Australia. The view recently expressed in this House, that the reference will enable an overall review of the bounty, does not accord with fact. The original request by the Farmers Union of Western Australia was for an overall investigation, but the Government determined that the inquiry should be limited solely to new land farmers. 
Further inconsistencies are shown in the Government's treatment of the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy. The arguments for and against both the fertiliser subsidy and the superphosphate subsidy would appear to be identical, yet the Government has made 2 widely different decisions. The inconsistency is even more blatant when we realise that sugar prospects are good and that the application of superphosphate does have residual benefit on soil fertility. Rural credit is another vital area in which members of the Government Party have talked large and acted small. One recalls their promises of 1972 to provide long term, low interest loans for farmers. In effect, they have merely continued credit facilities existing on their entry to office; no significant initiatives have been made. The Green Paper saw no threat to the family farmer, if there was adequate flexibility in the supply and availability of rural credit. The 1972 Bureau of Agricultural Economics paper 'Rural Credit in Australia' pointed out deficiencies in rural credit. 
In effect, this Government has acted conversely and, by tightening credit through monetary restrictions, by increasing interest rates, by lessening the amount allocated for rural reconstruction and, in this Budget, by introducing a capital gains tax, has gravely weakened the position of the family farmer. With a capital gains tax making no allowances for inflation, it will be particularly severe on farming estates, where assets are illiquid. The capital gains tax is another vulture, joining the vultures of death and probate duties at the death of the family fanner. Lack of action on promises to provide means of stabilising rural incomes to counteract seasonal fluctuations places the family farmer at a further disadvantage. 
In the House last week a Government member attempted to prove that agriculture was receiving more support today than under the previous Government. He grouped under government outlays all expenditure, whether financed by agricultural producers or whether in the form of loans to the agricultural sector. This total outlay figure is misleading. Government outlay on wool this year is shown in the Budget Papers as $ 102m, to which a Government supporter would probably add $150m being the loan to the Australian Wool Corporation for marketing support. Growers will contribute $7 1.7m this year through levies on wool sold. Of the total of $252m claimed as Government outlay on wool, only some 9 per cent or $22.9m is aid to the industry not to be repaid or not to be paid by grower contribution. Wheat outlays are shown at $1.8m, but $1.5m will be paid by grower levy. A further payment of $39m is expected from wheat growers for the stabilisation fund. The true picture shows Government expenditure of $0.3m, compared with a grower contribution of $40.5m. Examination shows similar results for such items as inspection services, rural reconstruction and certain irrigation projects. In fact, the amount to be extracted from producers this financial year by way of wool tax and other levies is $ 162.3m, as against $64.5m last year- a rise of 150 per cent or, in money terms, $84m. Additionally, much of the other outlay forecast is in the form of interest bearing, repayable loans and cannot be counted as a permanent burden on the taxpayer. 
I wish to touch on the social and economic welfare of people living in rural areas. The Green Paper recommended as follows: 
The aim of policy should continue to be to reduce disparities in the provision of public service and amenities, between urban and rural areas. 
Government charges for telephone installation in country areas and the cost of telephone calls in country areas hardly accord with this recommendation. Whilst the Budget proposal to abolish television and radio licence fees may appeal to many, the decision in effect taxes those people in outlying areas who do not have a television service. It worries me that so many people are enthusiastic about the introduction of colour television when significant areas of my electorate are still unable to receive a black and white television service. 
The Budget decision to reduce the education concession for taxation purposes from $400 to $150 reacts harshly on some country people. Parents who live some distance from high schools who are required to board their children will be severely affected. Boarding costs at government hostels in Western Australia are about $ 1 , 1 85 a year. A family can receive $350 a year under the isolated children scheme. Ignoring other costs such as fares, pocket money, uniforms, etc., the net expenditure of $835 by the parents can be offset only by a claim of $ 1 50 as a taxation deduction. This position is compounded if more than one child is involved. Much the same picture emerges even if the parents combined income is below $6,300- a figure very close to the average weekly earnings- and they qualify for the additional boarding allowance. I am referring to children attending state high schools and staying at high school hostels, not those attending private boarding schools. Similar disabilities apply to country people in getting medical or specialist treatment. Taxation concessions do not apply to the cost of transport to and from treatment, even though in many cases transport costs far outweigh the cost of treatment. In the publication 'This Land- Labor's Rural Program',  Senator Wriedt  says: 
One in 4 families in country towns live in poverty or near poverty conditions. There are more poor families in Australia's small country towns than there are in Sydney and Melbourne combined. This means that the incidence of poverty in country towns is almost twice the level in those cities. 
Our country poor must receive a better deal. This is another Labor undertaking on which no real action has been initiated. In fact the position is worse because current economic conditions in rural areas do not even assure continuity of employment in country towns or on farms. If the Government is serious in its attack on poverty, it will not solve the overall problem by merely transferring poverty from the urban areas to the rural areas. 
Lastly, I wish to touch on the wool industry. I welcome the Government's decision to put a floor in the market and the granting of additional finance and powers to the Australian Wool Corporation. I dispute the level of the floor price and feel that a level of 300c per kilo, clean, would more truly fit the current cost structures of the wool industry and would take account of the views of overseas wool users who have stated that they could live with that price. But whatever criticisms I make of the floor price level, they do not detract from my appreciation of both the Government's decision and the readiness of the wool industry to make a substantial contribution to its own stability and future. Whilst I acknowledge the assistance given to the wool industry by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government during the period of stress several years ago, I have often outside this House, criticised that Government for its failure to take decisive action on wool marketing. In my view it was a forlorn hope to expect a flexible reserve price scheme, with severe limitations of the powers of the Corporation to make a significant contribution to the problem of wool marketing. This Government's decision is to have effect for one year only. It still has to consider wool marketing in the long term and determine its reactions to the Corporation's marketing recommendations. These recommendations provide a sound base for future action. I hope that the Government realises that its current short term decision does not absolve it from the responsibility of making a long term decision. Such a decision must recognise the need to integrate marketing, promotion and research; to reduce costs inherent in current wool selling and handling procedures; to better equate supply with demand; to better service the needs of wool users; and to provide a sound, stable return to wool growers. 

 Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and the House for giving me a fair hearing. I support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).

We listened with considerable interest to the speech attempted by the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Whan).  When he used the rural reconstrution figures we were able to see the shallow ground on which he was putting forward his arguments. He pointed to the fact that there had been a fall in the numbers. He was using the 1973-74 figures which themselves are out of date. If the honourable member looks at the Budget figures he will see that the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  does not believe the figures because he has allocated for rural reconstruction this year an amount of $30m. If there are 500 farmers requiring rural reconstruction, as the honourable member has said, that $30m would represent $60,000 per farmer. The people in the Government are very generous when it comes to rural reconstruction. The honourable member has used the figures concerning Government outlays on agriculture. He has used these figures a number of times before. I think a much more realistic figure would be obtained by looking at the amount that farmers in very difficult times are contributing. Their contribution this year by way of levies and so on is 1  Vi  times greater than it was before. There has been an increase from $64m to $162.3m or a rise of 150 per cent in very difficult times. 
In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Agriculture I want particularly to refer to the problems of new land farmers in Western Australia. I have chosen new land farmers because whilst each Government decision and action in the agricultural field affects established farmers, the effects of Government policies are mirrored and magnified in the case of new land farmers. New land farmers are not an exclusively Western Australian phenomenon, but their numbers are greater in Western Australia than in other States because of the State Government policies of the 1960s to encourage land settlement- a decision then in accord with Federal Government thinking and policy. Whilst the numbers of new land farmers in Western Australia are difficult to assess various sources estimate the number to be between 1,500 and 2,000. 
Much has been made of the reference to the Industries Assistance Commission on the superphosphate subsidy for Western Australian new land farmers. The reference is narrowly confined to farmers developing conditional purchase land obtained since 1959. There are a number of farmers in Western Australia not included in the reference to the Industries Assistance Commission in the same position. Some are developing privately owned land whilst others may have purchased semi-developed blocks. They are all experiencing grave difficulties because of the Labor Government's rural policies and its overall economic mismanagement. The effect of Government policies and economic mismanagement harshly affects all farmers but their effects on developing farmers are disproportionately harsher. 
I wish to emphasise that I well know the heavy burden of this Government's policies on all farmers; all that I am saying is that the burden is heavier on new land farmers. If the characteristics of new land farmers are examined it will be readily appreciated why they are so much more vulnerable. Firstly, being developers, they are users of capital. They are heavy borrowers because although they commenced with some capital it was not in most cases sufficient to develop their properties fully. This Government's tightening of credit and failure to provide additional sources of rural credit have affected the whole rural community- farmers and businessmen as well as wage earners in country areas. The effect on the new land farmer is even more severe because with limited asset backing his ability to borrow from normal rural lenders- trading banks and stock firms- is severely limited. These farmers have to compete with other rural borrowers for borrowings from the Commonwealth Development Bank. As extensive capital users, new land farmers particularly feel the savage effects of the Labor Government's failure to keep interest rates within reasonable limits. 
Finance is a major problem for agriculture in the economic situation of today. The Government should be looking closely into the needs of agriculture in this respect. It should be looking at the needs of beef producers caught in the most severe slump in years. It should be not only looking but also acting. I suggest that the Government drag from the archives its promises of the 1972 election campaign in the rural credit fieldpromises that it has so conveniently shelved. But for the new land farmers the Government should be looking and acting to correct the position of credit starvation, both for developmental purposes and for carry-on finance. It should also be looking at finance for homes on new land properties to overcome many of the unsatisfactory living quarters on such farms. 
It is not enough to argue that new land farms in Western Australia are being developed by absentee owners or St George's Terrace farmers. It is true that some are. But the majority are owned and are being developed by hard working couples with limited capital, ready to apply to the 1960s and the 1970s the pioneering spirit of the last century. Deferment of investment in these properties is not the answer. Such an action would only result in extending the time before such properties could become viable. Action must be taken to speed their development and their subsequent absorption into the category of established farms. Special provision will be needed to achieve this. 
Secondly, not being at full productive capacity, new land farmers are much more vulnerable to cost increases and falling or variable returns, either seasonally or economically. Their productive capacity is limited directly by the area developed and pastured, and limitations on soil fertility in the early stages of development. Government policies on investment and depreciation allowances affect all farmers, but the impact on the new land farmer is even more severe. Fencing, pasture improvement and the provision of water facilities are vital to enable increases in the productive capacity and development of new land farms. Government policy does not discriminate between the established farmer and the new land farmer in this regard. 
All farmers are feeling the effects of rapidly rising costs- up to 30 per cent per annum. Costs of all agricultural inputs have risen dramaticallywages, machinery, repair costs, wool packs, shearing costs, freight costs and so on- as this Government gropes for an overall economic policy. Inflation manifested in these rapidly rising costs of agricultural inputs worries all concerned directly or indirectly with agriculture. It is all very well to state, as Government supporters are often want to do, that tariff reductions will lower costs. Any benefits resulting from the tariff reductions have been over-run by inflation itself. 
On the revenue side of the farm sector, we see falling beef prices and low mutton prices, coupled with wool being supported at a price level at or below the cost of production. Even for commodities selling at reasonable rates, such as wheat, payments are deferred because of the Labor Government's inability to ensure industrial peace. Thus on the one hand we have rapidly rising prices fed by the inability of the 
Government to exhibit any economic managerial ability. On the other hand returns are depressed, or if not depressed, deferred because of industrial banditry. All farmers are hit by the circumstances but the new land farmer, not yet able to obtain the full productive potential of his land, is hit very much harder. 
The third characteristic of many new land farms in Western Australia is that they are located in areas well away from the large country centres and the attendant faculties. Additional costs are incurred through freight, both on agricultural inputs and household commodities brought into such areas and on out-going grain, wool, stock and so on. Government policies on telephones and taxation deductions for education, without increases in the isolated children's allowances, are most severe in their effect on people in new land areas. In fact the Government's policies as they affect the social and economic welfare of persons on new land farms make a laughing stock of the Green Paper recommendations that the aim of policy should be to reduce disparities in public services and amenities as between rural and urban areas. The problems of the new land farmers must be faced or by default the Federal Government will allow the vast resources of capital and human effort already invested in the development of these 2,000 or so farms to be lost to the Australian economy. 
There are several alternatives open to the Government. Firstly it could continue to adopt the concept that its policies are designed to weed out the inefficient and uneconomic farmer. That is, that the economically marginal farmer must go, and in simple economic terms the new land farmer must be accepted as a marginal farmer. This is a harsh and unrealistic view for the new land farmer group which has invested both capital and human resources in the development to date of their properties. The second alternative open to the Government- this is the one that I advocate- is essentially based on the concept that the new land farmer should be given special consideration and conditions to speed and hasten his development to the stage where such special provisions are no longer necessary. Superphosphate for new land farmers, now under inquiry, is only one aspect of the whole question. Superphosphate concessions will help delay the demise of the new land farmers but measures particularly in the field of rural credit are also vital. It is not the time to blame the State Government for encouraging such people to develop these areas. It is not the time to ignore the problem and state that these new land farmers took and realised the risk inherent in their undertakings. My plea to the Government is that action must be taken, and taken quickly, on the very real social and economic needs of the new land farmer group in Western Australia. 

 Mr Kerin (Macarthur) (10.17)- It is evident that the dynamic agricultural situation has already had a significant impact on the Budget. The deterioration in the wool market meant that we had to take measures which involved us in the expenditure of an extra $150m bringing our appropriation to $487.6m for agriculture in 1974-75 compared with an appropriation of $303m last year and $329m the year before. These figures are not directly comparable. They simply show that we are spending sums of money in the agricultural area. Some individual items in the appropriation for this year are up and some are down. Of course this is exactly the situation that the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Whan)  tried to outline with regard to debt reconstruction and farm build-up. The moneys allocated in 1972-73 for this purpose amounted to $50m and this year the sum was $30m. The simple fact is that the States have all the money that they have asked for in this area. We are very glad when the figures show that there is no longer a great need for expenditure on this item. But we know that the figures do not reveal the situation at the moment. 
A member of the New South Wales Rural Assistance Board lives within 10 miles of where I live in my electorate, and he keeps me informed of the situation in New South Wales. The monthly figures show the way in which the situation has changed since 1971-72. The average monthly number of applications in 197 1-72 was 713. The monthly average for the State of New South Wales has dropped from 191 applications down to 5 applications for July 1973, 9 applications for August 1973, going through to 16 applications in June 1974. Therefore we had a monthly average of 16 applications in June this year compared with 191 applications 2 years ago. The figure for June is quite a recent one. Therefore the reason only $30m was appropriated for the purpose of debt reconstruction and farm build-up is that the number of applications this year has been considerably reduced. This is a darn good thing. A total of 7,570 applications were lodged in Australia in 1971-72. Last year the number of applications was 523. We are very glad that the number has been reduced. This simply reflects the up-turn in the fortunes of the farmers last year. If the situation deteriorates and a greater number of applications is made for farm build-up- at the moment the number has fallen away- the States can come to us and we will look at the situation again. The decision to devalue was of benefit to primary and exporting industries, but the flow-on will have effects on the general inflationary situation. I am not sure that the effects will be as adverse as some critics suggest. 
All allocations of money to agriculture come under the general heading of assistance to industry. It is in this context that I wish to address the Committee. It seems to be fashionable for honourable members opposite to regard only measures in the Budget for country areas as coming under the appropriation under discussion. The truth is that a wide range of the Government's measures assist country areas. One could instance the increase in education moneys, Grants Commission payments to local government, which are spread across Australia, regionalisation policies, etc. However, the events of last week, trends foreseeable for some time, and Monday night's television broadcast of 'Monday Conference' in which program the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  appeared, have indicated very clearly to me that the fundamental agricultural problem is not how to produce primary products but how to sell them. Those who used to be so critical of our views in the first months of Government to gain new markets are now quietening down on this aspect. I was disgusted to hear one fellow say on the session of 'Monday Conference' to which I referred that he had heard about the $56m for the animal health laboratory before and did not want to hear it again. This indicated a selfish ati.tude which does not do the farming community much good when it is expressed so clearly as that. 
On the program farmers were complaining that the removal of the investment allowance worth $30m or $37m last year, was now killing incentive. This always seems to be the problem. When the rural sector is faced with a new situation, for example, in beef where 3 exports markets have been lost, it likes to get back to a previous situation. Farmers want the investment incentives restored. What they are simply failing to do is home in on the problem itself. The problem for Australian agriculture always has been markets. This is the fundamental problem. I am not saying that there are no problems in production but the main one is markets. I would like to know what message is coming from the market place which would indicate that now is the time for people to develop land for sheep or beef production. If there are problems with beef markets, what sort of message is coming from the market place to say that if we spend $37m in providing investment allowances this will help farmers? Surely , the position with respect to cereal production holds very well, but how long this situation will hold I do not know. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing wheat payments.

asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: 
What is the scheduled completion date and estimated cost for each stage of the Cockburn Sound (Garden Island) Naval Base. 
What facilities, originally planned, have been deleted or indefinitely deferred. 
-One clear and indisputable fact emerges to anyone who looks at the position of local government today. It is that local government is in grave financial difficulties. Inflation and the credit squeeze are the cause of these difficulties. Local government is in the grip of financial starvation. Thus, we are considering this Bill, which endorses grants recommended by the Grants Commission for local government authorities, against a background of local government authorities in critical positions because of uncontrolled wage increases, rapid rises in costs for materials and machinery, repair services and the like, critical shortfalls in the realisation of borrowing programs and effectively reduced grants for roads through Commonwealth Aid Roads funds. This is the dismal background against which local authorities are working at the moment This is the background against which this House is approving these grants to local government authorities. 
This bleak outlook is caused by the inability of the Labor Government to exercise sensible economic restraints and sound economic management. We are looking at this Bill against a background in which councils are being forced to consider 3 alternatives. Firstly, to reduce substantially services and new works programs; secondly, to reduce substantially rates or charges; or thirdly, to lay off men. Let me refer to certain local government authorities in Western Australia to illustrate the current dire straits of local government. Western Australia local government authorities are not alone in experiencing such difficulties. No doubt during this debate the same story will emerge in respect of other States. In my electorate of Canning, in which there are 33 local government authorities, the story is one of savage increases in local government rates. These increases are not to expand or upgrade services and facilities; they are merely to keep abreast of the vicious increases in costs incurred by local government authorities because of wage and cost increases. 
Let me cite some of the rate increases applied this financial year by some shires in my electorate. The Armadale-Kelmscott Shire Council has increased rates by 52 per cent; the Boddington Shire by 40 per cent; the Brookton Shire Council by 30 per cent; the Corrigin Shire Council by 30 per cent; the Gnowangerup Shire Council by 29.8 per cent; and the Kent Council by 64 per cent. The whole list goes on in this way. These are the rate increases for this year. These shires represent the story right throughout the electorate. I expect also that they would mirror the picture throughout Australia. I understand that rate increases by local government authorities throughout Australia are overall of the order of 30 to 35 per cent this year. These increases have taken place directly as a result of the Government's inability to manage the economy. Furthermore, many of the shires which I have mentioned are in rural areas and their ability to increase rates are inhibited by the tight liquidity position and the poor situation of the grazing industry for both wool and meat. It would be quite unrealistic and probably irresponsible of local government authorities in grazing areas to increase rates severely when wool prices are being held at below cost of production and beef prices are at their lowest level for many years. 
The second alternative open to local government is to reduce the provision of services and facilities. A deal of this is happening on a voluntary basis as shire councils prune their programs and expenditures. It is even clearer that more of this will happen as this financial year progresses, as prices and wages continue to rise and as shire councils attempt to balance their budgets for this financial year. Councils will have no option but to retrench employees. Retrenchments by local government authorities will increase during the rest of this financial year and will become a significant factor in increasing the total of the unemployment pool. Many retrenchments will not be made voluntarily. They will be forced. In this regard, the failure of the local government authorities to satisfy their borrowing programs will add to the number of people thrown out of work. 
Let me cite an example from a shire in the electorate of Canning. The shire of Mandurah has in recent years used the full extent of its borrowing powers to provide sewerage for the town. The work is being done by the Western Australian Public Works and County Sewerage Department and is being financed by the shire council's borrowings. This year the borrowing program is $330,000 and at this late stage in the financial year approximately one third only of this amount has been raised. The position is clear. Unless this money can be borrowed the work must stop. If so, at least 100 people currently employed on the project will be joining the unemployed labour pool. This is an area where the unemployment rate is substantial- and where almost $60,000 has been allocated for the RED scheme. 
The same story emerges if we look at the Stirling City Council- a story which will be put by my colleague, the honourable member for Stirling  (Mr Viner),  much more forcibly if he gets an opportunity to speak and if the debate is not gagged. The Stirling City Council contemplates the dismissal of another 100 employees within the next two or three months if its borrowing program is not realised. It has a loan ceiling of $ 1.7m but to date there is still a shortfall of $lm. The cases of Mandurah and Stirling illustrate the point that I am making, that is, that massive retrenchments of staff by local government authorities are imminent. In a situation of overall unemployment, it is both unnecessary and foolish to force local government authorities into the position that they have to contribute to the ever-growing and ever-increasing pool of unemployment. The Government can come back and say that there is the RED scheme- the Regional Employment Development scheme. This scheme does help local government to do some worthwhile work. But what is needed is not schemes such as the RED scheme and the National Employment and Training Scheme to sop up the unemployed, but action to support those councils which will be forced to retrench staff in the near future because of unparalleled price and wage increases and because of grave deficiencies in borrowing programs. 
The position is clear. The Government must act to prevent retrenchments in local government before they take place, not to apply first aid after the retrenchments have been made. The grants made to local government authorities under this Bill will not significantly alleviate the position. Generally, the grants do not cover the increases in costs incurred by the councils because of inflation. Road funds allocated under the Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation passed earlier this year reduced the effective size of local government road programs. Local authorities in Western Australia are receiving grants this year equal in money terms to the grants received last year. In real terms, the grants, eroded by inflation, are smaller. Councils are restricting their road maintenance and extension programs for this very reason. Despite increased ratings, these grants will not even compensate councils for the rate of inflation or the lower grants in real terms for roads. These grants are supposed to be for topping up purposes. In effect, the beaker is leaking at a faster rate than it can be topped up. 
There are a number of other carrots being dangled before local government at the moment. These include area improvement schemes, sports and recreation grants, the Australian Assistance Plan, Aboriginal training programs and the like. When one analyses the amounts coming from these schemes, it is easy to realise their limited contribution to the overall contribution of local government. The area improvement scheme is limited in Western Australia to one trial region. The Australian Assistance Plan in the southern region was the greatest blunder imaginable. Many people, leaders in their communities, sacrificed considerable time and expense to formulate proposals. For administrative expenditure of $40,000, total grants received were $22,350. Some eight of 128 schemes were approved, 9 were referred for further information and the remaining 1 1 1 were fobbed off to other departments where no doubt they will be destined for the archives. 
These other carrots being offered to local government authorities through regional authorities or otherwise do not add up to much. They certainly do not compensate regions or shire councils or municipal councils for the impact of inflation. They do not compensate for the reduction in services by local government authorities because of inflation or inadequate loan fillings. In total, they are relatively insignificant or no more than mere decoys to persuade local government authorities and the people that they are being adequately catered for. 
When the Grants Commission Bill was before the Parliament in 1973, the Opposition attacked the regional concept. We still oppose the regional concept being developed by this Government. We do not condone the by-passing of State governments in the allocating of funds to local government, whether the scheme be administered by the Grants Commission, the Area Assistance Plan or in any other way. The regional concept developed by this Government has proved a failure. In his address to the annual conference of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations at Alice Springs on 1 1 November the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  said: 
I believe the new work of the Grants Commission, as it unfolds, will promote another development of profound significance to the shape, importance and effectiveness of local government. I refer to the creation of regions and the development of genuine regional thinking. 
The regions as they are now drawn in Western Australia are ludicrous. Councils in regions do not necessarily have common interests. For instance, in my electorate the shire of Boddington is included in the Perth region. Thus a small rural shire dependent on agriculture and forestry some 80 miles from Perth is lumped with the Perth City Council, the Stirling City Council and the Fremantle City Council. What community of interest can there be between a small rural shire so far from the city and radically different shires and municipalities in the metropolitan area? How can such a shire contribute to the 'genuine regional thinking' referred to by the Prime Minister? 
The Grants Commission reports indicate that grants are determined by deviations from standards and using comparisons both within regions and between regions. What meaningful comparisons could be made between a rural shire such as Boddington, with a population of less than 1,000, and major city councils in the Perth metropolitan area? Yet they aU are part of the same region. The Grants Commission has indicated that it will make inspections in regions. It is hard to envisage how inspections of the Perth City Council area will give the Commission any appreciation of the problems and disabilities of Boddington. 
The operation of the Grants Commission in determining the 1973-74 grants left much to be desired. Councils did not know what was wanted. Some presented large shopping lists of projects; others attempted to show disabilities No guidelines existed and so there could be no uniform approach. Since the recommended grants have been announced, shires with inadequate grants or no grants have not been able to obtain meaningful information as to whether their submissions were adequate or were along correct lines. The same old standard reply has been churned out by the office of the Special Minister of State  (Mr Lionel Bowen).  It says: 'Read chapter 3 of the Grants Commission report'. It gives a broad and meaningless attachment which is headed 'Summary of Grants Commission Method of Assessing Equalisation Grants'. It is of extremely limited value to any shire or municipal clerk as a guide to preparing a submission for 1974-75 
In my electorate 8 local government authorities were denied grants. They do not know why. Six were small shires. One is forced to ask whether there is discrimination against such shires because of their size. Two other shires, Beverley and York, also did not receive grants. No matter how the figures are analysed- by area, population, length of roads, level of rates, revenue or total loan debt- there is no discernible reason why they missed out in relation to other shires of about the same size in the same region. 
If the scheme is to work confusion must be avoided. Clear guidelines should be set for councils. They should know the real reasons that determine the size of their grant or the reason why they did not get a grant. The seminars proposed by the Minister and the promise that questions will be answered by the Commission at the next round of hearings are welcome and will help. But councils are already preparing their submissions for 1974-75 in the dark. So that action should be taken immediately. 
I shan cite another area where confusion is being spread. I refer to an article in the publication 'Community ' issued by the Department of Urban and Regional Development. The article is headed '$56 Million to Local Government'. The final paragraph reads: 
The Grants Commission is using a framework of regional groupings of local councils, and regional organisations are increasingly becoming active around Australia. Although the report - 
That is the Grants Commission report -  makes no recommendations this year for grants for regional projects, applications for such assistance are expected to increase next year. 
Thus we have the Department of Urban and Regional Development publishing its views on how the Grants Commission will operate. On reading this article I checked with the staff of the Special Minister of State to get clarification, to see whether shire councils had been told, to see whether I could tell my councils of a new development. The staff knew nothing of it. The best I could get was a statement that the comment was a kite-flying exercise. This is of scant comfort to shire councils who are now preparing submissions for the next round of Grants Commission hearings. 
On the one hand we have the Special Minister of State saying that grants will be judged on an assessment of the revenue disabilities and the expenditure disabilities of the respective local government authorities within a region. We similarly have the Grants Commission in its report stating that this will be the basis of assessment. On the other hand we have the Department of Urban and Regional Development indicating that regions or regional groups should be making up shopping lists for submission and consideration by the Grants Commission. No wonder the local government authorities are confused. Not only are they denied a clear answer on their applications as to how grants were decided, but they are also being given a dual set of standards for the presentation of their submissions for the next round of Grants Commission hearings. 
This is a question which the Special Minister of State should answer today. The simple question is this: Should council submissions be made on the basis of the disabilities as the Grants Commission and his views seem to support, or are they also to submit applications for grants for regional projects as recommended by the Department of Urban and Regional Development? The question of disabilities should be looked at afresh by the Grants Commission as that it seems in many areas important factors have been ignored. I refer particularly to areas which are tourist and holiday centres. With a population approaching 20,000 shires such as Mandurah cater during the summer period for populations of up to 50,000. No allowance appears to have been made for the additional burden on the Shire Council of providing facilities and services to provide for this influx. 
Other regional centres appear to have been similarly treated. They have expenditure disabilities because of the need to provide facilities for people from well outside their shire or municipal boundaries. Adequate weight does not appear to have been given to this factor. The Commission in its report discounted as a disability factor the rural recession. This clearly needs reassessment, particularly in many grazing areas. I hope that in the 1974-75 round of applictions this will be given further and adequate consideration. In Western Australia a number of shires are required, because of their location and difficulty of acquiring doctors and dentists, to subsidise these services. I see no provision in the report of the Commission to indicate that this has been given sufficient weight. 
I support this Bill not because I endorse the principals behind it, but because local government is in such a serious financial position that every bit of money is needed. The money granted by this Bill will not be significant in solving the financial predicament of local government, nor will it substantially reduce the bleak fact that mass retrenchments are likely by local government authorities in the near future.

1 ) What was the nature of the Army exercise held in the Stirling Range National Park, Western Australia, on 1 1 and 12 September 1974. 
Were consultations held with the National Parks Board of Western Australia prior to the exercise, to ensure unique flora in the park was not damaged. 
Will he investigate the feasibility of transferring such exercises to other areas outside of a national park. 
What other national parks or flora and fauna reserves in Australia are used for military exercises. 
Mt Barnard- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 
1 ) The Army exercises conducted in the Stirling Range National Park on II and 12 September 1974 involved elements of the Special Air Services Regiment and an Infantry Company. The exercise was designed to practice the techniques of surveillance, ambush and counter-ambush procedures. 
Written permission from the National Parks Board of Western Australia was obtained prior to the exercise. Permission was granted subject to restrictions imposed on the use of existing roads and vehicle tracks for Army vehicles and which prohibited digging or the destruction of flora and fauna. 
In the interests of training efficiency and economy it is not feasible to travel to distant areas when suitable terrain to which approved access may be granted is closer and particularly suited for a required phase of training.

asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: 
1 ) Has the Western Australian Government been advised that the stream-anchor from Matthew Flinders' ship 'Investigator', recovered in 1973 in Goose Island Bay, may be placed on public display in Western Australia until late in 1975, but that it is then to be permanently located in Canberra. 
If so, have representations been received from the Western Australian Government for a review of this decision, with a request that the stream-anchor be placed in the Fremantle Maritime Museum; if so, what decision has been made. 

 Mr Whitlam The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 
Yes. The anchor was recovered by the Department of Transport in 1 973 and was subsequently restored at the Con.servation Laboratory of the Western Australian Museum on behalf of the Australian Government. Because of the importance of Flinders' voyages and the interest of all Australians in the work of the navigator, it was decided that the anchor should be retained by the Australian Government. Following representations from the Western Australian Government seeking to have the anchor displayed permanently in Western Australia I advised the Premier on 7 August 1974 that, while the anchor is to remain the property of the Australian Government, it would be made available for display in Western Australia until the end of 1 975 when it is to be brought to Canberra for display in the National Capital. This decision was taken as a gesture in response to the State 's cooperation in restoring the anchor. 
The Premier of Western Australia wrote to me again on 18 September 1974 noting the. Australian Government's wish to display the anchor in Canberra after 1975. Also, he expressed the hope that in the meantime the Australian Government may be persuaded that the Fremantle Maritime Museum, is a suitable permanent repository for the anchor. I informed the Premier that his remarks have been noted.

3 ) When can residents of Ravensthorpe expect to be able to receive reasonable reception of ABC television programs? 
-The 2 cognate Bills we are discussing tonight involve amendments to the Wool Industry Act. The first Bill, the Wool Industry Bill (No. 2), proposes amendments to the Wool Industry Act to provide increased functions for the Australian Wool Corporation and also provides for changes in the membership of the board of the Australian Wool Corporation, and so on. The second Bill, the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill (No. 2), deals with the additional $200m to be provided to the Australian Wool Corporation for market support proposals. The Opposition supports this Bill although it has reservations as to how this market support finance should be provided to the Corporation and it feels that, if possible, the Corporation should be free to seek finance on the open market, subject of course to some Government guarantee. 
Firstly I want to look at the overall state of the wool industry today. As a member representing a substantial wool growing electorate I appreciate the firm action that the Government has taken through the Australian Wool Corporation to support a minimum price of 250c per kilo clean. Whilst one can quibble about the level of this support, and I think there are very clear indications that the level is below today's cost of production, the Government's action in a period of depressed demand for wool has been appropriate, apt and welcome. The Government gave a clear indication that it would not retreat from the reserve of 250c per kilo clean and its firm support of the Corporation has been acknowledged and applauded by all growers. 
Along with this we have had the first real contribution by wool growers towards the stability of their own industry when they agreed to pay an additional 5 per cent into the market support fund. Admittedly, wool growers have over many years paid into research and promotion funds but this is the first time that they have fully shouldered a substantial contribution to marketing support and the price support of their own commodity. This surely reflects a growing realisation by wool growers and by grower organisations that marketing stability is vital and necessary and that the industry, both producer and consumer, cannot live with the violent troughs and peaks of a completely open market without adequate insurance from the extreme fluctuations of such a market. 
The Australian Wool Corporation marketing recommendations have been released for a long time now; the appendices were released some months ago. It should be very clear that these Bills cannot be regarded as a substitute for action on the marketing report. The Australian Wool Corporation marketing recommendations go very much further than the proposals in these Bills and involve many aspects not included in the Bills. The Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  in the 1974 election pamphlet 'This Land- Labor's Rural Programme' stated: 
I have already stated publicly that I personally accept the main objectives and broad framework of the Corporation's proposals. These proposals are significant and have important implications for the future of the Australian wool industry. 
I can see in the Corporation's proposals the opportunity for improving the overall efficiency of wool marketing in Australia, a move which will benefit all woolgrowers. 
Many details embodied in the Corporation's report still need to be clarified. Accordingly, consultations will continue between the Corporation, all wool industry sectors and the Government. 
Important changes such as these need careful study by all concerned. I would hope that wool growers consider very deeply the importance of making changes to wool marketing and the extent to which wool growers are prepared to invest in the efficient marketing of their product. 
This undertaking cannot be forgotten. There is certainly some doubt amongst wool growers and wool grower organisations today as to whether the Minister intends to continue with the marketing recommendations. We understand that an interdepartmental committee is examining the matter, but it will be a broken election promise and a tragedy for the entire wool industry if the progressive and forward looking recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation are passed over and no action is taken on them. 
It has been put to me that the attacks by the Minister for Northern Development  (Dr Patterson)  and the honourable member for EdenMonaro  (Mr Whan)  some time ago on the integrity and performance of individual members of the Australian Wool Corporation, together with the proposals in this Bill to amend the membership of the Corporation, are designed to discredit the marketing report and to give the Government an escape hatch. I do not wish to canvass again the groundless accusations then promoted but I do seriously ask the Government whether it intends to go on with its examination of the marketing report with a view to accepting and implementing those recommendations in the report which are acceptable to the wool industry. 1 therefore repeat what I said earlier, that these Bills are not a substitute for action on the wool marketing recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation and that passage of the Bills does not absolve the Government from a full and thorough examination and subsequent implementation of such recommendations. Cost pressures on the wool industry at all stages from farmer to processor necessitate urgent action in many areas, and some of the recommendations in the marketing report would appear to lead to substantial cost savings through the pipeline. 
The Opposition opposes the proposal in this Bill to amend the membership of the Corporation. As will be clearly shown by the amendments which will be proposed later, we regard these changes in the membership as a censure of the Australian Wool Corporation. In my opinion the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation have been courageous and in the best interests of the Australian wool industry in the recent period of depressed demand, and I am sure that all growers throughout Australia would echo such sentiments. No reasons have been given for the proposed changes in membership. Who the new members with special qualifications are to be is still a secret. We know that several people have been approached, but the real purpose of the reorganisation of the board of the Corporation can only be guessed at. There can be only 2 reasons: Vindictiveness, or because the Australian Labor Party wants to stack the Corporation's board with Party sympathisers, Party hacks or trade union officials. On 23 July 1 974, as reported at pages 476-477 of Hansard, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said: ... I hope to establish a prima facie case for an independent investigation of the structure and activities of the Wool Corporation and its predecessor, the Australian Wool Board. 
It would appear fair and pertinent to ask whether these changes are resulting from such an independent investigation and, if so, why the results of this investigation have not been revealed to the Parliament, the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the wool grower organisations. Is the change in membership a result of the charges in this House in July 1974 by the Minister for Northern Development that the Corporation had exceeded its powers? According to an answer to a question on notice, recorded in the House of Representatives Hansard at page 2592, the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  did not strongly support these accusations that the Australian Wool Corporation had departed from its charter. He said: 
When sales resumed in July last the Corporation continued to test the market at the closing level of the 1973-74 season and in doing so purchased in excess of 60 per cent of auction offerings which had been considerably enlarged because of cancellation of earlier sales. Whether in following such action the corporation departed from the guidelines turns on a judgment as to whether the Corporation should have continued its testing role as long as it did. The Minister for Agriculture had not been formally consulted on the Corporation 's policy during the July auctions, but had been advised of the likelihood of a weak market during July. The Minister has stated that whilst in his view the actions of the Corporation could have been regarded formally as outside its guidelines, he accepts that the Corporation did not have the power to cancel or significantly reduce wool supplies at auction without the concurrence of other members of the Joint Wool Selling Organisation. 
The departure from the guidelines as seen by the Minister for Agriculture are not grave and do not appear to justify retaliatory action to the extent now proposed in this Bill. The Minister for Agriculture has made great play on the appointment of qualified men to boards, authorities and the like. His performances do not support his words. To illustrate this, I need only refer to the extreme pressure put on the Meat Board Selection Committee to get a defeated Queensland Labor candidate appointed to the Australian Meat Board. It speaks highly of the integrity of the Meat Board Selection Committee that it rejected such pressures and the appointment of a true grower representative was recommended. 
I could also point to the selection of a Western Australian farmer to the National Rural Advisory Committee- a person who had played no great part in farmer organisations in Western Australia and who was apparently chosen on the basis of a 5-minute conversation with the Minister at Narrogin prior to an election rally. Perhaps he was the only one in the audience and this was the Minister's way of thanking him. Grower representation on the board of the Corporation is changed by this Bill, both in the manner of appointment and in the ratio of wool growers to the total board. I am one who advocates grower control of statutory boards marketing primary products and I fiercely oppose the proposition that in an enlarged board as is proposed, the proportion of grower representation be reduced. Adequate grower representation on the board is vital to protect the wool growing side of the industry. After all, it is tile farmers' product which is being sold and the decisions, both large and small, by the Corporation can have significant effects upon a substantial proportion of the rural sector. 
The honourable member for Eden-Monaro  (Mr Whan)  is recorded at page 477 of Hansard for 23 July 1 974 as having said: 
Nobody on the Corporation has a wool technology background and is equipped to grasp the implications of the new developments. 
He was particularly referring to the introduction of objective measurement. This reflects an unfortunate view often put in relation to agricultural marketing boards, and that is that all the expertise has to be on the board itself. It completely ignores the ability of a board to buy expertise, from more than one source if necessary, or to use advisory committees of experts to put forward recommendations. Surely the board should be the decision maker in the light of the board's responsibilities and long term aims. In the case of the Australian Wool Corporation these aims are expressed to be the furtherance of the Australian wool industry, and such aims cannot be divorced from farmers who, no matter how one looks at it, are the single most important sector of that industry. 
The Minister wishes to choose the grower representatives from a list prepared by the Australian Wool Industry Conference so that he can cull those he does not want. He does not accept the right of growers to be responsible for their own selections. I also have to protest at the propositions floated at the recent Australian Wool Industry Conference where the Minister's representative indicated that the Minister would not choose people who were beyond 65 years of age. If this is to be the policy, why is it not included in the Bill? In effect the Minister, through his representative at the AWIC was attempting to influence the selection without having to accept responsibility for the ideas floated on his behalf. 
The Opposition rejects the changed membership proposal for the Corporation and rejects the spill which will result. It can be regarded as a vote of censure by the Government of the Corporation and must damage the goodwill, respect and liaison which the Corporation has built up with most sections of the wool industry. 
I turn now to proposed new sections 20a (1) and 20a (2) of the Wool Industry Bill (No. 2). Proposed new section 20a  (  1 ) reads: 
Before taking any action that could reasonably be expected to affect the conditions of employment, or the demand for labour, in the wool industry, the Corporation shall consult with, and have regard to the views of, the appropriate trade union organizations. 
Proposed new section 20a (2) states: 
The Minister may give to the Corporation such directions in writing as he thinks necessary in connexion with the performance of the duty of the Corporation under sub-section (1). 
The terms 'conditions of employment' and 'demand for labour' are very wide and in the absence of a narrow definition of the wool industry must include all areas from farm operations to the processor and beyond. Many of these areas cannot be accepted as areas in which the Corporation should be involved. Even less desirable from our point of view is the proposal that the Minister for Agriculture under proposed new section 20a (2) should be empowered to give directions binding on the Corporation in such dealings. We reject the concept that the Minister for Agriculture should be a manpower controller in the wool industry. 
In effect ministerial directions under proposed sections 20a (1) and 20a (2) can be operative and effective for up to 1 1 months and kept secret for that time from the public, industry or parliamentary scrutiny. The only time that such directions will be revealed will be at the time of the Corporation's annual report in accordance with the proposed section 90 (7). The amendment proposed by the Opposition will continue the requirement for the Corporation to consult with trade unions on changes in conditions of employment and the like. It also requires the corporation to consult with appropriate grower organisations. The obnoxious provision for ministerial direction to the Corporation on this aspect is removed altogether by our amendment that the proposed section 20a (2) be deleted. 
The other principal amendment which the Opposition will move deals with the handling of the money raised for wool market support by the additional 5 per cent tax levied on all wool sold which operates from 2 September 1974 to 1 July 1975. We wish to see that money clearly identified. We wish to see a full account of the transactions involving that money made to the Parliament and the wool growers. It is for this reason that we support the establishment of a trust fund under section 62a of the Audit Act. In effect, we want the money collected by the additional tax to be treated along the same lines as the money raised by tax for research and promotion purposes. A substantial sum of $45m is involved and this is money the wool growers have agreed to subscribe to help stabilise the market of thenown product. It is therefore important that the money be placed in a trust fund where full accountability will be required on the use of it. I feel that the establishment of a trust fund could well help the establishment in the near future of a market support fund financed by wool growers but operating on the basis of a revolving fund. Once a desired total is reached the earlier grower contributions are repaid as the later grower contributions are collected. Such a scheme will provide a fair basis for grower support of a marketing scheme- one where the Corporation can operate with little financial reliance on and risk of control by governments. 
In particular we reject the proposed section 28a (12) which would enable the money standing to the credit of the Market Support Fund to be 'applied by the Corporation for such purpose in relation to the wool industry as is determined by the Minister after consultation with the Australian Wool Industry Conference'. Having served on the AWIC for a number of years I am aware of what consultation means as interpreted by this Labor Government. It is merely a farcical recitation by the Minister's representative of what the Minister proposes and there is no opportunity for the AWIC to get its views placed before the Minister or even to be given scant consideration. 
The amendment proposed by the Opposition proposed section 28a ( 12) requires that the balance of the moneys:  . . . shall be applied by the Corporation Tor such purpose in relation to the wool industry as is determined by the Minister after approval has been given by the Australian Wool Industry Conference in writing to the Minister on recommendations made by the Corporation. 
This amendment emphasises that the money truly belongs to the wool growers and that they should have an effective say in its future use. It thus protects the wool grower by requiring that the Australian Wool Industry Conference, as the representative of wool growers, shall approve of the use of the money in the future. It does not allow the Minister to treat the AWIC and through it the wool growers with the disrespect with which they have been treated in the past under the meaningless title of 'consultation'. I support the amendment which will be moved by the Deputy Leader of the Country Party to this Bill. It will ensure that the Australian Wool Corporation can continue to play its vital role free, so far as possible, from Government dictation and control. I will support the amendment that will be moved.

-The Opposition supports the 5 Wool Tax Bills now being discussed. The  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party  (Mr Sinclair)  has indicated that the Opposition will not be opposing them. In effect what these Bills do is to carry forward for one more year the temporary arrangements which have applied for the bulk of the 1974-75 wool selling season- at least from September 1974. The Opposition supports the floor price scheme at a level no lower than 250c per kilogram clean. We support the grower levy of 5 per cent on wool realisations, to be placed in a special Market Support Fund to support the wool market and to finance any losses occasioned by the floor price maintenance operations of the Australian Wool Corporation. 
However, the Opposition deplores the decision making processes of the Australian Labor Party Government and the frightening way in which the floor price level for the 1975-76 season was determined over the past few weeks. The whole decision malting process of the parliamentary Labor Party on the wool support price emphasises the scant importance it attaches to the primary producers and to the whole of the rural economy. If we look back we see that it is always issues affecting the rural areas that are used as excuses for votes of confidence in the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam).  Similarly, if the Cabinet and Caucus are spoiling for a showdown the subject on which the showdown occurs is always a matter affecting rural industries or country people. This shows the relative unimportance that the Labor Party places on all things rural. 
Two major decisions for the rural industries and all people living in country areas were made subjects of votes of confidence in the Prime Minister. I refer specifically to the taxation concessions for education- a vital matter for people in country areas aiming to provide adequate education for their children- and also to the petrol price equalisation scheme, which similarly was of great importance to rural industries and to people living away from the capital cities. Both were used as issues on which to test the Prime Minister's popularity. So far as the Labor Party was concerned, the decision itself was unimportant. It was merely a by-product of the internal power struggle within the Party. Similarly, the wool decision for a floor price of 250c per kilogram clean was a by-product of the infighting of the Government. For the Labor Party the fight between the Cabinet and Caucus and its implications on the power base of the Party far outweighed the real issues of ensuring stability, progress and prosperity of the wool industry. 
Yet decisions on the wool industry are not purely concerned with the 80 000 to 100 000 wool growers. The decision made in relation to the wool floor price level has implications and directly effects thousands of people in country towns and also in the capital cities. Every attack on the wool industry similarly threatens the livelihood of thousands of other workers in transport, storage, commerce and so on. Thus whilst the Opposition supports the level of 250c finally decided, it deplores the methods by which that decision was reached. It deplores the uncertainty created through the whole industry and the shock which this uncertainty had throughout the entire wool using section of the international textile trade. 
This legislation, together with the events of the past 2 weeks, has highlighted most effectively 2 major points which wool growers need to appreciate. Firstly it has highlighted the temporary nature of the whole wool marketing structure now in existence. It has emphasised the brittle nature of the current arrangements. It has pointed out quite clearly that the wool support levels are on an annual basis and can be changed at the whim of the Australian Government at any stage. It has pointed out quite clearly that the continuance of the scheme may be judged on issues not pertinent to the wool industry and on factors not necessarily relevant to the situation of the wool market or the wool industry at a particular time. 
The main thing which I feel has been clearly indicated to all wool growers both by this legislation and by the fracas of the past fortnight is that these floor price arrangements are temporary and brittle and cannot be counted on to give long term stability to the industry when they are subject to the whim of any government fad or fancy. It has clearly pointed up the fact that the wool industry still needs more permanent marketing arrangements. In December 1973 the Australian Wool Corporation presented its marketing recommendations. These were widespread, forward looking recommendations aimed at enabling wool to compete effectively as a significant textile fibre within the world textile industry. The appendices supporting those recommendations were received in June 1974. The wool industry policy committee on behalf of the Australian Wool Industry Conference accepted the recommendations on 17 January 1974 subject to certain assurances concerning the commercial autonomy of the Wool Corporation and the freedom with which it could make commercial decisions free of Government direction or intervention. The decision was subsequently supported by the Executive of the Wool Industry Conference and by the Wool Industry Conference itself. In February 1974 and in April 1974 submissions were forwarded by the Executive of the Wool Industry Conference to the Minister for Agriculture advising of the acceptance of the recommendations and requesting that action be taken. What happened? The matter was fobbed off onto an interdepartmental committee. This is purely a delaying tactic and I doubt the sincerity of the Government to proceed with any longterm solution to the problems of the marketing of the Australian wool clip. 
The action of this Government is in direct contrast to its screams and promises of October 1972 when the Australian Wool Board and the Australian Wool Commission were amalgamated to form the Australian Wool Corporation. At that time the Corporation was given the task of preparing a wool marketing scheme which was subsequently produced in December 1973. The Labor Party, then in Opposition, attempted to blame the Liberal-Country Party Government of the day of procrastination and attempted to get a time limit of 6 months on the time the Corporation could have to produce its marketing recommendations. The honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  now the Minister for Northern Development and Minister for the Northern Territory said: 
So the Opposition will move in Committee its amendment which refers specifically to acquisition and also stipulates that an acquisition plan should be brought before the Parliament within 6 months. 
That is what the honourable member- now a Minister- said in October 1972. What action has been taken to fulfil this requirement which the Labor Party in Opposition attempted to force on the Government of the day? Nothing. This Government has sat on the report of the Wool Corporation now for 18 months without making any decision. Speaking again the honourable member for Dawson said: 
We know what will happen. The infamous interdepartmental committee will then meet and examine the Corporation's report. So the circle goes around and around. By the time the inter-departmental committee meets and considers the plan it will probably be shelved or it will be so out of date that another committee will have to be established to examine the matter ... If this Government really wanted marketing reforms and if it really wanted an acquisition scheme, within or without the auction system or combining both, it would have put such a proposal to the Australian Agricultural Council for examination months or years ago. 
These statements were made immediately before the 1972 election. What exactly has the present Government done to sustain the promises in or the implications of those statements? It has dithered, delayed and referred the matter to an interdepartmental committee without the urgency it saw as Opposition in October 1972. 1 feel that it is also relevant to quote a section of a speech in the same debate by the then honourable member for Riverina,  Mr Grassby,  who said: 
The amendments propose that this new authority should formulate a detailed plan for the operation by the Corporation of a scheme to acquire and /or market the Australian clip and to report this plan to the Parliament within 6 months of the commencement of this Act. This is our policy. This is our dedication to fundamental reform. We stand by it and we put it forward today. 
It was put forward then- 12 October 1972 -but it has subsequently been forgotten by the Labor Party since it came into power. 
It is no excuse to trumpet that the Labor Party has done much for the wool industry. I am the first to concede that it has. But it has not done anything significant to attack the basic problem of the industry- that is, the lack of satisfactory long-term marketing arrangements. The current marketing arrangements are temporary and this is made very obvious by the need to discuss this legislation today. No real action has meen taken towards finding a solution to the problem of long-term marketing arrangements. The temporary solution has been good and apt in the circumstances, but it has to be clearly understood that these arrangements are temporary and do not attack a number of the basic long-term marketing problems such as the overall marketing of wool as a textile fibre, sale rosterings problems of private selling and reduction of costs associated with improvements in handling, shipping, insurance and the like. 
The second main lesson that the past few weeks has emphasised is that growers must be prepared to contribute funds to the market support and marketing schemes. Under this legislation there is a readiness on the part of the growers to build up their equity. Last year some $42m was contributed in this way. This has been contributed in the form of a second mortgage and will be the first part to bear the brunt of any losses incurred by the Corporation. If growers are to get a satisfactory marketing organisation free from Government direction then they must expect to contribute. They have indicated that they are prepared and willing to do so. Together with the accumulated profits of the Corporation the grower contribution at this time next year will be substantial. 
asked the Minister for Tourism and Recreation the following question, upon notice:

-The main point that emerges from the examination of the estimates of the Department of Agriculture is that scant regard has been paid to the rural sector by this Labor Government. The Government has not analysed the current situation of agriculture or attempted to aid sections of agriculture which are under severe stress, such as the beef industry. So far as agriculture is concerned, the Government can be described only as having adopted a head in the sand stance. It has refused to implement measures for which there is a real and demonstrated need. It has imposed additional costs on rural industries. It has avoided making decisions on matters which are before it. In effect, it has refused to analyse the rural sector in an objective or meaningful way. It has clearly refused to amend its prejudiced approach to .agricultural matters. ' To judge from the Budget, one would have thought that the rural industries were in a period of prosperity and that no help or aid was necessary. Whilst all except the Government recognise the very plight of beef producers, there are also a number of other areas of agriculture which require urgent examination and action. If we look at the overall situation we find that the projections for net farm income for 1975-76, expressed in real terms, will be much lower than at any time in the past 15 years. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has estimated the gross value of rural production in 1975-76 at $5,503m. This compares with $5,777m in 1974-75 and$6,352m in 1973-74. These figures are actual figures and make no allowances for the fall in real value of the currency. Even in these crude figures the trend of reduced value of production is obvious. There is a fall of $274m on the value of production last year and a fall of $742m on the value of rural production over the year 1 973-74. 
No official estimates of total farm costs have yet been published. But unofficial estimates assume that even with severe pruning of farm expenditure, they will increase by a further 5 per cent on costs for 1974-75. This appears to be a very conservative estimate when we see that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics index of prices paid by farmers rose in the 12 months to March 1975 by some 33 per cent. There appears to be no reason, with the increased fuel, freight and other costs resulting directly from this Budget, for us to assume a much lower increase in costs in the year to come. An estimated 5 per cent increase in the total farm cost figures appears therefore to be conservative, especially in view of the fact that these costs rose by 1 1 per cent last year. It would also appear safe to assume that many purchases were deferred last year and that the prospects for indefinite deferral of many farm items is not possible. Assuming a 5 per cent increase in total farm costs which were $3,950m for 1974-75, the resultant net farm income figure for 1975-76 will be $l,356m. This compares with $ 1,827m for last year and $2,993m in 1973-74. When net farm income figures are converted to real terms by deflating by the Consumer Price Index the true situation is exposed. It shows a fall in net real farm income to a figure well below $700m. 

 Mr David Trebeck of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, assuming a 1 5 per cent inflation rate during 1 975-76, obtains a net farm income figure in real terms of $685m.  Mr Davidson,  a member of the National Rural Advisory Committee, forecasts a level of $625m whilst  Mr Bracken,  a journalist, estimates a figure of $655m. All these figures indicate that net farm income in real terms will be substantially lower than the $2,042m in 1973-74 and $l,068m in 1974-75. In percentage terms the drop is some 39 per cent over one year or 68 per cent over the 2-year period. 
Examination of the figures of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics for net farm income in real terms over the period since 1960-61 indicates that the figure projected for this year is lower than any figure for the previous 1 5 years. It is even lower than the $778m recorded in 1970-71 when the wool industry was at its most critical stage. The overall agricultural situation therefore reveals that some action was necessary by the Government in the agricultural field. With this background one would have expected that the Government would have taken special measures to aid and encourage the rural sector of the economy. This Budget does no such thing. It reveals that the Government is prepared to do nothing to stop the decline in rural earnings. In fact the Budget reduces aid and help to agriculture. The total Budget expenditure on agriculture is reduced from a net Government outlay of $438.9m last year to $199.6m in 1975-76-a fall well in excess of 50 per cent. When the term 'outlay' is used it covers loans as well as nonredeemable expenditures. The net Government outlay figures I have quoted differ from those shown on page 73 of Statement No. 1 attached to the Budget Papers. I have added to these figures the interest payments payable to the Government by the Australian Wool Corporation in order to get the true cost to the industry. These amount to $8.2m for 1974-75 and are estimated at $37.5m for 1975-76. 
The overall situation of agriculture today does not justify a reduction in Government outlays on agriculture to the extent of 50 per cent over those of last year. The fall in outlays cannot solely be explained by the reduction in loans made available for wool support operations of the Aus.tralian Wool Corporation. Another significant aspect to be examined is the payments which will be withdrawn from the rural sector by way of levies, charges and the like for research, promotion, disease eradication and marketing support or stabilisation. In 1974-75 the total payment by agriculture through such levies and charges was $ 1 63.5m. This year the amount to be extracted from the rural industries is estimated to be $202.6m. Thus on the one hand we have reduced total outlay whilst on the other charges made against agriculture by the Government have increased substantially. Outlay is down by over 50 per cent whereas the rip-offs from the rural sector have increased by 25 per cent. 
The contribution by certain agricultural industries is heavy indeed. If we look at wool, we see that the levy to cover market support operations of the Australian Wool Corporation, research, promotion and administrative charges is to rise to 8 per cent of gross wool proceeds. This is estimated to withdraw from the wool industry some $74.5m this year as against $64.7m last year. Additionally as I have previously pointed out, the interest payment to the Government is estimated to be $37.5m this year. The total wool industry pay-out therefore is estimated to be $1 12m this year, a rise of some 60 per cent over the total of $69.9m in 1974-75. 
The Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates the value of wool production this year at $970m. Thus the net return to the wool industry deducting only Government charges will be this year $858m compared to $879m last year and $l,202m in 1973-74. When these figures- they have not been converted to real terms- are looked at in the light of cost increases for shearing, superphosphate, freight, fuel and shire rates the true profitability picture of the wool industry during this year can be seen. The Government appears to be tied to the retention of the current floor price operations and seems to have rejected out of hand the recommendations of the marketing report of the Australian Wool Corporation. In effect the industry is contributing some 1 1  Vi  per cent of its gross returns on market support, research and promotion but it has no marketing body which can institute real savings by attacking costs in the freighting, shipping, selling and preparation of wool. The need for market reform in the wool industry has never been more evident. Already we know that freight costs to Europe have risen 25 per cent from 1 September this year with a further 25 per cent increase to operate from September next year. 
I have spoken on only 2 aspects of the Budget as it affects agriculture. The whole Budget adds to rural costs by increasing costs for fuel with consequent freight increases. There have been substantial increases in postal and telephone charges. There has been no attempt to control inflation. All of these factors have a disproportionate effect on farmers, country businessmen and country residents. 
-In speaking to the estimates of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of the Special Minister of State, I wish to confine my remarks to the Industries Assistance Commission. At the time of the framing of the Budget, the Government had before it 4 reports from the Industries Assistance Commission- the interim report on the superphosphate bounty of 31 July 1975, the report on assistance to new land farms in Western Australia, the report on tuberculosis and brucellosis dated 10 April 1975, and the report on rural income fluctuations dated 30 June 1975. All of these reports were ignored when the Budget was prepared. No wonder farmer organisations in Australia are seriously questioning the sincerity of this Government when matters are referred for report to the Industries Assistance Commission. No wonder farmer organisations are seriously questioning whether they should participate, at great cost, in further Industries Assistance Commission inquiries. 
The Industries Assistance Commission is a tool of government designed to allow investigation into problems and the formulation of informed recommendations for government consideration. It is clearly still up to the Government to reject, accept or amend the recommendations of the Commission. My criticism of the Government is the way in which this valuable tool, the Industries Assistance Commission, is being used by the Labor Government. Firstly, it is being used as a 'too-hard basket'. The beef industry is a classic example of the use of the Industries Assistance Commission as a 'too-hard basket'. The legislation setting up the Industries Assistance Commission specifically permits short term action to be taken by the Government in needy cases without any requirement to refer the matter to the Commission. The beef industry is in serious trouble, as many speakers from both the Liberal and National Country parties have so adequately pointed out in recent debates. Prices for beef are down, and many people depending on beef for a major proportion of their farm income are in acute financial strife. 
The Government did provide finance at exorbitant rates of interest and it has provided some matching finance to certain State governments. But this aid is inadequate, and it is not meeting the problems of the industry. One would have expected any competent government to give aid to the beef industry by means of the Budget. What did the Labor Government do? It referred the matter to the Industries Assistance Commission for report, when urgent short term alleviation of the problems of beef producers was required. There are many short term measures which could have been taken, such as additional carry-on finance at reasonable rates of interest, acceleration of the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication programs, special grants to needy producers, and the suspension of the beef export and other levies. 
The speech of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  in response to the Budget Speech proposed the lifting of these levies and the payment of welfare payments to beef producers in critical financial situations. The cost would have been about $34m. There is a significant difference between the attitude of the joint Opposition parties on aid to the beef industry and the callous attitude of this Government. As far as beef is concerned, this Government has used the Industries Assistance Commission as a 'too-hard basket'. It is a convenient means of escaping the need to make a decision at a time when decisions are desperately needed. 
I can refer also to the Government using the Industries Assistance Commission as a 'too-hard basket' in the case of rural income fluctuations. In the 1974 election publication  This LandLabor's Rural Program  the Minister for Agriculture  (Senator Wriedt)  said: 
The Labor Government has under close examination a range of issues aimed at bringing greater stability to farm income from year to year and allowing farmers to plan ahead with greater security. These measures include prosperity bonds, crop insurance, tax averaging and a farm income stabilisation scheme. 
That election statement clearly implies that the Labor Party had examined these matters and was ready to implement them very soon. That statement was made on 1 May 1974. It was not until 29 October 1974 that the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  announced that the matter of income fluctuations of rural producers had been referred to the Industries Assistance Commissionthat is 6 months after the glowing and promising words of the Minister for Agriculture. Obviously the election statement was false, or the Government wanted to use the Industries Assistance Commission as a 'too-hard basket'. Now the report has been received and still no action has been taken on it. 
I ask honourable members to contrast this with the positive policies on taxation and income fluctuations put forward by the Liberal and National Country Parties at the election in 1974. Those policies received outright support by the Industries Assistance Commission report. The joint Opposition parties, in contrast to the empty statements of  Senator Wriedt  earlier referred to, promised an income reserve fund to spread the effect of seasonal income variations on the taxation of primary producers and also promised changes to the taxation averaging provisions. Both of these policy planks have been endorsed in the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. Despite the report, no action has been taken on it and the words of  Senator Wriedt  at the 1974 election now have a very hollow and insincere ring about them. 
A greater matter of concern- this is even more important in the long term than the buck passing and too hard basket approach of the Government in referring matters to the Commission- is the lack of consideration of the IAC reports by the Government. I mentioned earlier that some 4 reports affecting agriculture had not been acted on. These are the tuberculosis and brucellosis reports, the interim report on the superphosphate bounty, the report on new land farm in Western Australia and the report on rural income fluctuations. The report on assistance to new land farms is particularly important. Immediate action is required on it. It proposes additional sources of finance and restructuring of current and developmental debts. It recommends the extension of the rural reconstruction scheme as a means of allowing those wishing to withdraw from their farms the opportunity to do so. It suggests that negotiations should take place between the State and Federal governments on this matter. To my knowledge, no action or discussions have been initiated. It goes to prove the need for additional rural credit facilities which have been part of the policies of the Opposition parties for some time. The 1974 election policy of the joint Opposition parties promised a rural bank to cover areas of deficiency in the rural credit field. Again, there is a contrast between the realistic policies of the joint Opposition parties and the glowing promises in the rural credit field put out by the Labor Party in the 1 972 electionpromises not yet honoured and probably never to be honoured by this Government. 
The new land farms situation in Western Australia is critical. I call for immediate action on the reports of the Industries Assistance Commission in its new land inquiry. The superphosphate subsidy report of the Industries Assistance Commission recommended by a two to one majority that the subsidy be reinstated. The Prime Minister has already indicated that the recommendations are to be assessed upon the basis of prejudice. To describe as rather pathetic the efforts of 2 IAC Commissioners who backed the return of the superphosphate bounty clearly demonstrates the view of the Government towards the Industries Assistance Commisssion. The Prime Minister's prejudice is clearly showing through and will probably sway the Caucus decision. The  President  of the Australian Farmers Federation,  Mr Noel  Hogan, rightly criticised the Prime Minister for his biased attitude. The Government's policy on the superphosphate subsidy shows the substantial difference between the policies of the Government and the joint Opposition parties. We have consistently supported the retention of the superphosphate bounty. We see it as essential to give the necessary incentive and encouragement for continued agricultural production, to boost and or retain overseas earnings and to offset partially the crippling effects of inflation in the primary industries. 
Farmer organisations are seriously asking whether they should continue to appear before Industries Assistance Commission hearings. Each submission and appearance is costlysomewhere between $3,000 and $30,000. Additionally, witnesses incur considerable personal costs. I can point to examples of farmers travelling 200 miles to appear before new land hearings. Some 70 witnesses in the electorate of Canning who appeared before the new land hearings have expressed their disappointment at the lack of decision on the recommendations of the inquiry. Many are disillusioned. Who can blame them? The United Farmers and Graziers Association of South Australia and the Farmers Union of Western Australia have both questioned the worth of appearances before the IAC if they are to be totally ignored by the Government. Interaction between the Government and the IAC is important for both rural and secondary industries. The Commission is clearly a tool of the Government. It should be a tool giving considered, informed and logical advice and recommendations to the Government. Any proper government would require sound reasons to reject a recommendation of the IAC. This Government and  Mr Whitlam  have indicated that they know best, that advice is not necessary and that the recommendations of the IAC should be ignored when they run counter to a Government prejudice. In particular, there is no reason to use the IAC as a too hard basket or as an excuse to delay taking action where urgent action is required. 

 Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. 

asked the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, upon notice: 
1 ) What grants from the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account to Aboriginal groups and organisations in Western Australia have been paid or approved since 30 June 1 972. 
To whom were the grants made, and for what purposes. 
-Firstly I would like to comment on several points which were made by the honourable member for Eden.Monaro  (Mr Whan).  Particularly I would like to comment on his statement that the Government has not added doubt or instability to the wool market. Even the keenest Labor supporter would view the blundering method of determining the floor price level for this season as clearly undermining the confidence of wool growers and of wool users. It can hardly be accepted as an objective statement by the honourable member especially since the level of the reserve price was used for interfactional fighting in the Labor Party- a fight between the Cabinet and Caucus- in order to promote issues within the Party irrespective of the final result as far as wool was concerned. Furthermore this fight was promoted publicly and it certainly could not have added confidence either to wool users or to people processing or holding stocks of wool. 
The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is clearly and blatantly wrong when he asserts that the Government has not added an element of uncertainty to the market. One of the greatest contributors to the current instability of the wool market is the fact that the Government took such a long and blundering way of deciding the current reserve price for this season. What worries me even more is that under the current conditions we could well have the same situation- if the Labor Government stays in office until June or July, which is most unlikely- of the Government making the same decision in the same blundering way. What confidence will that give to the wool market, the wool growers or the users, processors or stockists, etc? 
I noted in particular that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ignored one of the most significant points made by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair),  the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party, who stated that a Liberal-National Country Party government would look sympathetically at the recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation. That is rather strange when we compare the statement today of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro with his 1972 accusations of delay on the part of the Liberal- Country Party Government when the marketing report was first received. It is also interesting to contrast the remarks of Labor Party members at that stage with their remarks at this stage. The statement made by  Senator Wriedt,  then Minister for Agriculture, in a publication entitled  This Land- Labor's Rural Program  issued in 1974, contrasts directly with the statement today by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.  Senator Wriedt  said: 
I have already stated publicly that I personally accept the main objectives and broad framework of the Corporation's proposals. These proposals are significant and have important implications for the future of the Australian wool industry. I can see in the Corporation's proposals the opportunity for improving the overall efficiency of wool marketing in Australia, a move which will benefit ail wool growers. Many details embodied in the Corporation's report still need to be clarified. Accordingly, consultations will continue between the Corporation, all wool industry sectors and the Government. Important changes such as these need careful study by all concerned. I would hope that woolgrowers consider very deeply the importance of making changes to wool marketing and the extent to which wool growers are prepared to invest in the efficient marketing of their product. 
That statement, I suggest, contrasts vividly with the remarks today of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. 
It is also interesting, when talking about wool, to look at the remarks of the honourable member for Dawson  (Dr Patterson),  the new Minister for Agriculture, in 1971-72 on the need for marketing reform and the need for acceptance of the wool marketing recommendations of the Corporation. I should like to take just one more point raised by the honourable member for EdenMonaro. He made much play of the fact that this was the first time that there had been an openended agreement with regard to wool support. To some extent this is true. But I ask: What would have been the decision if the market did not look bright at the time that the floor price was set? I am sure that the squabble would have developed even more and there would have been no commitment. 
As the honourable member for Kingston says, or less. I should also like to contrast those statements made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro with the statement made by  Senator Wriedt  in Paris several years ago when he was the Minister for Agriculture. He was speaking on the wheat stabilisation agreement and the open-handedness, as he thought, of the wheat stabilisation scheme at that stage. 
The Bill that we are considering is the Wool Marketing (Loan) Bill 1974. It provides for the Australian Government to raise the amount allocated for the Australian Wool Corporation from $350m in all to $356m by way of grants. In effect, this is what was promised in the 1974-75 Budget plus an additional $6m. It provides for loans from commercial sources to be guaranteed by the Government to the limit of $70m. The Bill is significant in that it assures both wool growers and wool users that the Australian Government is prepared to support the market fully and the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation for this season. I want to emphasise the point that it is for this season only. This assurance is vitally needed in view of the Labor Government's indecision, vacillation and blundering in determining the level of the reserve price to operate for the 1975-76 season. No one associated with the wool industry could discount the damage done to the confidence of all wool using countries in the ability and willingness of the Australian Wool Corporation to hold a firm reserve price level. 
The  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party in speaking earlier to this Bill pointed out the effect of this blundering exercise. Many of the problems and the current need to buy up to 30 per cent of the current market offerings are probably due to the indecision and lack of confidence inspired by this method of determination of the floor price level by the current Labor Government. It is significant that at this stage the joint Opposition Parties support the reserve price operations of the Australian Wool Corporation. But we have emphasised- the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party has emphasised this point in particular- that we in government would be looking sympathetically at the marketing recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation. I think we have to look at this stage towards the current situation as being a step in the line- and a desirable step at this stage which is having desirable effects. But we cannot look at it at this stage as the ultimate in wool marketing or in permitting of growers to control the disposal of their own product. It is step one and it should be regarded as step one only. 
One point to which I also particularly want to refer was raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party, and that is that the taxpayers are virtually ensured that they will not be bearing any of the losses, if losses do occur of the Australian Wool Corporation. Some of these views, I feel, have been encouraged by certain statements by people in the Australian Labor Party. They use terms such as 'using taxpayers money', etc., to support the operations of the Wool Corporation. In effect, the Australian Wool Corporation pays high commercial rates of interest on the loans that have been made available to it by the Government. We have only to look at the Budget to see that the interest paid by the Australian Wool Corporation to the Australian Government will be something like $37.5m this year. Honourable members must realise that this is a significant slug firstly on the Corporation and ultimately on the wool growers. As far as taxpayers are concerned, there is no ultimate charge on the current market support operations of the Australian Wool Marketing Corporation. 
I think that one of the greatest dangers to the Australian wool industry at this stage is the rising of internal costs. I should like to quote from a speech made by  Mr Ken  Clarke, the managing director of the International Wool Secretariat.  His  speech was reproduced in the  Wool News Digest  of July 1975. He said: 
One of the biggest question marks over wool 's future is the capacity of the sheep industry to continue to absorb cost increases. Shearing costs, fuel and fertilizer costs and prices of material and equipment used in wool growing have increased steadily over the years and recently at alarming rates. Woolgrowing properties in Australia have declined in number especially from 1966 onwards as a result of drought and the domestic price decline for wool in the 1969-71 period. Those who remain have been hard put to raise productivity rapidly enough to cope with the cost-price squeeze. To survive, the industry will require continued technological advances and further adjustments in the organisation of farms. If inflationary trends did not abate, if unfavourable price conditions prevailed for any sustained period, survival of the industry could well rest on success in developing less labour-intensive methods of removing wool from the sheep. 
The most important thing for us to realise is that wool's future is not a fait accompli about to happen. It will depend very much on the efforts we make now to enlarge demand, to improve the processing of wool and its end-use performance, to impart new attributes to wool products and to utilise their existing characteristics and possibilities to our best competitive advantage. In short, the future for wool will be very  much of the wool industry's own making, although also dependent in no small measure, on the actions of governments of major wool-exporting countries. 
To sum up, wool has no assured place in the future. It must make its place. This place can only be won with sufficient resources, men and money. 
We refer particularly in that quotation to the way in which costs have increased. 
Many of the costs are because of Government actions. We all know that the increases in costs borne by wool growers have been substantial. Costs of materials, superphosphate, rates and taxes have gone along at the same rates or at greater rates than the direct costs of getting wool from the sheep's back to the mill. Let us have a quick look at the cost to the wool growing industry of moving wool from the sheep's back to the industry. I quote from a paper prepared by McEvoy and Mayman for the Australian Wool Corporation, Research and Development Department, which states: 
In the period 1970 to May, 1975 the total costs from sheep's back to mill have increased by 86 per cent, but those costs borne by woolgrowers have increased by 120 per cent and those borne by the mills by 39 per cent. . . . November, 1973 to May 1975, the woolgrowers' costs increased by 20 per cent (or by 40 per cent if the market support levy is included) and the mills' by 26 per cent. During the same period the average price obtained for wool decreased by 30 per cent. This latest increase in growers costs mainly results from increases of 34 per cent in shearing shed expenses. 
The article also states that since November 1973 there has been an increase of some 225 per cent in the cost of crutching and so on. So the costs, and the rises in many of these charges, have been significant indeed. If we look very briefly at the report we will find that in 1970 the total cost then from sheep's back to mill door was 29.66c per kilo. The cost per kilo of greasy wool was 17.41c to the wool grower and the cost to the mill was 12.25c. In November 1973 this figure had risen to 46.8c per kilo and in May 1975 it had risen to 66.6c. Of this amount some 49.57c per kilo was borne by growers and some 17.03c per kilo was borne by the mills. Since then- they were May 1975 figures- we have had significant increases in freight rates of 25 per cent on the European line from September 1975, with foreshadowed increases of a further 25 per cent in September 1976. 
If we look at the situation in one other way, we find that with regard to the gross return to the industry the Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimates that there will be gross receipts by the wool industry of $970m in 1975-76. The most ominous aspect of the figures is that if we look at the contribution that the wool growing industry is making to the Government purse we find that it is contributing some $74.5m for market research, market support operations, research and promotional levies and the administrative costs of the Australian Wool Corporation- in effect a total of $ 1 12m this year including interest payable to the Australian Government by the Corporation. As far as wool production is concerned, that means the net figure, taking away only the Government charges, is about $858m. That will be the net figure payable to the wool industry after Government charges have been deducted. This compares most unfavourably with the $ 1,202m received in the industry in 1973-74 and quite unfavourably with the $879m received last financial year. In effect, the wool growers will be contributing to government sources by way of interest charges and levies some 11.5 per cent of the gross value of wool production. In a situation in which costs are rising so rapidly and are reaching such great heights, the effect and the significance of what is happening can be readily assessed. 
The greatest danger with respect to these costs in the current situation is that the present mandate of the Australian Wool Corporation gives that body very limited ability to reduce many of these costs. These costs are incurred particularly in the handling, preparation, selling, freighting and shipping of wool. The marketing report by the Australian Wool Corporation which was delivered in December 1973 offered many ways, I suggest, of cutting down some of these costs. These were ways of reducing those costs which are not now available to the Australian Wool Corporation under its present charter. But that marketing report which was presented in 1973 has been hashed around by this Government. We do not know where it is. As far as we can see, it has gone to an interdepartmental committee. That is probably a good excuse for it to be buried, hidden and forgotten. 
It joins a whole list of similar reports on agricultural measures which need immediate examination but which have also gone into the same 'too hard' basket. I mention the reports by the Industries Assistance Commission dealing with the beef industry, the superphosphate bounty, the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy, the taxation averaging provisions for farmers and assistance to new land farmers in Western Australia, to name a few. All of these reports have been hidden. No action has been taken. They have been put into the 'too hard' basket. This Government refuses to act at all on them. It seems very much to me that the marketing report of the Australian Wool Corporation is suffering the same fate. 
The tragedy of the situation is that, despite the fact that the honourable member for EdenMonaro disagreed violently with the ex-Minister for Agriculture,  Senator Wriedt,  on this matter, that is what has happened. The recommendations of the marketing report of the Australian Wool Corporation contain a great deal of merit. They should be fully investigated. I was very pleased to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian National Country Party give a certain and definite undertaking that we would sympathetically review these recommendations. 
Let me speak very quickly on the subject of the amount of money that is being paid out by the wool industry for research and promotion purposes. I think that we all support the view that some research and promotion is necessary. But I think we also accept that a requirement exists in respect of any government money to ensure that value is being obtained for that expenditure. Even though the research and promotion programs have been in operation for quite some time very limited assessment of the value and the work of that expenditure has been made. We do not know whether good money is being spent on bad promotional work or on work using the wrong methods. The previous Government did commission the McKinsey report, but that was purely an organisational report concerned with the International Wool Secretariat. It seems to me that as the charges on the Australian wool growers for promotional and research work are so high there should be some means by which the value of this expenditure can be assessed. I make the plea to the Government that it should give some consideration to trying to assess just what value Australians are getting from what is paid in respect of research and promotion efforts to establish whether money is being wasted and, if not, to determine whether those funds could be used more effectively. These questions are quite vital when we consider that some $20m of wool growers' money is involved in this work each year. 
One most significant point, to which I now refer, was made by the Deputy Leader of the National Country Party when he referred in his speech to what would happen in respect of any shortfall of funds that should eventuate in the Australian Wool Corporation this year and asked whether this Government would have the integrity, the decency and the courage to face up to that event and to give further support if necessary. I feel that the wool market is improving to the stage where this will not be necessary but we would like an assurance from the Government that further support will be forthcoming if it is necessary. 
Briefly, the Opposition parties do not oppose this Bill. We accept the role of the Australian Wool Corporation in the current conditions. We welcome that role. We see it as a development of the wool marketing process. We do not see it as the final element in what should be the most ideal wool marketing set-up in Australia. That is why we ask that there should be clear, concise and fairly immediate decisions on the marketing recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation. 
asked the Minister for Health, upon notice:

asked the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, upon notice: 
Concerning the night closure of the Quairading Telephone Exchange since 25 October 1974. 
what is the cost to the Australian Telecommunications Commission in a full year of the reduced rental rates now applicable, 
what is the saving to the Australian Telecommunications Commission in a full year on wages for night attendants and 
c) what revenue is estimated to be forgone in a full year. 
My question is directed to the Minister for Overseas Trade. I note the Minister's recent trip to Japan and ask whether during his discussions in that country he was given any indication that there would be a possibility of long term agreements for the sale of Australian beef to Japan. 

 -Mr Speaker, pursuant to standing order 143 and in view of the notice given by the honourable member for Port Adelaide for General Business Thursday No. 1, 1 wish to ask the honourable member for Port Adelaide a question. I refer to reports that the Leader of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party attempted to borrow or beg $500,000 from Arab sources to finance either the Federal Labor campaign or to augment his personal slush funds. Will the honourable member indicate whether his Bill envisages that such attempts should be reported and disclosed? If this is so, will he prove his sincerity by pressing the Leader of the Opposition to reveal fully all aspects of this sordid affair? Furthermore, will he fully reveal any association that he personally had in such activities? 
My question, which is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry, refers to the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on assistance to new land farmers in Western Australia. The Minister will recall that the report recommended that discussions should take place between the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government on help to such farmers. I ask: Firstly, can the Minister indicate what action has been taken to date on the recommendations in that report? Secondly, can he say whether discussions have yet taken place between the 2 governments? If not, when is it expected that such discussions will take place? 
-Listening to the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating),  I think we are all well aware of the farce of the Australian Labor Party pretending to represent rural interests, because I think his speech today demonstrated very clearly that Party's lack of interest and lack of appreciation of rural problems. The Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Amendment Bill is based on an Industries Assistance Commission report tabled in January 1975. During the 11 months that the Labor Party remained in office after that time it refused to take any notice of the report or any action on it. It also ignored other reports. There was a lack of concern by the Labor Party for the rural sector. Not only the interim report on the superphosphate bounty but a number of other studies were put before the Labor Party, but it did not act on them. Let me mention several of them to point up the pretence and falsity of the remarks of the honourable member for Blaxland. 
A report on assistance to new land farms in Western Australia was presented on 21 May 1975. No action was taken on that report by the Labor Government. Contrast that with the reply given by the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  in this House yesterday that in the short time the Liberal and National Country Parties have been in government action has already been taken on certain aspects of that report. The difference is very clear. A report on the elimination of tuberculosis and brucellosis was presented on 10 April 1975. During the months subsequent to that absolutely no action was taken by the Labor Party on it. It is false for honourable members opposite to say that they seriously believe in action in this regard. All their words about observing Industries Assistance Commission recommendations have proved to be quite false. A report on rural income fluctuations came down at the end of June 1975. Again no action was taken by the Labor Party on it. I think the honourable member for Blaxland should be made to change his views that the Labor Party appreciates rural problems. 
In fact, the whole term of the Labor Government proved quite conclusively that on the basis of bias and prejudice it was prepared to attack the rural sector and all people who live in country areas. It refused to take action on the beef industry. As I have shown, it used the IAC as a 'too hard' basket to avoid making decisions in the rural sector. Despite glowing promises concerning rural credit in 1972, no action was taken. There is a demonstrated need for action in that area. The fiasco with the reserve price for wool also gives an appreciation of the lack of concern by the Labor Party for the rural sector. 
We have given a guarantee at the current rate, which you were not prepared to do. All you did was destroy any confidence in the industry by reducing the reserve price from 250c per kilo clean to 200c per kilo clean. If any other action could have reduced confidence in the wool industry more than the action taken by the Labor Party I would like to hear of it. Quite clearly, action has to be taken in the wool industry in u number of areas, particularly the level of the reserve price. 
A number of other attacks were made on people in country areas through increased telephone charges, fuel costs, postage rates and so on. Overall the rural sector was very much damaged by the complete lack of economic management by the Labor Party. Now the honourable member for Blaxland is quite prepared to pretend that the Labor Government took an interest in agriculture. The very fact that he occupies the shadow portfolio that he does proves quite conclusively that the Labor Party has no genuine interest. The Labor Government was ready to attack the rural sector and use it as a means of paying for its extravagant policies elsewhere. However, as time went on it was not even prepared to try to account for its lavish policies or to pay for them. Too often it accepted at face value the policy outlined by its Prime Minister or the fatuous view taken by him that the rural sector had never had it so good. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was only too happy to impose a number of penalties on the rural sector. In the period from 1945-46 to 1973-74, in fact wheat growers subscribed to the home consumption price of wheat something like $409m- that is, the loss incurred by the growers in providing the home consumption price and subtracting the Commonwealth contribution to the wheat stabilisation scheme. We noted even in the wheat stabilisation Bills which came into the House several weeks ago that whilst the overseas price for wheat is some $120 per tonne the home consumption price is less than $100 per tonne; and that is a substantial contribution by wheat growers to a lower home consumption price for wheat. 
The Labor Party goes along with the proposition that the rural sector is still prosperous. It refuses to face up to the true position of agriculture at this stage; that is, that whilst the sugar and grain industries are prosperous, there are a number of other areas, particularly the grazing and dairying areas as well as the fruit industries, which are in real difficulties. We have realised that action will be necessary in the future in relation to beef and wool. Even though the grain and sugar industries may be prosperous at this time, substantial cost pressures are building up in those industries and they will be affected. 
One of the criticisms levelled against the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Amendment Bill, which deals with the superphosphate bounty, is that the benefit will not go to the people in need. If one analyses the categories of people to whom it will be going, one finds that roughly 66 per cent of the superphosphate is used in the pastoral industries, and the pastoral industries, both beef and wool, are in difficulties at this stage. In fact, less than 20 per cent of the superphosphate is used in the production of wheat. The dairying industry and other areas in substantial need also use some 20 per cent of the total production of superphosphate. In particular I should like to point out the position of new land farmers in Western Australia. There are some 3000 of these in Western Australia, constituting something like 15 per cent of the total farm population in Western Australia. The Industries Assistance Commission report on new land farms states: 
The significance of the cost of fertiliser to new land farms was highlighted by the BAE which found from its case studies of new land farms in the southern areas of the Eastern region that fertiliser costs 'represented 3S.6 per cent of total costs in 1966-67 and subsequently fell . . . to 27.7 per cent in 1972-73'. 
In 1966-67 prices for superphosphate were very much lower than today. It then goes on to point out that as a basis of comparison established farms had costs representing some 13 per cent of total costs in relation to superphosphate. If we look at the whole situation of real farm incomethese figures are deflated by the consumer price index- we find that in 1975-76 real farm incomes are predicted to amount to $854m. That compares sadly with the figure of $ 1,367m in 1972-73 and $ 1,930m in 1973-74. The figure is even worse than the $925m for 1974-75. The reasons for that are clear. It can be attributed to rising prices and also falling markets in a number of areas. 
Whilst farm costs were reasonably constant in the period from 1965-66 to 1971-72, they have almost doubled since then. In fact, some increases have been as high as 37 per cent per annum. It is clear that adjustment in agriculture is sadly needed and adjustment is needed in a number of other areas. In particular I refer to rural credit, in relation to which action has to be taken. This Government has pledged itself to take action in that area. The dairy industry obviously needs action to be taken in relation to it. That is an area which was completely ignored by the previous Government, but it is an area which will not be ignored by this Government. The fruit growing industry needs reconstruction and rebuilding in various ways, and that has to be effectively tackled by this Government. At least this Government has shown that it is ready to provide short term assistance to the beef industry. 
Obviously many adjustments have to be made in relation to agriculture at this stage, and many of those adjustments will be very significant indeed. Agriculture throughout the years has shown a readiness to adjust and finance its adjustments from its own resources. However, the size of the adjustments necessary to cater for current prices and conditions are well beyond the resources of agriculture. There is a need for governments to come in, to plan and to help these adjustments to take place. Subsidies, such as the ones about which we are talking now, are temporary, and they buy time to allow the planning and the implementation of aid in order that agriculture can adjust to the conditions now pertaining. As I said, agriculture in the past has normally taken these functions of adjustment upon itself. They are too great today to be carried out without some help from the Government. I think 2 passages from the interim report on superphosphate of the Industries Assistance Commission are particularly relevant in this regard. The report states: ... the Commission considers that the question of government assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers should be examined with respect to the effects on the efficiency of resource use, adjustment to change, and income transfers within the community. At this stage the Commission has not reached a conclusion concerning the desirability or otherwise of assistance for the consumption of phosphatic fertilisers in the longer term. 
Later in its report the Commission says: 
The Commission believes that problems of adjustment and welfare are, in general, best dealt with by specific measures rather than by input subsidies. Nevertheless, such subsidies can provide some benefits, and may be of considerable importance for some people. 
Having regard to the recent developments in price relativities, the uncertainties to which they give rise, and their destabilising effects on incomes in several rural industries (including some which are relatively low-cost), the Commission will recommend restoration of the bounty which lapsed at the end of 1 974, as a short-term measure. 
In effect that is exactly what the Government is doing by. means of this legislation. It is accepting the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission, which were rejected by the previous Government. By doing so the Government will' allow a full report to be made and a decision to be taken in the light of that full report. That contrasts very drastically, as I said, with the measures adopted by and performance of the Labor Party in this regard. 
There are a number of economic justifications for the levy. In particular I think we can argue that agriculture generally is a very lowly protected industry. The costs of adjustment for secondary industries are, to a large extent, insulated from adjustment pressures because of tariffs and tariff reviews. Such insulation does not apply to agriculture- In fact, agriculture has greater pressures and greater difficulties in adjustment because of the fact that there are a number of highly protected industries in Australia. In fact, tariff compensation was advocated in the Green Paper. As the authors of the Green Paper postulate, agriculture generally would desire lower tariff measures overall than the tariff support given to secondary industries, but that is hot always possible or desirable. Across the board cuts on tariffs, as were implemented by the Labor Government in combination with its other policies, showed that such measures are quite unrealistic. With that in mind, I think we are quite justified in pressing a case for tariff compensation. We want to see tariffs reduced at every level as soon as possible. But that is a long term and relatively big task. In fact, tariffs do maladjust resources; they direct resources from efficient industries, including agriculture, to the highly protected industries. Implicit in these things are costs imposed on the agricultural industry- costs in regard to labour, costs in regard to a number of inputs, and also costs in regard to the price that is being paid for capital and labour. 
It can be argued also at this stage, I think, that the present rock phosphate prices are abnormally high and well above the long term trend. We have seen substantial increases in the rock phosphate price levels in recent years. More than half of Australia's rock phosphate is priced at world levels, although the price of phosphate from some sources is based on cost of production. However, I think it will be agreed that there is some substance in the proposition that if the rock phosphate prices at the moment are well above the long term trend some help should be given to the consumers of it. 
There are indications at this stage that world rock phosphate prices may be falling. This supports the view that present prices, are an aberration of the long term trend so far as prices are concerned. The Government gave aid to the beef industry on very much the same basis- that is that the current prices for beef are an aberration of the long term overall world price for beef and that we are going through a temporary recession. I think it can be well argued that the current prices for rock phosphate are temporarily high and that we can expect a levelling. In effect the subsidy will have some effect in helping during that period. In manufacturing industry short term disruption caused by imports is a common justification for increased assistance, even though the resource allocation arguments are seldom as powerful as they are for the rural export industries. 
This debate also emphasises clearly the need for the development of the rock phosphate deposits at Duchess in Queensland. There are substantial difficulties involved in such development. We have substantial infrastructure costs to start with and these will place great demand on government and private enterprise. Substantial costs also are involved in upgrading the rock and in altering existing manufacturing plants so as to be able to use that rock. However, when we look at the general situation in Australia and our dependence on superphosphate it is quite clear that current sources are not inexhaustible and that we have to develop our own resources. It appears that the Duchess deposits can provide the answer. I welcome the indications by the  Deputy  Prime Minister  (Mr Anthony)  that emphasis will be placed on the development of these deposits. 
Let me emphasise, in closing, that these Bills are not welfare measures, an idea which the Labor Party chooses to promote. I think members of the Opposition have proved conclusively that they view them as welfare measures by referring to them in relation to limited tonnages. Those references indicate clearly that they regard them as welfare measures. In fact the minority report of the Industries Assistance Commission proves conclusively that in their opinion they are welfare measures. I want to quote the reference by the previous Minister for Agriculture,  Senator Wriedt,  to the Industries Assistance Commission. I shall quote from a Press statement of that time which states: 

 Senator Wriedt said that the Government had decided to allow the former bounty to lapse . . . The original objectives of the bounty were to encourage fertilizer use and to boost export income- these had been largely achieved. At the time the decision was made, the rural sector was generally buoyant and continued government assistance could hardly be justified when there were so many priority areas of public expenditure which had been neglected for years. 
The Minister said that circumstances had changed markedly during 1 974 and there was now a case for consideration of the need for assistance for rural industries in the use of phosphatic fertilizers. Farmers have benefitted directly through Australia's ability to obtain rock phosphate from Christmas Island at well below world parity, and Australian superphosphate is still priced below that in the United States. However, increased prices of raw materials, and freight have resulted in the Australian price rising by some $27 per tonne in the last six months. 

 Senator Wriedt said that it is relevant that the pastoral industries are the major users of phosphate fertilizer. Wool and meat prices had fallen drastically at the same time as costs had increased putting a severe squeeze on farmers' incomes. 
I unhesitatingly support both these Bills and recommend them to the House.

asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: 
1 ) Has his attention been drawn to the answer to question No. 1027  [Hansard,  3 October 1974, page 2272) in which the former Minister for Health advised that the Departmental Committee which inquired into quarantine in Western Australia in March 1974 did not report any Quarantine deficiencies (a) at ports in the north west or Western Australia, (b) at aerodromes in the north west of Western Australia, (c) at Kwinana and (d) in the examination of overseas mail arriving in Western Australia. 
Is it a fact that the answer was misleading because in paragraph 3 of the Committee's report it was stated that the Director-General instructed officers on 12 March 1974 to review the quarantine operations at Perth and Fremantle; if so, can he say whether the Minister was aware of this. 
Can he say whether the answer was prepared by Departmental officers; if so, by whom and what positions do they now hold.

asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: 
What proportion of rock phosphate shipped from Christmas Island to Australia has been carried by Australian vessels in each of the last three financial years. 
What proportion is expected to be carried by Australian vessels in the financial years 1975-76 and 1976-77. 
Is there any substance in the claim made before the Industries Assistance Commission that the increased freight rates resulting from carriage of rock phosphate by Australian ships has raised the domestic price of superphosphate within Australia by $1.35 per tonne; if not what is the estimated increase in the Australian price of superphosphate resulting from the increased Australian participation in the shipping of rock phosphate from Christmas Island. 
Has he examined the question of reinstating the Exemption of the Christmas Island-Australian trade from the coasting provisions of the Navigation Act; if so what were the results of this examination; if not, will he examine the situation. 

 Mr Nixon: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) 1972- 73-5.15 percent 1973- 74-1 1.64 per cent 1974- 75-35.03 percent 
Based on shipments to date during the current fiscal year and expected Australian requirements for Christmas Island phosphate rock during 1976-77; the expected percentages are: 1975- 1976-64.29 percent 1976- 77-100.00 percent 
The claim that the domestic price of superphosphate has risen by $ 1.35 per tonne because of the withdrawal of the exemption of the Christmas Island trade from the Coasting Trade Provisions of the Navigation Act, was made by the Australian Woolgrowers' and Graziers' Council. The basis on which the estimate was calculated is not known. 
The British Phosphate Commissioners estimate that on programmed tonnages and fleet operations, the withdrawal of the exemption will result in the average cost of shipping all phosphate rock imports into Australia increasing by $1.73 per tonne in 1975-76 and $2.60 per tonne in 1976-77. This represents an increase of approximately $1.07 and $1.60 per tonne respectively on the cost of superphosphate. 
No. I do not think it would be practicable to reverse now the decision taken by the former Government in 1973, and exempt trade between Christmas Island and Australia from the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act. To do so would mean that the three licensed vessels which now operate in that trade and which are Australian manned could be replaced with foreign manned vessels. I have received no representations from the British Phosphate Commission to reinstate the exemption.

Gardiner, are reported as saying that on the few occasions when there are special imports, such as a load of timber from an Asian country, quarantine officers were sent from Perth.

Will he detail all action taken by his Department in relation to both the vessel and discharged cargo. 
-I address my question to the Acting Minister for Overseas Trade. Is the Minister aware of reports that the European Economic Community is likely to restrict imports of sheep meats? Would such restrictions harm Australia's important sheep meat markets, in the EEC and make competition with New Zealand more intense in other markets, especially those in the Middle East? Is this another example of the selfish protectionist attitude of the EEC towards international trade? What will the Government do to ensure continued access for sheep meats to the EEC? 
My question is addressed to the Minister for Health. I note with appreciation that the Minister in the past few months has visited the north-west of Australia to inspect quarantine enforcement in that area. Can the Minister inform the House of the deficiencies in quarantine procedures that he detected in that area and, more importantly, of the steps that have been taken to correct those deficiencies? 
-In listening to the honourable member for Melbourne  (Mr Innes)  and his flights of fancy and imagination I get the feeling that if he really believed what he said the Labor Party would be moving amendmentssubstantial amendments- to this Bill. However he indicated that the Opposition was not going to take such action. One gets the impression that the Labor Party, which has been so successful in wrecking Australia, is now also intent on wrecking Christmas Island. I have referred to the flights of fancy and imagination of the honourable member. To be a member of his Party and support the puerile demonstration which took place outside this place today one would have to have a very vivid imagination. 
This Bill seeks to ratify an agreement, already signed, between the Australian Government and the New Zealand Government. It will allow the use of the special fund set up under the existing 
Christmas Island Agreement of 1958 to meet the resettlement costs of Christmas Islanders in Australia. As was pointed out in the second reading speech by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations  (Mr Street),  a number of Christmas Islanders already have settled in Australia on a permanent and private basis. The Minister said in his second reading speech that about 450 Christmas Islanders were here. I understand that that has happened since 1973. In 1958 something like 685 Christmas Islanders have settled in Australia and, most importantly for Western Australia six hundred and forty-five had settled there. I am reminded that a substantial number settled in my electorate. Of the present population of Christmas Island, which is about 3300 people, long term Christmas Islanders who are eligible for entry to Australia number one thousand three hundred. Short term workers number about one thousand seven hundred and are mainly drawn from Singapore and Malaysia and there are about 300 other people. In effect about 1300 people are eligible in due course to resettle in Australia or some other country of their choice. It is significant that most of them are seeking to resettle in Australia. 
I can report to the House that the Christmas Islanders who have resettled in Australia to date are quite happy. The phosphate rock on Christmas Island is expected to run out in 20 years or so and resettlement is to go ahead as soon as possible. I find it rather strange that I was able to get from the Western Australian Parliamentary records and the Western Australian  Hansard  details of the projected number of people to be moved from Christmas Island to Australia over the next few years whereas this was not mentioned in the Minister's second reading speech. I want to refer to those figures which were projected yesterday in the Western Australian Parliament. They indicate that over the next 9 months some 219 people will come to Australia and in the following 3 years they will be coming here at the rate of about three hundred a year. The final group of about three hundred and eighty is expected over the following 2 years. It seems strange to me that I had to get these figures from the Western Australian Parliament and that they were not made available to the Minister's second reading speech. This seems to me to be just puerile secrecy for no reason. Either the Minister is being secretive or the Department is being secretive for no good purpose so far as I can see. There is nothing to be achieved from secrecy about small things like this. Everyone should well and truly know the program. 
Most of the Christmas Islanders have settled in Western Australia. A substantial number, three hundred or so, have settled in Katanning. A number have settled in the Pilbara area and I guess that the next area for resettlement is to be Geraldton. These people have settled very well into Katanning. They have been readily accepted in the community and have become very fine citizens. Most of them work in the Southern Meat Packers Ltd abattoir and have made a substantial contribution to its operations. They are highly regarded as efficient and dedicated workers and have enabled that abattoir to kill and prepare meat to meet the Middle East market where there are Muslim populations. 
A number of problems are associated with this scheme. Additional help over and above that which has been suggested may be required for the Christmas Islanders. I read in the Minister's second reading speech that the resettlement scheme embraces resettlement allowances, free fares and other assistance such as scholarships for further education and training. The Government will also assist these people in finding employment and housing. I would point out that housing is a particular problem in Katanning. It may well be argued that there would be housing problems following the establishment of an abattoir in a town such as Katanning and that is right. However it must also be borne in mind that when people are brought into a completely new environment there needs to be special consideration so far as housing is concerned if they are to fit adequately into a community. There have been several other minor problems but generally these people have been very well accepted. 
I have some reservation about suggesting that more Christmas Islanders come to Katanning. I think that three hundred in a population of five thousand is quite enough although they have been very well accepted. There have been no complaints and they are happy there and the people they work for are happy. However I hesitate to suggest that additional Christmas Islanders should be concentrated in a small country town such as Katanning. I think it is important that there be a proper attempt to integrate them and I doubt whether concentration in areas like that would effectively achieve that aim. 
The debate on this Christmas Island Agreement Bill permits us to raise several other long term matters to which I particularly want to refer. The phosphate on Christmas Island is expected to run out in 20 years or so but there is a substantial amount of C grade phosphate rock there which is not being used at this time. In the future it may be possible to use these deposits. Certain research work is being undertaken by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture in calcinining phosphate and using it for agricultural purposes. There has been a favourable reaction to this in Western Australia. This product may be able to be used in the future. This emphasises the need to place more stress on the development of the Duchess deposits in Queensland and other deposits very soon. Australian agriculture depends on superphosphate and there is no way that this can be avoided at this stage as far as I know. The Government should take active action to ensure that Australian phosphate deposits are used, particularly in view of the running down of the supply expected from Christmas Island. 
I have been limited in the amount of time for which I can speak but there is one other point that I want to make quickly. I hope there will be some discussions about the future of Christmas Island once it is vacated by its present inhabitants. I do not want to see Christmas Island traded to some other country. I want to see it remain part of Australia because at some time it may have strategic value for us. This is something which must be considered. I want to see the Australian flag remain on Christmas Island. I certainly-do not want to see the red flag which was flying over the demonstration outside Parliament House today flying over Christmas Island or any other Australian possession in the future. I support the Bill.

It amuses someone who genuinely represents a rural electorate to hear the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  professing to represent in this House farmers and others. I hardly think that he has advanced his claim for the position for which he is trying tomorrow unless misrepresentation is the prime criteria for that position. He spent 7 minutes attacking the Government and the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  on their performance in relation to the agricultural industries. He chose deliberately to ignore the complete lack of concern for rural matters by his Government when it was in power from 1972 to 1974. We had a Prime Minister who told dairy farmers in Victoria at a time when the dairy industry was on its knees that they had never had it so good. This Government will be discussing legislation this week which deals with the dairy industry and attempts to rectify some of its problems.  Mr Grassby  and many other Labor supporters made promises about rural banks and so on. It will be this Government which provides a rural bank which will give adequate finance and allow some of the credit deficiencies of the rural sector to be rectified. 
The marketing report of the Australian Wool Corporation was released in December 1973. It was held by the Labor Government for one year. Not one action was taken in respect of it. It is poor criticism on the pan of the honourable member for Blaxland to point out that action has not yet been taken by this Government. The Labor Government had 12 months in which to take action. No action whatsoever was taken. In relation to the Labor Government's interest in the rural sector, for 6 months it did not touch or make any decision on 6 reports of the Industries Assistance Commission on rural industries. These included reports on brucellosis, new land farmers in Western Australia, the superphosphate bounty, the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty and income averaging for primary producers. They were all significant reports which had been tabled. For 6 months there was no action by the previous Government. If that is the concern for the rural industry that the honourable member for Blaxland professes, at least I can guarantee that this Government and this Minister take a much more serious and responsible attitude towards the rural industries. 
The Bills which the House is discussing cognately aim to provide for the 5 per cent market support levy to be paid by growers for another 12 months. This scheme was introduced in September 1 974. It has been continued yearly thereafter. The market support fund provides a reserve financed by growers to meet any losses arising out of the floor price arrangements. The legislation has the full support of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and major grower organisations. In effect, it means that for the next 12 months there will be a levy on growers of 8 per cent, 5 per cent for the market support trust fund and 3 per cent for the research, promotion and administrative costs of the Australian Wool Corporation. The continuation of this tax requires consideration of several aspects. Firstly, we should consider whether a revolving fund should be established. By a revolving fund I visualise that when the total capital requirements are met- they are approaching that level at this stage- the growers who paid in the early years can be repaid from the contributions of later years. At the moment the market support trust fund is receiving some $50m a year in contributions from growers. The optimum total for any marketing scheme is estimated variously at between $250m and $350m. We are getting towards that total now. During the period that this levy has been operating growers have contributed, along with interest payments, a total of $158m. The total is rising rapidly. I think the introduction of a revolving fund would be of advantage. It would mean that as people left the industry their payments would be repaid to them. I feel that this would keep growers interested in the operations of the Corporation. 
Secondly, the growth of the market support fund places in question the number of growers who should be representatives on the Australian Wool Corporation. Currently growers constitute four out of 9 members. My view is that, as the grower contribution to the market support trust fund increases, the grower representation on the Corporation should also increase. I think there is a logical and sound argument for this action to be taken in due course. I do not necessarily support the standardised forms of the Corporation's structure which are now being proposed for the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and which have previously been accepted in relation to the Apple and Pear Corporation. Admittedly, the Wool Corporation at this stage is functioning very soundly. I think my suggestion in respect of the Australian Wool Corporation will need consideration in the near future. Wool is a reasonably homogeneous commodity. Producers are not as geographically dispersed as meat producers. I have grave suspicions about the limitation of 4 grower members on the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. I feel that this is a retrograde step. Four members can not adequately represent the wide spread interests and the geographical spread of the meat industry. 
The honourable member for Blaxland, in commenting on the legislation now before the House, referred particularly to consideration of the marketing report of the Australian Wool Corporation. The Minister in his second reading speech on the Wool Industry Amendment Bill referred to approval of decisions by the Government to authorise the Australian Wool Corporation to operate a limited scheme of direct purchase of wool from growers. The object of this approval is to demonstrate new and improved methods of handling wool which may provide economies in the handling and distribution of wool. In my opinion the limited offer to purchase scheme is not a substitute for the full consideration of the Australian Wool Corporation's marketing report which was brought down in 
December 1973. 1 point out that the Labor Party did not act on that report in any respect in the 12 months after it was brought down. Any arrows it wishes to fire at this Government should similarly be directed at its own performance. 
-That is right. I admit quite freely that the Labor Party made one substantial and worthwhile introduction. That was the introduction of the wool floor price reserve scheme. Even though it did introduce that scheme, it almost destroyed it in mid- 1974 by trying to reduce the level from 250c per kilo clean to 200c per kilo clean. If ever there were a measure or a decision designed to wreck confidence in the wool industry for producers or users, it was that projected move by the Labor Government at that stage. I give the Labor Party credit for the introduction of the scheme; but I can give it no credit for the way in which it mismanaged the scheme whilst in power. 
In contrast, this Government has made a firm decision in regard to the reserve price scheme. Not only has it indicated that the scheme will apply for one year only but there have been guarantees that the price will not be reduced in the following year. This has allowed much more stability to be given to the wool market. All sides and sectors of the wool industry now have more faith in the industry's future. In fact this Government, after devaluation, fixed the guaranteed price at 284c per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis. It also indicated that this price would not be lowered for the next season. This is a very worthwhile move and it represents to the wool growers the full application of the 17 per cent devaluation. Subsequent prices after the revaluations have not been reduced in regard to the reserve price scheme. As far as wool growers are concerned, this has been a very worthwhile and satisfactory move. 
I have already mentioned the limited offer to purchase scheme. I point out that this is purely a handling operation. In this way it cannot be a substitute for the full recommendation of the marketing report of the Australian Wool Marketing Corporation. The report goes much further. It suggests that wool should be marketed in such a way that it would be marketed as a textile fibre in effective competition in the world textile markets. This would aim at providing a better service to users. The report also envisagesthis is important- that there will be real savings in handling charges and so on. But it also envisages that the selling and distribution functions will be changed. To some extent this is not effectively tackled by the limited offer to purchase scheme. However, the growers and the Australian Wool Industry Conference, I feel, have somewhat reluctantly accepted the limited offer to purchase scheme mainly, as some say, because of the Government's unwillingness to consider fully the marketing reports. My fear is that the situation may be a repetition of the disastrous price averaging plan of some years ago but I sincerely hope that this plan is much more effective than that. 
The scale of the limited offer to purchase scheme is something that causes some concern. The size of the scheme could be much bigger. It will be limited to some 1 50 000 bales in one year. It is therefore an experiment in handling and that is all it can be considered. It cannot be considered a substitute for the marketing report which has more far-reaching implications for wool marketing and for the future of wool as a textile fibre. Whilst talking about handling and other arrangements, I should comment that despite the efforts of the Australian Wool Corporation and many other bodies, there is still a great deal to be done in this regard. I am alarmed when I see the number of grower cooperatives and so on which are instituting many far-reaching and effective reforms in regard to wool handling. I think of the operations of the Economic Wool Producers of some time ago and of the projected arrangements by Grazcos Co-op. Limited in relation to jumbo bales and many other handling innovations. In relation to wool harvesting I also think of the efforts of the Southern Districts Sheep Research Council in Western Australia which is putting up much of its own money to devise effective and improved means of wool harvesting. I think that that Council needs even more support than it is getting at this stage. It does alarm me to some extent that growers, through their co-operatives, are taking initiatives such as this and putting their own money at risk whereas a lot of money has been provided for research and promotion and so on. 
My criticism of the limited offer to purchase scheme is made fully in the realisation of the very real benefits that this Government has brought to the wool industry. I shall cite a few of those benefits. I have already mentioned a stable floor price scheme for wool. This is in direct contrast to the performance of the Labor Party in regard to the level of the reserve price scheme. Not only have we ensured stability, ensured that the scheme will be continued for one year without the price being lowered, but we have also increased the floor price according to devaluation and other means. It is a much more real and pertinent scheme at this stage. Further, as I have pointed out, the price has been raised to take full account of the revaluations. I think this Government has done a very good job in supporting fully the operations of the Australian Wool Corporation in regard to its floor price operations and the operations of the flexible reserve price scheme. 
There is one other thing to which we should refer when we are talking about wool and that is the fact that private buying is increasing largely throughout Australia. Traditionally it was restricted mainly to West Australia, but it has now spread much more widely. A significant proportion of the Australian wool clip is now being sold through this means. To some extent it may be a means by which growers are seeking to offset the cost of selling through the traditional auction system. But I think that it is cause for some worry, especially as many wool selling brokers are now involved in this private selling and buying operation. I think a number of questions have to be asked in relation to it. We should be asking just how much it does affect or undercut the auction selling scheme of wool and the option price of wool. We should also be looking at whether it has any significant effect on the reserve price operations of the Australian Wool Corporation. There have been reports of wool being sold overseas at prices much lower than the reserve price. Some of these reports may be valid. If they are valid, they give true cause for concern in regard to the undercutting of the official reserve price levels. This is a matter which, because of its growth and so on, cannot be swept under the carpet. We cannot pretend that it does not exist. It must be examined in detail and action taken on it if it is jeopardising either the auction price or the level of the reserve price. I end my contribution to this debate by endorsing the actions of the Government in introducing these Bills. I also endorse the speedy decisions that have been made by both the Minister and the Government in relation to the reserve price. I support the Bills. 

 Mr FitzPATRICK (Darling) (5.48)- I was very surprised to hear the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Bungey)  attack the honourable member for Blaxland  (Mr Keating)  on his ability in rural matters. It is a well known fact that the honourable member for Blaxland was a very successful share farmer before he entered Parliament. One of the reasons for his entering Parliament was the support he received from the several people in the rural industry. It is a wellknown fact that even though he is an expert on the minerals industry, he has also retained his interest in primary industry.  His  speeches are very much sought after. 
I can remember when I first came into this Parliament in 1969. 1 had been approached by wool growers in my electorate asking me when the Labor Party was going to introduce a marketing system that would be worth while and beneficial to the wool growers or to primary industry. As a member with an electorate that depends to a large degree for its economic health on the wool industry, it is some satisfaction to know that this Government is bringing in machinery amendments to support the worthwhile legislation introduced by a Labor Government in September 1974. I am reminded by wool growers that such a scheme was sought by these people from the Liberal-Country Party governments for many years- in fact from 1949 to 1972, that long period when those Parties were in government. But unfortunately no such scheme was forthcoming. All the Liberal-Country Party governments could do in those early years was to produce a scheme called the emergency assistance for wool growers scheme. Everyone knows what a disaster that was. So I believe it was of some satisfaction to the wool growers when the Labor Government introduced a scheme that was to give them 250 cents for every kilo of 2 1 micron wool. 
If one has to criticise this Bill today- although the honourable member for Blaxland speaking for this side of the House said we would not delay the legislation and I know the Minister wants to speak to it- he would have to be critical of the fact that the rate is to be at only the same level as it was last year. We all know that the inflationary effect since Labor first introduced this support program has meant that wool growers must be suffering a great deal because of the delay in the increase in the support level of the price of wool. I should like to conclude on those remarks because there are a lot of other problems in my electorate and it would take me a good deal longer than the time allotted to me to explain them all to the House.

I support this Bill, which amends the Wool Industry Act in two major ways. The first change gives the Australian Wool Corporation additional powers in relation to setting conditions for the carriage and handling of wool for export by sea. The powers are designed to improve the Corporation's negotiating ability on freight rates and to enable economies to be made in the movement of Australian wool exports. I believe it is necessary that the matter of freight rates and the effect of freight costs on Australian exports be examined. This Bill provides for the incorporation into the Wool Industry Act of exactly the same principles and arrangements for freight rate negotiations as were included in section 14 of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Act, which was recently passed by this House. These amendments are designed to ensure that marine freight rates and services for all commodities are determined to the advantage of the wool industry. Of course, the Australian Wool Corporation, and the Wool Board before it, has taken a very keen interest in many aspects of freight negotiations. It has also encouraged innovation in the handling and freighting of wool, areas which are both very important. In retrospect, it is very likely that the introduction of containerisation for wool may not have provided the benefit to the industry which was forecast at the time it was introduced. It is very clear, as I said earlier, that a consideration of all aspects of freight rates is vital. I welcome the amendments contained in this Bill, as I welcomed the moves made by the Government when it formed the Meat and Livestock Corporation. 
The second part of the Bill concerns the future financing by the Government of wool promotion and research. Up until the last financial year an amount for a 3-year period was included in the Wool Industry Act to cover the Government's contribution to research and promotion. That arrangement has expired and this new arrangement follows on the investigation by the Industries Assistance Commission of research and promotion in the wool industry. In effect, what will now happen is that triennial funding will be discontinued and annual appropriations will be made from Consolidated Revenue for the Government's contribution to research and promotion. Some concern might be expressed about the discontinuation of triennial funding, but in his second reading speech the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  indicated that there would be forward planning in respect of research and promotion expenditures, instead of a decision being made each year relating solely to that year. In his speech the Minister said: 
Future government financing of wool promotion will be reviewed annually. The review will decide on the level of support for the following financial year and, to assist in the forward planning of promotional programs, will provide an indicative level of support for the following two years. 
I think that overcomes any criticism which might be made about the abolition of the triennial funding arrangement. Indications will be given of allocations for both research and promotion in future years. At the moment the wool industry is doing a lot to help itself. The 8 per cent levy currently being paid by the wool growers is a very substantial burden on them. Admittedly, the Government has supported the wool industry by giving an assurance of a reserve price of 280c per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis, and that was a welcome decision. It followed some of the decisions, both favourable and unfavourable, made by the Labor Government in respect of the reserve price for the Australian wool clip. But there is still a huge burden on the wool industry in the requirement that it pay 8 per cent of its gross proceeds by way of levy. Of course, 5 per cent of the levy is for market support activities and the remainder is for research and promotion activities and the operating expenses of the Australian Wool Corporation. The 8 per cent wool tax is expected to raise some $95m this year, and that $95m will be taken from the pockets of the wool growers in a period of rapidly rising costs. 
An analysis of that $95 m shows that it is expected that some $59.5m will go into the market support fund and $32. lm will be used for research and promotion. Additionally, in the Budget the Government allocated $3 1.4m for research and promotion, of which $ 19.9m is earmarked for promotion and $1 1.5m for research. The research money is distributed in various ways. Some of it represents a direct allocation to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial 
Research Organisation, following a recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission. Of the $ 1 1.5m which will be allocated from Consolidated Revenue for research, it is expected that $6.9m will go to the Wool Research Trust Fund for allocation in the same way as such amounts are currently allocated. An amount of $4.4m is included in the allocation for CSIRO, as well as about $200,000 for the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. In effect, the total promotion and research budget this year, including the amount allocated to the CSIRO, is something like $66. 6m, which is indeed a significant figure. As far as the Government's contribution is concerned, in his second reading speech the Minister said: . . . the Budget provides $3 1.4m as the Government's contribution for the current fiscal year for wool research and promotion. This is an increase-of some $ 10m over 1976-77. 
The honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  criticised the Government in some measure when he said that the Budget allocation represented a credit for the Government in relation to the wool industry, and that is so. Even though the Government will spend a considerable amount of money on the wool industry, a sum of $ 100m is still outstanding on loans made previously to the Australian Wool Corporation for stockholding activities and so on and that has to be repaid. At the beginning of last year it was expected that some $240m would be repaid to the Federal Government, but only $145m was repaid, and it is expected that the additional $100m will be repaid this year. That does not represent taxation of $70m on wool growers. It is a return by the Australian Wool Corporation of money loaned to it by the Government. I do not think that it in any way gives an indication of the future financing of any stockpiling by the Corporation. The Corporation's stockpiles have always been financed by grower contributions, by loans from the private banking sector, and by government assistance by way of loans. I anticipate that if the need does arise in this financial year, and let us hope that it does not, similar sources of financing will be available. The wool industry has been quite adamant in its expressions over a long period of time that it is determined to finance its own market and stockholding operations if at all possible. To a large extent, I reject the criticism made by the honourable member for Corio. 
The reports of the Industries Assistance Commission in respect of research set out a number of recommendations on the wool research program. They recommend that approximately 60 per cent of the wool research currently undertaken by 
CSIRO and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and financed by the Wool Research Trust Fund should be funded by the Government through direct appropriations. That is exactly what this Bill is attempting to do. The reports further recommend that the Commonwealth Government provide a grant on a dollar for dollar basis to match expenditure on research from growers' levies and interest. Again, the Government has virtually accepted that recommendation in its Budget proposals for this year. It was further recommended that changes be made in the administration of the wool research funds and the method by which recommendations are made. I do not think that this recommendation has been adopted at this stage. However, the two basic recommendations  of the Industries  Assistance Commission in relation to wool research funds have been adopted in the Bill before us. 
The Minister for Primary Industry clearly indicated in his second reading speech that the arrangements still permit the Australian Wool Corporation to negotiate with the Australian Wool Industry Conference and the International Wool Secretariat on areas of importance and areas of preference for wool research although, as indicated previously, some of the money will be paid directly to the CSIRO for basic and continuing wool research. We all realise that the International Wool Secretariat research, linked with its promotion to help manufacturers, has played an important part in maintaining wool's share of the total textile market. I noted in the Industries Assistance Commission report the comment of the Corporation when reporting on the level of available funds for wool research. The Corporation commented, as reported on page 54 of the IAC report: 
It is the opinion of the Corporation that the existing level of available resources for, and expenditure on, wool research is adequate to meet present needs. 
The additional report of the Industries Assistance Commission entitled 'Financing Promotion of Rural Products' clearly shows the importance of promotion to the future of wool and the very great efforts that have been made over a number of years by the International Wool Secretariat to encourage and maintain wool usage throughout the world. In looking at the level of expenditure on promotion, especially by the International Wool Secretariat, that report at page 59 stated: 
Nevertheless, the Commission would judge, on the basis  of the  evidence submitted by the IWS and on its own analysis, that it seems probable that the optimal level of wool promotion is greater than the current level of expenditure and that it probably would be as large as or larger than the IWS budget of 1973-74, expressed in terms of real purchasing power. 
There is of course a limit to what either the Government or growers can contribute to wool research and promotion and I think that a fairly reasonable balance has been achieved by the additional Government contribution this year. Looking at the history of the financing of wool research and promotion, I note that in the financial years 1970-71 to 1972-73 an average of $2 7m was allocated by the Government for research and promotion. However, the amount allocated during the period the Labor Government was in office fell fairly significantly and in 1973-74 the amount allocated for research and promotion was only $22m. The same amount was provided in 1974-75, while in 1975-76 it fell to $20m with a change in the method of allocation and division of the money. Under the 1975 proposals introduced by the previous Government three-quarters of the research program and one-quarter of promotion costs were to be funded by the Government. That decision has now been reversed and the present Government is getting back to the dollar for dollar basis of financing in both areas. This is vital. 
Although the level of financing of research and promotion is useful and although much effort has been spent on both research and promotion, we would be very foolish to think that additional Government money at this stage is sufficient. A number of other problems in the wool industry are crying out for solution. I refer in particular to the recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation on marketing which was made a number of years ago. These recommendations were forgotten by the previous Government and unfortunately I feel they are being forgotten by this Government. There is so much worth in those recommendations which can adequately change the shape and future of the wool industry that they bear careful consideration and, in my opinion, should be implemented. To a large extent we are hiding our heads in the sand if we take it for granted that improving the research and promotion vote alone is going to help the industry when we are not able to market wool as a commodity in a competitive textile world. Frankly, the wool industry cannot afford the luxury of continuing with the antiquated marketing system it has at this stage. It is significant that the whole wool industry accepts that change is necessary in the marketing of the Australian wool clip and agreement in the wool industry is something which is unique. 
I know that the Government would like to claim that the limited offer to purchase scheme which it has approved for introduction this year is a significant improvement but, looking at it honestly, it is on a very small scale. It is attempting to test areas of wool marketing and wool handling which really are well outside the marketing recommendations of the Australian Wool Corporation. This is a petty manoeuvre to try to avoid introducing the recommendations. I support the Bill. 
Debate interrupted.

-As a member of the Public Works Committee it pleases me to see that the Government has accepted the recommendations which the Committee included in its report. Firstly, I shall refer to the points raised by the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman).  The Committee was very concerned with these two aspects, that is, the question of security within the installation itself and the transportation of animals from the airport or sea port to the quarantine station. In the transcript of evidence which has not yet been published it will be seen that these questions were examined at some length. The Committee was satisfied with the projected plans and arrangements. The Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay)  referred to a number of reservations which the Committee had in relation to the construction of this quarantine station. I am pleased that the Government will pay attention to the recommendations we made m relation to the grooms' accommodation, the siting of the manure pit and incinerator and the road layout in the area. 
Interesting evidence was given to the Committee on quarantine facilities for bees. The evidence given by the Commercial Apiarists Association of New South Wales and the Federal Council of the Australian Apiarists Association should be examined carefully by quarantine officers in the Department of Health. It is quite clear that there is a need for quarantine facilities in this area. This station will have a significant effect in safeguarding Australia against rabies outbreaks. At the moment there are only 12 kennels in the whole of Australia which are rabies secure for the importation of dogs. The new installation at Wallgrove will allow this number to be increased to 609, 597 being provided in the new installation. I am also pleased that the Minister has accepted the recommendations of the Committee to examine charges to see whether capital costs can be incorporated. It seemed to the Committee that there should be some charge in this respect. I refer to the capacity of facilities for importing horses into Australia which will now be provided at Wallgrove. The Committee was not aware that additional funds for those facilities would be provided in the most recent Budget. Wallgrove will provide 90 horse stalls. At the moment there are only 10 stalls with temporary facilities for perhaps an additional 20 stalls at Wallgrove. 
The Committee was not aware of it at the time, but in the Budget provision is made for an additional 32 horse stalls at Spotswood during this financial year, which will lift the capacity of Spotswood to about 40. Provision is also made for an additional 36 horse stalls at Torrens Island in South Australia, which will lift the capacity in that area to 41. In effect, after the completion of Wallgrove, Spotswood and Torrens the total number of facilities available for horses will be 171. When one compares this with the current capacity of 31, one sees that it is a very large increase indeed. If the Committee had been aware of these definite additional arrangements for this financial year it may have had a different outlook on the provision of horse facilities at Wallgrove. 
The Committee was very doubtfulunofficially doubtful, because it made no official recommendation on it- as to whether horse facilities should be decentralised. It was felt that people importing horses could well afford to pay any additional price made necessary by the centralisation of horse quarantine facilities. I think that the Committee would accept the need for dog and cat facilities to be segregated but felt that, with the greater range of aircraft and the greater size of aircraft shipping horses, there would be some way in which centralisation could be established. I think this report also indicates that a number of other reports of the Public Works Committee in this area have not been acted on. Let me refer to several of them. Firstly, the animal health laboratory at Geelong was the subject of a report by the Public Works Committee. In its sixth report for 1974 dated 17 October 1974 it recommended the building of an animal health laboratory at Geelong. At that stage the recommendation was accepted, and it is one of the few recommendations of the Public Works Committee in which the Committee stressed that it was a matter of urgency that the work proceed. 
I point out that only about $91,000 has been spent on preliminary site work for that project and also a further $18 1,000-odd on site work construction. So with a total estimated capital cost of $67m in 1974 this significant and vital program has still to be proceeded with. Let me also refer to the delays in the high security offshore quarantine station project which was also examined by the Public Works Committee. In its fifth report for 1973 dated 13 September 1973 it recommended that an offshore high security quarantine station be established on West Island in the Cocos group. At that stage the estimated capital cost of the project seemed to be $2. lm. It is gratifying to the Committee and to all people interested in quarantine work to note that the sum of $6.9m has been provided in the Budget for work in this area. As a member of the Public Works Committee I am pleased that the Minister and the Government have accepted the recommendations of the Committee. 

 Mr McLEAY (Boothby-Minister for Construction)in reply- Very briefly I would like to thank the honourable members who have taken part in this debate- the honourable member for Prospect  (Dr Klugman)  and the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Bungey).  The comments of the honourable member for Prospect will certainly be taken on board by the Government and I will raise them with the officers of my 
Department although, as the honourable member for Canning said, this matter has been fairly heavily canvassed during the sittings. I want to respond briefly to what the honourable member for Canning said about the animal health laboratory at Geelong. I must say that the design team on that project is still intact and still working. I have forgotten how much has been spent on the actual design work but it is certainly in excess of $ 1 m. I share with him the hope that it will not be too long before we will be able to proceed and put that facility to work.

-Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed a view on the safe disposal of nuclear waste? 
-Let me wipe the tears from my eyes after listening to the honourable member for Newcastle  (Mr Charles Jones)  present the pitiful scene in his electorate. 
-Thank you. The honourable member for Newcastle blamed the Federal Government for the failure of the Newcastle State dockyard. I think he has a very short memory indeed. He should lay the blame much more directly on the New South Wales State Government. 
-The Premier was the one. The Federal Government made genuine offers to enable the dockyard to continue. It would have provided generous subsidies if it had got the very rninimum of guarantees from the unions that there would be no industrial strife. That was negotiated through the Premier of New South Wales. There was no result. The workers in the dockyard were not prepared to give the very rninimum of guarantees that were required. I ask the honourable member why the State Government has not placed with that dockyard an order for a floating dock if it is so keen on preserving the dockyard in that way. He has taken a very convenient view indeed. It is easy for him to lay the blame on the Federal coalition Government. He refuses to look realistically at the matter and to lay the blame where it directly should be laid, and that is with the New South Wales Labor Government. 
I refer to his comment on the indexation of family allowances. He has a very convenient and short memory because in this case he forgets the very large increases that this Government made some time ago. It changed the whole family allowance structure. This has had more than a compensatory effect for the matters which he raised. This was a complete revolution in the family allowance system. It was an avenue which his Government, from 1972 to 1974, shirked, but it was a step which this Government took at a time of severe budgetary restrictions. So I think the Government deserves congratulations rather than condemnation by the honourable member for Newcastle. 
I noted the way in which he quoted his unemployment figures. He was very careful to give figures representing only the period from 1975 to 1977. He failed completely and utterly to indicate the increases in figures for unemployment and a few other factors from 1972 onwards. If he had taken a more representative sample he would have seen that the most rapid increase in unemployment in both his electorate and throughout Australia took place in the period from 1972 to 1975 and not during the selective period from 1975 to 1977 for which he quoted figures. No honourable member can fail to admit that there was an increase in the figures between 1975 and 1977, but that increase in percentage terms was minute compared with the vast increases between 1972 and 1975. 
Another factor of which he failed to take account was that during the period from 1975 to 1977 this Government was attempting to reverse the trends which had been set in play during the 1972 to 1975 period of the Labor Government. Economic trends, employment trends and the like are very difficult to change. At no stage did this Government indicate that there would be an automatic improvement or changes overnight. This Government has always stressed, during the 1975 election and at other times, that it will be a long and arduous job getting things back onto the right footing. But there are indications now that things are improving. 
-Of course they are. Does the honourable member not read the inflation figures and so on? There have been much more significant falls in the inflation rate recently than ever occurred during the period of his Government. 
The lowest - 
-There is now a lower rate of inflation than has obtained for quite some dme. 
I think every honourable member will admit quite freely- even the honourable member for Newcastle if he were to be honest for a moment- that there was a need in December 1975, when this Government came to power, to take severe corrective actions in relation to the economy. We were heading for record deficit figures. I think it is to the credit of this Government that it was able to reduce the deficit last year to about $2,740m, and this year it is projected that the deficit will be further reduced to $2,2 17m. 
-But the honourable member's Government had record deficits and record unemployment. From 1972 to 1975 that Government increased unemployment at a record rate, which no other government has been able to emulate at any stage, nor would it hope to. 
When the honourable member's Government started in 1972 and ended in 1975, how many more people were unemployed? There were 300,000 more. 
-Thank you,  Mr Deputy Speaker.  I hope you will protect me from the carnivorous interferences from the source to which I am retorting. 
-Before I was rudely interrupted by the honourable member for Newcastle I pointed out that this year the Government was reducing the overall deficit by some $500m to a figure of $2,2 17m. The domestic deficit will fall from $ 1,997m to $ 1,347m. It is worth bearing in mind that these reductions in the deficits are being made in the context of indexation of taxation and social security payments and the like. The indexation of taxation represents a considerable forfeiture of revenue and the indexation of social security payments represents a considerable fixed increase in payments. 
There has been a severe restriction and scrutiny of government expenditure. Despite these cuts in revenue, the funding of health, education, transport, defence and welfare has been maintained at very adequate levels. I point out also that the amounts made available this year to the States under the new tax sharing arrangements will increase by $627m, which I think is a substantial amount. The general healthiness of the States is reflected in the way in which a number of States have surpluses in their accounts this year. 
There has been an increase of 18.1 per cent to $ 1 63m in untied grants to local government. This is a significant increase over the $70m made available for this purpose by the Labor Government. Local governments will receive increased amounts for  Tocal  rural roads and urban roads. There will be an increase of some 18 per cent in the funds made available from that source for rural local roads in Western Australia, which will take the total Commonwealth allocation for these sorts of roads to some $ 1 4.4m. 
I shall refer in particular to the rural sector. On Tuesday last week we witnessed an attack on this Government for its rural policies. The Opposition claimed that farm operating costs had increased more rapidly under this Government than under the previous Government. I think this claim was well and truly sealed, cemented away and buried during the debate last week. I doubt very much whether this Labor Opposition could honestly claim to have had a genuine interest in the rural industries at any stage. In fact, the Opposition's period in government from 1972 to 1975 illustrated quite clearly that it had no sympathy for the rural industries. Many of its most severe measures were directed against the rural sector- not only against rural industries, but also against the people who live in country areas. Therefore, any claims by the Opposition that it represents or takes a genuine interest in the rural sector have no credibility whatsoever. We only have to look at its performance during the period 1972 to 1975 to appreciate its attitude towards the rural industries and the people who live in country areas. 
Let me refer to some of the actions which this Government has taken in relation to the rural sector. Firstly, let me contrast what this Government has done in the area of communications against what the Labor Government did. The Labor Government imposed severe charges for the installation of country telephones. It imposed escalated and unprecedented increases in postal and telephone rates. 
-We have not increased the postal rates set by the Labor Government; they are still pegged at 18c a letter, the rate imposed by the Labor Government when it increased the charge from about 7c during its two years of government. 
-We have held those rates, which is more than the Labor Government could ever claim to have done. We have kept the postal rate at 18c a letter and the telephone charges at the previously determined level. In addition, we have given some concessions in telephone charges, particularly to people in country areas. We have increased the distance applicable to non-chargeable capital expenditure for the installation of telephones from 8 kilometres to 12 kilometres. In addition, we have retained at $ 160 per half kilometre the installation charges for distances beyond the 12 kilometre limit. 
-We have increased the distance; therefore, we have reduced the capital cost to the person installing a telephone. We have effectively reduced the severe charges imposed by the previous Labor Government. Only today the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson)  indicated that an announcement will be made concerning television services in country areas. This will be very welcome indeed. There are many areas in my electorate and in many other electorates in which television reception is quite inferior. This was an area in which the Labor Party when in government took absolutely no interest whatsoever. As the Minister indicated today, it is an area in which this Government is taking a very genuine interest. It will do those things which the Labor Government either refused to do or did not want to do. 
-How did that help country people? 
-How did that help country people? They did not have to pay the fee because they do not receive a television service. If they do not receive a television service and they do not have a television licence, what benefit is it to them to have the licence fee abolished? That would be the myopic type of thinking I would expect from such an honourable member who represents such an electorate as Newcastle. It represents very clearly indeed the type of thinking that was indulged in during the term of office of the Labor Government. 
Yes, but what benefit is that to someone who does not pay the licence fee in the first place and does not receive a television service. 
-A television licence? 
When you do not receive a television service? 
-The area in which the honourable member lives probably would, because this affects only people in the country areas. We know how unsympathetic the Labor Party is to people in country areas. Anyway, thank you very much,  Mr Deputy Speaker,  for allowing the honourable member for Newcastle to- 
-I turn now to a subject in relation to which the honourable member for Newcastle will be able to give me some further help, I am sure. I refer to this Government's policy in relation to the wool subsidy or the wool reserve floor price. It has been increased by this Government in accordance with the revaluation that has taken place in the Australian dollar. It now stands at 284c per kilo clean, which represents a 17 per cent increase over and above the 250c per kilo clean which applied previously. I contrast that with the effort of the Cabinet of which the honourable member for Newcastle was a member and which was determined to decrease the reserve floor price from 250c per kilo clean for 22 micron wool to 200c per kilo. No other action which could have been contemplated or promoted could have had a more disastrous effect on the wool industry at that time. 
The Labor Government threatened and talked about reducing it and so on. 
-Sir, can I let the Labor Party members decide whether or not they reduced it? 
Yes,  Mr Deputy Speaker.  I point out that the actions of this Government, which takes a genuine interest in those who live, work and have industries in rural areas, contrast with those of the previous government. I point out that the rural adjustment scheme has been continued. The amounts made available for farm development funds and term loan funds have been increased by some $ 1 5 9m. I can point to the introduction of the Meat and Livestock Corporation. I can also point to the removal of the meat export inspection charge made on export meat which was imposed by the Labor Government. The removal of that Labor impost represents an additional return to growers of some $25m. 
Let me refer to other changes that have been made to Labor policy. We have seen an increase in the carcass classification system. We have seen an acceleration in the programs for the elimination of diseases such as brucellosis and tuberculosis. Some $15. lm has been made available for that purpose. An amount of $4.5m has been made available to compensate for reactor cattle being slaughtered. I can point to another very meaningful and valuable change that this Government has made, and that is- the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty which will cost the Government some $40m. Also, the continuation of the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty will cost another $12m. I contrast that action with the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr E. G. Whitlam)  when he was in Queensland recently. He said that the nitrogenous fertiliser bounty had been abolished. Obviously at that stage he had delusions of grandeur that he was still Prime Minister, and that obviously was the next attack he contemplated making on primary industry. I can point to the taxation changes and the beneficial effects that the price averaging system has had on rural industries. 
The two areas in which we cannot deny that action is still required are concerned with the establishment of the Rural Bank and with the beef industry. We have had indications that the Rural Bank will be established and announcements will be made in the near future in that regard. That is a very important matter indeed. It is one area in which the Government has made a promise which it has yet to honour. The indications are that that promise will be honoured in the very near future. 
We honour our promises. There are problems in the beef industry, and that is an area which the Government is making very clear indications that it is studying. Decisions will be announced in the near future which will help the beef industry. 
In the few minutes remaining to me I want to refer to one pleasing aspect of the Budget, and that is the provision of additional finance for the Department of Health civil works program to allow meaningful improvements, particularly in the area of quarantine. As far as Western Australia is concerned, money is being made available for the completion of incinerators at Port Hedland and at the Perth airport. Both of those projects are very vital factors m the preservation and protection of Australian primary industry from imported diseases. I also point to the fact that the construction of an animal quarantine station will commence at Wallgrove at a cost of $4.6m. That will provide a very valuable adjunct to our other facilities and allow the importation of additional horses, cats and dogs into Australia. I point out also that a further 32 horse stalls will be constructed at the Spotswood animal quarantine station in Victoria and that a further 36 horse stalls will be constructed at the animal quarantine station at Torrens Island in South Australia. Additionally cattle quarantine facilities will be constructed at Torrens Island, which will allow the importation of selected cattle from certain areas into Australia- an importation which at this stage is banned in every way. 
I point out also that some $6.9m is made available for the commencement of the construction of the quarantine station at Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I think that will be a very vital adjunct to our present facilities. It is a project which was shirked by the previous Government. We are now seeing a real and genuine interest in improving the quarantine faculties in Australia. 
-Half a million what? 
-No, of course not. As I was saying, it was the recommendation of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works to build this $6.9m facility on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It recommended this and a number of other projects prior to the term of office of the Labor Government but the construction of this facility is something which the Labor Government shirked. It is not shirked by this Government.

asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 16 August 1977: 
1 ) What statutory or regulatory requirements of the Public Service Act or any other Act support his statement in a telegram of 21 July 1977 addressed to me that the coincidence of the charges laid against  Mr Toomer  under the Public Service Act and his suspension from duty from 14 July 1977 with the actual hearings of the Inquiry into  Mr Toomer's  grievances established by the Public Service Board 'is not the Department's doing'. 
What legal processes determined the timing of the charges, to coincide with the hearings of the Inquiry. 
Is he satisfied that the timing of the charges was not designed to jeopardise the Inquiry and/or to prejudice  Mr Toomer  before the members of the Inquiry; if so, on what evidence and advice has he reached this view. 

 Mr Hunt The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 
1) and (2) In my telegram of 2 1 July 1977 to the honourable member I explained, inter alia, that the instructions which  Mr Toomer  is considered to have disobeyed were issued to him during December 1976, some six months before the Inquiry was announced on 1 June 1977. My Department has no record of  Mr Toomer  having disobeyed these instructions between December 1976 and June 1977. The actions by  Mr Toomer  that gave rise to the charges occurred on 9 June 1977, after the announcement of. the Inquiry. The timing of the charges has therefore been determined on the one hand by when  Mr Toomer  made the statements and on the other hand by the legal processes concerned in laying the charges. 
I also stated in my telegram that the coincidence of the laying of charges was not the Department's doing. Rather, from what has been outlined above the laying of charges was caused by Mr Toomer's actions at that time. (3)Yes.See(l)and(2).

Which libraries are open to the public, and what is the extent of public usage? 
I, too, want to speak very briefly on the report. I have taken a keen interest in the Toomer case. I speak as the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  spoke, in that I am not fully aware of the contents of, or the recommendations in, the report. It is very clear that lessons can be learned from this case in a number of areas. Firstly, the honourable member for Corio referred to deficiencies in quarantine. I am sure that the airing of this case to a large degree has allowed a number of those deficiencies in quarantine to be plugged or at least reviewed. I note that the Government, through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has made a review of the whole administrative arrangements of the quarantine service. I think that this is a very good start. 
I ask the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters  (Mr Street)  to follow the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration that its case study of the Toomer case be published. I note that the Minister has tabled the report of the inquiry by Temme and Perriman, but in no way has any effort been made to summarise the very substantial case study- it occupies more than 100 pages- which was made by  Mr Munro  who was a member of that Royal Commission. I ask the Government to look at the possibility of following that recommendation. I think this whole case has indicated a degree of secrecy which is quite undesirable. I think frankness breeds confidence. One cannot have confidence in a quarantine service or a department of health which is very keen on hiding things. This whole case has been very secretive. It is essential that we have confidence in the quarantine service. That is the only way in which we will get full support from the public to ensure that there is proper quarantine enforcement. 
I am worried also about several aspects of the current inquiry by  Mr Temme  and  Mr Perriman.  One of them has been referred to as the  Vishna Kalyan  episode. The episode has not been explained by the Department. The honourable member for Corio and I have questions on notice on this matter directed to the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt).  I think it is desirable that they be answered. I note that a reply was received to question No. 1461 which deals with this matter. The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Public Service Matters stated: 
I am satisfied that the conduct of Messrs Perriman and Temme while visiting the MV  Vishna Kalyan  was quite  proper, and has not in any way compromised the independence of the inquiry. 
Without receiving a full report and answers from the Minister for Health, I have not quite the confidence that the Minister displayed in answering that question. I welcome the fact that a further report will be made to the Parliament on what has happened in this case. It is very clear that there has been a number of areas of administrative immorality. I hope that if these areas have been revealed in the report methods will be adopted to change the Public Service Act and Regulations to ensure that similar administrative immorality and personal vendettas cannot be exercised through the Public Service Act or under the guise of the Public Service Act. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

What was the cost in 1976-77 of (i) salaries and (ii) other charges in the provision of tea services in his Department. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, I present the Forty-first General Report of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
-by leave-In tabling this report I take the opportunity on behalf of the Public Works Committee to pay tribute to its former  Chairman,  the  Hon.  C. R. Kelly, for his dedication and untiring efforts during his long service to that Committee. He had a real understanding of the workings and the value of the Committee's bipartisan role, representing as it does all political parties from both Houses of Parliament. 
Appendix A to the Report details the reports presented by the Committee during 1977. The proposals were most thoroughly examined by the Committee not only to assess the overall public value of the proposed works but also to satisfy itself as to the need for the projects. This is the only Committee that inquires in depth into government expenditure before the expenditure actually is incurred. Despite the best intentions by departments in detailed investigations to foresee and to overcome possible criticisms of proposed works, the Committee has been able to detect weaknesses and on occasions designs have been modified. In the case of the Katherine South Primary School the scope of the proposal was reduced, resulting in a saving of some $78,000. In the case of the Wallgrove Animal Quarantine Station, at the suggestion of the Committee the grooms' accommodation was redesigned, saving some $22,000. Other savings that have not yet been costed fully are likely from the Committee's inquiries into the Antarctic Division's headquarters and the Royal Australian Air Force bases at Point Cook and Edinburgh. In summary, the Public Works Committee continues to function effectively as the watchdog of the Parliament over public works expenditure.

What sum was paid by his Department, or by Departments formerly encompassing the functions now performed by his Department, to each airline for air travel within Australia during 1976-77. 
-As a member of the Public Works Committee I wish to endorse the motion that has been moved by the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay).  The Committee examined the proposed works very thoroughly indeed and felt that the proposed works were fully justified in every respect. In fact, in view of the growth in air traffic through the Adelaide airport and the projected growth in future years it is evident that to maintain adequate safety standards the construction of the buildings which are a part of this proposed work is essential. I am not saying in any way that there is a danger at this stage as far as safety aspects are concerned, but there certainly would be some prospect of danger if the volume of traffic through the airport continues at the rate at which it is growing and the rate at which it is projected. 
The proposed work provides for the construction of a new air traffic control tower and also an operations building to incorporate the flight service centre, area approach controls and control equipment. The proposal also allows for the installation of more up to date and modern air traffic conrol equipment. It was clear to the Committee that the facilities at the Adelaide airport in no way match the operations facilities at the Melbourne Airport which the Committee also inspected. 
May I say that the Committee received full reports from the unions whose members will be working in the proposed new facilities and they also very strongly supported the proposed work. There is one further point I should like to make and that is the fact that in no way does this proposal prejudge the expansion of the Adelaide airport. This was a matter of major concern to a number of citizens who appeared before the Committee. It was pointed out that these facilities are necessary at this stage even to handle the present volume of air traffic and particularly in view of the future air traffic build up at the airport. There is an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government which has set up a joint government advisory committee with the function of reporting and recommending on the future development of airports for the Adelaide region. It was quite clear to the Public Works Committee that irrespective of the way in which the joint advisory committee reported there would still be a need for the airport at Adelaide in its current location at least to the year 2005. The Committee bore this fact in mind to a great degree when it made its recommendations in this respect. Paragraph 62 of the report states: 
Even if it is decided to establish a new airport, the new area approach control centre and the flight service centre to be accommodated in the proposed operations building could continue to operate from their planned locations until their economic life is reached. 
Paragraph 63 states: 
The new control tower would also reach its economic life if Adelaide airport is retained in its present or in a reduced form. If, however, the present airport is abandoned, any remaining economic life of the control tower would represent only a very small proportion of the total investment at Adelaide airport which would need to be written ofl" in the event of such a decision. 
Despite the fact that the costs, or a proportion of the costs, of these facilities will be recovered through a cost recovery program it was very clear that both the Department of Construction and the Department of Transport had a very keen anxiety to keep costs to an absolute minimum. I commend the departments for that attitude. I support the motion.

-I support the motion moved by the Minister for Construction  (Mr McLeay).  As mentioned by the Minister, the Public Works Committee did explore and examine in detail the proposal for the building of the Ultrasonics Institute and the National Acoustics Laboratory at Chatswood. Before recommending the construction of the laboratory and the institute on the site proposed, the Committee carefully considered local objections to the proposal. These objections can be broadly stated as: Firstly, that the proposal was inappropriate for a zoned residential area; secondly, that it would alienate an area of open space- some 3.44 hectares- from community use; and, thirdly, that there would be adverse effects on surrounding residents from increased traffic movements and building activity. In addition, the proposed access was regarded as unsuitable and the parking space provided was seen as being deficient. 
In relation to zoning, the Committee is satisfied that the Government has the authority to use the proposed site, which is zoned 'Special Uses: Defence' for other than defence purposes. The Committee has recommended that the Department of Health and the Department of Administrative Services negotiate with the Willoughby Municipal Council and local residents on the question of continued public access to the site and surrounding bushland. It is pleasing to note that the Minister has indicated that the Government has accepted this recommendation of the Committee. I think it is also important to recognise in this respect that existing flora will be retained where possible and the existing watercourse, ponds and waterfalls will be cleared and preserved as features of the site. 
With regard to vehicle access from Greville Street, the Committee was satisfied that the Greville Street access was the only practical solution. This was supported, in particular, by a study by Professor W. R. Blunden, Professor of Traffic Engineering at the University of New South Wales, who advised that there would be no long term significant effects as far as traffic to the site was concerned. The Committee was well aware, however, that there would be dislocation to local residents during the construction period, particularly in relation to blasting and excavation on the site and the use by heavy vehicles of narrow residential streets, to cart away spoil and to bring in concrete and other building materials. It is also pleasing in this respect to note that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Committee that these disabilities to local residents should be minimised as far as practicable. 
I should also mention that the environmental clearance for the proposal was given by the then Acting Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development in June 1 976. This has been followed up and that environmental clearance has been re-endorsed by the Department at this stage. I have pleasure in supporting the motion moved by the Minister for Construction.

1 ) How many officers and employees of his Department have their home telephone rentals or charges fully or partially paid by the Department. 
What was the cost to the Department of this expenditure in 1976-77. 
-Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to the decision of the Victorian Supreme Court in the case of Nilsen Developments v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, concerning the tax deductibility of recreation and long service leave payments? Does that decision have implications for this year's revenue collections? If so, what is the Government's attitude to it? Will any action proposed by the Government involve retrospective legislation? 
-Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to reports that the Government's Budget deficit for the first quarter of this financial year is higher than for the corresponding period of last year? I therefore ask the Treasurer whether the latest figures indicate any significant departure from the estimated deficit given in his recent Budget Speech. 
I choose to disagree with the honourable member for Fremantle  (Mr Dawkins)  in saying that this Bill is a minor one. It may be a relatively small Bill in that it proposes few changes to the Quarantine Act, but I feel it is a very important Bill so far as the future of Australian agricultural industries is concerned and the protection of Australia from diseases and pests. The Bill sets out to increase the penalties provided under the Quarantine Act. The penalties at the moment are ludicrously low. They have not been changed for quite some time. They are substantially increased by this legislation. For plants and animals being illegally imported into Australia, the penalty will rise from something like $500 or six months gaol to $5,000 or two years imprisonment. I think it is very important so far as the administration of quarantine is concerned that it is ably backed up by penalties which are sufficient and justify the importance which the Government places on quarantine. I do not have to canvass very deeply the need for effective quarantine within Australia because is it very obvious indeed. 
One estimate is that if foot and mouth disease breaks out in Australia it could cost the Australian agricultural industry in the order of $600m. It is a frightening prospect if any of these diseases such as foot and mouth, rabies, rinderpest or bluetongue do get into Australia. Not only would it be a cost to the agricultural industries, it also would be a threat to many of our exports because we saw that in the bluetongue incident people were very wary of buying products from a country where there is a possibility of collecting a disease such as that. I was disturbed to read in the annual report of the DirectorGeneral of Health that over seven tonnes of goods of plant or animal origin was confiscated in one year. This sounds a really frightening amount because any of these goods or plants of animal origin which have been confiscated could have brought in disease to Australia. He mentioned that it included 8,000 plants, some 16,000 items of fresh fruit and some 2,000 eggs. Of course, he has not mentioned other products such as meat, including salami, and the things like that which are constantly being removed from incoming passengers or visitors to Australia. 
I think that this legislation also clearly demonstrates the readiness or keenness of the Government to enforce, update and improve quarantine. We have done a lot on quarantine since we have been in government. I congratulate the Minister for Health  (Mr Hunt),  who is at the table, for this fact. I would point out some of the things we have done in relation to quarantine apart from this legislation. I am very pleased to see the establishment of surveillance on the north coast of Australia. I think this is vital. This will allow the area between Geraldton in Western Australia and Cairns in Queensland to be viewed from the air each day. It will help quite a lot so far as quarantine is concerned. We have seen cases of fishermen and refugees coming in to the unattended parts of north-west and northern Australia. They constitute a grave quarantine hazard. 
It is all very well to say that fishermen do not land, but there have been incidents of fishermen landing on the north-west coast. It is all very well to say that fishermen from Indonesia eat rice and do not bring meat in, but cows' heads have been found at Ashmore (Cartier) Reef, and so on. There has to be an effective surveillance and there has to be a way for the quarantine service to check these areas very quickly and pick up any cases of people corning in. Certainly, some animals such as dogs, cats or fowls are carried on some of these vessels. These constitute a real hazard indeed. That is one of the measures we have undertaken. We have undertaken capital works programs or there are capital works programs about to start. For instance, the Cocos Islands station is about to start and hopefully will be completed in April 1981 at a cost of some $6.4m. This will allow importations from a number of countries whence importations cannot currently be taken. 
We have commenced the building of the National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong which will cost some $80m. Once that is completed and the Cocos Islands station is completed it will permit the importation of stock from a number of countries and areas whence stock just cannot be brought in at the moment because of the risk of diseases. These areas include Africa, Asia and South America and the like, and that is a substantial improvement in that regard. We are upgrading the Torrens Island facilities so that it will be able to handle 36 horses and 144 cattle at a time. This will allow the importation of cattle and so on from New Zealand and perhaps from the United Kingdom and Ireland. There is the construction of a new quarantine station at Wallgrove in New South Wales which will cost some $4. 6m. This will allow the importation of cats, dogs and horses. There has been a substantial effort by this Government in the total area of quarantine. The capital works programs indicate the importance that this Government places on that area. 
-The honourable member for Fremantle and the honourable member for Swan  (Mr Martyr),  by interjection, mentioned Bicton. Negotiation is being conducted between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government for a new site. I understand that this is taking quite some time and no site has yet been determined. Until that site is determined it will not be possible to build a new station. Bicton needs replacing; there is no doubt about that. Bicton is inadequate and badly situated for a quarantine station for cats and dogs. 
Not yet. Also other quarantine initiatives that have been taken include the provision of additional incinerators at Perth airport. That project is just about complete at this stage. It will cost some $660,000. That will be a very important addition which has been grievously needed. Until now there have been four incinerators at that airport which are quite incapable of handling the garbage from international aircraft. Further, a new incinerator is to be provided at Port Hedland at a cost of $170,000. From the report of the Director-General of Health I see that it is planned to improve the incinerator at Tullamarine airport and provide new incinerators at Rockhampton and Townsville. 
I am not particularly happy with several aspects of quarantine. I note that the new automatic disinfecting method has now been approved for Qantas Boeing 747s. The reports that I have heard on this method indicate that there is still a possibility of live insects coming through these sprays. I think the Department should reassess its activities in this regard and make sure that they are completely effective. I understand that the methods used for the identification of insects that are collected by quarantine staff are very slow indeed. I think there should be a much speedier way of doing this than the current facilities provide. Secondly, I also emphasise that in my opinion the importance that the Government places on quarantine is very clear indeed but I am worried about the morale of the officers in the quarantine service. I think the service needs to be updated and there should be more diligence and dedication from the officers. I think there should be an upgrading of the service and the whole question of staff morale should be looked at. A number of unhappy incidents have occurred, particularly in relation to  Mr Toomer  from Western Australia. It is very clear that there have been some bad administrative improprieties carried out by the Department of Health as far as its staff is concerned. I think this has decreased morale. Some of the quarantine officers to whom I have spoken, I feel, are just going through the motions and doing their jobs. If quarantine is to be effective much more than that has. to be done. In general, I support the Bill. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, 1 present the report relating to the following proposed work: 
Development of army site stage 1, Bonegilla, Victoria. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
by leave-In tabling the report of the Public Works Committee regarding the development of the army site stage 1, Bonegilla, Victoria, I wish to draw attention to three matters mentioned in the report. The proposal as presented to the Committee included a SO metre, nine lane, unheated swimming pool, which is the entitlement for a military installation with more than 1,000 personnel, at an estimated cost of $400,000. However, the Committee has recommended provision of a 50 metre, nine lane, covered, heated swimming pool with some space for spectator seating at an estimated additional cost of $330,000. In reaching its decision, the Committee noted that, due to climatic conditions, the local unheated pool at Wodonga is closed for almost half the year. During the remaining months of the year when an unheated pool is suitable for use in the Albury-Wodonga area, the use of the swimming pool at Bonegilla would be restricted from November to January owing to final examinations of apprentices, graduation parades and the December-January vacation period. 
The Committee was very conscious of the fact that the Bonegilla military complex will have some 700 trainees, mainly apprentices aged 15 to 1 8 years, and feels that such trainees should have adequate recreational facilities all year round. The Committee believes that it would not be economically efficient to spend $400,000 on a facility which can be used for only approximately four months of the year and which the Army assures the Committee can be fully used for training, sport and recreational needs throughout the year. The pool would be available for the use of the 1300 staff and students proposed for the Bonegilla development and a further 1,300 military personnel currently at Bandiana, approximately eight kilometres from Bonegilla. I draw attention to the document entitled 'Services, Scales and Standards of Accommodation' published by the Department of Defence and which states, among other things, in paragraph 2 1 (E) regarding swimming pools: one pool on any military installation may be heated and covered if training requirements and/or location justify it subject to prior approval by the Departments of Defence and Treasury. 
It is also worth noting that there is an enclosed heated pool at the Kapooka military camp near Wagga, only some 140 kilometres north of Bonegilla. The Committee also understands that an enclosed heated pool- admittedly smaller- is under construction at the Clyde Cameron Trade Union Training College at Wodonga. The Committee appreciates the concern expressed at the public hearing by the representatives of the Mornington Shire at the removal of the Army Apprentices School from its present location at Balcombe in that Shire. The Committee wishes to acknowledge the excellent relationship that has been built up over the years between the staff and students of the Army Apprentices School and the local community. However, having considered all the evidence, the Committee is satisfied that there are significant advantages in relocating the Army Apprentices School at Bonegilla. 
Lastly, I would like to draw attention to paragraphs 129 to 132 of the report dealing with the submission to the Committee of Civil and Civic Pty Ltd regarding project management which was seen by Civil and Civic as an alternative fundamental approach to implementing the design and construction of major public works. The Committee believes that this proposal should be thoroughly studied by the Department of Construction. However on the evidence before it the Committee is unable to recommend that for this reference there should be any departure from the normal procedures of the Department of Construction. All papers and evidence on this point will be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure as a possible area of investigation for that Committee. The charter of the Public Works Committee does not permit it to investigate such matters divorced from a special reference by one of the Houses of the Parliament. 
I direct my question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to reports today that China has announced officially that as from 5 March all Chinese frontier troops are withdrawing from Vietnamese territory. Can the Minister confirm these reports? 
-by leave-As  Chairman  of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I wish to refer to several comments made by the honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes).  Firstly, I point out that the hearings in relation to the Garden Island development project, which is the subject of this motion, were held in public. A full hearing was held in Sydney. The officers from the Department of Defence and the Department of Construction gave their evidence in public, and the questions were asked in public. No part of the proceedings was held in camera or was not open to the public. 
Secondly, the whole object of the Garden Island development program, which is the subject of this discussion, is to provide facilities for the new FFG frigates. I seem to recollect that the first one is due to be delivered in 1981. The program involves fairly urgent works which will provide the facilities for the servicing of those new vessels. It does not impinge on any future development of Garden Island, which is the subject of additional planning by both the Department of Defence and the Department of Housing and Construction. I point out also that the Committee examined very closely whether we were duplicating facilities which are already being upgraded at Williamstown and which were the subject of an earlier inquiry conducted by the Public Works Committee. The Committee was satisfied that these works are not in any way duplicating the works at Williamstown and that the facilities being provided at Williamstown would not be adequate to service the new FFG frigates. The Committee was very conscious of the fact that there could be duplication of facilities and it examined this question in some detail. As I said before, Williamstown had been examined by the Public Works Committee previously. 
I also point out to the House that in the White Paper on Australian Defence of November 1 976 the Government spelt out that it intended to develop the Garden Island facility. I refer to page 44 of that document which was put down by the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen).  It states: 
The Government intends that the major naval base at Garden Island, NSW, should remain, but be modernised and developed in a way which pays careful attention to environmental considerations and improved aesthetics. 
This development is continuing and there are plans for the future development of Garden Island. I wished to make those few comments only to clarify the mind of the honourable member for Corio. 

 Mr SCHOLES (Corio)-by leave-Neither the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence  (Mr McLeay)  nor the  Chairman  of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Bungey),  listened to the remarks I made. I do not intend to repeat them. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 I present the fortysecond General Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
by leave- As in past years, the report summarises the Committee's activities for the previous 12 months; in this case, the period ending 31 December 1978. In addition to activities relating to the six reports presented by the Committee, quite a number of the 49 occasions on which the Committee met during the year were for the purpose of its inquiry into the proposed Defence Force Academy which the Committee hopes to report on in the near future. In addition, at the request of the Presiding Officers, the Committee obtained evidence and provided advice on the proposed alterations to the front entrance of Parliament House. 
Included in the report is a summary of the progress of works previously reported on by the Committee; the likelihood of the Committee examining proposed works of selected statutory authorities in the future; a review of some aspects of the non-reference of defence works to theCommittee; and a comment concerning changes to works proposed which have occurred after the Committee's report to Parliament. The House may be assured that the Public Works Committee continues to examine works proposals in a manner which ensures that there is a need for the work and that the proposed expenditure is fully justified. 
-Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether there has been an attempt to hijack an aircraft from an Australian airport? 
I support the Bills before the House. They are the Wool Industry Amendment Bill and the Wool Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1 to 5).  (Quorum formed).  It is significant that when the Australian Labor Party called that quorum only eight Labor members were in the House to show an interest in the wool industry. The Bills before the House are designed to extend for one year the wool tax proposals, that is, the 5 per cent levy for the Market Support Fund and the 3 per cent levy for research, promotion and the administrative charges of the Australian Wool Corporation. These Bills have the full support of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and also of wool industry groups throughout Australia. 
As the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr Kerin)  pointed out, during the current woolselling season the market indicator has varied from 307c per kilo at the beginning of the season to something like 364c per kilo last week. This is a significant improvement in and strengthening of the wool market. Not only has this strengthening appeared but also there has been a significant fall in the stockpile holdings of the Australian Wool Corporation. At the beginning of the 1977-78 wool selling season, the Corporation's stockpile was in the region of 900,000 bales and by last week this had fallen to something like 450,000 bales. This means that by the end of this wool-selling season the stockpile could be 350,000 bales or less. In addition, there has been a reallocation of the types and styles of wool in the stockpile. Earlier the stockpile was dominated by a large collection of the finer types of wool. That has now been reduced so that the stockpile represents much more the spread of types throughout the Australian market. As the honourable member for Werriwa also pointed out, the Market Support Fund at the beginning of the wool selling season contained about $135m. Growers during that time contributed just over $200m. It seems that by the end of this wool-selling season the Market Support Fund could well contain a total of over $200m. 
I think that this season has demonstrated significantly that there are a number of important features in the wool market in Australia. A5 the honourable member for Werriwa pointed out, the Corporation's reserve price operations are acting effectively. In the past they have prevented extremely low levels of wool prices being obtained and they have avoided to some extent this year the sudden rises that occurred in the 1972-73 season. Those sudden rises in prices were of long-term significance to the wool industry. It had an effect on the decision of users to buy wool. The whole point is that questions have to be answered about the future of the Market Support Fund. To what level should the Market Support Fund be lifted? The Australian Wool Industry Conference has looked at this question. Its view is that once grower contributions to the Fund have reached $300m a reassessment should be made. The Conference supports, at this stage, the concept of a revolving fund. I feel that a revolving fund is a fair and equitable answer and will allow those wool producers who contributed earlier to the Market Support Fund to get some of their money back. The reserve figure of $300m could be reached by 1 98 1 . There is a requirement on the Government at this stage to make a decision. This is not something that can be ignored for much longer. 
The 3 per cent of funds which is currently appropriated for research and promotion and to the administrative costs of the Wool Corporation may well require some reassessment. The honourable member for Werriwa touched on the International Wool Secretariat. A fair proportion of research and promotion funds which are contributed by growers and matched substantially by the Commonwealth Government is paid to the International Wool Secretariat. Australia operates the Secretariat in combination with a number of other wool-producing countries including New Zealand and South Africa. The effect of inflation world-wide and the devaluation of the Australian dollar over past years has meant that the Australian contribution to the budget of the International Wool Secretariat in real terms has dropped. In fact  Dr Gerald  Laxer the Managing Director of the International Wool Secretariat, visited Australia earlier this year. He pointed out very clearly that at least a 10 per cent increase each year for the next four years was needed in the Secretariat budget to enable it to retain the current level of effectiveness. In effect the budget is buying less and less promotion and research. It is quite clear that worthwhile benefits to the Australian wool industry are being achieved and have been achieved in the past by the work of the IWS. Therefore there is a real need to assess the requirements of the Secretariat. 
The Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Sinclair)  has announced a review by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics into the promotional activities of the International Wool Secretariat. I have some reservations about the adequacy of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to conduct such an investigation. Similar investigations have been carried out in the past into the International Wool Secretariat, the last being the McKinsey report of 1 973-74, which looked at the organisation of the Secretariat. It was also required to look at its functions and the effectiveness of those functions. The Industries Assistance Commission to some extent, through its publications on research and promotion, looked at the activities of the International Wool Secretariat. In both cases the results were tentative and did not add very much to the evaluation of the effectiveness of the International Wool Secretariat. I have reservations about how effectively the Bureau of Agricultural Economics will be able to conduct such a survey. I wonder whether in seeking an evaluation in this way we are not sending a boy on a man's errand. I will be very interested, indeed, to see exactly what the reports contain. 
It is quite clear that, if we want the International Wool Secretariat to continue at the level at which it is functioning at the moment, there is a need for increased contributions to be made. Those increased contributions will have to be drawn from the members of the International Wool Secretariat. Of course Australia, being the premier wool producer in the world, is the premier contributor to those funds. It seems to me that there is a clear requirement for additional funds to be made available to the International Wool Secretariat. Where those funds should come from, I am not sure. One answer could be that they should come solely from government. It could well be argued that that should be so because the Australian wool industry is one of the least protected industries in Australia. It carries one of the biggest burdens of tariffs and of other artificial protection to Australian industry. 
Over the years the wool industry has gained very little by way of support from the Australian Government. It has gained very little indeed if one compares it with many other industries and when one takes into account that this year, for instance, its contribution to Australia's overseas earnings will total over $ 100,000m. I think that that puts the situation of the wool industry into perspective. So, there is at least a good argument in favour of the Government financing the increased requirements of the International Wool Secretariat, or at least a large proportion of them. After talking to grower organisations, I feel that they are prepared to match the Government and to supply jointly, with the Government, the additional funds required by the International Wool Secretariat. 
Another possible source of funds which should be looked at is to reduce the amount of research funds which are made available from growers' contributions and which also are supported quite generously by the Commonwealth Government. But when we consider the nature and the requirements of research into the wool industry we see quite clearly that there can be no fall off in the funds made available for such research. The wool industry still has many problems which have to be solved. Just to name a few, the whole area of wool harvesting still needs a great deal of research and' further investigation. With increasing shearing costs and wool handling costs, it is very clear that much more detailed research has to be undertaken to find a cheaper and more effective way of removing wool from the saep 
We have blowfly problems and disease problems. I can point quite clearly to one disease problem which is very worrying in my electorate, namely, the problem of rye-grass toxicity. At this stage, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is making some limited attempts to find solutions to the problem, as is the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. Those problems are indicative of some of the problems which exist in the wool industry. It is quite clear that there can be no diminution in the level of funds made available for research. So I discard the suggestion that we should provide the additional funds in that way. 
One of the other alternatives which I think could be looked at is that, as the Market Support Fund is growing, the 5 per cent contribution made to it could be cut back to, say, a 4 per cent contribution and the 1 per cent decrease in contribution could be added to the amount made available for research, promotion and the administrative costs of the Australian Wool Corporation. I understand that this suggestion has been raised with grower organisations but that they are unhappy with that solution. I ask them to look more realistically at the suggestion because it seems to me that it offers a realistic and sensible answer to some of the problems which exist. I repeat that, in my view, there is a clear requirement for, a clear obligation upon, and a clear justification for the Government to increase its contribution to wool promotion and research. 
The honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr Kerin)  went quite deeply- much more deeply than I can- into the marketing situation faced by the Australian Wool Corporation. I am disturbed that the wool marketing proposals have been deferred. They were put up originally in 1973 and were supported by the Australian Wool Industry Conference over a period of years. They were reviewed in 1978, but no changes of any significance were made. The effect in the plan of brokers and a few other people was changed to some extent, but the basic aims of the plan, and the basic methods of achieving it, remained very much the same. Then, in March of this year, the Australian Wool Corporation announced that it would defer consideration of the marketing proposals. It felt that the time was not propitious, that they did not have support from the Government, and that they had doubtful support from the growers. However, the Corporation pointed out that it was not retreating from the view that it saw the recommendations in the marketing report as being the solution to the long-term wool marketing problems in Australia, and I support that view. The whole marketing area has now been referred back to the grower organisations by the Wool Industry Policy Committee, and it is expected that the matter will be considered at the next meeting of the newly formed Wool Council. 
It worries me very much that again this may be a classic case of growers becoming complacent when things are going well in the wool industry. Having been a member of the Australian Wool Industry Conference and having served for many years in grower organisations, I am well aware that that is the case and that it happens quite frequently. The growers squeal and ask for government intervention and help and for changes in marketing when market forces are against wool. As soon as the market forces turn in favour of wool and things look rosy again, they are quite prepared to drop all claims for changes in marketing methods, handling and so on. I wonder whether this is another case of a short-term outlook in that regard. I appeal to grower organisations to look more closely at the marketing proposals put forward by the Australian Wool Corporation and not to fall into the classic position when things are going well of feeling that no change is necessary in the industry. 
A brief look at the history of the wool industry since 1969 indicates quite clearly that the methods and the reserve price plans that have been implemented, and the activities of the Wool Corporation, limited as they are at the moment, are not sufficient and will not serve the long-term interests of the wool industry. Further basic and substantial change is still required. A number of factors have to be considered, and I think that these were referred to in part by the honourable member for Werriwa. There is still no control of wool going onto the market. It comes in seasonal gluts, not necessarily in the interests of either the growers or the users of wool. It is clear also that the Corporation's situation is quite limited in that, as the honourable member for Werriwa said, it is a passive market participator. It cannot force the market in any way; it reacts to the market. I think it is even more clear that there are substantial savings to be made in the handling, transport, organisation and distribution of wool, and these involve significant costs at the moment. 
I welcome the fact that the Wool Corporation has made experimental shipments of wool overseas on other than the Conference line. For instance, as an experiment it has shipped something like 80,000 bales outside the Conference line. I understand that it estimates the savings to be something like $500,000, which is significant indeed. I believe that there are many other areas where this could be done. Admittedly, sale by sample and objective measurement and sale by separation have gone some way towards solving the problems, but substantial savings could still be made. The limited offer to purchase scheme has brought about some improvements and has been testing methods of bulking and bulk classing and interlotting wools, but it is only a limited experiment and one in which I do not place much faith. Even more important is the fact that there is a requirement to put wool on the world fibre market as a competitive textile fibre. With our present fragmented selling and marketing system, this cannot be achieved. 
I support the measures that are now before the House but indicate that no matter how healthy the wool industry appears to be, it has problems that must be resolved in the near future. I have referred to a number of those problems in my speech. 

 Mr FitzPATRICK (Riverina) (9.35)- I support the Wool Industry Amendment Bill and Wool Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1 to 5 ), so that the statutory accounting provisions in respect of a floor price scheme for wool may include the 1979-80 season. 
We are indeed fortunate to have had speak in this debate a past member of the Wool Industry Council and a past member of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. They have given us much technical and practical knowledge of the wool industry and wool marketing. I will try not to cover too much of the ground that they have been over. 
However, I do want to draw the attention of the House to one of the statements that were made by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry  (Mr Adermann)  in his second reading speech. He said that the floor price arrangement was introduced in September 197.4 and was designed to operate for the 1974-75 season only. I direct the attention of the House to that because I well remember the discussions when the floor price was first introduced by the then Labor Government. 
There was then no doubt that it was a major plank of the Australian Labor Party's platform. That was well understood by members of this Parliament and by people outside of it. Everyone knew that the intention of the Australian Labor Party was to have a continuing floor scheme. That was debated in meetings all over Australia and was something that the wool industry had been after for years. Of course, the Bill anticipated that the floor price would have to be increased along with the increased costs that the farmer had to face, and with the inflationary spiral generally. Therefore, provision was made for an increase in the floor price, and it was never intended that the scheme itself would continue for only one year. I do not know whether the Minister was referring to the accounting provisions only but his remarks made it look as if applicability for one year only had been the intention under the original Bill. I do not want anyone to get that impression. 
One can well understand the shame of the National Country Party in not having introduced such a measure despite acting for so many years in coalition with the Liberal Party. It will never get away with the claim that the then Labor Government intended that the scheme should operate for one year only. Every woolgrower knows that the scheme, when it was introduced by the then Labor Government, was a milestone in the history of progress in the wool industry. Despite all the knockers in this House no one would want to go back to the uncertainty that existed before the Labor Government introduced this scheme. 
As a matter of fact,  Mr Von  Bibra, who commanded some respect and authority in the wool industry of that time, had this to say: 
The floor price scheme represents a milestone in the history of the wool industry. After very many years of dissension and debate within the industry and within the Government we now have a commercially viable marketing proposal which can overcome the crippling uncertainty that has been evident in recent times in the wool market That in itself will be of enormous relief to wool producers and wool users around the world. 
It was certainly clear in this very knowledgable man's mind that this was not a scheme that had been introduced for one year only. I think that there was every justification for such remarks because it was a Labor government which, after many years of dissension and debate, gave the industry some kind of security. It set up a scheme that guaranteed a floor price which was completely justified in commercial terms. It offered the growers of this country a reasonable level of income when the going was tough. Of course it did not represent a revolutionary change in wool marketing. It simply represented an assurance that wool prices would be kept at a certain level, and that is what has happened. 
Whatever criticism may have been made in the intervening years, I have never heard anyone, either in this House of outside it, say that he wanted to go back to the previous scheme of deficiency payments whereby the government came to the party when prices dropped below 36c per lb. Of course, people would be foolish if they wanted to do so. We can all remember the unsatisfactory deficiency payments in the wool scheme that was introduced by the LiberalNational Country Party Government. The Labor Government legislation consisted of two measures: Firstly, the Wool Tax Acts were amended to impose a special 5 per cent levy on the sale of wool by growers in 1974-75. It was intended that the levy would provide a reserve for meeting any losses that might arise out of the floor price arrangement. Secondly, the Wool Industry Act was amended to provide for the establishment of a market support fund as a repository for the proceeds of the 5 per cent levy. It also laid down special accounting provisions for the reserve price operations. What has not been mentioned is that at that time the Labor Government had to guarantee $ 150m to start the scheme off. 
The Wool Industry Act had to be amended to provide for the establishment of a market support fund. Since then, the continuation of the floor price scheme has involved successive annual amendments to continue the arrangements described in the original Bill. 
As a member with an electorate that depends so much on the wool industry for its economic health and welfare, I have some satisfaction in knowing that this Government is introducing machinery amendments to carry on the worthwhile and nationally accepted floor price scheme introduced by the Labor Government. I can well remember in 1969, when I first came into this Parliament, wool growers asking when the Parliament would introduce a worthwhile and beneficial marketing scheme. For many years, such a scheme was sought from the Liberal-Country Party Government. But, in spite of the coalition Government's being in office from 1949 until 1972 and in spite of many crises in the wool industry, that Government failed to come up with a scheme that offered any real assistance, any real support to the wool industry. It must go on the record that it was a Labor Government that did something about the matter. Surely honourable members can remember the meetings of angry wool growers in 1970. At that time 2,000 to 3,000 wool growers gathered to express their disappointment and disgust at the assistance they were getting from the then Government. In any case, it is good that we are keeping the Labor Government legislation updated to meet the present day prices and pressures. 
Early this year I attended the Rural Outlook Conference. I suggest that some of the people who have been painting such a bright picture of the situation in the wool industry should consider some of the reports put out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics at the time of that Conference. The forecast given by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics was that Australian wool prices would fluctuate between 316c a kilogram and 324c a kilogram clean, or 4 per cent to 7 per cent up on last year. The Bureau also remarked that although there were some positive elements in the outlook, demand for wool was expected to remain subdued, and auction prices realised by the Australian growers would depend critically on any movement in the value of the Australian dollar. It went on to say: 
Between the beginning of 1977-78 and mid-November 1978, the value of the $A in terms of the official tradeweighted index fell by 10 per cent. The decline was greater when measured in terms of a basket of currencies of the major OECD raw wool-consuming countries. Over the same period, Australian auction prices increased by only 7.5 per cent. 
I think this is the critical point: 
This means that prices paid by overseas buyers actually fell on average, measured in terms of their own currencies. 
So it is not such a great, buoyant market when we go into it a bit deeper. These are the facts and bearing them and the forecast in mind must convince everyone of the importance of having a sound floor price scheme. Any study of the wool market would be incomplete without some comparison between the private and auction prices for wool. I refer to the booklet, also put out during the Rural Outlook Conference, entitled 'The Private Buying of Wool'. I do not want to go far into it but I do want to read the conclusion reached because I think there is a vital point made in it that has been overlooked by some people when discussing wool sales and private buying. It is stated on page 24: . . . there was no evidence of pricing inefficiency between the private and auction submarkets because of private buying. An inference that can be drawn from the foregoing evidence of price uniformity, is that the interdependence between the auction and private submarkets is likely to result in the AWC's reserve price scheme at auction being generally effective in the private submarket as well. 
That means, of course, that without the floor price the wool growers would not be getting so much from their private sales because the floor price keeps up the price in both cases. I think this is a point that is generally overlooked when people speak about private sales. It was nice to hear the honourable member for Canning  (Mr Bungey)  talking about the revolving fund. The House will recall that last year when the Wool Industry Amendment Bill was debated the Australian Labor Party moved an amendment that the revolving fund be set up. It is nice to know that once again this Government, although a bit late in doing it, is now getting behind the policies of the Labor Party. There is no doubt that many wool growers are referring to this fund. We said during the earlier debate that after seven years the chap who came in during the first year should go out and the plan should revolve accordingly. If the wool growers do not want the plan to operate for only seven years let it be 10 years, but surely at some time the grower who came into the scheme early is entitled to get his money back. This money should not be frittered away for any reason whatsoever. It belongs to the grower; it is there for his security. He should get it back eventually. The marketing of wool has been a topic of public controversy in Australia for many years. It will continue to be so. It is obvious from the remarks made by the two previous speakers that there is a good deal of contention still. In the meantime, it is very gratifying to see so many Government members supporting the measures introduced by the Labor Party.

I seek leave to make a statement relating to the report. 
Leave granted. 

 - Mr Acting Speaker, the investigation into the proposed work has taken over 12 months. Fifty witnesses were examined by the Committee during eight public hearings and two private hearings. In view of the complexity of the proposal and the length of the inquiry, the Committee decided that the House should be given the opportunity of examining in detail all the evidence placed before the Committee. We have, therefore, arranged for copies of the minutes of evidence of the whole inquiry to be made available to honourable members at the same time as the report is presented. Copies of the evidence, which comprises four volumes, are available in the Table Office for those honourable members who require them. 
The basic concept of the Defence Force Academy was to replace the degree stream component of the Royal Military College, the Royal Australian Air Force Academy, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and Darling Downs Institute, and the Royal Australian Navy College with a single academy that would provide a balanced and liberal university education in a military environment for officer cadets of the three Australian services, concurrently with a program of professional military training. The institution so created would be both a university and a military academy. The Committee agreed that there is a need for a greater proportion of tertiary educated officers in the Defence Force and that cadets should be involved in a military environment as much as possible during their tertiary studies. There was no clear evidence, however, that the training of cadets of all Services in a common establishment would of itself provide any improvement in the quality of officers. 
The Committee rejects the view that association at cadet level will significantly foster interService co-operation and understanding and believes that this objective can be more effectively fostered at a more senior level. Each Service has differing requirements and tri-Service arrangements can lead to unsatisfactory compromises. The Committee believes that each Service should be free to determine its own method of educating officers and there should not be an enforced uniformity of education. The Committee concluded that consolidation of the officer production facilities of each Service is more desirable and justified than the consolidation on a triService basis of the tertiary training of the three Services. The Committee received evidence that there is insufficient use of tertiary education institutes and recommends that full use should be made of these institutes. Based on these and other conclusions, the Committee recommends that it is not expedient to proceed with the construction of the proposed work. The recommendation of the Committee is unanimous. 
The Committee has put forward a number of suggested arrangements for the three Services which should be examined as a means of providing cost effective tertiary education towards the training of highly skilled professional officers of the Defence Force. The Committee is of the opinion that the suggested arrangements can be provided at a lesser capital cost than for the proposed Academy, and that recurrent costs can at best be kept as low as those currently obtaining, and probably very close to those estimated for the Academy. In presenting this report, I would like to thank all members of the Committee and the Committee's staff for their efforts during the protracted hearings and discussions leading to this report. I also thank the Minister for Defence  (Mr Killen)  for his personal assistance to the Committee on the several occasions on which his help was requested. Thanks must also go to the uniformed and civilian officers of his Department who have given the Committee considerable aid. The Committee's assessor,  Mr Alan  Harris, formerly First Assistant Secretary, Department of the Treasury, also deserves the Committee's appreciation. 
During the course of this inquiry, it was necessary to draw the attention of witnesses to the provisions of section 32 of the Public Works Committee Act. This section provides amongst other things that witnesses should not be disadvantaged by giving evidence to the Committee. Early in the hearings it was clear that certain witnesses were reluctant to give their opinions to the Committee, based on their own expertise and experience, apparently because of fear of jeopardising their advancement within the Defence organisation. I am aware that undue public criticism of departmental policy and decisions is undesirable in organisations structured in the manner of the three Services, and with the important responsibilities of the Department of Defence and the Services. However, as  Chairman  of the Committee, I am acutely aware of the Committee's responsibilities to the Parliament as set out in the Public Works Committee Act. The Committee's procedures ensure that government or departmental policy and decisions relating to any proposed works are fully presented. Therefore there is no reason that individual witnesses appearing before the Committee at their own request or at the request of the Committee should feel constrained in answering questions put by the Committee in areas where such witnesses have special expertise or experience. I readily admit that, as the hearings in this particular reference progressed, the evidence received from military personnel appearing before the Committee became franker, less reserved and of much greater help to the Committee. These comments are made to draw the attention of the House to a danger which, if allowed to develop, would threaten the authority and capacity of both the Committee and the House effectively to scrutinise expenditure on public works. I commend the report to honourable members. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969,I present the report relating to the following proposed work: 
Relocation of the Royal Australian Navy Research Laboratory (RANRL) from Rushcutters Bay to the Royal Edward Victualling Yard Premises at Pyrmont, New South Wales. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
I shall rephrase the question. Has the Federal Government reduced its contribution to wool promotion and research? 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 I present the report relating to the proposed work: 
Crop adaptation laboratory for the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation at Black Mountain, Acton, Australian Capital Territory. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
-I direct my question to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. The Department's monthly review of the employment situation, released yesterday, shows a fall  of 7,000 in the number of unemployed persons registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service during September. Has the Minister seen reports that the number of unemployed persons registered with the CES is now lower than the Australian Statistician's unemployment figure released earlier this month? Can the Minister inform the House of the correct position? 
In accordance with  the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969,I present the report relating to the following proposed work: 
My question also is directed to the Minister for Health. What are some of the limitations and restrictions imposed on the medical and hospital benefits packages being offered by the Victorian friendly societies outside the provisions of the National Health Act? How do these limitations compare with the basic medical and hospital tables offered by registered organisations under the National Health Act? 
In accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1 969, 1 present the report relating to the following proposed work: 
Redevelopment of Brisbane International Airport- initial works of Phase 1, Queensland. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 

 Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a statement in relation to the report. 
Leave granted. 
-The proposal referred to the Committee was for the initial works for Phase 1 for a new Brisbane airport. These works, totalling $98m, involved site reclamation, floodway development and construction of a new 3,500 metre runway. Approval of these works almost automatically requires the provision of the additional facilities planned for the completion of Phase 1 such as domestic terminal buildings and aprons, control tower, access roads, car parks and navigational aids and systems at an additional estimated cost of $74m. Therefore, total estimated cost for Phase 1 is $l72m. 
The Committee's report is not unanimous. The honourable member for Griffith  (Mr Humphreys)  has dissented from some of the Committee's conclusions and recommendations, and the report includes his minority view. 
The Committee has accepted the broad concepts proposed by the Department of Transport and the Department of Housing and Construction for the ultimate redevelopment of Brisbane Airport. It accepts that the site is suitable and that the scope of works proposed for Phase 1 is satisfactory, except in one regard. This relates to the international terminal building. The Department of Transport plans for Phase 1 do not include a new international terminal building, although some $5m is planned for upgrading of the current interim international terminal building. Evidence to the Committee clearly indicated that the taxiing distances to and from the proposed new runway to the current international terminal building would be unacceptably long, and could be dangerous under certain circumstances. The Committee has therefore recommended that a new international terminal building should be an integral part of Phase 1 and should be commissioned at the same time as the other Phase 1 facilities. The additional estimated net cost would be $18m, with the terminal actually costing $23m but with the need for the $5m expenditure on the current upgrading of the terminal being averted. 
The reasons advanced by the Department of Transport for immediate development of the new airport were based on traffic forecasts and consequent pressures on terminal and runway facilities, the need to reduce noise nuisance in certain residential suburbs, elimination of building height restrictions in the Brisbane central business district and the ability to lift the current curfew. Additional factors in support advanced by other witnesses included encouragement of Queensland tourism, the Defence need and the current inability to instal certain guidance systems. 
In summary, the Committee acknowledged the problems currently existing in relation to noise, curfew and building height restrictions, but did not accept them as compelling reasons for immediate redevelopment. Evidence in relation to the traffic forecasts and the capacity of the current runways and terminal facilities indicated that there were some deficiencies which could be alleviated with some additional capital expenditure. Current runway capacity is clearly sufficient until well after the 1990s, although some restraints are imposed on larger aircraft. Upgrading and extension of the current runway by some 300 metres at an estimated cost of $13m would overcome the major shortcomings. 
The domestic airlines, in evidence, indicated that before the announcement of the redevelopment of Brisbane Airport in 1977, they had planned to upgrade the current terminal facilities at their own cost to meet their needs to the year 1992. Reference has already been made to the planned extensions to the current international terminal which would cost some $5m. The capital cost to the Commonwealth of extending the current runway and upgrading terminal facilities to satisfy needs until at least 1992 is therefore in the region of $18m. Probable cost recovery charges to the aviation industry in respect of such upgrading over the next 10 years would be some $ 16.7m. The capital cost of the total of phase 1 development of Brisbane Airport is $ 1 72m or $ 190 m if a new international terminal building is included. The anticipated cost recovery charges to the aviation industry over the next 10 years of such works would total some $97.7m. 
-It will mean about a 4 per cent increase in domestic air fares. As I say, cost recovery charges will total some $97. 7m or $ 109.25m if a new international terminal building is also constructed. 
The Committee was concerned that premature expenditure on Brisbane Airport could well jeopardise essential airport development elsewhere in Australia and that air travellers, because of the cost recovery program, would be forced to pay higher air fares earlier than would otherwise have been necessary. So far as the Committee can ascertain, the earlier than necessary undertaking of the work involves premature Commonwealth capital expenditure of at least $ 154m and an additional cost recovery burden to the aviation industry of at least $81 m over the next 10 years. Therefore, the Committee has in this report, firstly, endorsed the concept and plans for the ultimate development of Brisbane Airport, except that an international terminal building should be included in phase 1 ; secondly, recommended that the ultimate development be not commenced until at least 1986; and thirdly, recommended upgrading of current facilities at a capital cost of $ 18m to enable the current airport to function satisfactorily until at least 1992. I thank the House. 
I speak on this matter as the  Chairman  of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I wish to respond to some points made in the statement made today by the Minister for Transport  (Mr Nixon).  I want to refer in particular to several areas in relation to which the advice he has outlined in his statement today varies substantially from the advice that his Department gave to the Committee. Firstly, the Committee was concerned with short term considerations, especially the rise in air fares. The Minister has told us today that special consideration will be given to the cost recovery factor in relation to Brisbane airport. The Committee welcomes this move because, in the Committee's view, when money is spent on facilities before they are needed and when this cost is charged to air travellers, some special provision should be made. The very fact that the Government acknowledges that it has to do this in the case of Brisbane airport, I think to some extent acknowledges the very point made by the Committee, namely, that the expenditure is premature. 
In the very limited time available to me if I am to allow other honourable members to speak, I wish to point out some of the inaccuracies in the statement and where these conflict with some of the evidence presented to the Committee. Let me deal, firstly, with the matter of the taxi-ing distance to the international terminal. It is quite clear from the evidence of the Air Pilots Guild of Australia and from Qantas Airways Ltd that there was a substantial element of danger in any taxi-ing distance greater than 5 kilometres. Aircraft could taxi for such distances with slower taxi-ing rates and the like, but there would have to be some reason for it, such as in the case of an abortive take-off. 
Secondly, I come to the matter of cost recovery. The Committee was very concerned about this matter because we heard a lot of evidence to the effect that there were substantial needs in airports in other areas. The situation could be summarised in many ways. I could quote the actual evidence that was given. For instance, even the Department of Transport acknowledged that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport was saturated and that something had to be done, but that the solution would be very costly. The air pilots see the length of the runway at the Adelaide airport as presenting the biggest danger. It says that that has to be lengthened. Qantas and some of the other airlines see the needs of the airports at Perth, Darwin, Sydney and Adelaide and even Canberra as being more compelling than those of Brisbane. They put forward their submissions along that line. 
The Committee could not get from the Department of Transport a list of priorities of works to be carried out by the Department over a period. It seemed to the Committee that the Department was adopting a piecemeal approachdoing one thing at a time- and that we would have to look at the effect of that approach on the cost recovery program and air fares. It is quite clear that if the works at Brisbane airport go ahead, as the Government is now proposing, there will be an increase in air fares of at least 4 per cent solely to cover the cost of that project, unless special provisions are made in relation to cost recovery. When the cost of that project is added to the cost of other projects that are proposed, such as those at Canberra and Sydney and those which are badly needed in a number of other areas, we see that there is a requirement for cost recovery positions. The Minister's statement referred to the capacity of the current terminals. He said: 
In any case the Department's investigations show that ultimate capacity of the present total domestic terminal area complex, regardless of improvements made in the meantime, will not suffice for the period contemplated by the Committee. 
That is in direct contradiction of what TransAustralia Airlines told the Committee. It is obviously the result of a survey that has been carried out by the Department, because the Department told the Committee nothing about this. The Department obviously treated the Committee with contempt in relation to that matter. 
I refer to what TAA stated in its evidence in relation to the terminal buildings. It said that the current state of the existing terminal buildings, aprons, roads and surfaces is such that it is possible with some improvement to cater for TAA forecast traffic levels for the next 12 to 15 years or about 6 years longer than 1992. TAA also told us that the situation in Brisbane is not as serious as that which exists at some other airports in Australia. So that is the situation in relation to the terminal buildings. If the Committee is to bring down a solid report it is unfortunate, I think, that we are not given the benefit of some of these analyses made by the Department of Transport. Our proceedings are conducted in such a way that the Department of Transport has the right and the opportunity at the end of the evidence to counter any of the other evidence that has been given. But we still received no evidence in relation to that matter. 
In his statement the Minister says that these costs to be borne by the airlines will inevitably increase fares. The point I wish to make in relation to that matter is that these costs will increase air fares to a much smaller extent than will the total costs incurred through the cost recovery program. In fact, the amounts contemplated by the two airlines were something like $2m, $4m and $6m. In the first year of operation of the Brisbane airport development- in 1985-86- the total amount to be paid by the airlines under the cost recovery program will be something like $ 13.5m. That compares the two components that will cause air fares to rise. 
There were a number of other inaccuracies in the report. Because I know that some other honourable members whose electorates are located in Brisbane wish to speak on this matter I will not say any more, except to refer to the Minister's statement that the Government's recommendation in relation to the extension of the runway is based on paragraph 1 13 of the Committee's report. In fact, paragraph 1 13 of the report is almost word for word part of the submission that the Qantas representatives gave to the Committee under oath. If the Department has got further information from Qantas the Committee certainly has not been told of it. Qantas gave the Committee that information under oath and we accepted it as being true and genuine. The Department now tells us that it has other information. There are a number of other points that I could make. But, as I said, the Committee supports the general concept of the development. Our argument is in relation to the timing of it. I feel that the Government has made a mistake in adhering to the original timing proposal.
