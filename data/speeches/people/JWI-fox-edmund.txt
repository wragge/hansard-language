Will the Minister for Labour and National Service say whether 24-hour stop work meetings are to be held on the waterfront tomorrow in Sydney, Brisbane, Hobart and Fremantle? Are the meetings likely to extend into general stoppages of work? 
I would like to join with other honourable members who have paid a tribute to the late Jim Fraser. As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I knew him well and 1 greatly admired not only his capacity for work but also the diligence with which he applied himself to representing his constituents, both inside this House and outside it. I believe that it can be said of most members of this House that they are clearly identified in the minds of the public with either a particular subject or subjects or with the political parties to which they belong, or both. But it can truly be said of Jim Fraser that he was identified with his electorate. He was  Mr Canberra. 
I am quite sure that a great many people who reside in the Australian Capital Territory were not aware of his political affiliations but knew that if they had a problem Jim Fraser was the man to see. The thousands of people who attended either the service at St Andrews or at the cemetery, or who lined the road to the cemetery, were there to pay their respects not to an office but to a person - the late Jim Fraser. I think if it can ever be said of any member of Parliament that he resided in the hearts of his electors it can be said of Jim Fraser. 
He will be missed by a great many people in all walks of life and in all sections of the community. I would like to extend to his widow, his son, his brother and the other members of his family my very deep sympathy. 
1 reject the motion of the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  and I support the amendment which has been moved by the Prime Minister  (Mr Gorton).  The honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  who has just resumed his seat, has no peer as a political humourist. Most honourable members are prepared to suffer his buffoonery with good humour and tolerance. This does not alter the fact that last night the standard of behaviour in this, the House of Representatives of the Federal Parliament, sank to the level of a fourth rate local council. 
I can cope with you. I was saying that last night the standard of behaviour in this, the House of Representatives of the Federal Parliament of Australia sank to the level of a fourth rate local council. In making that comparison I realise that I am probably being very unfair to fourth rate local councils. Whatever may have been the cause of last night's disgraceful behaviour - it was disgraceful - whatever reputations may have suffered, I believe that the greatest casualty was that of the institution of Parliament. Last night  Mr Speaker  had occasion to name the honourable member for Wills  (Mr Bryant),  who saw fit to defy his ruling and refuse to leave the House. I believe that no member regrets that more than does the honourable member for Wills, and he expressed himself to that effect earlier today. 
At a time when the Leader of the Opposition had a wonderful opportunity of increasing his own stature in this Parliament, and certainly in the rank and file of his own Party, by endeavouring to persuade the honourable member for Wills to obey the Standing Orders of this Parliament, he saw fit to condone and support the defiance of the Chair by some members of his Party. This was a great pity, not only for him personally - because I believe that in the eyes of those members of the community who take an interest in Parliament he lost a very considerable amount of ground by his failure to act with responsibility - but also for the Parliament itself. The failure of the Leader of the Opposition to take appropriate action to persuade members of his Party to respect the Standing Orders was in itself bad enough, but he now seeks to divert attention from his own shortcomings by trying to shift the responsibility for the damage which Parliament has suffered onto the shoulders of the Leader of the House. 
The issue that we ought to be debating now is not that moved by the Leader of the Opposition but the loss suffered by the institution of Parliament by last night's performance in this House. I believe that the blame for this must be laid at the door, not of the Leader of the House but of the Leader of the Opposition because of his failure to make even the slightest effort to persuade the honourable member for Wills to obey the Chair and the Standing Orders of this Parliament, or to make even a token effort to uphold and maintain the dignity off Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition, by his motion, is seeking to make the Leader of the House the scapegoat for the unprecedented unruly behaviour of a very considerable number of his own Party who openly defied the Chair. 
We in Australia pride ourselves on our parliamentary system of government, but there was nothing whatsoever in last night's performance to justify that pride. No-one expects an opposition tamely to accept all government legislation. An opposition it quite within its rights to oppose - indeed, it would be failing in the exercise of its proper function as an opposition if it did not strenuously oppose with every means in its power within the Standing Orders of this Parliament - legislation with which it did not agree. This is the right and duty of any opposition worthy of its name. It is equally the right of the Government to use every means in its power to see that the business of government is not taken out of its hands by the Opposition. The Minister charged with this responsibility is the Leader of the House. He would be failing in his duty if he did not attempt to anticipate all the delaying or frustrating tactics which the Opposition may seek to employ. It is only natural in circumstances such as this that tempers can sometimes become frayed and members sometimes become extremely edgy, but at all times I believe that honourable members on both sides of the Parliament should endeavour to conduct themselves with dignity so that the institution of Parliament is not brought into disrepute. 
It is the duty of the  Speaker  to maintain order and decorum while acting within the Standing Orders of this Parliament, to interpret those Orders in an impartial manner and to be fair in his treatment of members on both sides of the House. This. I believe,  Mr Speaker  has always endeavoured to do. although it is not possible for him, any more than it is for any of us, to please all people at all times. I believe that  Mr Speaker  is entitled to expect the co-operation of every member of this House, particularly that of the leaders of the respective parties, in his endeavour to maintain the dignity of Parliament. The tactics employed last night by the Leader of the House were obviously entirely unacceptable to the Opposition and it was entitled to show its displeasure but not, in my opinion, at the expense of the institution of Parliament. To the extent that the Leader of the Opposition failed completely to make even the slightest endeavour to assist the  Speaker  to maintain dignity and decorum in this House, he deserves the strongest censure of this House. 
1 preface my question to the Minister for Social Services by reminding him that yesterday the honourable member for Perth asked the Minister for Immigration whether he was aware of the concern and resentment of elderly migrants who found that, in spite of naturalisation, they are denied the age pension because they have not been in Australia for 10 years and he referred to their complaints of being treated as second class citizens. I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that the 10-year residential qualification relating to the payment of age pensions applies equally to persons born in Australia. Is it also a fact that the Australian Labor Party, when in power, fixed this residential qualification at 20 years, not 10 years? Further, is it not a fact that the Australian Labor Party also required migrants to become Australian citizens before being eligible to receive age pensions and is it not a fact that it was this LiberalCountry Party Government which removed this bar to the receipt of pensions by migrants? 
The year 1970 is a very important one in many parts of the world. Australians are celebrating the 200th anniversary of the discovery of the east coast of Australia by Captain Cook. Europe in 1970 is celebrating Conservation Year. Australia's contribution to conservation is to foster and encourage the extinction of one of the word's most unique animals - the kangaroo. Some people, no doubt, will believe that I am exaggerating and, in typical fashion, will make the well known observation: 'It can't happen here. We could not possibly eliminate the kangaroo'. But it is happening here. Let me try to substantiate that statement. 
An article in the Brisbane 'Courier-Mail' of 9th February this year refers to a report that  M  million kangaroos may be killed in Queensland this year to meet mounting orders for the fur and leather trade. A Sydney report stated that three American firms were planning to import at least 1 million kangaroo skins from Queensland handlers in 1970. This would mean that in order to fulfil these orders the Queensland shooters would have to slaughter more kangaroos than have ever been killed in 1 year in the State of Queensland during this century. I think that experts warned the Queensland Cabinet that this is about ten times as many as could safely be shot in that State in this period. The Queensland Cabinet evidently placed some reliance on this recommendation because it has reduced the number of chillers operating in that State by more than half. In a Press statement issued on 1 0th December 1969 the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries said that his Department was concerned that the age distribution of kangaroos had become unsatisfactory in some areas and that the blame for this was due to some extent to trade competition. 
What kind of trade is it? It is mainly the pet food industry. An article in the 'Sunday Telegraph' of 14th December 1969 stated that Australians are spending more than $100m a year on pet foods. The 'Land' newspaper of 4th December 1969 stated that pet food sales had increased by 1 ,200% . One of the main ingredients in a number of brands of pet foods is kangaroo meat. I ask: What species of animal can possibly survive a rate of killing in excess of 1 million a year in one State alone, and in excess of 2 million for the whole of Australia? While South Africa is protecting the leopard, Australia has virtually proclaimed an open season on the kangaroo. 
I am aware that in a number of States the kangaroo is a protected animal, but not 1 State has sufficient game wardens to police its laws. I believe that there are insufficient wardens to police effectively even our national parks. Western Australia has 7 wardens and 1 cadet to patrol an area equal to half the size of Europe. New South Wales has 6 men to patrol an area in excess of 300,000 square miles. Queensland recently introduced new laws but, according to an article in the Brisbane Sunday Mail' of 8th February this year, a professional shooter stated that he had evidence that kangaroos weighing between 13 lb and IS lb were being accepted by Queensland pet food firms. I understand that the legal minimum weight is 20 lb but there are not enough game wardens to see that the law is obeyed. 
Pet food is big business and today one can buy tinned kangaroo meat in San Francisco, in Valparaiso and in Hamburg. As Alan Moorehead said in an article in the magazine 'Animals' of January 1964, the meat is cheap since the animals cost nothing to raise and no-one need buy a kangaroo; you simply shoot him and he is yours'. As I said, pet food is big business, but I believe that tourism is bigger business. Every year we are attracting a greater number of visitors to Australia and they are spending increasing amounts of money. I believe that many of them are attracted by our unique flora and fauna which they apparently regard more highly than we do. 
On 23rd January 1970, the Belgian newspaper 'Present' carried a 3 page supplement entitled 'Stop the Massacre of the Kangaroo.' On 24th February a petition bearing 115 signatures and protesting against the slaughter of kangaroos was presented to the Australian Embassy in Brussels. I have received hundreds of letters and dozens of petitions containing hundreds of names urging this Government to take effective action to protect the kangaroo. The letters have been written by people of all ages and from all walks of life, and many of these people are judging this Government by its lack of action to provide adequate protection for Australia's national emblem. Let us not forget that once a species has been eliminated it cannot be brought back; it is lost to the world for all time. Already 
Australia has lost a number of species of kangaroo. It will be too late afterwards to be sorry. Let us act now. 
A few weeks ago the honourable member for Chisholm  (Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes)  directed a question to the Minister for Customs and Excise  (Mr. Chipp)  in these words: 
What action has been taken in conjunction wilh the Slates lo stop or control the marketing of kangaroo meat for pet food and, in general, to co-operate wilh the Slate Governments to preserve our unique flora and fauna. 
The Minister said among other things: 
We know that each State Fauna Authority is exercising close control over the preservation of Australia's flora and fauna. Until such time as the Commonwealth receives representations from the States lo ban the export of kangaroos, the Commonwealth would be loth to move unilaterally in this regard. 
I hope I am not being unkind to the Minister when I say that he does not take that line in regard to censorship. He does not leave it to the States to police something which he believes the Commonwealth can do more effectively. I have a great admiration for the courage shown by the Minister for Customs and Excise in regard to censorship. He has not been afraid to do what he believes to be right in a sphere where he cannot be on side, in my opinion, with more than 50% of the community. The matter of conservation is not controversial. I am sure that at least 80% of the community - this is a very conservative estimate - would applaud the Minister if he took action to ban the export of kangaroo products. I realise that there are more departments than his involved in such a decision and that the States are also involved. But I believe that the Australian public wants the Federal Government to give a lead to the States by passing positive legislation. 
Let us stop fooling with the problem and show the States that we mean business and that we have a real interest in conservation. We are receiving bad publicity overseas in regard to conservation. I previously mentioned Belgium. Sometime ago I received a letter drawing my attention to a film which was produced in Australia and shown in Canada. It showed clearly that a number of Australian birds and animals were being hunted in a cruel manner to provide sport' for the hunters, and I am told that it evoked both revulsion and hostile criticism from many people who viewed it. I have been provided with a copy of a letter written by an officer of the Australian High Commission in Ottawa in his official capacity to an Australian lady who was resident in Toronto. It suggested that she might like to express her concern to the World League for the Protection of Animals. 
I think it is rather ironical that graziers, who are reputed to be not in the least sympathetic to the kangaroo, should be urging that food should be provided for starving kangaroos in the vicinity of Mildura. This was reported in the Melbourne 'Herald' on Tuesday evening. I concede that the responsibility for effective legislation is largely a matter for the States. However, it is not one entirely for the States. Let us, as a Federal Government, not pay mere lip service to conservation and pass the buck to the States. During the visit to Australia of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, who is an enthusiastic conservationist, let us show that our interest in conservation is genuine by taking positive action to protect our kangaroos. Let us make 1970 conservation year in Australia as it is in Europe. 
That grievances be noted. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. 
I preface a question to the Minister for Customs and Excise by drawing his attention to a speech which I made in Ihe grievance debate last Thursday on the plight of the kangaroo and the urgent need to have effective protective measures. J ask the Minister whether he read the speech and whether he is aware of the public's concern in this matter, as is evidenced by the number of petitions presented to this Parliament? Is it a fact that the State governments do not have the facilities to police the killing of kangaroos and to see that their own laws relating to the killing of kangaroos are obeyed? Finally, does the Minister propose to investigate the allegations I have made and to do something about them? 
I ask the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs: Is it a fact that a football team of Aboriginal boys at present is playing a series of games against junior teams throughout Australia? What is the purpose of this programme? What success has the team achieved? 
I wish to direct a question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a recent report concerning a spray-on antiskid road surface which has already reduced pedestrian crossing accidents by 87%, wet road accidents by 72%, rear end collisions by 73%, and accidents where the driver has lost control by 70% in areas of roads which have been treated by this material in the United Kingdom? lt is claimed that no major roadwork is necessary and that spraying can be done quickly at night time without disturbing the existing road surface. 
I move - 
That the petition be printed.  In accordance with the requirements of standing order  1 32,  I inform the House that I intend to submit a notice of motion in connection with the petition. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
 I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: 
That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon: 
The need for an urgent and comprehensive survey of wildlife populations including birds, mammals of the land and water, and reptiles, and their ecology to enable conservation measures to be effectively applied to threatened species; 
the adequacy of the several systems of national parks, reserves, etc., of the States and Territories to ensure that at least minimum areas of the major animal habitats and the wildlife of the continent are preserved, held securely, and are properly managed in the national interest; 
the effects of pollution and the widespread use of pesticides on wildlife population; 
the effect on the population of kangaroos of the trade in meat and hides and the effect of other industrial exploitation on wildlife; 
the need for international and interstate agreements for the effective conservation of migratory animals; (0 the threat presented to wildlife by the large numbers of domestic animals gone wild, particularly in Northern Australia; and 
the need for a Commonwealth wildlife conservation authority. 
That the committee recognise the control in these matters exercised by the States and seek their co-operation in all relevant aspects. 
That the committee consist of 7 members, 4 to be appointed by the Prime Minister and 3 to be appointed by the Leader of the Opposition 
That every appointment of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to the  Speaker. 
That the  Chairman  be appointed by the Prime Minister. 
That the  Chairman  have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, also have a casting vote. 
That the  Chairman  of the committee may from time to time appoint another member of the committee to be  Deputy Chairman,  and that the member so appointed act as  Chairman  of the committee at any time when the  Chairman  is nol present at a meeting of the committee. 
That the Deputy Chairman, when acting as Chairman, have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, also have a casting vote. 
That the committee have" power to send for persons, papers and records, and to move from place to place. 
That the committee report to the House as soon as possible. 
That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the Standing Orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders. 
My question is addressed to the Minister for Customs and Excise. He will be aware of the daily petitions calling for a ban on the export of kangaroo products. Because of the flood of these petitions, which indicate the alarm with which the public views the problem, I raise the matter again. Can the Minister tell the House when investigations are likely to lead to action? 
I ask the Minister for Health whether he is aware that a great many people mistakenly believe that if the National Health Bill becomes law they will never have to pay, in any circumstances, more than $5 for even the most complicated operation. Will he make it perfectly clear that this could apply only where the doctor concerned charged for the particular operation or service the common fee which is set out in the Schedule to the Bill? Will he make it perfectly clear that unless the legislation was based on the principle of a common fee the taxpayer would be called upon to make up the difference between  $5  and whatever amount, however unreasonable, the doctor saw fit to charge? Finally, will he make it clear that the fixing of a common fee will not prevent anyone from consulting any doctor he chooses providing he is willing to pay in addition to  $5  the difference between the common fee and that charged by the doctor? 
I move: 
That a Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon - 
The need for an urgent and comprehensive survey of wildlife populations including birds, mammals of the land and water, and reptiles, and their ecology to enable conservation measures to be effectively applied to threatened species; 
The adequacy of the several systems of National Parks, Reserves, etc., of the States and Territories to ensure that at least the minimum areas ofthe major animal habitats and the wildlife of the continent are preserved, held securely, and are properly managed in the national interest; 
The effects of pollution and the widespread use of pesticides on wildlife population; 
The effect on the population of kangaroos of the trade in meat and hides and the effect of other industrial exploitation on wildlife; 
The need for international and interstate agreements for the effective conservation of migratory animals; 
The threat presented to wildlife by the large numbers of domestic animals gone wild, particularly in Northern Australia, and 
The need for a Commonwealth wildlife conservation authority. 
That the committee recognise the control in these matters exercised by the States and seek their co-operation in all relevant aspects. 
That the committee consist of seven members, four to be appointed by the Prime Minister and three to be appointed by the Leader of the Opposition. 
That every appointment of a member of the committee be forthwith notified in writing to the  Speaker. 
That the  Chairman  be appointed by the Prime Minister. 
That the  Chairman  have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, also have a casting vote. 
That the  Chairman  of the committee may from time to time appoint another member ofthe committee to be  Deputy Chairman,  and that the member so appointed actas  Chairman  of the committee at any time when the  Chairman  is not present at a meeting of the committee. 
That the Deputy Chairman, when acting as Chairman, have a deliberative vote and, in the event of an equality of votes, also have a casting vole. 
That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records, and to move from place to place. 
That the committee report to the House as soon as possible. 
That the foregoing provisions of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing orders. 
It is barely 200 years since Europeans first set foot on the east coast of Australia. Since that time more than 30 species of birds and animals which were unique to Australia have already been exterminated and others are at present under threat of extermination. When a species has been eliminated it is gone for all time. There is no way in which it can be brought back. Australia's wildlife is a national asset. It belongs to all the people of Australia, not only to those who may reside in any particular State. It is probably even more correct to say that Australia's wildlife really belongs to all mankind and that it is held by the Australian people on trust. It would be an international tragedy as well as a national tragedy if the threat to the existence of our unique wildlife were not eliminated. By moving the motion I do not intend that the Commonwealth should take over from the States those matters which are constitutionally theirs to administer, butI sincerely believe that an effective conservation policy will depend for its success on the close co-ordination of policies of neighbouring States. If such a policy is in existence at present it is not particularly noticeable. 
As a national Parliament we are charged with the responsibility of preserving our national heritage. We can no longer afford to let things drift along as they have been doing. The Australian public is not propared to let things drift along. That is evident from the number of petitions which have been presented to this Parliament in relation to kangaroos. The function  at  a select committee, among other things, would be to ascertain the facts in relation to the population of kangaroos and other forms of wildlife. Systematic surveying of Australian wildlife is non-existent. Each State and each Territory has its national parks, reserves and sanctuaries. I have been told by people who should be in a position to know what they are talking about that no State system is as comprehensive as it ought to be. For various reasons very few of the reserves have adequate management plans to ensure that what is meant to be preserved is in fact being preserved. I have been told that in some cases the tenure of the reserves is very insecure. 
Practically no effective research has been carried out on the effects of pollution and of the widespread use of insecticides on Australia's wildlife. Such research can be done only at national level. Our wildlife is being threatened by commercial exploitation. I have reliable information that some persons engaged in the kangaroo meat trade believe that it is only a matter of time before governments will take effective action at least to reduce drastically the present rate of slaughter. These people are making the most of the opportunities that they have at the present time; in other words, they are getting what they can while they can. As I see it, a Commonwealth wildlife conservation authority could provide expert collaboration and assistance for the States' wildlife programmes and it could include an advisory panel of State representatives. The authority could provide State grants for conservation projects which are considered to be of national importance. I would hope that when it is established it would not be merely a hoven for wellmeaning academics but that it would have the teeth to ensure that what ought to bc done will be done. The committee should be composed of people who will at all times be vigilant and who will be prepared to act promptly and fearlessly. I express the hope that the States will give their blessing to the select committee of this House which is proposed to be appointed and that they will do everything in their power to co-operate with it so that its findings will result in a set of rules and a national conservation policy of which the Australian nation can be proud. 
I direct my question to the Minister-in-Charge of Aboriginal Affairs. Has the Office of Aboriginal Affairs taken any steps to assist the Torres Strait Islanders to exploit the wolfram deposits on Banks Island? 
My question, which is addressed to the Minister for National Development, is somewhat supplementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition. Did the Minister see a statement relating to some alleged information which was provided by Commonwealth Ministers to the meeting of the Australian Minerals Council in Adelaide yesterday referring to sharing of royalties for off-shore minerals and other matters? Will the Minister inform the House whether this statement is accurate in any way? 
I ask the Treasurer whether he has seen reports, which have been given very wide .coverage, suggesting that the Government is' seeking to introduce legislation to double the pensions of members of Parliament. Does he agree that such reports are a gross distortion of the true position? Is it not a fact that what the Government is seeking to do is to place members of Parliament on an equal basis in regard to superannuation- -with every, other section of the community, particularly retired public servants and retired members of the Defence forces? Is it not a fact that members of Parliament constitute the only section of the community who have their superannuation rates halved if they accept an office of profit under the Crown? Further, is it not a fact that retired' members of Parliament are paid not pensions but superannuation for which they contribute of their salary? 
I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service: What has been the response to the call by the Australian Council of Trade Unions for a national stoppage today? 
I present the following petition: 
To the honourable the  Speaker  and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The bumble Petition of the residents of the State of New South Wales respectfully sheweth: 
The Red Kangaroo and many other marsupials, through shooting for commercial purposes, have been reduced to a numerical level where their survival is in jeopardy.

My question is directed to the Minister for Customs and Excise. Is the Minister aware that recent newspaper reports allege that a substantial trade exists in illegal dealing in Australian birds and that the birds are subjected to cruelty?  ls.  there any truth in the allegations, and, if so, will the Minister inform the House of what action his Department has already taken or proposes to take to end this unpleasant, unnecessary, unwanted and undesirable trade?

ls the Minister for the Interior aware that a number of questions have been asked both in this House and in the Senate relating to the activities of police taking photographs at demonstrations in front of Parliament House? Is it a fact that a number of demands have been made for the destruction of films and photographs taken by the police during these demonstrations? If it is a fact, can he inform the House why the demands have been made and what action he proposes to take?. 
I present the following petition: 
To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the State of Victoria respectfully sheweth: 
That because of uncontrolled shooting for commercial purposes, the population of kangaroos, particularly the big red species, is nowso low that they may become extinct. 
There are insufficient wardens in any State of the Commonwealth to detect or apprehend those who break the inadequate laws which exist. As a tourist attraction, the kangaroo is a permanent source of revenue to this country. It is an indisputable fact that no species can withstand hunting on such a scale, when there is no provision being made for its future. 
We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that the export of kangaroo products be banned immediately, and the Commonwealth Government takethe necessary steps to have all wildlife in Australia brought under its control. Only a complete cessation of killing for commercial purposes can save surviving kangaroos. And your petitioners, therefore, as in duty bound will ever pray.

 I direct a question to the Minister for Trade and Industry and preface it by referring to an article, published with considerable display a couple of days ago in one of the big daily newspapers, dealing with the cost of tariff protection. I ask the Minister whether the Government continuously reviews the level of tariffs. Is it a fact that, as stated, the burden of the present level of tariffs is of the order of $2,700m a year? Finally, are our tariffs based on the test of an industry being economic and efficient?

I direct a question to the Attorney-General. Is he aware that in most of the major countries spotlight shooting has been banned? Is the Attorney-General aware that field game associations and sporting shooters' associations do not regard spotlight shooting as a sport and would favour the introduction of legislation to make it illegal? In the interests of wildlife conservation will the AttorneyGeneral give consideration to placing this subject on the agenda for the next conference of Attorneys-General?

I direct to the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that just asked by the honourable member for Oxley. Does the profit made last year by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd represent a return of only 6.2 per cent on shareholders' funds. Is this years increased profit unlikely to provide BHP shareholders with a return which is comparable with many that are readily obtainable by investors elsewhere? 
My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the Australian Government aware that the Governments of Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia have appealed to the United Kingdom and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which are co-chairmen of the 1962 Geneva Conference on Laos, to take some action to restore peace in Laos? What is the Government's attitude towards these appeals and towards the 1962 settlement in Laos? 
I oppose this motion for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that [ consider the time taken in debating it is a colossal waste of valuable time ' which could be better employed in getting on with the business of government which is the purpose for which all members of this Parliament have been elected. This; is what I believe the public wants; it is what 1 believe the public expects. 1 listened in vain for the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  to state clearly the reasons for moving this motion. After all, this is the first day in the Parliament for a new Prime Minister. However, instead the Leader of the Opposition set up his own Aunt Sallies which he then proceeded to knock down. He set out the reasons which he believed the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  would give for not holding an election immediately. Then he proceeded to demolish these reasons. The Leader of the Opposition was unfortunate in that the Prime Minister did not give the reasons which he anticipated would be given. The Leader of the Opposition set himself up as a seer. He not only endeavoured to anticipate the Government's arguments but he also named some of the Ministers whose positions he thought would be endangered by the change in the leadership of the Government. 
The Leader of the Opposition used a number of objectionable adjectives to describe the Government. I cannot remember all of them but I know he referred to selfishness, to rivalries, to tensions and to dissensions in the Government. But I believe that he could equally and probably with greater truth have applied them to his own Party. After all, his own position as Leader of the Opposition is not all that secure. Instead of worrying about Ministers whose positions he believes are in jeopardy he ought to be looking over his own shoulder. He referred to what some of the members of the Liberal Party are reported to have said about the previous Prime Minister. 1 suggest that he would have been better rewarded if he had been paying the same attention to what some members of his own Party are reported to have said about him. It is not that we on the Government side of the House do not wish him well because we regard him as our greatest political asset. The last thing we want to see is a change in the leadership of the Opposition. However, I do not want to get into a verbal battle of offensive remarks. The public is not interested in this. 
 I will catch up with the honourable member in a minute. The public cares not for recrimination or for character assassination. What is past is past, however much some people might regret what took place last week. But this is now water under the bridge. It is past history; it goes into history. Today we have a new Prime Minister; so let us get on with the job. Let us give him a chance to get on with the job. The Leader of the Opposition said that the people of Australia should be given a voice in who shall govern Australia. He said it was only proper that the people of Australia should have their say. The people of Australia had an opportunity of voting on the respective policies of the Government and the Opposition only 18 months ago. At that time they showed in no uncertain terms that they preferred our policies to those of the Opposition. They showed clearly that they had no confidence in the Leader of the Opposition. They showed clearly that they had no confidence in the Opposition. 
The Prime Minister said earlier today that most of the promises which were included in the Government's last policy speech' have already been implemented. Since then only the leadership has changed. The policies which were endorsed by the people 18 months ago remain exactly the same. The Leader of the Opposition has said that the present . Prime Minister has no mandate from the people, but 18 months ago the people voted for the parties which they wished to govern, and the members of the Government chose their leader. Does the Leader of the Opposition imply that every time the leader is changed there ought to be an election? If he does, then the Labor Party ought to have gone to the people twice after the death of John Curtin. If the argument presented by the Leader of the Opposition is valid, neither  Mr Forde  nor  Mr Chifley  had a mandate from the people. I know of no precedent in any major Parliament in the world for having an election in circumstances similar to those which have taken place here. 
The Prime Minister referred earlier today to a number of cases where the leadership of the Government has been changed without the Government going to the people - without the necessity for an election. I believe that the policies of the Government are infinitely superior in every way to those of the Opposition. 
 The honourable member will not be and I doubt whether he ever will be. There is nothing wrong with the Government's policies. The only" thing is that we do not always get sufficient credit for those policies, because we do not take the trouble to explain them sufficiently to the people. Too frequently we are defending ourselves when we ought to be attacking. Heaven knows, we have enough to attack. We ought to be proclaiming our policies from the housetops, because they are good policies. Instead of that, the public relations of Liberal-Country Party governments have, for as long as I can remember, been poor. We are criticised when we ought to be praised. Let me give honourable members an example in respect of a subject in which 1 have taken a particular interest. I could choose many subjects. 
This Government has come in for a great deal of unfair criticism because of its welfare policies. During the past 3 years the Government has increased age pensions by $2.50 a week. That figure does not include the 50c increase announced today by the Prime Minister, which will bring the increase up to $3. This represents an increase of more than 23 per cent on the single rate of pension which was paid only 3 years ago. Tn the same period the consumer price index has increased by a little less than 17 per cent. I have quoted figures relating to single pensioners. The percentage increase for married couples would be slightly less. When the Liberal-Country Party Government came to power in 1949 only 39.15 per cent of the people of pensionable age were in receipt of pensions. But because of the continuous liberalisation of the means test which has been brought about by successive LiberalCountry Party governments, at 30th June last year 60 per cent of the people of pensionable age were in receipt of pensions. The tapered means test which was introduced only about 18 months ago increased the figure from 55.4 per cent of people at 30th June 1969 to 60 per cent one year later. The present rate of age pension represents a substantially higher percentage of the minimum wage than that paid by the Labor Government when it was last in office. 
 The honourable member can check the figures for himself. Furthermore, the increases which have been made by this Government have very substantially increased the purchasing power of pensions. These figures are there to be checked, too. The amount paid by this Government for welfare - that is, for social services, repatriation and health - represents a much higher percentage of the total Budget than that paid by Labor in its last year of office. I believe that actions speak louder than words. Performances count for more than promises. I have not been referring to individual amounts of pensions or the total sums paid because, naturally, these increase as years go by. As the value of money changes and as the population increases one expects rates of pension to be higher and the total amounts to be higher. 1 am speaking of percentages which are not affected either by inflation or by increased population. 
Of all the criticisms which (he Labor Party could have offered against the Liberal-Country Party Government those relating to social welfare are by far the weakest. They are on by far the weakest grounds. The Government cannot be criticised for what it has done for the less privileged section of the community. I do not want to go back into the distant past. I want to draw the attention of honourable members to just some of the very great improvements in social welfare which have been introduced by this Government during the past 2 to 3 years. 1 am told that today's increase of an additional 50c a week will benefit more than 830,000 pensioners. In addition to the base rates of age pensions being increased by S3 in less than 3 years, all persons in receipt of long term sickness benefit, sheltered employment allowance and tuberculosis allowance will receive a benefit by the increase announced today. As well as the general increase in pension rates, hearing aids have been provided at a cost of $10 each for those pensioners who are in need of them. Elderly persons in nursing homes who require intensive care now receive from this Government $35 a week in addition to their normal rate of age pension. Local government authorities providing meals on wheels receive a subsidy of 10c for each meal provided. This has assisted them very substantially to do more for the underprivileged section of the community. 
This Government extended hospital benefits to provide 52 weeks coverage in every year instead of only 13 weeks a year as previously. The concept of a common fee in relation to medical services, which was introduced by this Government, means that even the most serious operation will cost the patient only $5 where the most common fee is charged. Health insurance is provided free for low income families. Migrants are granted free insurance for a period of 2 months after their arrival. These are only some of the new benefits which have been introduced by this Liberal-Country Party Government during the past 2 to 3 years. In addition to this, persons of pensionable age who, because of their savings, have not been in receipt of a pension pay no income tax on what would normally have been a net taxable income of $1,326. Married couples pay no income tax where their net joint incomes do not exceed $2,314. On incomes above those figures they pay tax at reduced rates. This is because of the operation of the age allowance which was introduced by a previous Liberal-Country Party Government. 1 chose to speak on welfare because the Government has been unfairly criticised by uninformed people and by the Opposition for its welfare policies. But I believe that the policies of the Liberal Patty and the Country Party are in every case superior to those of the Australian Labor Party and have been formulated in the overal interests of a majority of the people of Australia. Only a couple of weeks ago the Opposition launched a motion of no confidence against the Government and this was defeated, as will this present motion be defeated. Whereas a couple of weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition may have received some political mileage out of this action, and I rate it no higher than that, I believe that today the public is heartily sick of the amount of time which is wasted which ought to be devoted to passing worthwhile legislation such as the Bill forecast by the Prime Minister today to provide increases for the pensioners for whom the Opposition says it is speaking. The Opposition says it represents the underprivileged section of the community. The Prime Minister today forecast the introduction of a Bill which will mean a rise of 50c a week for more than 750,000 people but instead of trying to have this legislation brought. down the Opposition is wasting time on a no confidence motion which each of them knows has no chance of being carried. Today the Government is united and is anxious to get on with the business of governing. I believe that the introduction of a Bill to increase pensions is of much more interest to the people than the fantasies of the Leader of the Opposition. If he is so anxious to have an election let him have one on Wednesday when Caucus next meets. Let him put his own position as leader on the line and see what measure of support he has in his own Party because the public will have an opportunity of saying what it thinks of Labor's policies when it votes in the byelection for the electorate of Murray on Saturday next. The Liberal Parly has had its problems and I am not trying to gloss them over, but I do believe that the public prefers Liberal-Country Party government to any which might be led by the honourable member for Werriwa  (Mr Whitlam).  I believe that we provide the policies that the people want. I believe that we provide the type of government that the people want and 1 believe that the Prime Minister will provide the leadership that they want. So let us get on with the job.

I direct a question to the Treasurer, and preface it by drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that a branch of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation within the electorate of Henty closed for business last week. The reason given was that the branch had been held up by armed robbers 5 times in the past  3$  years.  I  ask the Minister: At what level was the decision to close the bank taken and what consideration was given to the convenience of its customers? Finally, what efforts were made to cope with the problem of armed robberies by other means than by closing the branch?

I ask the Prime Minister: Has the Government given consideration to amending the restrictive trade practices legislation particularly with regard to the subject of resale price maintenance? If so, can he indicate the lines along which the legislation will be amended? 
I preface ray question to the Postmaster-General by referring to the policy which requires Australian television stations to include 45 per cent of Australian produced programmes between- the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. on 7 nights a week as from September this year. I ask the Minister whether he has seen a recent statement in the 'Australian' which quotes the managing director of a television corporation as saying that the final nail was driven into the 'Tonight' show by the new standards laid down by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board which become effective in September this year. Does this statement indicate an attempt to break down the Board's stated policy before it conies into operation or does it imply a lack of executive capacity to meet these new requirements? Finally, does the Minister see the statement as an endeavour to influence other television corporations to make a joint effort to persuade the Government to change a policy which has been designed to foster Australian produced television programmes?

I wish to make a personal explanation. 
I claim to have been misrepresented by inference. I did not seek a pair for the honourable member for La Trobe, nor was he granted a pair. The fact that he was shown in Hansard as being paired was as a result of an arrangement between the Whips to try to co-operate when members are not here. 
I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he has seen newspaper reports of a statement made to the Press by the Leader of the Opposition that the letters between the Australian Government and the Prime Minister of  Veitnam  in April 1965 show that the South Vietnamese Government merely accepted an Australian offer and that 'there would in fact have been nothing dishonourable in the Australian Government stating forthrightly in 1965 that it was acting in collaboration with the Government of the United States but the Government chose to sell its commitment to the Australian people on the basis of an urgent request from South Vietnam'. Will the Minister inform the House whether the facts as stated are correct? 
I address my question to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. It relates to the recent substantial increase in the rate of infant mortality among the Aboriginal population in the Alice Springs area. Has the Minister given consideration to a letter which I wrote to him in which I drew to his notice the views expressed by  Dr Kalokerinos  of Collarenebri as to the reasons for this increase? Is he aware of the very great amount of research undertaken by  Dr Kalokerinos  into the causes of the very high rate of Aboriginal infant mortality? Is he aware that  Dr Kalokerinos  believes that an inquiry ought to be held immediately into this very important matter which involves the lives of Australian children? If he is aware of these matters will he say what action he has taken?

by leave - I move: 
That the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation have leave to report from time to time. 
The reason for this motion is that the Committee wishes to present an interim report in relation to kangaroos but it has not, under the terms of its resolution of appointment, the power to present interim reports. I commend the motion to the House. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
I ask the Minister for Social Services: Are the facilities of sheltered workshops which obtain assistance from the Government available to people in the upper age groups who would benefit physically, psychologically and financially by participating in the workshop activities? 
During the course of his Budget speech the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  said that Australia is in the grip of inflationary pressures and, if allowed to develop unchecked, this will cause increasing economic hardship. (Quorum formed.) 1 thank the honourable member for Leichhardt  (Mr Fulton)  for obtaining an audience for me. As he has done that, I think it is worth while beginning again. I said that during the course of his Budget Speech the Treasurer said that Australia is in the grip of inflationary pressures and, if allowed to develop unchecked, this will cause increasing economic hardship. I find myself in agreement with these sentiments. I believe that if we can do anything at all to reduce costs it is worth examining the proposal. I would like to make what I believe to be a constructive suggestion to the Government. 
It is my belief that interest is a considerable factor in costs. If a manufacturer borrows money the interest which he pays forms part of his production costs. Obviously the selling price of his product is correspondingly higher. If a consumer borrows money to enable him to finance a purchase for which he cannot pay cash, obviously he has to pay more for the article than if he were able to pay cash. If he has to pay 10 per cent or 12 per cent interest then the ultimate price which he has to pay will be higher than if the interest charged were in the vicinity of 8 per cent. There are 2 main traditional sources of lending in Australia. 1 refer to the banks and to the finance companies, or fringe banking institutions. The current rate charged for a bank overdraft is in the vicinity of 81 per cent although the rate of interest charged by finance companies varies from 7 per cent to 8 per cent on new motor vehicles to as much as 11 per cent or 12 per cent on other consumer durables. 
Over the past 7 years the trend of lending has been moving away from the banks and towards the fringe banking institutions. The reason that I have taken a period of 7 years is that it is only since 30th rune 1964 that the Commonwealth Statistician has compiled detailed statistics on the finance companies. But let me prove what I have said about the trend of lending moving from the banks to the finance companies. Between 30th June 1964 and 30th June 1971 the amounts which were owed to trading banks at the end of the financial year has increased over that period by 103.7 per cent. During the same period the amount of loans outstanding to finance companies has increased by 159.8 per cent. Let me express this in another way: The amount of money owed to trading banks represented about 60 per cent of the total which was owed to banks and finance companies combined at 30th June 1964; 7 years later, at 30th June this year, the amount owed to banks bad fallen to only about 54 per cent of the total. 
I would like to remind the House that the amounts I am talking about do not exactly represent chicken feed. At 30th June 1964, the Australian people owed a total of $4,3 13m to banks and to finance companies. Of this amount the banks were owed S2,609.9m and the finance companies were owed $l,703.1m. At 30th June this year the total indebtedness had increased from $4,3 13m to $9,741. 6m, of which the banks were owed $5,3 1 6.8m and the finance companies were owed $4,424.8m. Honourable members can see that the movement of lending has definitely been from the banks towards the fringe banking institutions. This means that people are paying considerably more for goods for which they cannot afford to pay cash. It also means that many of the smaller manufacturers and the smaller builders who cannot be accommodated by banks have to borrow elsewhere at higher rates of interest. This also reacts to the detriment of the consumer. 1 would like to point out to the House that the trading banks are the major shareholders in many of the fringe banking institutions. My research has shown me that in the case of three of the major such institutions Australian banks own 100 per cent of the shares. In 3 other cases they own respectively 60 percent, 43 per cent and 42 per cent of the shares. In addition to this, overseas banks have substantial holdings in a number of finance organisations. This means, in effect, that in many cases where a person seeks to borrow money from his bank he cannot be accommodated at normal overdraft rates but he can be assisted if he is prepared to pay from 30 per cent to 50 per cent more for his money. The rate of interest which he is called upon to pay is, in many cases, dependent on the drawer from which the bank manager takes his loan application form. 
The reason I have raised this matter is that bank lending is largely controlled by the Government through the Reserve Bank of Australia and it exercises this power in a manner designed to assist the Australian economy. With this I am in complete agreement. But I understand that the Government has no control whatsoever over other than bank lending. I am suggesting that it ought to be seeking this power. If the Government believes that it has a duty to control the economy in the interests of the Australian people and, in the words of the Treasurer, to combat inflation, to slow it down and to halt it, again I am in complete agreement with that. I believe that the Government ought to seek powers which will enable it to control all of the lending which is made both by banks and by other financial institutions - not only a reducing percentage of it which at the present time is not much above  50  per cent. I believe that high interest rates operate mainly against the ordinary people of the community and these are the people whom we as a Government claim to represent. 
I now wish to turn to another matter which has been referred to during this Budget debate. I refer to immigration. I wish to join issue with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Moreton  (Mr Killen)  who said earlier this week:  1 think it is about high time that the Government . . . put the axe into the immigration programme. 
He went on to say: 
Growth for growth's sake is a spurious national goal. 
He stated that we should be seeking quality rather than quantity. With these statements I am in complete agreement but I do not agree with the arguments which he developed. Today it is fashionable to knock immigration, and the critics of our immigration policy point to the demands which the immigration programme makes on the economy and the additional amount of money which has to be spent on roads, schools, hospitals and sewerage systems because of the number of migrants which we as a government have brought to Australia. The critics conveniently either overlook or seek to minimise the importance of the contribution which migrants have made and are continuing to make to Australia's development. 
The latest information that I have been able to obtain indicates that whilst migrants represent only 18 per cent of the total population they provide more than  23  per cent of the work force. As to the demand for more schools - and  1  do not deny that many more are required - migrant children represent only a little more than 9 per cent of the school children population. If Australia has an education crisis I believe that it is a crisis created by prosperity and not by migrants. There is a demand for higher educational standards and it is a fact that children today stay at school much longer than did children of earlier generations.  1  believe that we in Australia might find it worth our while to examine the policies of some overseas countries which make much greater use of their school buildings by having  2  shifts per day instead of only one as we do. In this way they not only save a considerable amount of capital expenditure but also they get much greater value for the money which they spend on classrooms. 
The critics of Australia's immigration policy base most of their criticism on the demand for capital which they claim is aggravated by our intake of migrants. They claim that much of our capital resources are diverted from productive fields to nonproductive fields such as the building of roads, schools, hospitals and power installations, the provision of water supplies and so on. The critics ignore the fact that migrants themselves contribute a great deal to our supply of capital. Migrants are not paupers. Many of them bring capital with them into this country. They are also good savers and experience has shown that per head of population they invest more of their savings in home ownership than does the average Australian. They also contribute substantially to Australian revenue, both federal and State, because they pay both direct and indirect taxes. They also pay their local government rates as, of course, do all Australians. To the extent that migrants through their work contribute to the profits made by the companies which employ them they also contribute to the capital which is not paid out in dividends but which is ploughed back into the businesses, and the industries which they help to develop also attract overseas capital. 
Statistics show that migrant demands on social services are less than the Australian average. I would also point out that at a time when the primary producer is finding it extremely difficult to sell his products on overseas markets the migrant population contributes very substantially to the home market consumption. I have obtained some figures which were produced towards the end of last year. They show that migrants in Australia consume annually  70  million gallons of milk,  20  million lb of cheese,  55  million lb of butter,  525  million lb of meat, and  55  million eggs. In addition they consume a tremendous amount of fruit and vegetables. They must also be very big users of wool. I believe that those figures ought to be of interest to those who represent the primary producer. Without this contribution to local consumption 1 believe that primary producers would be in a much worse position than they are today. 
Whilst on the subject of migration I would like to say that 1 favour the portability of pensions with respect to migrants who wish to return to their native land, provided of course that proper safeguards could be worked out so that elderly people would not come to Australia merely to qualify for an age pension and then return to their own country after qualifying. Al the present time 10 years residence in Australia is necessary to qualify for the payment of the age pension and this is probably an adequate safeguard. However, if at some time in the future the residential qualifying period were reduced this safeguard would not be as effective as it is at present. 
I want to be fair to migrants but at the same time 1 do not want to recommend anything which could be unfair to Australian taxpayers. Migrants have pointed out to me that there could be a saving to revenue if we adopted this policy. If migrants who qualify for the payment of an age pension remained in Australia they would receive in addition to the pension all the fringe benefits which go with the pension. These fringe benefits have been estimated to be worth in the vicinity of $2 to $3 a week to each pensioner. To the extent that these fringe benefits could not be used by a person residing overseas this would be a saving to revenue. I understand that Canada permits the portability of pensions  but  there are very severe residential qualifications with respect to migrants who choose to return to their homelands. I understand this residential qualification varies from 25 years residence to 40 years residence. The United States also permits pensions to be paid to people in overseas countries. But comparisons with the practices in overseas countries are not valid because Australia's age pension scheme is non-contributory whereas in most if not all overseas countries the worker himself makes a contribution towards his retirement allowances or age pension. It is not possible to estimate how many people may seek to take advantage of legislation such as this, nor is it easy to estimate how much it would affect our balance of pay ments problem but 1 believe it is worthy of investigation and 1 support the idea in principle. 
In the few minutes remaining to me in this debate 1 would like to refer to a conference which I was privileged to attend as a representative of this Parliament. This conference was referred to earlier in this debate by the honourable member for Reid  (Mr Uren),  lt was a conference arranged by the Working Centre of the 11 provincial parliaments of the Federal Republic of Germany and the theme of the conference was 'The Environment'. The conference was attended by 70 to 80 delegates representing 23 countries including countries in Europe, Asia, North America, South America, the Middle East and Australia. The resolutions which were passed at this conference will be sent to a much larger conference which is to be held in Stockholm next year and is being organised by the United Nations. It is hoped that most of the member countries of the UN will bs in attendance at the conference. lt was made very clear at that conference that no country can live entirely to itself and that action taken in one country or on one continent can react on people who live in another country or on another continent, lt was pointed out that the world's population will double during the next 35 to 37 years and that if the present rate of population increase continues there will be one person to every square metre on the face of the earth in 150 years time. Perhaps this is not quite as bad as it sounds because we will, of course, have available multi-storey buildings. This increase in population to the extent I have mentioned will not affect us and it may not affect our children but 1 believe that the actions which our generation takes today will have a tremendous effect on the lives of future generations. 
The delegates at the conference were left in no doubt that the problem of pollution and the destruction of the environment is one which cannot be dealt with by one country in isolation and that laws relating to pollution, whether it be of the air, or of water, and to the destruction of the environment, have to be dealt with at international level. 
For example, what happens in international trade when one nation requires an industry to bear the cost of combating pollution and another does not? Where the products of both countries are sold on the international market obviously the advantage must lie with the polluter. One of the problems discussed at the conference was that of non-degradable containers such as bottles, aluminium cans and plastic containers. People who travel extensively around Australia are appalled to see the extent to which the country is littered with these containers. Sooner or later, and the sooner the better, Australia will have to face up to this problem. Some countries and cities have already done so. I understand that the suburb of Bowie in Maryland introduced a law, effective from 1st April this year, which provides a fine of $100 for any store convicted of selling non-returnable containers. A bank in Pittsfield offered lc for non-degradable containers brought in by Boy Scouts. I believe it cost the bank about $1.2m. 
I present the following petition: 
To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of. Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: 
That Lake Pedder, situated in the Lake Pedder National Park in South-West Tasmania, is threatened with inundation as part of the Gordon River hydro-electric power scheme. 
That an alternative scheme exists, which if implemented would avoid inundation of this lake. 
That Lake Pedder and the surrounding wilderness area is of such beauty and scientific interest as to be of a value beyond monetary consideration. 
And that some unique species of flora and fauna will be in danger of extinction if this area is inundated. 
Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government take immediate steps to act on behalf of all Australian people to preserve Lake Pedder in its natural state. All present and particularly future Australians will . benefit by being able to escape from their usual environment to rebuild their physical and mental strength in this unspoilt wilderness area. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

An expression which has become popular in recent months is 'the quality of life'. People are becoming more conscious of the fact that civilisation is gradually destroying the environment, which it inherited, thereby impairing the quality of life. As population increases green fields and trees are destroyed to allow the building of roads and apartments. As people become more prosperous more and more motor vehicles use these roads and help to pollute the air. It has been estimated that motor vehicles cause 60 per cent of the air pollution. So, indirectly countries which manufacture and export motor vehicles contribute to air pollution in other countries. This is only one way in which actions which take place in one country cause or contribute to pollution in other countries. It is on record that Scandinavian countries have suffered from acid rain and black snow caused by industrial pollution from the factories of England and of the Ruhr. I have read of the pollution of the Sargasso Sea by oil brought by the currents from all corners of the Atlantic. Our own seas around Australia are contaminated by the discharge of oil and rubbish by ships owned in other countries. 
The use of DDT as a pest control can have very detrimental effects on countries distant from that in which it is used. Hydrocarbons like DDT can have secondary effects of a cumulative nature. Birds can feed on insects killed by this type of product and be themselves poisoned. The use of DDT has affected migratory birds. It has been found in penguins in the Antarctic. It has caused one species of bird to lay soft-shelled eggs. This, of course, could lead to the elimination of the species as the eggs would be squashed before hatching. Currently there is a difference of opinion between scientists in New South Wales and Victoria about the wisdom of using Lindane to fight a threatened locust plague. I am not qualified to express an opinion on this subject one way or the other but I do believe that where the slightest degree of doubt exists proper investigation ought to be carried out before we use a product which may destroy bird life and which while destroying one pest may assist others to multiply because birds - their natural enemies - will be eliminated. 1 believe 1 have said enough to indicate that environmental hazards can and do transcend international boundaries. But fortunately the governments of a great many countries in the world are aware of the seriousness of the problem and many of them, including Australia, have already established departments and ministries concerned with the environment. I believe that there is legislation pending in the United 
States of America which will require motor car manufacturers to reduce by 197S the pollution which is caused by motor vehicles by 90 per cent and at the same time to endeavour to find an alternative to the internal combustion engine with not less than equal efficiency. During the Budget debate I mentioned that one city in the United States had already introduced legislation which provides for a fine of Si 00 for any retailer selling a non-returnable container. Some housewives in the United States have formed themselves into an association to inform their members of the effects on the environment of different types of products on the market. 
Earlier this year I was privileged to attend a conference on the environment which was held in Bonn in West Germany. The conference at which about 25 countries were represented made a number of recommendations which are to be sent to a much larger conference which is to take place in -Stockholm next year in the hope that, they will be endorsed and implemented. Some, if not all of these recommendations should be of interest to members of this Parliament. In the time left to me I would like to refer to what I believe to be some of the more important of these recommendations. It was recommended that governments should begin international negotiations to establish appropriate systems for strict pollution controls over products which enter into international commerce and which are sold on the markets of the world. It was recommended that international treaties should be examined to ascertain their impact on the environment and that parliaments of the world should be advised of the potential environmental effects of those treaties. It was recommended that there should be a total prohibition on the dumping of oil and toxic wastes at sea and that strict regulations ought to be promulgated relating to the dumping of other wastes at sea. 
It was recommended that tests should be conducted to ascertain the effect on the environment of non-degradable and toxic components and that the results of these tests should be published. It was recommended that there should be established a world network of protected areas and that international agreements should be made with respect to endangered species. It was recommended that approval for the international transport of hazardous substances should be refused unless these substances were accompanied by instructions as to the measures to be taken in cases of danger or accident. It was further recommended that all nations be required to ratify conventions relating to civil liberty for oil pollution damage and that provision should be made for adequate compensation to be paid in such cases. 
It was recommended also that the United Nations Organisation should sponsor international environmental programmes and that an international pollution data bank should be established and that the function of this bank should be to collect information and to make it available to all countries. These are just some of the resolutions which were passed by countries represented at the Bonn conference and I believe that all of these resolutions will meet with the approval of most honourable members of this Parliament and of other parliaments of the world. I believe that we in this Parliament should already be thinking along these lines and already doing much more than we are doing at present to combat both pollution and the destruction of the environment whilst we still have time on our side. 
I present the following petition: 
To the Honourable, the  Speaker,  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of Victoria, respectfully showeth: 
Australian, custodians of the world's largest _ marsupial, the red kangaroo, have allowed it tobe reduced so low numerically that even CSIRO research has had to to be suspended in some areas and alternative means of research employed In others. 
The kangaroo is being exploited whilst facts on population and numbers of kangaroos are unknown - any day the numbers can be reduced below that level needed for survival of droughts and natural mortality. At this date neither the number needed for survival nor the number of kangaroos left is known. 
Pending the outcome of investigations by the Select Committee, it can be logically assumed that shooters, fearing restrictive legislation in the future, will intensify their efforts to obtain as many animals as possible, while they can. We, your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that you will: 
Immediately ban the export of products made from kangaroos. 
Strongly urge the State Governments to ban the shooting of kangaroos for commercial purposes, at least until the Select Committee has made its investigations and recommendations. 
Add to the Constitution a clause giving power to the Commonwealth Government to act to safeguard any species of wildlife thatis endangered through any cause. And we your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. 
Petition received. 
It is obvious that there are great divisions within the Opposition over its immigration policy. It is equally obvious from the speech made tonight by the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly)  that the Opposition is trying to play down these divisions and the reasons for them. Only recently the honourable member for Grayndler was sacked by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  from the position- of shadow Minister for Immigration but tonight he carried the torch for his leader. I shall leave it to my colleagues to deal in detail with the divisions which exist within the ranks of the Opposition with respect to its policy and the reasons for them. Later on I intend to refer to 2 statements made by the Leader of the Opposition when he addressed the members of the Perth Press Club last Sunday. 
During the very short time at my disposal I want to speak in support of immigration. As I said during the debate on the Budget it has become fashionable, for some reason, to knock immigration. The knockers go on. Earlier this week the Government announced a deferment of the arrival of 3,000 migrant workers and their families in order to assist some of those who are currently registered for employment to obtain jobs which the Government believes may otherwise be taken by migrants. I believe that this announcement was well received but I am not personally convinced that it will achieve what is hoped or expected that it will achieve. I am yet to be convinced that immigration contributes either to unemployment or to inflation. I have never believed it. I asked the Legislative Research Service of the Parliamentary Library to obtain certain information for me. I sought 3 tables of statistics relating to 6 selected countries and to the subjects of the annual rate of increase of the consumer price index, the percentage of the work force unemployed and the net long term immigration as a percentage of mid-year population for each *&gt;f those countries. 
The countries which I chose were Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. I could have selected any other 5 countries to make a comparison with Australia but I chose Canada and New Zealand as countries of immigration, Japan and the United Kingdom as countries of intense manufacturing industry and as countries which have not increased their population through migration, and I chose the United States of America both as  a  highly intensive manufacturing country and as a country which still attracts migrants in reasonable numbers. The Legislative Research Service provided figures for me for the years between 1964 and 1971. The tables are extremely interesting and I seek leave to incorporate them in Hansard. 
The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN- Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The documents read as follows) 

<graphic href="074131197110283_97_9.jpg"></graphic>

 I thank the Opposition for that courtesy. These figures show that, in spite of the criticism levelled at the Government with respect to inflation and the average rate of annual increase in the consumer price index between 1964 and 1970  -  they were the latest figures for which the Library Research Service was able to make a comparison - they are lower in Australia than in any of the other 5 countries I have mentioned, and appreciably lower in many cases. The table shows that for the year 1970 only in Canada was the increase in the consumer price index lower than in Australia. As a matter of interest, the increases were: Canada 3.4 per cent, Australia 3.9 per cent, United States 5.9 per cent, the United Kingdom 6.4 per cent, New Zealand 6.6 per cent and Japan 7.7 per cent. The table relating to the percentage of the work force unemployed, which covers all of the countries except New Zealand, for which no percentages were available, shows that in every year between 1964 and 1971 only Japan had a lower percentage of unemployed than Australia. 
The figures for this year show that the percentage of the work force registered for employment in the 5 countries are: Japan 1.3 per cent, Australia 1.7 per cent, United Kingdom 3.1 per cent, United States of America 6.2 per cent and Canada 7.1 per cent. So only Japan has a better record with respect to employment and only Canada has currently a better record with respect to inflation. Let me turn to the table relating to migration. The interesting thing is that in each of the years between 1966 and 1969  -  these were the only years for which the Library research service was able to provide comparative figures - Australia's intake of migrants as a percentage of the population was higher than that of the other 5 countries with the exception of Canada in the years 1966 and 1967. In 1969, the last year for which comparative figures are available, the respective figures for the percentage by which migration added to the population figures at mid-year are: Australia 1.14 per cent, Canada 0.77 per cent and the United States of America 0.2 per cent. No figures are available for Japan, New Zealand or the United Kingdom, but the last year for which figures are available for those countries indicate that they showed a net migration loss. Surely those statistics indicate that we should be looking elsewhere than to immigration to find the reasons for the present rate of inflation and increasing unemployment. 
I believe that our immigration programme has been made the scapegoat for changing economic conditions which have affected countries other than Australia. In fact, statistics show that Australia, which has the highest percentage of migration intake, has managed to combat the problems of inflation and unemployment far better than countries which have either no immigration intake or a lesser one than Australia. It is conceded by economists that inflation is caused either by demandpull or cost-push, to use 2 terms which are fashionable at present. I ask: How can 18 per cent of the community which provides 23 per cent of the work force be blamed for either of those types of inflation? I am not attempting to deny that Australia is suffering from too great a rate of inflation. But in my opinion immigration is not to blame. 
Every migrant has to be fed, clothed and housed. To this extent he must help to reduce unemployment. With respect to a capital demand for houses, schools, transport facilities and so on, his requirements are no greater than those caused by a natural population increase, but he brings with him a capital inflow that a natural increase cannot bring. Because migrants constitute a higher percentage of the work force relative to their total population than does the rest of the community they contribute substantially to taxation revenue and help to spread public expenditure on certain items - for example, defence - over a larger number of taxpayers. By contributing to the expansion of local markets they must surely reduce costs because of the economies associated with larger scale production. Because migrants contribute to expanding Australian production they encourage foreign investment and by their savings, which are higher than the average, they contribute substantially to domestic capital. Besides contributing new skills and techniques they provide a flexible and mobile work force. 
I said earlier that I wanted to refer to 2 statements made by the Leader of the 
Opposition when he addressed the Perth Press Club only last Sunday on the subject of Labor's approach to immigration. Referring to the impact which migrants who have come to Australia under the Government's immigration policy have, he said: 
The pressure on schools and hospitals and all the services provided by. State and municipal authorities in the cities where overwhelmingly migrants have settled has become starkly apparent 
In other words, he said that Australia's current policy with respect to migration was contributing substantially to inflationary pressures. That is the policy which has resulted in migrants, who comprise 18 per cent of the total population, providing 23 per cent of the work force. The alternative policy of the Australian Labor Party can be discerned from the statement of the Leader of the Opposition in which he said: 
The Government's chief role should lie in the assistance not the search for migrants. 
I believe that if the Government is concerned with fighting inflation - the Leader of the Opposition has on many occasions also expressed his concern about inflation - its chief role should be to search for skilled migrants who can contribute to our technical knowledge and who can, because they represent a higher percentage of the work force than the overall Australian population, help to reduce costs by producing more than they consume. Labor's policy, as stated by the Leader of the Opposition, could not possibly achieve this end if a Labor government's role would be to provide assisted passages for the relatives of people already resident in Australia without regard to the degree of skill they possess. 
I present the following petition. 
To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of Victoria, respectfully sheweth: 
The Red Kangaroo, largest marsupial in the world, has through shooting for commerce become extinct or rare in many areas of Australia where it was once prolific. 
All scientific evidence points to this decimation of numbers, which is clear evidence that State Governments are unable to control commercial shooting within their boundaries. 
We, the people of Australia, feel strong repugnance to the fact that industries should be allowed to operate, which in the past have decimated the koala to extinction over vast areas of this land, and which have now similarly exploited the kangaroo. We feel that the taxpayer should not have the heavy burden of having to pay for the control of an industry which benefits but a few people in this country, and that live kangaroos through their value as tourist attractions are economically far more profitable to our economy and to us aesthetically. 
We your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that you will: 
Immediately ban the export of products made from kangaroos. 
Strongly insist that State Governments prohibit the commercial shooting of kangaroos. 
Enact legislation to give the Commonwealth Government control of all native wildlife throughout Australia. 
And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. 
Petition received.

To the Honourable  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the State of Victoria, respectfully sheweth: 
That because of uncontrolled shooting for commercial purposes, the population of kangaroos, particularly the big red species, is now so low that they may become extinct. 
There are insufficient wardens in any State of the Commonwealth to detect or apprehend those who break the inadequate laws which exist. 
As a tourist attraction, the kangaroo is a permanent source of revenue to this country. 
It is an indisputable fact that no species can withstand hunting on such a scale, when there is no provision being made for its future. 
We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray, that: 
The export of kangaroo products be banned immediately, and the Commonwealth Government take the necessary steps to have all wildlife in Australia brought under its control. 
Only a complete cessation of killing for commercial purposes can save surviving kangaroos. 
And your petitioners, therefore, as in duty bound, will ever pray. 
Petition received.

I ask the Treasurer: ls he aware that there is a strong body of medical opinion which suggests that there is a relationship between cigarette smoking and the incidence of lung cancer and heart disease, the major cause of these diseases being considered to be the tar content of cigarettes? In an endeavour to persuade manufacturers to produce cigarettes with a lower tar content, will the Treasurer consider providing a sliding scale of excise duties so that those brands which have the lowest tar content will attract the lowest rates of duty? If the answer is in the affirmative, will he take into consideration both the gain to revenue from excise duty on cigarettes and the cost to the taxpayer of providing medical treatment and hospialisation for sufferers from heart disease and lung cancer?

I preface my question, which I direct to the Minister for the Interior, by saying that one can frequently see motorists, particularly at night time, taking some of their attention from the road because they are looking for street names and house numbers. I ask the Minister whether, as a contribution to road safety and as an example to the States, he will consider introducing legislation to make it compulsory for street names and house numbers to be prominently displayed in luminous paint?

I direct my question to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer noted the response in a number of newspapers yesterday to an address he gave in Sydney on Monday night? The Press emphasised the consideration that was being given to an apparent change in the income tax laws whereby individual income earners in a family would have their incomes combined for tax purposes so that they would be taxed on a family unit basis. I ask the Treasurer whether the course of action is in fact proposed by the Government? 
During my absence last Tuesday afternoon the  Deputy  Whip arranged for a pair for the honourable member for Gellibrand  (Mr Mclvor).  I was here during the evening when the vote was taken. At that time the honourable member for Angas  (Mr Giles)  had left the chamber because he intended to abstain from voting. I was not aware of the arrangement made with the honourable member for Gellibrand. On checking the pairs later I found that although we had promised a pair, no pair was available because the honourable member who had been paired with the honourable member for Gellibrand had inadvertently voted. As I had a spare name on the paper I suggested to the honourable member for Angas that he might agree to pair with the honourable member for Gellibrand. He was reluctant to do so and agreed only to keep faith with the honourable member for Gellibrand. He had never at any time applied for a pair and no such arrangements were made. This morning I discussed this matter with the honourable member for Sturt  (Mr Foster)  and the Opposition Whip. In the Whip's office I telephoned the honourable member for Gellibrand and explained the circumstances. I said that it had been our intention simply not to let him down, and if he were happy about it I would suggest to the Opposition Whip and to the honourable member for Sturt that the weekly Hansard be altered. Those were the circumstances. 

 Sir WINTON TURNBULL (Mallee)Mr  Speaker- 
 I wish to direct a question to the Prime Minister. I preface my question by saying that last night the Minister for Defence tabled a paper and made a statement on defence. The paper is long and complex, but it indicates clearly the deep and profound differences between the policies of the Government and the Opposition. Can the Prime Minister indicate how these differences can be emphasised so that there will be no misunderstanding as to the nature of them? 
Will the Prime Minister let the House know the Government's attitude to foreign ownership of the shares of Ansett Transport Industries Ltd in the light of the present bid by Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd to take over that company? 
I direct to the Minister for Labour and National Service a question which is supplementary to the one asked by the honourable member for Ballaarat. Is the Minister aware that the last report of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd records that during the last financial year the number of man hours lost at the com pany's various plants due to employees being on strike or being laid off because of strikes by others totalled approximately 1,600,000, which is the equivalent of the number of hours that 800 men employed full time would work in a year? Is he also aware that the same report shows that industrial disputes involving sea-going personnel and waterfront labour resulted in the loss of 587 ship days - the equivalent of the number of days lost by  li  ships being out of service for 1 year? Would these staggering losses of working time caused by strikes not contribute substantially to BHP's costs and consequently to its recent increases in prices? 
I wish to direct a question to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is no doubt aware that members of the Jewish community in Syria are being subjected to persecution, including deprivation of human rights. He is also no doubt aware that various protests have been made against this state of affairs and that endeavours have been made to alleviate the great suffering of Syrian Jewry. I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make suitable representations through appropriate diplomatic channels and the United Nations Organisation to alleviate the desperate plight of Jewish people in Syria and ensure for them the preservation of their human rights. 
I ask the Prime Minister: Does he know whether there is any substance in the matter which was raised in the Senate and in this House last night and reported in the Press today concerning the Minister for Housing? 
I direct a question to the Minister for Social Services. I preface my question by referring to a suggestion which has been made by a number of organisations, including I believe the Australian Council for Social Services and various church  bodies, that the Government should implement a public inquiry into poverty and social conditions in Australia. Can the Minister say whether the Government proposes to hold such an inquiry? 
I direct a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the Paris peace talks. When did these talks commence? How many meetings have been held? What have they achieved, and can any useful purpose be served by continuing them? 
I thank the House for , . indulgence. I accept what the honourable member for Newcastle  (Mr Charles Jones)  said, namely, that his objection was not on personal grounds. I have attended every meeting of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation. That Committee was appointed to do a particular job which every member of the Committee believes should be completed during the life of this Parliament. We are aiming to do so. I believe, and this can be verified, that my attendance at the meetings of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory over a long period of time is probably better than that of any other member of the Committee. 
I cannot be in  2  places at once but I am aware that when select committees are appointed, initially advertisements inviting submissions are published and as wide an opportunity as possible is given for interested parties to submit evidence to the Committee. I know that '.his takes a reasonable amount of time. I will not be overseas for such a great time. The conference on the environment, I believe, will assist me in connection with the Wildlife Conservation Committee. I am not 
Mandrake but I like hard work and I believe that 1 am capable of doing it. I think that I can meet my commitments. My history on any committee in which I have been involved indicates this. 
I have no wish to cover the ground which was very adequately and effectively covered by the first  speaker  for the Government, the honourable member for Isaacs  (Mr Hamer).  He showed clearly that smoking is a major health hazard and that most of the responsible health organisations of the world support that view. It is a fact that most advanced countries have already either placed a complete ban on radio and television advertising of cigarettes or have severely restricted such advertising. I speak tonight only to emphasise my complete support for the legislation and in doing so I do not delude myself into believing that the Bill will greatly influence, if it influences at all, confirmed smokers and cause them to changes habits which they have developed over a long period of time. However, if the legislation can be responsible for convincing young people that smoking is a health hazard and that they should not smoke, it -will be well worth while. I agree that no-one can claim with certainty that smoking causes either heart disease or lung cancer but there is an abundance of expert medical opinion and statistics to indicate that smokers are much more susceptible to and much more likely to contract these diseases than are non-smokers. 
The latest figures which I was able to obtain from the Legislative Research Section of the Parliamentary Library are figures put out by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics. They show that in 1970 nearly 40,000 Australians died from heart disease and 3,244 from lung cancer. It is generally conceded that anythink which can be done to reduce these figures should be done by any responsible government. I believe it is a fact that heart disease in 1970 accounted for 30 per cent of all deaths in Australia and these figures are steadily rising. I believe also that heart disease is the biggest single cause of deaths in Australia and that the Australian figures are typical of most developed countries. Quite a lot of arguments have been advanced on medical and ethical grounds but we are concerned here with the raising and spending of revenue. The pure economic arguments which should influence members of Parliament are all in favour of banning cigarette advertising on radio and television. Let us look at figures in relation to this. There is a tremendous amount of time lost through absenteeism and hospitalisation 01 those who have contracted illnesses caused by smoking. This is tied up with a tremendous loss in wages, a consequential loss of production and loss to the gross national product. To the cost to the community of hospitalisation we can add the cost of paying widows' pensions to a great many women much earlier than they would have received them had their husbands not died of heart disease or lung cancer attributable in a very large measure to smoking. To those items we can add the loss of revenue from taxation because of reduced earnings. 
For all these losses the taxpayer foots the bill. At present he pays nearly SO per cent of the cost of advertising by cigarette manufacturers because advertising is a legitimate business expense and company tax being at present 47i per cent means that revenue forfeits nearly SO per cent of the cost of company advertising on smoking. In addition this money which could be used for paying greatly increased rates of social service benefits to deserving people helps to create more candidates for hospitalisation, more candidates for invalid pensions who produce less and consequently contribute less to revenue. So it is a vicious circle and the economic arguments are in favour of this ban or restriction on radio and television advertising. Some people have asked why the Government has singled out radio and television advertising. I believe there are 2 main reasons. The first is that the Federal Government exercises complete control over advertising on radio and television but it has limited control over advertising through other media. The most important reason in my opinion is that this legislation is designed to assist young people to decide against smoking. Of advertising in all the media, television advertising creates the greatest impression on children and adolescents. When television advertisements are glamorous, as they are now, young people are much more attracted to the product being advertised than they are by advertisements in newspapers or magazines. For the reasons I have given I support the Bill. In conclusion I am authorised to say on behalf of the Government that the Government is not prepared to accept the Opposition's amendment. 
There has been a tendency over recent years for foreign affairs debates to be dominated by discussion of the war in Vietnam. I would like to refer to that matter later. One could be forgiven for believing that Vietnam was the only trouble spot in the world. It is certainly nearer to Australia than are quite a lot of other areas of trouble. But we would have cause for optimism if it were the only area in the world in which peace did not prevail. This is far from being the position. For example, the question in the Middle East is far from being resolved. I think everyone would agree that the position in Ireland also is far from being resolved. We have problem areas on the continent of Africa and in the Indian area. I do not believe that things are as good in Europe as all of us would like to think they are. Also, South America rarely is free from strife of some kind. 
It could be that some of the countries which are involved in disputes around the world are merely pawns in a power game which is being played by some of the greater powers. But whatever way we in Australia look at the world picture we are left with only 2 alternatives. We cannot sit on a fence and we cannot have a bob each way. There are 2 great philosophies in the world today, and these are democracy and communism. I think that we have to make up our minds, as do other countries, as to whether we are on the side of democracies or on the side of communist countries. 
Whether Russian or Chinese communism prevails, the result will be the same - that is communism. I have a very good friend in Melbourne who is an anti-communist Russian. He has often said to me that there is no point in Australians drawing any consolation or comfort from the serious differences of opinion which exist between Russia and China. He said that they are arguing only about who is going to be boss and, whichever one wins, the result will be communism. If it is our desire to follow the democratic way of life I believe it is essential that Western democracies be united, and I include in that category Great Britain, the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and those European and Asian countries which want democracy. I think it is essential for these countries to stand together. I believe also that democracy requires a strong South Africa. In mentioning those countries, I do not mean to imply that we in Australia fully endorse all of their internal policies. But I do believe that the old adage that unity is strength still prevails. I believe that this phrase still is as true today as it was when it was first coined. 
However much Australia might like to do so, it cannot stand on its own feet. We have to be realistic about this. We cannot have the best of both worlds. We have to make up our minds about which philosophy we support - democracy or communism. We have the right to choose for ourselves, just as every other country should have the right to choose for themselves the type of government which we want. But the Australian Labor Party apparently does not believe in this right because it is prepared to deny to the people of South Vietnam the right to choose their own form of government. The Australian Labor Party says that Vietnam is one country. I may be wrong, but I believe that this attitude is inconsistent with that adopted by the Labor Party in regard to Bangladesh because until the people of that country broke away - and I believe they were quite entitled to do so - they formed a part of one country, the country of Pakistan. Why does the Australian Labor Party deny to the people of South Vietnam the freedom of choice which it has endorsed for the people of Bangladesh? 
Since the end of World War II the United States has carried the burden of the free world. It has contributed tremendous amounts of money to put the defeated nations of World War II back on to their feet and also to help raise the standards of living of poorer countries. But the United States has received no thanks for this. Not only has it received no thanks for the vast amount of money that has been provided by its taxpayers, but on the contrary it has been abused and reviled for this assistance. 
There are a great many young Australians who damage United States consulates and business premises. They shout and print the slogan: 'Go home Yank*. I do not deny the right of people to protest provided that in doing so they do not deny other people the freedom which they demand for themselves, and provided they protest without senselessly damaging property belonging to other people. I think it is obvious that young Australian who shout 'Go home Yank' have not stopped to think that most of them would not  be  here today if the United States had not come to Australia's assistance during World War II. So much for gratitude. Only a few weeks ago we commemorated the Battle of the Coral Sea. It was that battle, for which the United States paid in . ships, men and human suffering, that saved Australia from invasion. The young protesters ought to go down on their knees and thank God for what America did for Australia during World War II instead of behaving in the thoughtless and thankless way in which they do. 
I believe that it has been due to the United States, and the United States alone, that many countries of the free world have not fallen under communist control. My advice to those who believe that communism is worthy of a trial is for them to go and live in a communist country. I have talked to far too many migrants who have fled from communist countries to have any illusions about those  countries  being a workers' paradise. Workers and strikers in communist countries do not get away with what they do in Australia. 
I am interested to hear what my honourable friend said. A migrant in Melbourne told me about strikes which were held in his former country. He said: They have a way of ending strikes in the country from which I come. They take the man who began it down to the village square and hang him". It is very easy to be a knocker, and the United States has far too many knockers. What hope would the rest of the free world have in containing communism without the United States? Europe is not united. There are some trade organisations in existence but a great deal of enthusiasm is not shown in regard to uniting for defence. I know that also there are one or two defence treaties and one or two defence organisations. But I believe that without American aid their value is open to question. Trade organisations and agreements are well enough but without security there cannot be any trade. 
I would like to turn to Vietnam. The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  has accused the United States of escalating the war in Vietnam. I believe that it is doing the very opposite. The Leader of the Opposition has not denied that Russia is the chief source of war materials that are going into North Vietnam. The sole purpose of the Haiphong blockade is to shut off supplies of war materials to North Vietnam with the object of shortening the war and saving lives. The United States has laid down 2 conditions for complete withdrawal of all of its forces in Vietnam. The first is the return of United States prisoners of war. The second is the implementation of an internationally supervised cease fire. I ask whether the Leader of the Opposition considers that either or both of these proposals are unreasonable? If he does, would he be good enough to say which is unreasonable and why he holds that belief? On the other hand, I am not aware of Russia having made any offer whatsoever. If the Leader of the Opposition is aware of Russia having made any undertaking with respect to a cease fire in Vietnam, he should say so. 
The Leader of the Opposition should say unequivocally in this House where he stands with regard to recent statements which were made by the left wing controlled executive of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria. I am referring to the statements which were made by this body in support of the recent invasion of South Vietnam by North Vietnamese forces. Those statements expressed support for an ultimate military victory by the North Viet namese forces. The Leader of the Opposition is reported in the Press as having been disturbed and politically embarrassed by these statements. I have no doubt that this is true and that he has been embarrassed. But he should tell the House where he stands as the leader of the alternative government in this country. In the past he has criticised the Prime Minister for making policy statements outside the House. But the Australian public, and in particular the Australian voters, are entitled to know where he stands on all of these issues. Noone in his right mind could seriously accuse the West of having territorial ambitions because history records that since the end of World War II both the United Kingdom and the United States have been giving independence to their former colonies. On the other hand, . Russia, which frequently has accused the West of colonialism, has taken away the freedom which previously was enjoyed by independent countries. I name only some of them - Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. I believe that the people of every country should be free to choose the form of government that they wish, free from outside influence, in elections where any party has the opportunity and right to stand candidates; where any individual has the opportunity to offer himself as a candidate, if he wishes to do so; and where people have the right, by means of a secret ballot, to vote as they please. They do not have this right in communist countries; migrants who have come here from Iron Curtain countries will testify to this. 
I think it is time that the Australian Labor Party made it quite clear where it stands. If Australia were threatened in the future and if, by some mischance, a Labor government happened to be in power, I am quite sure that it would turn to the United States for assistance, just as it did, and rightly so, during the last war. Yet the Opposition equivocates about giving the United States free and unfettered use of bases in Australia - bases that are necessary and vital. These are not wanted to enable it to make war or to attack anyone, but are needed as essential parts of an effective defence system. How can any self-respecting Australian say to the United States: 'We hope you will always be ready to come to our assistance when we need you, but please do not expect any help from us because our policy is isolationism'. Where are the left wing spokesmen of the Australian Labor Party who are usually very vocal in debates on foreign affairs? Why are their names not listed to speak today? The Australian voters are entitled to know, before they cast their votes in what I believe will be one of the most important elections in our history - an election in which defence and foreign policy must be a major issue - where the Government and the Opposition stand on these matters. The Liberal-Country Party Government will not sit on the fence. Where does the Australian Labor Party stand? 
My question, which I direct to the Postmaster-General, relates to the black ban which has been placed by the Professional Radio Employees Institute on the broadcasting and telecasting of the Olympic Games which are to begin in Munich on 26th August 1972 and to finish on 1 0th September 1972. The Minister was reported earlier this week as stating that he had no reliable information on the situation but that he would make immediate inquiries. I ask the Minister: Has he completed his inquiries and, if he has, will he inform the House why the ban has been placed on the broadcasting and televising of the Games? Will he also say why it has been placed at this particular time when the real sufferers will be the public who are the real victims of most industrial strife? Finally, will the Minister say what his Department can do to see that people who pay broadcasting and television licence fees are not denied the right to hear direct broadcasts and to view direct telecasts of the Munich Games? 
I ask the Minister for Immigration: Has the Government reached any decision on the question of accepting some Asians from Uganda? 
My question, relates to the proposed inquiry into poverty in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister: When will he be able to provide further information relating to this inquiry, such as who is to head it and what its terms of reference will be? 
When the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  spoke in the Budget debate last Tuesday evening he did not have one good word to say about the Budget. He levelled many charges against the Government. He made many criticisms of the Government and that is fair enough, because he is quite entitled to criticise, but the public are equally entitled to know the facts and they should not accept his criticisms at face value. The Leader of the Opposition criticised inflation, unemployment, social service benefits, taxation reductions and Australia's growth rate. I would like to examine some of those criticisms to see just how valid they are. 
No-one likes inflation and I would like to see it at a lower rate but I would not like anyone to run away with the idea that 
Australia is the only country which is suffering from inflation. Inflation is affecting most countries. The latest issue of the monthly review of business statistics put out by the Bureau of Census and Statistics includes a table which lists the changes in the consumer price index for 22 countries including Australia. The table takes 1963 as the base year. It shows that of the 21 other countries listed 3 had marginally better rates of inflation than Australia. Two other countries - West Malaysia and Singapore - had much better rates than Australia and 16 other countries had higher rates. In those 16 were the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Switzerland. I do not believe that Labor's policies are designed to reduce inflation rates. Labor wants shorter hours, longer holidays and higher pay. 
The honourable member for Wills agrees, but Labor does not have any regard to increased production. Shorter hours and higher pay without increased production must result in higher prices. The Opposition stands for a 35-hour week. It has been estimated that the cost of introducing a 35-hour week without increased production would be from$2, 500m a year to $3,000m a year. Honourable members may be interested to learn that industrial stoppages to the end of May this year, according to figures supplied by the Department of Labour and National Service, caused a loss of more than 2½ million working days and a loss to workers of nearly $38m in wages. Surely these factors must add to inflation. The last annual report of Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd showed that industrial stoppages had cost the company enough money to pay 800 men full time for one year. On the waterfront the time lost through stoppages was equivalent to that required to keep one ship in operation for 1½ years. I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party can avoid taking a very large share of the responsibility for whatever inflation we have in Australia. 
Let us have a look at what the Leader of the Opposition had to say about unemployment. Presently it is running at about 2 per cent of the work force. The Leader of the Opposition says that that is too high and I agree, but not many years ago the Australian Labor Party spokesman on these matters accepted  5  per cent unemployment as being virtually full employment. Personally, I would like to see that every person who wants a job and is capable of taking a job is in employment, but other things have to be considered in regard to unemployment. Bad as the unemployment rate of  2  per cent is, it is one of the lowest rates in the world. For example, it is better than the unemployment rates at present in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Italy. At present about  100,000  people are registered for employment. That figure includes married women whose husbands are in employment, but I do not know the number of married women included in the number registered for employment. However, I do know that the  1947  census showed that  8  per cent of married women were in the work force. The  1972  census showed that  35.2  per cent of married women are in the work force so I think it is fair to assume that a substantial number of registrants for employment are married women whose husbands are working. 
We are entitled to ask ourselves why these people are out of work. As I said earlier,  1  do not believe that the Labor Party is blameless in this matter. The industrial stoppages to which I have referred affect the employment not only of the people directly involved but also the employees in the servicing industries. Strikes cost a great many people their jobs. The Leader of the Opposition has said that  2  per cent unemployment and  100,000  registrants for employment are too high. That is so, but evidently the honourable gentleman is prepared to risk a much higher rate of unemployment than  2  per cent. I say that because of what he has said about tariff rates. He said that generally speaking the tariff rates are too high. Everyone knows that high tariff rates are designed to protect the jobs of Australian workmen. The Leader of the Opposition is against protect the jobs of Australian workmen against imports. The Leader of the Opposition has had thrown at him quite a lot his view that the Australian dollar is under valued and ought to be revalued upwards. As has been pointed out by a great many of my colleagues, if the dollar were revalued upwards it would make it much harder to export our primary products and manufactured goods. It would make much easier the entry of imports into Australia. This would threaten the jobs of many Australian workers and they should take notice of that possibility. The employment position has one positive aspect. There are more people in jobs in Australia than ever before. A higher percentage of the population of working age is in the work force. But let me return to consider unemployment. 
1  am told that that is a good idea and I am glad to hear it. The Labor Party expresses concern for unemployment and showed its concern when last in office by paying an unemployed man with a wife and  4  children  $5  a week unemployment benefit. That was a long time ago. If we increased that rate in accordance with changes in the consumer price index the same man would now receive  $13.70  a week unemployment benefit. But what unemployment benefit does the Government pay? The Government pays to an unemployed man with a wife and  4  children unemployment benefit of  $43  a week. 
The sentiments of the Labor Party in regard to social welfare and unemployment benefit would ring much more truly if it practised what it preached. Actions speak louder than words. I have detailed what Labor did when in office and that is what is important, not what it talks about doing while it is in opposition. Members of the Labor Party speak with  2  voices. The Leader of the Opposition has criticised what this Government is doing in the field of social services. He is very much more vulnerable on this subject than on any other subject. He has criticised the recent increases in pension rates and has said that they are not enough, although pension rates have been increased twice in the last  6  months. While in the last  12  months the consumer price index has moved upwards by  6.14  per cent, this Government has increased the single pension rate by  15.94  per cent and the married pension rate by  13.11  per cent. The Leader of the Opposition in referring to these increases in basic rates glossed over many other benefits. These increased rates represent only a very small part of the story of what the Government has done in this Budget for the less fortunate people in the community. 
In case many people do not realise this, when the Budget measures have been passed there will not be a single pensioner in Australia who is entirely reliant on his pension and has to pay rent who will receive less than $24 a week. No married couple who now become eligible for a rent subsidy and who are entirely dependent upon *heir pensions will receive less than $38.50 a week. When the Australian Labor Party was last in office a single pensioner lost his entitlement to receive anything at all when his income reached $6 a week. He also lost his entitlement to a pension if his property had a value of $1,500. That figure completely disqualified him. But today, under this Liberal-Country Party Government, a single pensioner can own his own home and have $10,800 in the bank and he will still receive the full pension of $20 a week. He does not lose his entitlement to some pension until his property, other than his home, reaches a value of $31,600. If he has no property he does not lose his entitlement to some pension until his income reaches $60 a week. 
A married couple may have property to the value of $18,740. They may derive what income they can from the $18,740. They can invest it at any rate of return and the income is exempt. This is not as it was under the last Labor government. The married couple will still qualify for a pension of $34.50 a week. The figure at which they receive  bo  pension at all is when their property other than their own home reaches a value of $54,640. If they have no property but have provided for themselves by way of superannuation, they do not lose their entitlement until their income reaches $103.50 a week. That is a long way different from what a pensioner ever received under a Labor government. When Labor went out of office in 1949 it paid the single pensioner $4.25 a week. Since that time the consumer price index has moved upwards by 174.6 per cent, which means that the single rate pension today should be worth SI 1.75 a week. But this Government has not increased the rate only in line with the change in the consumer price index. The Government has increased it by 370 per cent and it now pays the single pensioner $20 a week. In addition to that, the Government will pay him supplementary rent assistance of $4 a week which he would not have received under the last Labor government. Let me point out to honourable members the difference in the effect of the 2 means tests. Under Labor, only 39 per cent of persons who were eligible by age received age pensions; today, more than 61 per cent of such people are eligible to receive a pension because this Government has greatly eased the means test. 
The Leader of the Opposition criticised Australia's growth rate. He said that Australia had one of the lowest growth rates in the world. He criticised the Government because the percentage growth of Australia's gross national product has fallen over the past few years. I obtained a table from the Bureau of Census and Statistics which shows the percentage growth of the gross national product at constant prices for quite a number of countries. This table indicates that, over the same period that the growth rate of Australia has fallen, the same thing has happened in the United States of America, Japan, Italy, the Netherlands and the countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As for Australia having one of the lowest growth rates in the world, the same table shows that, for the last year in which comparative figures were available, the Australian rate was better than that for the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada and the OECD countries. 
Let me now turn to the subject of taxation. The Leader of the Oppisition said that the Budget will not reduce taxes. I would suggest that he try telling that to the workers who will receive extra money in their pay envelopes after 1st September. As the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  pointed out in the Budget Speech, a man with a wife and 2 children, in receipt of $98 a week, which is the approximate average weekly male wage, will gain an additional $2.75 a week. If he has a wife and no children and receives $85 a week, the increase in his pay envelope will be $2 a week. I should like to say one more thing about income tax. I refer to a leading article which appeared in the 'Australian' on Thursday, 24th August. I will not quote the entire article which is headed: 'Whitlam must explain tax policy*. I shall quote just 3 sentences. The article states: 
It is now clear that the most embarrassing question anyone can ask  Mr Whitlam  during the election campaign will be whether he is prepared to guarantee not to raise taxes if Labor wins office. . . . The inescapable conclusion is that  Mr Whitlam  will not be cutting income tax; he will be raising it by 10 per cent or more. 
The article claims that if Labor is elected to office and keeps all its promises,  Mr Whitlam  will have to do just that. I have heard it said that the Government should have cut sales tax to reduce the price of goods and give the public more spending power. I know that the Government has looked at the area of sales tax but there is no guarantee that any reduction in sales tax would benefit the consumer. It could well be absorbed in the price margins of the wholesalers and the retailers, who could then say: 'We were going to increase prices but the reduction in sales tax will enable us not to do so'. But by granting income tax reductions the Government has ensured that the worker will receive the money in his pay envelope and he knows what the tax reduction is worth to him. 
During the course of his speech the Leader of the Opposition said that the Australian Government takes a greater share of the national revenue resources than any other federal system in the world but provides directly fewer government services than does any other comparable system in the world. I do not know whether or not that is true; I have not been able to check the figures. However, what I have been able to check is that, in its Budget presented in its last year in office, the Labor Party returned to the States 18 per cent of its total revenue. In this Budget the Government is returning to the States in excess of 25 per cent of its total revenue, so if what this Government is doing is not enough - I do not believe that it is - Labor's record in this field is very much worse than the record of this Government. 
The Leader of the Opposition has been peddling a theme: 'It's Time'. I quite agree; it is time that the people of Australia realised that this Government is responsible for the introduction of most of the social welfare legislation now in operation. The Government introduced the pensioner medical service, the nursing home benefits, homes for the aged, age tax allowances, hospital and medical benefits and guardians and mothers allowances, lt is time; it is time that people realised that this Government introduced housing grants and Commonwealth scholarships. It is time that the people realised that, under this Government, Commonwealth expenditure on education has increased by nearly 2,300 per cent over the amount provided by Labor in its last Budget. It is time that the migrants realised that it was this Government that - reduced from 20 to 10 years the residential qualifying period necessary for them to receive age pensions. It is time that migrants realised that it is this Government which introduced portability of pension rights which will enable them to take their pensions with them when they leave the country after they have qualified by residence and after other countries have passed reciprocal legislation. 
It is time that the people realised that the Australian Labor Party stands for the abolition of censorship, the recognition of Scientology, the breakdown of the standard of our immigration programme, the importation of unemployment, because of the stated views of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to tariffs and the revaluation of the Australian dollar and because the Labor Party is pushing for shorter working hours without any regard for increased productivity. It is time that people realised . that if they want to continue to live iri a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, in a country which is free from racial strife, in a country which provides incentives for those who are prepared to work and in a country which offers security to its citizens, they can ensure this by working for and voting for the return of this Liberal-Country Party Government which has served them so well over the past 23 years. 
Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs seen reports that Jews wishing to leave the Soviet Union are being forced to pay for their freedom by being charged, on a sliding scale commensurate with their education, for their visas? Further, do the same reports place the price of freedom as high as 12,200 roubles, or approximately $20,000, for a university graduate? Can the Minister inform the House whether there is any truth in these reports, and, if there is, what action is open to the Government to make known its dislike of such an arrangement? 
I direct my question to the Prime Minister. In 1971-72 the Government set a growth limit of 3.1 per cent on the overall numbers employed in the Public Service. I ask: What is the situation for 1972-73? 
My main purpose in speaking to the estimates of the Department of Immigration is to pay a tribute to the officers of this Department who are stationed overseas. I recently returned from a visit to Europe during which I attended a conference in Vienna on the environment. While I was away I took the opportunity of calling on the Immigration post in every country I visited. I want to acknowledge the help and the courtesy which was extended to me by the officers of the Department of Immigration. In quite a number of cases I talked with Government officials of the countries which I visited and I found that without exception the Australian officers were held in very high regard by those overseas governments. Australia is fortunate to have such capable and dedicated men representing it overseas. 
Our overseas immigration posts did not just happen; they did not appear like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. They have been built up over the years. I believe the future of some of these posts has been placed in jeopardy by some of the critics of our immigration policy. Some people blame immigration for the increased level of unemployment in Australia. For this reason they want either greatly to reduce our immigration intake or cut it out completely. I want to go on record as saying that it is my personal belief that migrants do not contribute to unemployment. On the contrary, I believe that they create demands for consumer goods. I think that the level of unemployment has been contributed to by a reduction in what we have accepted as a rate of increased demand. We have had it for quite a number of years. 1 do not believe we have to look any further for the reason why last year our consumer demand fell than the fact that we reduced our intake of migrants by 45,000. I believe that it is a mistake that this year the same reduced target has been set. Industry was geared to an annual intake of  185,000  migrants. We have suddenly reduced this intake by  45,000  potential customers. Every person who comes to us from overseas has to be housed, fed and clothed. The records of our immigration intake over the years show that in those years in which we had the greatest number of migrants coming to Australia we had our lowest level of unemployment and we also enjoyed some of our greatest levels of prosperity. 
The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Whitlam)  is on record as saying that a Lab.v Government, if elected, would reduce the migrant intake still further.  1  think it was during the Frost interview on television that he said that the level of intake would be in the vicinity of  100,000  people a year. The Labor Party expresses concern  - 1  think rightly so - at the present level of unemployment. But it is my personal belief, that a further cut in our intake would increase unemployment for the reasons which I have already given. The Labor Party has said that a Labor government would give preference in selecting migrants to the relatives of people already in Australia. Superficially this has a very great humanitarian appeal, but surely it would affect our ability to control the intake of migrants on occupational grounds. At the present time we can bring in people with the skills that we need. But ALP policy would practically eliminate our ability to be selective in order to meet current employment requirements. It is my opinion that migrants have contributed very greatly to the trades and skills which are in short supply in Australia. To make family relationship the main selection criterion must reduce the worker component of our intake. Because of its mobility and its greater adaptability the migrant work force has provided the economy with a greater flexibility and responsiveness. That is because migrants are willing to go anywhere in Australia where employment opportunities are available. They are much more willing to travel than Australians. 
I do not think anyone would dispute that migration has contributed very greatly to our culture. The matters  1  have mentioned are very positive gains which we have made from our immigration programme. In saying that, I do not believe that migration does not create some adjustment problems, but I think that we have to live with those because nothing worth while is ever achieved without some sacrifice by some people. As the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden)  said a few months ago - I think it was during the month of June - nation building will involve us in considerable costs and the benefits will not come free. I accept that. But I think it is wrong to attribute unemployment, congestion and pollution to immigration, as quite a number of people have done. We live in one of the most prosperous countries in the world with one of the highest standards of living. 1 think migration has contributed very greatly to this. 
Let us have a look at some of the benefits which we have derived from our immigration programme. The migrants we have brought to this country and the Australian born children of those migrants have provided  53  per cent of the increase in population from  8  million in  1950  to  12.7  million in  1971.  Migration has reduced the average age of the population. It has provided over half the increase in the work force, which in  1954  was  3.5  million and which today is  5.6  million. It has added considerably to the skilled component of the work force. Migration has helped to service the key industries which provide electricity power works and transmission lines, water and sewerage supplies, air transport and concrete and cement products, lt has reinforced our education facilities, particularly at the tertiary levels. It has provided essential hospital staff.  An  examination of the percentage of migrants employed in hospitals and education authorities, particularly at the tertiary level, will reveal that they represent a much greater percentage of the population than their percentage of the total population. 
Migration has provided a disproportionately large number of the work force for developmental projects. It has reduced per capita social service costs because migrants have to be resident in this country for  10  years before they are entitled to receive the age pension, but they have to contribute to social services by way of taxation payments during the whole of their working lives. They have also, as do Australians, to reach an age which would qualify them for the receipt of such benefits. Migration has facilitated and encouraged increased industrialisation and diversification of the economy. A vigorous immigration programme is essential to the development of Australia. I believe that it is in Australia's best interests to retain the very efficient immigration posts which have been already established overseas. These posts can be very easily destroyed but they cannot be easily re-established. 
I have referred to some of the tangible benefits of immigration. Let us have a look ac some of the benefits that are less quantifiable but which are, at the same time, of significant importance. Immigration has contributed to the non-material activities which add to the quality of life in Australia. The effects of immigration have in fact permeated the whole life of the nation. We are socially and culturally more diversified and more tolerant than once was the case. As the Minister for Immigration  (Dr Forbes)  announced earlier this year, quite a number of new measures are proposed both for assessing migrants overseas and counselling them prior to their arrival in Australia. In addition, greater emphasis will be placed on English language training and both the migrant education and the migrant welfare services in Australia will be expanded. I hope it will not be long before the Government again increases its intake of migrants. In my opinion, Australia's migration policy has served it well in the past and I believe it will contribute a great deal to Australia in the future. 
I ask the Minister for Social 
Services: When did the Social Services Bill receive the royal assent? Are the increased pensions and increased means test limits now in operation? When will the first payments be made under these new arrangements? 
 I ask the Prime Minister whether he can say what would be the effect on Australia of an immigration policy confined solely to sponsorship by Australian residents of relatives and friends, without the exercise of discrimination. 
(3.34)- During the winter recess it was my privilege to attend a conference which was held in Vienna to discuss matters affecting the environment. It was attended by representatives of nations which belong to the InterParliamentary Union. The purpose of the conference was to enable the delegates to become informed in depth on the recommendations of the United Nations conference which had been held a little earlier in Stockholm. Secondly, its purpose was to endorse the recommendations of the Stockholm Conference where it considered these to be appropriate; thirdly, to identify any omissions or errors of strategy of the United Nations Conference and to refer to any recommendations which might require further international consultation and action. The fact that 32 nations were represented at this conference, which was held so soon after the Stockholm Conference, indicates the very great interest held by quite a number of governments of the world on matters affecting the environment. 
I am quite sure that the Australian people would be interested in the matters which were discussed at this conference and the resolutions which were passed at Vienna. It became obvious to me, as I am sure it did to all the other delegates there, that some of the problems which many people believed to be peculiar to their own countries were matters which affect most countries. It became equally obvious that none of us can live in a world apart and that the actions which are taken by one country may affect people who live hundreds or even thousands of miles away. It became very clear to me that if mankind wishes to live in a world which is reasonably free from pollution and if it wishes to preserve for future generations a world of that nature, most of the governments in the world will have to take very drastic action and take it promptly. 
One of the conclusions which was reached at Vienna was that the main thing wrong with the environment in developing countries is poverty and the main thing wrong with the environment in developed countries is pollution. The conference concluded that industry everywhere must build pollution control into its planning. I believe that the customer must be prepared to pay for a clean environment. The conference discussed resources of the sea and it recommended that governments ought to agree on the areas over which they have complete jurisdiction, that they should decide jurisdictional limits and within these limits each responsible government should undertake conservation measures so as  to  avoid decline in stocks which are caused by overfishing, pollution and by the destruction of habitat, and that outside these limits the resources of the sea ought to be regarded as the common heritage of mankind. The conference recommended that in the case of migratory species agreement ought to be concluded between the governments concerned so that benefits of exploitation of the species should belong to every country and that the costs of conservation should be equitably shared so that no few countries share all of these benefits exclusively. 
The conference recommended that pollution of the high seas, whether it be by solid or liquid pollution from traffic, dumping or from the outflow of rivers, ought to be controlled. It recommended that a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling should be called and, at the end of that time, that criteria should be laid down which would permit the rational exploitation of this resource for the benefit of mankind as a whole and, again, not for the benefit of comparatively few countries. Evidence was given to the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation, of which 1 am Chairman, that if the hunting of one species of whale ceased today, the species could well become extinct within 25 years because its numbers are already down so low. 
The Vienna Conference naturally discussed nuclear pollution of the atmosphere because of the tests which France had been conducting at that time. The conference concluded that nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere constituted a most dangerous source of pollution. It recommended that all tests should cease immediately and that a comprehensive test ban ought to be introduced on an international level. I mentioned that the purpose of the conference was to see whether there were any subjects which had not adequately been covered by the United Nations Conference. The conference concluded that the United Nations did not squarely face up to the problem of hunger and it rated the spectre of famine, particularly in developing countries, as the greatest threat menacing world population. It attributed this threat of famine to over-exploitation of the soil and water resources and to the impoverishment of the forests. The conference concluded that pollution increases the threat of famine which could become critical and it suggested that specific studies of this be undertaken at an international level immediately. It discussed the use of agro-chemicals and it suggested that knowledge of this should be pooled internationally with a view to eliminating the use of those chemicals for which less dangerous substitutes exist and so as to exercise more precise control of dangerous residues in soil, in air, in water and in plant and animal products which are intended for human consumption. 
The conference suggested that particular attention should be given to the interaction of urban and land uses with the marine environment, notably wetlands. It was firmly of the opinion that the more developed countries should not transfer their problems of pollution to the underdeveloped countries by taking advantage of low wage structures and low costs of production. It recommended that a comprehensive network of protected areas should be established under international control so that representative examples of ecosystems of international scientific significance should be preserved for all time, particularly those containing genetic resources which are imported to conserve, and so that animal and plant species and their habitats should be preserved. It also recommended that international conventions be drafted to preserve wetlands and threatened species and that maximum tolerance levels of pollution, both of air and water, be made the subject of international agreements because it considered that pollution caused in international waters could affect people living in countries through which these waterways passed and it could affect the livelihood of people in countries who live largely on the resources of the sea. 
It was suggested by that conference that much more research should be conducted into projects having environmental impact and that individual countries should consider adopting methods in favour of antipollutant goods and services and against certain goods and services which contribute to pollution and that these be of a fiscal nature and involve tax concessions. The conference suggested that consideration should be given to providing tax advantages to industries which recycle products. 1 have read of one city in the United States of America which has made it an offence for any retail establishment to sell goods in non-returnable containers. I believe that in the interests of a clean environment we ought to give consideration to this aspect. In some countries - Singapore is an example - it becomes an offence which carries quite a heavy fine for people who pollute the streets with rubbish. 
The Vienna Conference concluded that environmental education at all levels is essential to the wellbeing of the planet in which we live and for man's place in the planet. It recommended that all governments support an education and information programme both in regard to policy and money and that every parliament establish a special committee which is competent to deal with environmental problems. I express the hope that when this Parliament is convened in the new year the new Government will decide to set up such a committee in this place. 
In directing a question to the Minister for Social Services I refer to the fact that the Budget proposals on social services, which came into effect on 27th September, made many people eligible for pensions for the first time. I ask: What is the position in regard to persons whose earlier applications for pensions had been refused but who have now become eligible? Should they put in fresh applications for pensions if they consider that they are now eligible under the new concessions which have been introduced by this Government or will their previous applications suffice? 
I ask the Treasurer: Has his attention been drawn to the serious allegation made in this Parliament that something very shady is going on in the Treasury and the Department of Labour and National Service and that for political reasons public servants are deliberately withholding vital information from the Parliament? Will the Treasurer investigate this serious allegation concerning the public servants under his authority? 
I wish to direct a question to the Treasurer: Is the Treasurer aware that the Income Tax Assessment Act requires a resident of Australia to pay income tax on income which is earned overseas but which, under the laws of the overseas country, he cannot receive? Will he say whether Australian laws require estate duty to be paid on overseas assets which have been frozen under the laws of another country and the use of which have been denied to the owner? Will he give consideration to amending any federal laws which require an Australian resident to pay tax on overseas assets or any income  from those assets where it can be clearly established that, because of the laws of another country, the resident is denied the use of such assets or income for as long as he remains a resident of Australia? 
On behalf of the Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation I present the report of the Committee together with minutes of the proceedings. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
I ask for leave to make a short statement in connection with the report. 
I present a report, together with minutes of proceedings, from the House of Representatives Select Committee on Road Safety, being a report that the Committee has been unable to complete its inquiry. 
Ordered that the report be printed. 
I seek leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. 
I should tike to join with other honourable members who have congratulated  Mr Speaker  and the  Chairman  of Committees on their election to those very important offices. I should also like to congratulate those new members who have made their maiden speeches. I think it is obvious that the Parliament has gained some valuable new members. The Government, through the medium of the GovernorGeneral's Speech, has announced a comprehensive program of legislation but already a number of people who voted on 2nd December for a change of government are becoming apprehensive. In the past couple of weeks I have received many calls from people who have asked me: 'How long do we have to put up with this present Government? Where are we heading?' I believe that these are good questions in the light of some of the decisions which have been taken by the Gov ernment since its election and before Parliament had met so that no discussion was possible. 
At least 16 fairly important decisions have been taken and I would like to ask why. Was it because the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  was afraid that some of the decisions would not have received the support of a majority of his Party or even of his Ministry? Or was it because these actions would not have stood up to public scrutiny after the Opposition had dealt with them in Parliament? I think that those are good questions in the light of the information contained in a couple of publications sent to me in the post in the last few weeks. I will quote shortly from some of them and let honourable members draw their own conclusions. 
I believe they are very good questions indeed, especially when a number of Government supporters have indicated already that they do not acknowledge the Queen nor do they acknowledge God. If this statement horrifies some of the people in the precincts of this House, let me prove what I have said. I can do so quite easily. It has been stated in the Press on a number of occasions - I have copies of the statements - and it has never been denied by the Government that, at a send off party given in Sydney for the Australian Ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China,  Dr Fitzgerald,  at which about 550 guests were present, including some members of the Ministry, when the toast to  Her  Majesty the Queen was proposed, many remained seated or acted perfunctorily. But, as one newspaper wrote, when the toast to  Chairman  Mao was proposed, people were on their feet and applauding most vigorously. Only last week in Parliament House after Parliament was opened by  His Excellency  the Governor-General, who is the Queen's representative in Australia, honourable members were invited to meet him and pay their respects to him. Quite a number of Government supporters, including some Ministers, refused to shake hands with the Governor-General for a variety of reasons. Some stated that they believed Australia should be a republic. I respect their views but I still believe that even though they hold those views sincerely, it still would have been courteous to acknowledge the Queen's representative while she remains Queen of Australia. So, I believe I have proved my point that a number of Government supporters do not acknowledge the Queen. 
As for some honourable members opposite not acknowledging God, it is somewhat farcical that we open the proceedings of this House every day with a prayer.  Mr Speaker  says: 'Almighty God, we humbly beseech thee to vouchsafe Thy blessings upon this Parliament'. I believe this to be farcical when clearly 12 Government supporters or nearly 20 per cent of the Government Party, including some Ministers, do not acknowledge the existence of God. Last week 124 members of this House were sworn in. There were 66 members of the Government Party, 38 members of the Liberal Party and 20 members of the Australian Country Party. Every Liberal member and every Country Party member took the oath on the Bible, but 12 members of the Australian Labor Party, or approximately 20 per cent of that Party's numbers in this House, refused to take the oath on the Bible and instead made an affirmation. I believe that the public or people should ponder about these things. 

 Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)Order! There is no substance to the point of order. 
I am not casting any doubts upon their right to do as they like, but I believe the people should ponder on these things and reflect on the type of government they have elected and ask themselves: 'Is this the type of example which should be set for my children by the supreme authority in this country?' 
I should like to refer to the 2 documents which have been sent to me. The first is issued by a group calling themselves the Watervale Advance, Waterville, Minnesota, and I will read to honourable members some of the comments of this paper. The paper begins by saying: 
In May of 1919 at Dusseldorp Germany, the Allied Forces obtained a copy of some of the 'Communist Rules for Revolution'. 
Honourable members will recall that the Communist Party was formed in that year. The document continues: 
As you read the list, stop after each item and think about the present-day situation where you live. We quote from the Red Rules: 
Corrupt the. young, get them away from religion, Get them interested in sex. Make them superficial; destroy their ruggedness. 
Get people's minds off their government by focusing their attention on athletics* sexy books and plays and other trivialities. 
Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters pf no importance. 
Destroy the people's faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up to contempt, ridicule, obloquy. 
By encouraging government extravagance, destroy its credit, produce fear of inflation with rising prices and general discontent. 
Foment- unnecessary strikes' in vital industries, encourage civil disorders and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government towards such disorders. 
Let me refer to some of the matters contained in that document, lt referred to corrupting the young and getting people's minds off their government. I ask honourable members to think of the soft line taken by many people, including some Government supporters, with respect to the laws, relating to drugs. Think of the pressure groups in the community which are advocating abortion on demand, whether the girl happens to be married or single. Think of the pressure groups which want a relaxation of laws relating to sexual behaviour and think of the pressure for the complete abolition of all forms of censorship. I am sure that many well-meaning people who say that no government has the right to tell them what they should read, see or hear have no idea at all of what they are advocating. They just could not imagine some of the types of hard-core pornography that are freely available in some countries overseas. The theory is that this material can be kept away from children and made available only to adults, but I do not believe that in practice this has any hope of working out. When one looks at these matters - abortion on demand, abolition of censorship and relaxation of laws relating to the use of drugs - I believe that they must result in the undermining of traditional human values. 
The document says: 'Divide the people'. There are groups who are constantly trying to divide people and foment trouble. They try to divide them on racial grounds and religious grounds, and there are many people trying to foment unnecessary trouble between employers and employees. Some members of the present Government have openly encouraged radical and militant groups. The document says: 'Destroy the people's faith in leaders.' Again I would like to quote 3 statements made by the present Minister for Overseas Trade and Secondary Industry  (Dr J. F. Cairns).  On 16th September 1970 he was reported in the 'Daily Telegraph' as saying that he hoped that authority had had its day. On 28th August 1970 he said in the House of Represenatives that he wanted recognition of what he called the formulation of the will of the people outside Parliament by meetings, by demonstrations, by sit-downs and by civil disturbances. Finally, on 16th April 1970 in the House of Represenatives he said: 
I recognise the existence of the law as it is, and if 1 think it is wrong and the issue is strong enough, I will break the law. 
Surely any member of the present Government could not object if any member of the public sought to break any law which was introduced by this Government. If we want further evidence of this there is the fact that the present Government endorsed a lawbreaker as one of its candidates in the last election. Finally I mention the stand-over tactics adopted by ALP organisations such as State councils and Federal conferences with regard to the elected members of this Parliament. In other words, they tell the elected members that they will do as they are told. 
The document refers to encouraging Government extravagance. When the present Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  was Treasurer in the last Government he said that the Government had gone to the boundary of responsiblity when framing its last Budget, but now the present Government has increased the deficit by approximately $300m. It will further add to this deficit by its advocacy of a 35-hour week, and there will be economic effects from the introduction of 4 weeks annual leave, which we support. We made this quite clear. We recognise that the Government has a mandate in consequence of the Prime Minister's promise to introduce 4 weeks annual leave, and we do not intend to oppose the legislation providing for its introduction. As honourable members know, the Government was forced to change it attitude yesterday by extending 4 weeks annual leave to all Government servants whether they happen to be members of unions or not. It is rather interesting to note that the Government believes in compulsion where unionism is concerned but does not believe in compulsion where the defence of this country is concerned. The 35-hour week and 4 weeks annual leave must have economic effects. Spokesmen for the Government have clearly indicated that they believe in substantially higher wages. I believe that this must add to costs for 2 reasons. One is that the Government itself is the biggest employer of labour in Australia, and the second is that the Government is committed to achieving an age pension equivalent to 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. What I have been talking about must surely and inevitably and substantially increase average weekly male earnings. 
I turn to rising prices. The Labor Party claimed that it is able to control prices and that it would perform miracles when it came to office. I quote from the 'Daily Mirror' of Tuesday, 6th March, an article headed '1,500 Prices Rises'. It states: 
Housewives paid higher prices for 1,500 grocery items in February and further rises are expected this month. One manufacturer of canned foods increased prices 3 times in the past 5 weeks. 
So much for the ability of the Labor Party to control prices. Let me refer to the document's statement about fomenting unnecessary strikes and consider the number of demarcation disputes, which are surely unnecessary and of which the victims are the public. Surely the present Government has fostered a lenient attitude to strikes by its stated policy of placing unions above the law and of removing penalties and sanctions from the conciliation and arbitration legislation. Since 2nd December, the date of the election, there have been at least 7 major strikes. So much for Labor's ability to reduce the incidence of industrial trouble. Even though this document was written more than 50 years ago, I believe that what it states is very applicable today. 
The second document which was brought to my attention is much more recent. It was issued just prior to the last election by a group calling itself the Socialist Workers League, which is a communist organisation. It is headed 'Labor to Power!' Let me quote briefly from it: 
It is vital that a Labor Government be elected in November. . . . The ALP must be forced to take a clear position in support of the following demands: The complete withdrawal of all Australian military forces and material support of any kind from Indo China; and an end to any form of complicity and political support for US policies there. Withdrawal from SEATO, ANZUS and other reactionary pacts and no Australian forces anywhere in Asia. . . . Abortion on demand. . . . Repeal of all anti-abortion laws. . . . The immediate and unconditional self-determination of Papua New 
Guinea. ... No limitation on the right to strike; an end of all penal powers; legislation for  a  reduction in working hours with no loss of pay. ... A guaranteed wage for all, employed or unemployed. 
Yes, I will put a bit of ginger into it for you too. I do it daily. Surely the present Government is following the policies advocated by the Communist Party. In saying that I am not accusing any member of the Government of being a communist or a communist sympathiser. But I believe it is fair comment to say that the Government is unconsciously taking a line which the Communist Party would like it to take consciously. In relation to the immediate and unconditional self-determination of Papua and New Guinea, I want to say that the Opposition believes in the independence of Papua New Guinea, and it made this very clear when in office. But the attitude of the Prime Minister is that big brother knows best and that the Territory will get its independence when he determines, whether the people of Papua New Guinea want it at that time or not. It is clear that substantial sections of the population of Papua New Guinea would like to defer independence beyond December this year, but apparently their wishes are to be entirely disregarded and they will receive their independence when the Prime Minister determines, whether they are ready for it or not. He is also apparently determined to ignore the wishes of the Torres Strait Islanders with respect to the demarcation of boundaries between Australian and Papua New Guinea. 
Some weeks ago I was privileged to attend an Australia Day luncheon in the Melbourne Town Hall and to hear a very inspiring address by the  Hon. Sir Reginald  Sholl. I want to make 2 quotations from what he said. In relation to Communism he said: 
I have not forgotten Sharpley, the communist defector, sitting in my chambers in 1949, when the late  Sir Charles  Lowe . . . was inquiring into his disclosures. He told me: 'In 1940 we estimated we would be in a position to take over Australia in 20 years; we would get control of the unions handling power, transport and food; and we would move from the unions into the universities, and then into the schools. We would not need numbers, only power. This inquiry will put them back another 20 years, but they will keep at it.' When one looks at the unions under communism or left-wing control today, and contemplates the potential pincer movement constituted by the Russian progress across the Indian Ocean and the now apparently inevitable communisation of Indo China, one hopes we shall not too brashly thumb our noses at old friends. We could surely too do without the embarrassment, (to use akind term) of communist sympathisers or left-wing politicians emerging from a state of hitherto discreet reticence in Australia, and presenting themselves and us in abject posture in Hanoi. 
He also said: 
We do not want to find that our only friends are Communist China and East Germany. History shows that there is no future for small nations who genuflect to the bullies of this world. Free peoples despise them, and they, end up in subjection as satellites. 
That is What  Mr Justice  Sholl said about people who genuflect to the bullies of the world. I ask honourable members to note an article written by Douglas Wilkie following the function to farewell the. Australian Ambassador to Communist China. The article appeared in the Melbourne 'Sun Pictorial'. In it he said: 
The Sydney episode will arouse nothing but amused contempt among the leaders at Peking, when they hear of it. 
The Chinese may be Maoists. But they are also heirs to the Mandarin tradition of propriety and - outside propaganda invective - formal politeness. 
They are also fervent nationalists, looking on all foreign devils as their cultural inferiors- but nonetheless ready to measure the quality of other nations by the strength of their respect for their own national institutions and traditions. 
Surely it is time that the present Government woke up to the fact that.it is bringing Australia into disrepute in the eyes of the world and that it is not earning the respect of anyone, including the communists. I repeat, it is fair comment to say that the Government is - unconsciously perhaps - following the policies advocated by the Communist Party. For Australia's sake it is time it Woke up to the facts of life.. 
Debate (on motion by  Dr Gun)  adjourned. 
I direct a question to the Minister for Defence and  Deputy  Prime Minister. If he genuinely holds the regard for  Sir Arthur  Tange which he expressed in a television interview last week, particularly as the Prime Minister has since expressed the same high regard for  Sir Arthur,  will the Minister for Defence take action, which only he can take, to remove the cloud hanging over the reputation of  Sir Arthur?  Will the Minister state unequivocally what reservations he has on the, statement made by  Sir Arthur  which he tabled in the House, and will he grant  Sir Arthur  the same opportunity to provide  a  statement in the same form? Will he table that reply in the House or withdraw his reservations? 
I direct to the Minister for Immigration a question supplementary to that asked of the Prime Minister by the honourable member for Gippsland. Is the Minister aware that a considerable number of migrants believe that a slur has been cast on the migrant community in general by the statement made on Tuesday by  Senator Murphy  and that many of them who are not yet naturalised are fearful for their safety? Will the Minister give an assurance that before any action is taken by him to deport any member of the Yugoslav community or any other migrant community in Australia he will require the production of substantial evidence and that if such evidence has been provided solely by a communist government it will be disregarded? 
I ask the Prime Minister: Is he aware that it is reported that on 28th April a joint delegation of Vietcong and North Vietnamese will be visiting Australia as guests of the Minister for Overseas Trade? If he is aware of this intended visit, will he say whether the delegates will be travelling on North Vietnamese passports or on passports issued by the Provisional Revolutionary Government? If travelling on passports issued by the Provisional Revolutionary Government, will he say whether they will be admitted to Australia? If they are travelling on North Vietnamese passports, will he say how they can pass themselves off as Vietcong, which presumably is an organisation composed of South Vietnamese? If he is not aware of any of these facts, will he cause inquiries to be made and report to the House the result of his investigations? 
I move: 
That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended  as would prevent the immediate reopening of the debate upon Notice No. 1, General Business, on today's Notice Paper. 
I find it very hard to understand why the Government should seek to curtail debate on  a  subject on which it claims to have the interest of the less fortunate members of the community at heart. It is very hard to understand, unless, of course, the Government has acted in a sense of pique. The Government has accused the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  of being inconsistent or of trying to do something that he did not want to do when he was the Minister responsible for social services. The honourable member for Mackellar has shown much more dedication and concern for the less fortunate members of the community and has done much more to alleviate their distress than any other member of the House. In moving his motion today the honourable member is consistent with the attitude that he has adopted since he has been a member of this House, both as a private member and as the Minister responsible for social services. 
Again I find it hard to understand why the Government has sought to curtail debate when its supporters were very loud in their complaints about the number of times the previous Government used the gag and the guillotine. The present Government has shown itself to be much more ruthless in the few weeks that it has been in office than our Government ever was. I hope that the Government will be able to offer a very satisfactory explanation to the people that the honourable member for Mackellar seeks to help. After all, the honourable member thought, and I thought, that he was expressing the view of all parties .in this House, the view that the means test should be abolished as quickly as possible.. The stated intention of the 3 parties in this place at the last election was that they would abolish the means test within the life of this Parliament. 
by leave - 1 am glad that the Government has seen fit to reappoint the Select Committee on Road Safety. The new Committee will continue the work which was done by a similar Committee in the last Parliament - a Committee of which it was my privilege to be Chairman. When the House went into recess at the end of last year, the work of that Committee had not been completed, although we had taken a great deal of evidence both from Australians and from overseas experts. I believe that there are few more important issues than the matter of road safety, when one considers the size of the road toll in Australia. As the Minister for 
Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  said, over 3,000 people are killed and 80,000 to 90,000 injured annually. Some of those who were injured probably are a great deal worse off than those who were killed. I say this because of the degree of physical and mental incapacity that many suffer as a result of road accidents. The road toll is the No. 3 killer of Australians, the others being heart disease and cancer. I am appalled that members of the public apparently are reconciled to the present road toll. They seem to regard it as inevitable. At the conclusion of each weekend they take up their newspapers, read the football results and the racing results then turn to see how many people have been killed on Australian roads. They then put the matter out of their minds until the following weekend when they look to see what the score is for that weekend. 
There is no simple answer to the major causes of road accidents. There is no simple answer to what we can best do to reduce them. The losses caused by road accidents are colossal both in economic terms and in terms of human suffering, which is immeasurable. The demand for hospital beds for victims of road accidents must adversely affect the health of persons who cannot be admitted to hospital immediately for treatment which they require because of the demand on beds created by road accidents. The tragic part of the story is that a big percentage of road accidents could be avoided. If drivers were less selfish, less aggressive and less thoughtless and more responsible, more careful and more considerate of others many homes would not be mourning the loss of parents or children. What are a few minutes in the lives of motorists when because of reckless driving more than 3,000 die and 80,000 are injured every year? Such a road tol) would not be tolerated in time of war, so I do not know why we should tolerate it in time of peace. 
To the extent that the re-establishment of this Road Safety Committee of this Parliament may contribute to ascertaining the causes of road accidents and to reducing both their number and the suffering caused by them it is a matter of major importance. I commend the Government for taking the action it is now taking- 
I commend the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  and the Government for moving for the establishment of this Committee. Again it will more or less take over from a select committee of the last Parliament which it was my privilege to chair. I pay a tribute to all members of that Committee. It was a very dedicated Committee comprising members from the 3 parties represented in this House. I would like to think that we achieved something worth while. One of the recommendations made by that Committee when it tabled its report was that the Parliament should establish a standing committee to which controversial matters could be referred, and I see a great deal of value in this. Some of them that come to mind quickly are Lake Pedder, Cooloola Sands and the wood chip industry, just to name 3 of them. If it is a committee of this Parliament to which the Government can refer its controversial matters it could and should take a great deal of pressure off the Government, because it can look at these matters impartially and on their own merits. 
I believe that in Australia we have a chance to learn from some of the mistakes which have been made by other countries. There is a very good reason why very many more people are conscious of pollution of the environment now than there were 5 or 6 years ago. The world population is doubling every 35 years. People themselves mean pollution because people must have factories to provide their requirements. These factories have been discharging pollution into the rivers and streams; they have been pouring smoke into the air. We are destroying fields and trees to put down roads to accommodate the motor vehicles which, too, are causing pollution. As the population of the world increases very rapidly we have to be conscious of the fact that we are making an environment that will be there for generations to come. People are entitled to live in a clean environment, but if they want to live in a clean environment they ought to be prepared to pay for it. If this means that we have to require industry to spend more money on up-to-date equipment to eliminate or reduce pollution and this means an increase in the price of goods, people have to be prepared to pay for it. ' 
One can travel hundreds or even a thousand miles or more in this country, and one can even go out into the outback 100 miles from Alice Springs and find roads and areas where no roads exist which are cluttered with bottles, non-degradable containers and cans. There are countries in which laws have been passed to make it an offence to sell something in a non-returnable container. Other countries are a great deal stricter with regard to people who throw their rubbish out on to the roads. I believe that a committee such as has been set up could act as a watchdog for a clean environment. I am all in favour of it. I hope I am fortunate enough to become a member of it. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
As one who was privileged to serve in this Parliament with  Sir Arthur  Fadden and who had a very high regard for him and greatly respected him as, I know, he was respected by all who knew him, I should like to add my tribute to those which have been tendered by previous speakers.  Sir Arthur  was not only a great parliamentarian and Treasurer; he was also a very warm hearted person who numbered his friends in all walks of life and at all levels of society. I know that he was able to meet all these people on equal terms. He exuded good humour and had a fund of stories which was unequalled by anyone. As has been stated,  Sir Arthur  could not resist the temptation even on the occasion of his last speech in this Parliament to tell three of four stories. No doubt these are recorded in Hansard for posterity. This was typical of  Sir Arthur  Fadden. Australia is the poorer for his passing and  I  should like to extend my personal sympathy to Lady Fadden and the other members of bis family. 
I join with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  in protesting about the treatment which the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  seeks to mete out to us. The Leader of the House and the honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  are critical of the Opposition because we are protesting about the attempt of the Government  to muzzle our  opinion and to ride roughshod over what I believe to be an increasing measure of public opinion which is diametrically opposed to that of the Government. If Government supporters doubt that, I suggest that they read the results of last Saturday's gallup poll to see. just how much out of step they are with public opinion. The honourable member for Chifley referred to a similar debate which took place at about this time last year. As a matter of fact, he should have referred to a situation in May 1971 relating to the debate on a number of Bills which did not include, as the honourable member for Chifley suggested, the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I suggest that not one of the Bills involved at that time was anywhere near as important or far reaching in its effects as the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill we are discussing today. 
I wish to quote a statement made at that time by a very prominent member of the present Government whose name I will tell honourable members later. The then Leader of the House said that he had sought unsuccessfully to negotiate with the Opposition over the Bill. I remember that our Minister explained that he negotiated with the Opposition and that it was aware of the time, to be allotted for the debate. The very prominent member of the Labor Party to whom I referred had this to say: 
The Minister said that he consulted the Opposition. What he did was to walk around to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and say: 'This is what we are going to do. We will bring it in this afternoon.' That is the Liberal method of consultation with the Opposition. When a party is a few numbers short, what can it do with an arrogant, overbearing Government which is perpetrating at this moment what we might term the rape of democracy? 
He went on to point out that every member had a right to speak in any debate whatsoever in order to express the point of view of the people he represents. The honourable member for Chifley suggested to you,  Mr Speaker,  that he would not use the word 'hypocrisy' because you would rule him out of order, and quite rightly, too. But let me tell you this: Webster's dictionary says that the actual prac tice of pretending to be. what one is not or pretending to have principles or beliefs that one does not have is an act of hypocrisy. I will not use the word because you would rule me out of order. 
1 see. I will not call anybody a hypocrite because you would rule that out of order, but l ask you,  Mr Speaker:  How would you describe a person who, when in the Opposition, complains about not having the right to speak on behalf of his constituents and says that he places on record his condemnation of the Government for its treatment of the people even more than for its treatment of the Opposition, but changes his attitude when his Party achieves office? The honourable gentleman to whom I have been referring is the honourable member for Grayndler  (Mr Daly),  who is now Leader of the House and is meting out to the House exactly the same treatment that he previously condemned. I ask you,  Mr  Speaker:  Would you describe a person who adopted such an attitude as a hypocrite? I will leave it to you. 
This Bill deals with Australian citizenship. Since the postwar immigration scheme started nearly 4 million migrants have come to live in Australia. Over 2.5 million of them have been British subjects. Of those not British subjects and eligible to aply for Australain citizenship because they have resided in Australia for 5 years, 701,448 had applied for naturalisation up until a little earlier this year. That is not as many as we would have liked, but it represents about 71.5 per cent of those who are eligible to apply for Australian citizenship. This Bill makes a number of changes. In the first place it changes the name of the ceremony from a naturalisation ceremony to a citizenship ceremony. This is an item with which I am thoroughly in accord and I believe that it meets with the approval of the Opposition. A number of migrants have asked me: 'What does naturalisation mean? Does it mean that until we become naturalised we have been unnatural?' I think this is an understandable change and a very happy one. 
The Bill also changes the age at which a person may apply for citizenship in his own right from 21 years to 18 years. I think this is a very sensible change, because at 18 years of age a person is now eligible to vote. The Bill seeks to reduce the period of residence after which a migrant may apply for naturalisation from 5 years to 3 years. Again I, am heartily in agreement with that. At the present time British subjects may apply for Australian citizenship by notification after having resided in Australia for one year. Alternatively they may apply for registration after 5 years. This Bill seeks to make it uniform for people of all nations to become eligible at the end of 3 years. I can see merit in making a uniform standard but I am not happy with taking away the preference which previously applied to British people enabling them to apply for citizenship after 12 months if they wished to do so. I am well aware that they lose no tangible advantages by having to wait 3 years. The Electoral Act provides that they should enrol for voting after 6 months, and they are entitled to vote whether or not they choose to become Australian citizens. I am well aware that they do not lose any opportunity to apply for permanency in the Public Service. Their British citizenship gives them that right. But we are basically a British country. We were settled by British people. I believe that we are losing or weakening another link with Britain by taking away the preference' which British migrants presently enjoy. 
For the same reason I am not happy with the deletion in the oath of allegiance of all reference to  Her  Majesty the Queen. This again is just another broken link in our ties with Great Britain. I think this is a great pity. As was mentioned by the honourable member for Darling Downs  (Mr McVeigh),  the Opposition will be moving an amendment to this clause. I am not happy with the deletion of the oath of renunciation. The honourable member for Darling Downs mentioned dual citizenship. If there is any merit in deleting the oath of renunciation I do not believe that now is the right time to do it because of the trouble we have been having at the present time with respect to Yugoslavia and dual citizenship in general, which applies to a number of countries. I believe that some Australian citizens could be placed at a disadvantage if they should return to the countries from which they came without having renounced their former allegiance. I believe that they ought to be able to go to those countries as Australian citizens on an Australian passport having made it quite clear that they have renounced their citizenship. I believe also that a lot of them are happy to renounce their former allegiances because they want to identify themselves with Australia. They have adopted Australia as their country and they are happy to become Australian citizens. They want to become part of the community in which they live. I do not believe that they are assisted by having divided loyalties, a situation which exists under dual nationality. This Bill cannot change that. It is something which can be changed only by the laws of the countries which at present recognise dual nationality. But I believe that we would make the position of migrants from those countries a bit stronger by including in the oath or affirmation of allegiance the act of renunciation. 
I think we ought to be encouraging migrants if we want them to become Australian citizens. I have already said that while 71.5 per cent of those eligible is a reasonable figure this is not as high a percentage as any of us would like to see. I think the best way for us to encourage migrants to take out Australian citizenship is to point out to them the advantages of becoming Australian citizens. I know that this is not a tangible advantage, but surely it is worth something to become part of a community in which one resides. Migrants cannot really become part of a community unless they participate on a level with their fellow Australian citizens. I think that most migrants would want to be at one with their children, and their children, whether the parents like it or not, surely will grow up as Australians. I think it is a great thing for the parents to be on a parity with their children. 
When migrants become Australian citizens they have the advantage of being able to choose the Government of the country in which they live. I do not believe that anyone should be in a position to criticise the government, from whatever side it may be drawn, if he has not cast a vote in the election of that government. In becoming Australian citizens, migrants have just as much say in choosing the government as anyone else. Their vote is just as valuable as that of any other citizen. If they choose to offer themselves as candidates they have an equal opportunity with other Australians to be elected as members of this Parliament, the State parliaments or local government councils provided that they get enough people to vote for them. 
I am one of those who believe that migration has contributed a very great deal to Australia's development. Migrants have changed Australia's eating habits. They have influenced almost every aspect of Australian life. They have added to Australia's culture and have become Australian in their outlook. I am not one who believes, as do some of the critics of our migration program, that migrants contribute to unemployment. On the contrary, I believe that they have created employment. It is a fact that at the time when Australia was taking its greatest number of migrants we had the lowest percentage of unemployment. I am sorry that the present Government has seen fit to cut the intake of migrants. I think that this is a mistake and I am not inconsistent in saying this. I said the same thing to the previous Government when it reduced the intake of migrants. I believe that our previous policy contributed to the employment of people but that if anything the present policy will contribute to unemployment. 
The present Government has announced that its main criterion in selecting migrants will be the unification of families, and that migrants should be nominated by families already in Australia. I think that on humanitarian grounds this criterion is quite sound. 
But I believe that if that becomes the main criterion and we discard our selectivity on the basis of employment, skills, and if qualifications are not essential, it is possible that many of our migrants could add to the pool of unemployment. If this is the case they will not become happy citizens and they W,11 be added to the pool from which likely returnees are drawn. In saying that, 1 want to point out that I do not believe that we ought to worry too much about migrants who return to their homelands. 1 believe that every country which has embarked upon an immigration program has had this experience. After all, people are very much more mobile today than they have ever been before. Many of the countries of Europe from which migrants have come are experiencing very much greater prosperity than before, and there are always people who are not prepared to settle in another country. Some of these people have the money and the mobility to get around and look at countries. If they like a country they may stay there. Many migrants want to retain their right to move around. 
If we want to retain the largest possible number of migrants who come to Australia we ought to be encouraging them to seek naturalisation and to want to belong to Australia. The Opposition is not opposed to quite a number of the changes which the Government seeks to bring about in this Bill. But we strongly oppose some aspects of the legislation, and, as has been mentioned, we will be introducing amendments to this effect at a later stage. 

 Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Armitage)I call the Minister for Immigration. 
Is the Prime Minister aware that last Wednesday's issue of the 'Canberra Times' carried a report of the Press conference which he held on the preceding day? Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his protest note on the nuclear tests, he said that the protest to China was oral so there would be no written response? Is the Prime Minister aware that on last Wednesday's 'A.M.' program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia's Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,'  lodged a protest note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? ls this another instance of the Prime Minister not being informed of actions taken by his Ministers or his departmental officers on matters which are under his direct control? 
My question is directed to the Treasurer and I preface it by reminding him that at present when an employee retires income tax is levied on 5 per cent of any lump sum he receives as a retiring allowance or superannuation payment. Is the Treasurer aware that there are very strong rumours that the amount on which income tax is levied on such lump sums is to be substantially increased? I have heard figures as high as 25 per cent of the amount mentioned. I further ask the Treasurer, while not expecting him to express an opinion as to whether there is any substance in these rumours, whether he will say to the House in an unequivocal manner that should any such legislation be introduced it will not be made retrospective in its application. In other words, any higher  amount of tax would not be levied on an amount which was paid prior to any such relevant legislation passing both Houses of the Parliament. 
 I refer very briefly to clause 37 of the Insurance Bill. This clause deals with exemption in respect of insurance business which is carried on for the benefit of limited classes of persons. I relate my remarks to the effect that this clause will have on some sections of the taxi cab industry. This industry throughout Australia has established insurance organisations to serve the industry's peculiar needs. I believe that none of these organisations has a paid up capital of $200,000. Under the general provisions of this Bill they would not be able to continue to operate were it not for clause 37. Sub-clause 3 (1) (b) and sub-clause (4) of clause 37 exclude from the operation of this clause any organisation which has an annual premium income exceeding $200,000. I understand that the Australian taxi cab industry has already made representation to the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  asking that this limit be raised to $600,000 per annum as the income of some of these organisations already exceeds $200,000 per annum while the income of others is expected to reach this limit fairly soon. Unless the amount of $200,000 per annum is increased, those companies which have presently or will have in the future an income exceeding $200,000 per annum from their premiums will be out of business. My purpose in rising is to ask the Treasurer whether he will give sympathetic consideration to the representations of the taxi cab industry and also look very sympathetically at clause 37 of the Bill. 
On 29 February last year the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam),  moved a motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister of that time. The words of his motion included an accusation that the Prime Minister in answering questions without notice had deliberately misled the House. During the course of the debate the then Leader of the Opposition stated that he had directed to the Prime Minister a simple enough question requiring a straightforward answer. He complained that instead of giving a straightforward answer the Prime Minister had chosen to give a tortuous and smart-aleck reply. I share his dislike for smart-aleck replies. For that reason I do not appreciate the smart-aleck reply the Prime Minister gave me in answer to a question which I directed to him on 15 May. It was surely a simple enough question requiring a straightforward and simple answer. I asked: 
Is the Prime Minister aware that last Wednesday's issue of the 'Canberra Times' carried a report of the Press conference which he held on the preceeding day? Is he aware that the report stated that, in answer to a question directed to him about whether he had received any response from the Chinese Government to his protest note on the nuclear tests, he said that the protest to China was oral so there would be no written response? Is the Prime Minister aware that on last Wednesday's 'A.M.' program  Dr Fitzgerald,  Australia's Ambassador to China, stated that his predecessor,  Mr Cotterill,  lodged a protest note with the Chinese Assistant Minister? Is this another instance of the Prime Minister not being informed of actions taken by his Ministers or his departmental officers on matters which are under his direct control? 
That was a simple enough question requiring a straightforward answer, but the smart-aleck reply given to me by the Prime Minister was as follows: 
I did not read the newspaper account. I did not hear 'A.M.'. 
The reply certainly was not tortuous but undoubtedly it was a smart-aleck reply. 
The Prime Minister knew perfectly well what he had said at a Press conference on 8 May in answer to a question directed to him by a pressman. It was not necessary for him to read the report of the conference in the daily Press to know that he had stated unequivocally that the protest to China was oral and that for that reason he did not expect a written response. I say that he did not need to read the newspaper report of what he said because he later issued a transcript of the entire Press conference. The relevant question and answer are stated in the transcript issued by the Prime Minister's Department. The transcript states quite clearly that the protest to China was oral so that there would be no written response. The conference was held on Tuesday, 8 May, so that the Prime Minister no doubt would issue the transcript a little later that day. As Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs he should have been aware that the Ambassador to China whom he appointed had stated in a radio interview that a protest note had been lodged with the Chinese Assistant Minister. If he were not aware that a note has been lodged he should have been so aware and that is the whole point of the question which I directed to him. 
Later in the day on 15 May during question time in the Senate  Senator Marriott  addressed a question to  Senator Willesee  who represents the Prime Minister in the Senate. He asked whether the Australian Government had made a protest to the Chinese Government about that country's nuclear atmospheric testing, whether there had been a protest and whether it had been verbal or written.  Senator Willesee  replied that a protest had been lodged and that it had taken the form of a letter from the Foreign Minister to the Chinese Foreign Minister. The Prime Minister, who is also Foreign Minister, must have written the letter of protest himself. Yet, he chose to give me the smart aleck reply that he did. This might be good enough for the honourable member for Werriwa but it is a long way from being good enough for the Prime Minister. However, it is in line with the misleading answers which he gave to a series of questions which had been directed to him and the Minister for Immigration  (Mr Grassby)  by the honourable member for New England  (Mr Sinclair)  - questions regarding the proposed visit to Australia of  Mr K.  T. Li of Taiwan. On 3 May 1973 the honourable member for New England asked the Prime Minister:   . . on what terms and conditions will  Mr  K. T. Li  be allowed to enter Australia in order to participate  in  this regional conference?  The conference referred to was of the Pacific Basin Economic Council. The Prime Minister replied: 
He would undoubtedly be able to come to Australia under the same conditions as any other person from Taiwan, that  is,  in any unofficial capacity. 

 Mr Li subsequently applied for a visa but his request was refused. On 10 May 1973, during question time, the honourable member for New England directed a question to the Minister for Immigration asking why  Mr Li's  request had been refused in view of the Prime Minister's assurance that provided he applied in an unofficial capacity  Mr Li  would be issued with a visa. The Minister promised to make inquiries. On IS May 1973 the honourable member for New England again directed a question to the Prime Minister asking him how he reconciled his change of attitude with respect to the refusal to grant a visa to  Mr Li.  The Prime Minister's firm reply on 3 May was that  Mr Li  would be issued with a visa provided he came to Australia in an unofficial capacity. The Prime Minister, of course, by that time had received his orders from Peking and he sought to blame the honourable member for New England for, as the Prime Minister said, blowing  Mr Li's  cover. He must have known that the honourable member for New England blew  Mr Li's  cover - I am using the Prime Minister's words - in his original question. The Prime Minister's assurance that a visa would be issued to  Mr Li,  provided  he  came to Australia in an unofficial capacity, was given with the full knowledge that  Mr Li  was at that time Minister for Finance in Taiwan, because the honourable member for New England said so, and also with the knowledge that a reception had been given in  this  Parliament on the previous day to representatives from North Vietnam. As I said earlier this conduct might be good enough for the honourable member for Werriwa but it is far from good enough for the Prime Minister of Australia. 
asked the Minister for Immigra  tion, upon notice: 
How many persons have been deported from Australia since 2 December 1972. 
To which countries have they been deported. 
How long was each of these persons resident in Australia. 
What was the (a) age and (b) sex of each deportee. 
What dependent relatives did each of them leave behind in Australia. 
What were the reasons for their deportation. 
asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice: 
Is there an Australian Capital Territory Ordinance which prevents the parking of motor vehicles on Camp Hill. 
My question is also directed to the Prime Minister. In view of the answers that he has given to the Leader of the Opposition and in view of the reference which he made to the existence of a Senate committee, will he- make available to that Senate committee an authenticated copy of the telex sent from the Canberra office of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to other branches of ASIO on 28 March? If not, why not? 
asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: 
Will he list all committees and commissions of inquiry, with their terms of reference, which have been established since his Government took office. 
What are the classifications and salaries of the public servants who staff each committee and commission. 
Are all the public servants listed employed fulltime on the inquiry. If not, what are the details. 
Will he seek similar information from the Presiding Officers in respect of parliamentary committees. 
I reject the Budget and support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden).  On 2 December last year many thousands of Australians were persuaded by the Australian Labor Party and by some sections of the news media that it was time for a change of government. It is now history that the Liberal-Country Party Coalition Government was voted out of office. I firmly believe that thousands of voters who supported the Australian Labor Party voted Labor for the first and last time in that election. Surely those who had not previously become disillusioned by the present Government's policies and performance were disillusioned last Tuesday evening when the Treasurer  (Mr Crean)  presented his Budget. So many of them have been horribly let down. They voted for the ALP full of hope that a new era had dawned and that the rate of inflation which the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  described as the worst in 20 years would be attacked and reduced. But the opposite has been the result. The Treasurer has said on a number of occasions that inflation did not begin on 2 December. This is true but it is also a fact that it had been falling steadily over the previous year. The Consumer Price Index moved from 135.8 for the 1971 December quarter, to 141.9 for the 1972 December quarter and this represents an increase of just under 4.5 per cent for the whole year. 
Between December 1972 and June of this year,, a period of 6 months, the index has moved from 141.9 to 149.7, a percentage increase of 5.5 per cent for the first half of this year. These are not my figures; they are Business Statistics' issued by the Bureau of Census and Statistics. I have not based these not the figures of the Liberal Party. I have quoted them from the 'Monthly Review of figures only on the December quarter which the honourable member for Adelaide  (Mr Hurford)  and the 'Australian Financial Review' from which he quoted have said to be unfairly favourable to the previous Government. I have taken out figures for the entire years. Furthermore, the figures for each of the 4 quarters of 1972 were better than those for 1971. The figures for the first 2 quarters of this year - the only 2 completed quarters - are substantially worse than for the first 2 quarters of last year. Should those figures be related to food prices which affect all families alike but particularly pensioners, basic wage earners and the battlers, the people whom the ALP claims to represent, the picture is far worse. 
When they are related to food prices the picture is far worse. I again wish to refer to a publication of the Bureau of Census and Statistics - the Bulletin of 17 August last. It indicates that food prices increased between July and December last year by 3.1 per cent at a time when the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office. For the first 6 months of this year food prices have increased by 11.1 per cent. In the period to the end of July food prices increased by 12.8 per cent and it is not very hard to find reasons for the increase. The Labor Government has given its blessing to the 35-hour week, 4 weeks' annual leave, equal pay and a substantial increase in the minimum wage with the flow-on which is consequential to that increase. 
Let me make it clear right at the beginning that I am not against any of those benefits. I believe that the Australian worker is entitled to the highest wages and the best working conditions possible but one does not have to be a Rhodes scholar or even the holder of a degree in economics to know that unless industry is able to produce much more in the shorter working week as well as pay higher wages and grant longer holidays, prices must rise. There is no alternative but apparently the Australian Labor Party does not recognise that fact. 
All people suffer from inflation, but particularly people on fixed incomes. I am not referring to pensioners in this instance but to the people who have provided for their retirement by way of superannuation or other savings and who at present are ineligible to receive pensions. Surely their interests should be protected. I have referred to pensioners and I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Mackellar  (Mr Wentworth)  who said last week after the Budget speech that pensioners have been short-changed. The Prime Minister said in his policy speech: 
All pensions  will be immediately raised by  $1.50 and  thereafter every  spring  and every autumn the  basic  pension rate will be raised by  $1.50  until it reaches  25  per cent  of  average weekly male earnings.  That is the promise. What is the record? An increase of $1.50 a week backdated to 14 December 1972 was made in the autumn session and an increase of $1.50 a week has been provided for in this Budget. As the Treasurer said last Tuesday night that a fur ther increase of $1.50 a week will be made in the autumn, my arithmetic indicates that the pensioners have been diddled out of $1.50 a week because the increase announced in the Budget should have been the third increase and not the second. I am sure the pensioners will not forget that because one of the last things that the Treasurer said in his Budget speech was: 'We will do what we said we will do'. Perhaps he can explain what happened to the promised autumn increase which has not been paid. The pensioners have surely been short-changed. Furthermore, the increases already paid and announced barely cover the increased food prices to which I have already referred and which to the end of July represent an increase of 12.8 per cent as compared with December prices. So I do not believe that pensioners have achieved very much towards gaining their promised rate of 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings because the March increase in the minimum wage has not yet been fully felt in increased costs. 
I mentioned earlier some of the causes of current inflation as the 35-hour week, 4 weeks' annual leave, equal pay and increased wages. To those I would like to add the production time lost by industrial stoppages. The Parliamentary Library Research Unit has provided figures on industrial stoppages for the first 5 months of this year, the latest period for which such figures are available. In that time industrial stoppages were 53 per cent greater than for the first 5 months of last year. This must certainly add to the cost of production and therefore to the present rate of inflation. Yet the Minister for Labour  (Mr Clyde Cameron)  said before the election: "There will be less industrial trouble under Labor because there will be no need for it.' There is no doubt that he should tell that to his boss -  Mr Hawke. 
It is my personal opinion that the reduction in our immigration intake must be a factor in the increased rate of inflation. It is common knowledge that Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd and other companies, including many in the building trade, are short of skilled tradesmen. If it is true that the supply and demand for goods influences costs and prices it is equally true that the supply and demand for skilled labour also influences costs and prices. The skilled worker is entitled to make the most of the opportunities available to him. If there is a shortage of workers in his trade and he can ask for higher wages, I say good luck to him. 
I do not criticise him, but it is a fact of life which cannot be ignored that higher wages mean increased costs. 
I have never believed immigration to be inflationary, but on the other hand I believe that the numbers of immigrants who have come to Australia together with their dependants have provided a steadily increasing local market for our primary and secondary industries. So much for the Prime Minister's promise in his policy speech that Labor would protect the consumers. What a lot of rubbish. The Treasurer said that the Budget will not add to inflation. Does he really believe that an increase of Se a gallon in the price of petrol will not add to transport costs? Does he believe that the elimination of the investment allowance and increased postal charges will not add to increased costs? If he says so he must be kidding because I do not believe that he is as naive as all that. 
I wonder whether the Treasurer can per.suade the residents of Canberra that the increases in the Australian Capital Territory in payroll tax and motor registration fees and an extra $10 a week rent for government houses will not add to inflation in this city. 1 believe that the young people of Australia as well as the pensioners have been shortchanged. The Treasurer said on Tuesday night: 
The Government proposes to introduce during tho coming autumn parliamentary session legislation to provide for a scheme of deductibility of mortgage interest - 
I think most young people expected it in this Budget but it has now been promised for next year. The Treasurer went on:  as promised in the policy speech - 
I want honourable senators to mark those words -  to have effect from 1 July 1974. In the light ot that we have decided to end the home savings grant scheme. 
To protests by members of the Opposition the Treasurer replied: 
If honourable members opposite will listen they will sec that we do not do things suddenly and that what we put back is better than what we take away. 
What did the Prime Minister say in his policy speech? He said: 
Labor will deliberately plan to reduce interest rates wherever practicable. Meantime, we propose that a limited tax deductibility be available for interest payments. This tax concession will be concentrated amongst the groups which bear the greatest burden. All taxpayers whose actual income is $4,000 or below will be entitled to deduct 100 per cent of their interest rate payments. The percentage of total interest payments which is deductible will be reduced by 1 per cent for every $100 of income in excess of $4,000. 
He said not one word in his policy speech about ending the home savings grant scheme. I wonder how many young people voted for this Government because of that promise. How many of them were disillusioned and felt that they also had been short-changed last Tuesday night? The Treasurer and Prime Minister have both expressed themselves very strongly and frequently about the inequity of the income tax scale. I completely agree with them and I have said so here. To me it is completely wrong that because the minimum wage is increased and all people on higher wages or salaries likewise receive an increase and they are all doubly taxed. And they are doubly taxed. Firstly, they pay more tax because they receive more money. This is reasonable, but in my opinion it is not reasonable that they should pay tax at a higher rate than previously. Relatively they are in the same position. It is past time that the tax scale was restructured. I regret that the Liberal-Country Party Government did not do it but I would have thought that this would have been one of the first things done by a Labor government. There is no doubt that this Government is pleased to take advantage of the extra money provided by this unfair scale to finance its very extravagant Administration. It represents an inbuilt jackpot for this Government. Last year, in spite of an increase in average unemployment of 2.5 per cent and the fact that average earnings increased by only about 9 per cent the Treasurer has budgeted this year for an increase in payasyouearn collections of 24.7 per cent. For income earners other than those on the payasyouearn system the tax collected is expected to rise by 33 1/3 per cent. Inflation suits this Government and it is apparently resigned to further substantial inflation because the Treasury expects average earnings to jump by 13 per cent in the current financial year whilst productivity is expected to increase by only about 3 per cent. Under the present tax scale taxes will be increased by an average of 27 per cent. This surely emphasises the injustice of the present system. 
Another hidden cost in consumer prices must surely be the requirement for companies to pay their taxation quarterly. This is fair enough in principle but in terms of money it means that companies will no longer be able to. earn interest on money which but for this change in legislation would have been in the bank or otherwise invested. This must reduce a company's earnings and to this extent increase its costs. I think it is fair comment to say that the Labor Party hates profits. It criticises companies for the amounts of profits they make. It considers, for example, $50m profit excessive, irrespective of what this amount represents as a return on shareholders' funds. This could be as low as 3 per cent to 4 per cent but this matters nothing to the ALP. The amount of itself is too much in the opinion of the ALP. The ALP is not even concerned with relating the amount of profit to the number of times capital has been turned over and obviously the question whether a profit is excessive or not is related to this matter. But Labor would not even think of this. Labor cannot even distinguish between interest on invested capital and profits. As I have said, Labor hates successful companies. 
The present Treasurer called the 1971 Budget a 'cynical collection of items'. I am quoting from an article that appeared in the Melbourne 'Herald' on 18 August 1971 following an interview with the Treasurer after the Budget Speech. The Treasurer is reported as having said: 
It lets the beer drinker off but it hits the petrol user. The brewery lobby was shrewd enough to organise. The petrol increase will make transport costs rise. 
It is strange, is it not, because what this Treasurer criticised in 1971 he has done in 1973. The beer drinker has been let off but the petrol user has been hit. Is it fair to ask the Treasurer whether the brewery lobby has been shrewd enough to organise? Is it also fair to ask him whether he agrees that if an increase in petrol tax in 1971 was inflationary it is equally inflationary on this occasion? Where is the increase in child endowment that the ALP has demanded with regularity each Budget time from the previous Government? If it believed that child endowment should have been increased in the past couple of years what has happened since 2 December last year to make this no longer urgent? 
The Government has made much of its intention to abolish university fees as from 1 January next year. I believe it was the presentMinister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  who expressed an opinion that the parents of many university students are well able to pay for their education. I believe this to be true and I would have thought that the money spent in this direction could have been used to greater advantage by giving greater assistance by way of living allowances, for example, to those students whose needs are greatest. 
I believe that the people of Australia made a mistake last December when they elected an ALP government. Some of them will have an opportunity in the by-election for Parramatta to demonstrate clearly that they are disenchanted with the ALP by voting very solidly for  Mr Phillip  Ruddock, the Liberal Party candidate. I ask the electors of Parramatta to remember that the rate of inflation which the Prime Minister described last year as the worst inflation in 20 years is today even higher under a Labor government. I ask the workers of Parramatta to remember that the average wage earner with a wife and 2 children, who, according to the Prime Minister, paid a higher proportion of his income in tax under the McMahon Government than under any government in Australian history, is paying an even higher tax under this Labor Government because it has not seen fit to alter the inequitable tax scale. I ask the pensioners of Parramatta to remember that an increase of $1.50 per week which was promised has not been paid. I ask the ratepayers of Parramatta to remember that in future if they are unfortunate enough to pay more than $300 a year in rates they will be allowed to claim no more than $300 as an income tax deduction. I ask the young people of Parramatta to remember that unless they contract to buy or build a home before 31 December 1976 they will not receive the home savings grant benefit which was granted by a Liberal-Country Party government. I ask the electors of Parramatta to remember that it was the present Prime Minister of Australia who said during last year's Budget debate, as recorded at page 515 of Hansard: 
The Australian citizen is not merely a wage-earner who pays income tax to the Federal Government. He is not just a taxpayer. He is a citizen who must buy land, build a house or rent one, raise a family, keep them and himself in health, travel to work, pay State charges, pay municipal charges, pay insurance charges. If the community, if governments by doing nothing or by deliberate action raise the cost of the other charges he must bear, then he is being taxed as surely and deliberately as he would be if the income tax were increased. 
That was said by the present Prime Minister. Has not that been done in this Budget? This Government has increased petrol tax and postal charges; it has reduced the permissible deductible amount for rates; it has increased indirect taxes which Labor professes to dislike, and it has done this in its own Territories. In its own Territories it has increased payroll tax, motor registration fees and rents. Last year it criticised the previous Government for increasing tax collections by 13.5 per cent when earnings increased by only 11 per cent. This year the Treasurer has blandly announced in one of the statements attached to the Budget Speech that 'in contrast to 1972-73, personal income tax liabilities will rise considerably faster than incomes'. In actual figures I believe he has stated that an increase in personal income of 13 per cent will result in an increase in tax collection of 27 per cent. This is a bad Budget for the little people and I am sure that the electors of Parramatta will show clearly that they endorse this view on 22 September next. 
Is the Prime Minister aware that a great number of Australians are very upset by the decision of the Governor-General not to attend Princess Anne's wedding? Is it a fact that this decision was made by the Governor-General on the advice of the Government? If that is the position, what is the pressing emergency which could not have been adequately handled in the circumstances by one of  Her  Majesty's State Governors in order that the people of Australia could pay proper respect to the Queen of Australia? 
 In the remaining minute or two of the time allowed for this debate, I should like to put a few facts on record. The honourable member for Chifley  (Mr Armitage)  said that the record of the present Government with regard to the use of the guillotine is far better than that of its predecessor. These are the facts: In the life of the last Parliament the LiberalCountry Party Government used the guillotine on 4 occasions. Admittedly, these 4 occasions involved 20 Bills, 17 of them in one instance. However, the fact remains that in 3 years the guillotine was used on only 4 occasions in respect of 20 Bills. As to the period during which this Government has been in office, in the 6 months since May last this is the ninth occasion on which the Government has used the guillotine, and those 9 occasions have involved 14 Bills. The Bills now proposed to be dealt with are three of the most important Bills that have ever been discussed. Surely those who have an opposite viewpoint with respect to the propositions to be submitted to the public as a result of these Bills should have he opportunity to explain to the public why they hold that view. The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  suggested that if these Bills were not guillotined 
Question put. 
That the motion  (Mr Daly's)  be agreed to. 

 - Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. 
 Mr Speaker,  I wish to make a personal explanation. 
Yes - by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly).  A few minutes ago the Leader of the House accused me and the teller from the Australian Country Party of acting irresponsibly when a division was called for by refusing to act.  Mr Speaker,  you will recall that while the present Government was in Opposition and when the honourable member for Sydney was one of the tellers, he, on at least one occasion, refused to act. I am quite sure that you would agree with me that the honourable member for Sydney did not act irresponsibly. The second point I want to make is that the Leader of the House suggested that some of my colleagues and I should spend some of our spare time in reading. Could I suggest, with respect, that he ask the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  to do some reading. If he reads the 'Parliamentary Handbook' and Who's Who' he will learn that the honourable member for Sydney has a birthday on 26 November and not on 14 November. 
I thank the Minister for the Environment and Conservation  (Dr Cass)  for making the report available to me towards the end of last week. I have read the report of the working party and I find that it endorses most of the recommendations with respect to kangaroos which were made by the Joint Select Committee on Wildlife Conservation of which I was  Chairman  in the last Parliament. That Committee unanimously opposed the uncontrolled harvesting of kangaroos. It recognised that at some times and in some places, kangaroo populations became too large and that some culling was necessary. But the Committee stated categorically that it believed that controls at all times should rest with governments. This view has been expressed by the working party and to this extent it endorses the view expressed by the Select Committee. But I also agree with that part of the report of the working party's submission which stated that the object of fauna conservation was to ensure the survival in reasonable numbers of all of our native fauna in the presence of man and his activities. I believe that any policy designed to achieve this must establish land use priorities because in my opinion the great majority of that section of our wildlife population which is under threat - and this applies to and includes quite a number of species of the kangaroo family - is threatened not because of hunting but because of the spread of civilisation which has gradually encroached on and eroded its habitat. 
The time to enlarge our national park and sanctuary system is now, before some species of the environment are irretrievably alienated. We have the opportunity of avoiding some of the mistakes made by a number of older countries. I think that we ought to take this opportunity now before it is too late. We do not want to waste our opportunities. Any harvesting program for kangaroos must include regulations with respect to age, sex and size, and I believe that only governments are capable of implementing these regulations. I do not believe that all private individuals who have a vested interest in kangaroo harvesting can effectively discipline themselves. Some can and do because they also have a vested interest in conservation, but as a result of the irresponsibility of some individuals I firmly believe that controls at all times should rest with governments. I support the recommendations of the working party and the views expressed by the Minister for Environment and Conservation. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
Not a great deal of time has been allotted for the debate on the estimates for the Department of Labour and the Department of Immigration. In fact, we have about 1 hour or  59i  minutes from now. As a number of my colleagues wish to speak on these estimates I will be as brief as I possibly can. I wish to direct my remarks to the estimates for the Department of Immigration and to express a point of view. I want to pay tribute to the overseas officers of that Department. I recently returned from a visit to South America. While there I took the opportunity to talk with our immigration officers in every country there in which Australia is represented. The officers to whom I spoke conformed to the pattern that I have come to expect from officers of the Department of Immigration. They were courteous, helpful and dedicated. 
I found that a great deal of interest in Australia prevailed in most of the countries of South America and that the interest has increased for a number of reasons - firstly, because of a general frustration with the policies of a number of governments in South America, and secondly because of the comparative lack of employment opportunities in South America. I firmly believe that we could double our present intake of migrants from that continent and that we could do so with great advantage to ourselves. In the past and currently Australia has been criticised for the quality of some of its present intake. I believe very strongly that the quality of some of the prospective migrants that are offering from a number of South American countries is far superior to that of some of the migrants who are presently coming to Australia to become permanent residents. Many of these people are well educated and well qualified in technical skills. A large number of them speak English. I believe that they would be an asset to Australia. If we could arrange to move these people by air we could bring some of them here very quickly. 
I said that these people would benefit Australia. It is well known that at the present time a number of commodities- are in short supply in Australia, and to some extent this is due to a shortage of labour. Surely a shortage of labour contributes to inflation, as does a shortage of any other commodity. Prices are fixed on the basis of supply and demand, and this surely affects wage levels. When skilled tradesmen are in short supply the amount of remuneration which they can demand - I do not quarrel with this - is higher than if a greater number of them were available. The fact that there are not enough to supply our requirements means that we are short in quite a number of directions. For those reasons I believe that we could with advantage increase our present level of intake of migrants. 
I have said on a number of occasions that I believe that the last Government made a mistake by reducing the level of our intake. It cut it down from about 185.000 to about 140.000. The present Government has repeated the mistake and is even worsening it by cutting the intake further to a figure this year of about 110,000. I have never believed that migrants take jobs which would otherwise be available for Australians. Every migrant who comes to this country has to be fed, housed and clothed. Migrants contribute very substantially to the home consumption of both our primary production and our manufactured products. They have contributed substantially to our manufacturing techniques and skills and to the total volume of our production. In many instances they have provided us with new industries. They have brought new industries to this country, and they have also brought in a considerable amount of capital. 
For the reasons I have stated, I believe that the contribution made by migrants very greatly exceeds the cost of the demand they make on Australia or on the public purse for increased services by way of roads, water supply, power supply, hospitals, schools and so on. If the Government were to give some consideration to the suggestion of increasing our present intake it would be doing something much more positive to reduce the present rate of inflation than that which would be achieved by its half-baked policy of price control, which has not worked in the past and is not likely to be any more successful in the future. I will content myself with saying that and hope that by sitting down now I will provide an opportunity for at least one of my colleagues to express a point of view. 
 I rise to register my protest at the removal of the age allowance for income tax purposes. This allowance was introduced by the Menzies Government to ensure that persons of a pensionable age who did not receive pensions would not have to pay tax on an income the equivalent of which in the hands of pensioners was tax-free. The Government devised a scale to ensure that this occurred and the scale also provided a very small tax advantage for those nonpensioners who were in receipt of a slightly higher income and in a higher bracket over persons who had not reached pensionable age but who had a similar income. I believe that this was not an unreasonable arrangement because many of these people who could have stayed at home and drawn a pension preferred to go to work. In doing so, they contributed to the national economy. This Bill, which we are now discussing in the Committee stage, not only removes this concession but also leaves some single pensioners $1 a week worse off than they were before. Some married couples are more than $4 a week worse off than they were before. 1 admit that as a result of this action quite a number of pensioners are in a better position than they were previously. But I am of the opinion that no pensioner should be worse off. The Labor Government has gone back already on one promise it made to pensioners. This was to provide an immediate increase of $1.50 a week following the election, and thereafter $1.50 a week every spring and every autumn until the pension reached 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. Not only have the pensioners been taken down for one of these increases of $1.50 because they have received only 2 increases since the Government came to office 12 months ago, but, by removing the age allowance in a time of high inflation and an increasing rate of inflation, this Government has left some pensioners worse off than they were before this Bill was introduced. I believe that this is inexcusable. On behalf of the pensioners I register my protest at what this Government has done. 
I ask the Minister for Health: Is he aware that the University of Melbourne has for 6 years or more been conducting research at the Royal Melbourne Hospital into a rare hereditary brain disease, Huntington's Chorea, which is reported to affect one in 12,000 Australians? The research project is  the only one of its kind in Australia and is one of the largest in the world. Since 1967 the group conducting this research has been receiving an annual grant of $13,000 through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The group has been told recently that the grant has been withdrawn. The doctor in charge of the group has stated that the research project is grinding to a halt because of a lack of funds. In view of the fact that the Department of Health has budgeted for an expenditure of approximately $600m this financial year, will the Minister explain why such a miserly amount of $13,000 cannot continue to be paid for this very important research project? 
 I direct a question to the Leader of the House. In view of conflicting reports as to the number of remaining days of sitting of this House in the current session will the Minister give an indication as to how many sitting days remain and the date of the final day of sitting? 
I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is it a fact that the Government is contemplating changing the date of Australia Day? If there is any truth in this rumour, will he state what new date the Government has in mind, and what is the purpose of the change? 
by leave- On behalf of the Opposition, I should like to say that we are happy to see that the Government has made this amount of money available for the purposes stated by the Minister for Science  (Mr Morrison).  If I have any personal criticism, it is that the amount is not large enough. The study was recommended by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Wild life Conservation, of which I had the honour to be  Chairman.  The Committee recommended that a biological study be carried out in relation to birds, animals and reptiles and their ecology. It is a well known fact that in the past many countries have destroyed unique areas of habitat which can never be replaced. It is also well known that hundreds of species of wildlife have disappeared and, in the main, this has been due to encroachment on their habitat and not because they have been hunted. 
We, as a Committee, considered that this survey was urgent, and I commend the Minister and the Government for making this amount available. I believe that before any development takes place in any virgin area of land it should be essential that an environmental impact study be carried out. For the present, the provision of this amount of money and the establishment of this Council are steps in the right direction and we completely support them. 
Members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party are completely opposed to these Bills for the reasons set out in our amendment. We believe that this legislation is unnecessary and that it will result in a great many Australians paying more than they are presently paying for a service which is inferior to the one they are presently receiving. We recognise that the present scheme has some defects and that it can be improved. We also believe that the deficiencies of the present scheme could have been corrected for far less money than the Australian Labor Party's legislation will involve. The ALP proposals are ill-conceived. They are born of misrepresentation of the facts and of the incorrect assumption that the benefit funds are wasteful. It can easily be shown that they are not. 
The whole of Labor's scheme has been based on a report prepared by a committee which comprised 2 economists and 5 public servants. No members of the medical profession were represented on the committee. There were no representatives of registered organisations which have had years of experience in this field. There were no representatives of the consumers - the general public. Surely, to have had the advice of such people would have been an advantage. In his second reading speech the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  set out why the Government had seen fit to bring in these Bills and why it considered the legislation to be necessary. But the Minister's speech was full of inaccuracies. It was full of misleading and entirely incorrect statements. As the legislation is based on false and misleading statements, it is clearly built on an unsound foundation. Let me illustrate what I mean. On page 4147 of Hansard, the Minister for Social Security gives the cost of the present scheme in providing direct subsidies to hospital and medical benefit funds, the cost of the pensioner medical and hospital services and the services provided for repatriation beneficiaries. He referred to the substantial indirect subsidy provided by way of taxation concessions and went on to say: 
A great deal of this money will be spent in propping up the ramshackle, inequitable and wasteful private health insurance scheme - a scheme which can only retain any facade of respectability through the injection of more and more taxpayers' money. 
The Minister pointed out that the average proportion of medical 'benefit refunds met by the Australian Government has risen from 45 per cent in 1969-70 to 56 per cent in 1972-73 and he went on to say: 
One of the reasons for all this is simply that the 90 health funds, with their separate and often extravagant managements, are wasteful. They unnecessarily accumulate large amounts of reserves. At the last count these reserves totalled S124m. 
The Minister for Social Security referred to these reserves as being unnecessarily large and he stated that approximately 15 per cent of the contributions to medical funds is lost in administrative expenses. I do not have the slightest doubt that the Minister deliberately confused the medical and hospital funds of benefit organisations and also the cost of administration of these funds. 
Firstly, the reserves of SI 24m to which he referred are almost entirely, if not entirely - I believe this to be the case - made up from hospital funds. The medical funds of all the major benefit organisations are in deficit. My authority for saying this is a publication issued by the Australian Department of Social Security entitled 'Operations of the Registered Medical and Hospital Benefits Organisations'. This publication was issued by the Minister's own Department. If the Minister doubts the figures of his own Department and requires further proof, he can obtain this by referring to the balance sheets of the larger funds. A perusal of the balance sheets of the largest organisations in my own State of Victoria will confirm that the medical funds are in deficit. The medical funds of the Hospital Benefits Association is more than S6m in deficit and those of the Manchester Unity and the Australian Natives Association, which are the next 2 largest funds, are each approximately $500,000 in deficit. As I said, these are the 3 largest organisations in Victoria. I point out that not $1 of the hospital fund reserves of these organisations can be transferred to the medical funds. The law, quite rightly, prevents them from doing this. 
Why do the benefit organisations need such large .amounts in reserve? It is because ordinarily it is common sense to hold such amounts for contingent liabilities. Actuarial advice to the funds confirms that they do not hold excessive reserves, particularly at a time when hospital charges in Victoria for public wards are of the order of $20, $30 and $40 a day. I refer to Victoria because I have a knowledge of that State. If Australia were unfortunate enough to suffer an epidemic, the run on these funds would be tremendous. Every benefit fund of this nature which has been built up by contributors' funds is required by government actuaries to provide for the contingencies I have mentioned. Life assurance societies and general insurance companies employ actuaries to advise them on the adequacy of the reserves held by them at any one time in order to ensure that their liabilities can be met. Even the superannuation fund to which members of this Parliament contribute 11.5 per cent of their salaries cannot increase the value of its benefits or reduce the amount of contributions merely because the fund continues to grow. The actuary requires that the funds shall be sufficiently strong to meet any emergency demand caused by the voluntary or involuntary retirement of members of this Parliament. It might have to meet such a demand if the present Australian Labor Party Government has to face the people with its national health proposals as the main issue 
When the Minister for Social Security claims that hospital fund reserves of SI 24m are unnecesarrily large, obviously he is speaking as a politician and not as an economist or a businessman with actuarial common sense.  His  statement is like so much of Labor's philosophy. Members of the ALP consider total figures but make no attempt to relate these figures to anything else. If a company makes $50m profit, Labor considers it to be too much. It is not concerned with what this amount represents in terms of a percentage return on shareholders' funds. It considers the $124m reserves held by the funds to be too great but it does not attempt to relate this figure to a contingent liability. However, somewhat paradoxically, the Minister has conceded elsewhere that substantial reserves are necessary to cover the older and normally uninsurable people. 
As I have said, these reserves have been built up from contributions and in saying that 15 per cent of the contributions is lost in administration expenses I believe that the Minister sought to imply that the cost of management of contributions made to both medical and hospital funds is more than 15 per cent. He went on to say that, with a government operated scheme, these rates would be cut in half. What are the facts? Again I should like to quote from a publication issued by the Minister's own Department to which I have already referred. It is entitled 'Operations of the Registered Medical and Hospital Benefits Organisation, and is for 1971-72, the latest report that is available from the Department. Page 24 of this publication shows that the management expenses of medical funds whose total contributions for 1971- 72 were $110m were 15.1 per cent of contributions. But the publication also shows that the management expenses of hospital funds to which members contributed SI 86m over the same period were only 8.2 per cent of contributions. The Minister did not mention this in the figures he quoted. I emphasise that the figures I have quoted are not figments of my imagination; they are figures produced by the Minister's own Department. If we work them out, we find that the average managment costs of both funds for the year 1971-72 were approximately 10.7 per cent of all contributions. With the larger amount of contributions which now operate, it is reasonable to assume that comparative costs would be lower in subsequent years. To say that a government fund could be operated at half these expenses is absurd. I should like the Minister to say whether his estimates include the cost to the Taxation office of collecting the 1.35 per cent levy on income. I feel sure that he has not taken this into account and that the cost of collecting this levy would be enormous. If this cost has been included in the Minister's estimate, will he be good enough to say so when he sums up and replies at the end of this debate? 
The Minister said that the average proportion of medical refunds met directly by the Australian Government has risen from 45 per cent in 1969-70 to 56 per cent in 1972-73. This is true. But why is it true? It is because of the scheme introduced by the Gorton Government, which ensured that where the most common fee was charged for any medical service, the patient would not have to bear more than $5 of the total cost of that service. It is also fair to assume that the 56 per cent cited by the Minister has fallen since, because in September of this year he forced the funds to bear the full increase of 10 per cent in all fees covered by Part 1 of the medical benefits schedule and this schedule includes the fees of the general practitioners, consulting physicians and specialists. 
It is also true to say that under the Gorton Government's scheme, where the most common fees were charged for operations which included an X-ray and also the anaesthetist's fee, the total cost to the patient was no more than $5 but under Labor's proposals these will be regarded as three separate services and the patient will be required to meet 85 per cent of the cost of each service or $5 for each service whichever happens to be the lower amount. Labor's health proposals are full of faults. It is obvious that there will be a greatly increased demand for public hospital beds. Pensioners will be competing with people who were previously debarred from receiving treatment in public hospitals because of a means test and many people will feel that in paying 1.35 per cent of their net taxable incomes they are paying enough and will not bother to re-insure for private bed treatment. 
If some of the private beds in private hospitals are converted to public beds, as they will have to be to meet the increased demand, fewer private beds will be available, thus reducing the patient's freedom of choice of doctor because there is no choice of doctor in public wards. Today some people are finding it difficult to obtain the services of a doctor when they need one and I believe this is likely to become progressively worse because many students today who would have been interested in becoming doctors have already been frightened by the threat of nationalised medicine. I believe that some medical practitioners have already left the profession for this reason. In the United Kingdom, where a nationalised medical scheme is operating, approximately 500,000 people are at any time on the waiting list for beds. Let me cite my authority for saying that. In September of last year an international conference of voluntary health service funds was held in London and the statement I have made was included in the report of the proceedings of the conference. It has also been widely reported in other publications. 
Experience has shown in other countries that where a medical service appears to be free there is a greater increased demand for it than where the patient is called on to meet part of the cost. I say 'appears to be free' deliberately because it is a fact that it is not free in those countries and it will not be free in Australia under Labor's scheme. People will be paying plenty indirectly through their normal income tax assessments in addition to the 1.35 per cent which they will pay on their net taxable incomes. This leads me to the Minister's charge, which has been repeated by many members opposite, that people in the higher income brackets get their health insurance on the cheap at the expense of people on lower incomes. This is rubbish, as an analysis will show. The cost of providing so-called free medicine has to be supported very substantially from Consolidated Revenue because the 1.35 per cent will met only a fraction of the total cost. I ask honourable members to reflect on which individuals contribute the greatest amounts to Consolidated Revenue. It is obviously the people in the higher income brackets. 
At present people have freedom of choice of funds and if they are dissatisfied with one fund they have the right to transfer to another without loss of privilege. If they arc dissatisfied with a government monopoly scheme they are stuck with it. There is no alternative. It is beyond question that there are inadequacies in the present scheme but these could be corrected for far less than the cost of implementing Labor's proposals, and heaven alone knows what that will be. It is a matter of record that the cost of the British scheme when it was introduced soon after the Second World War was budgeted at £200m. This figure was exceeded in the very first year of the scheme's operation and the budget for that same scheme this year is not £200m but £2,500m and very little of that money is going into capital works. This represents an increase of 1250 per cent which cannot be explained away by inflation. As an English economist said: 'When bread is free there is no limit to the demand for bread'. 
I believe that pensioners could have been included in the present scheme by the Government's paying to the funds the total cost of their contributions and this would have ensured that pensioners would receive exactly the same treatment as do the present contributors to the funds. The Minister's second reading speech was full of inaccuracies and the Government's legislation has been based on these misconceptions or untruths. The scheme is badly based and it is a bad scheme which will operate to the disadvantage of a great many people and organisations. It will operate to the disadvantage of private hospitals which will be called upon to make a percentage of their beds available for public wards thus upsetting their economy, and undoubtedly their private patients will have to pay more in the future than they are paying at present. The scheme will also operate to the disadvantage of many single taxpayers who at present pay only half the rates that are paid by a married man with a family. Under this scheme single taxpayers will pay the same rate as a married man with a family pays. 
The scheme will operate to the disadvantage of families where the husband and wife are both working, as they will each pay 1.35 per cent of their net taxable incomes. It will operate to the disadvantage of residents of Queensland who at present receive hospital treatment free of charge. It will operate to the disadvantage of persons in the middle and higher income brackets and to the disadvantage of persons in the defence forces who at present do not have to insure for hospital or medical benefits. It will operate to the disadvantage of persons who require private ward treatment because they will have to take out extra insurance to provide for it, and it will operate to the disadvantage of people who are unable to obtain standard ward accommodation in public hospitals because of the increased demand for public wards which will be created by this scheme. It will operate to the disadvantage of all taxpayers because the 1.35 per cent compulsory contribution that they make will not be an allowable taxation deduction as are their present contributions to health funds. For all of these reasons the Opposition finds these Bills completely unacceptable. 
My purpose in speaking at this time is to register a protest at the deteriorating services provided by the Post Office in quite a number of different areas. I informed the Postmaster-General  (Mr Lionel Bowen)  that I would raise these matters tonight and I told him of the items about which I intend to speak. My criticism is not of the Minister, except in one instance; it is a criticism of his Department. Last week I sent him 4 letters which, although correctly addressed by the sender, had been returned to the sender. I also sent him another letter on which the Post Office had altered the address to the correct address but, instead of the letter being delivered to the addressee, it was returned to the sender. 
I have here a $20 postal order about which I spoke to the Minister a couple of weeks ago. This postal order was issued at the Castlefield post office in Victoria. It was paid into a bank account and returned marked 'Not negotiable at present - refer to the Post Office'. My friend took the postal order to one of the chief post offices in Melbourne. There it was suggested that he should try cashing it at his local post office. When he took it to his local post office he was referred to the sub-agency which had actually issued the postal order and which, he was assured, would be prepared to cash it. The only trouble was that the sub-agency did not have $20. I spoke to the Postmaster-General about this matter and he said that if I provided him with the postal order he would give me the cash for it. I have the postal order with me and I thank the Minister for that offer. But on the back of this postal order it is marked clearly that the postal order is payable at any post office. This is not the way that this matter has worked out. 1 have a further complaint in regard to my own telephone account. On 7 November, at the post office here in Parliament House, I paid my telephone account, at least 2 weeks before the account was due. I have done this on a number of occasions previously. Three weeks later my wife rang me; she was quite distressed because she had had a telephone call from the Telephone Accounts Branch in Melbourne, saying that unless my account was paid promptly the service would be disconnected. She did not know that I had paid the account. I telephoned the Telephone Accounts Branch and explained the circumstances, namely, that the account had been paid at least 2 weeks previously at the post office here in Parliament House. This was noted and I thought that that fixed the matter. But last Thursday, without any further notice, my telephone was disconnected. On Friday, when I returned to Melbourne, my wife told me about it. I rang the Telephone Accounts Branch again and, I can tell you  Mr Speaker,  I was not very polite on that occasion. I said that I had paid the account on 7 November. An officer checked, and then apologised and told me that the account had been marked as being paid. I do not think that this is anywhere near good enough. 
I am waiting to see whether that happens. Last week a lady called at my office and complained that it now costs $1 a month to redirect mail. I know that this matter has been given publicity recently. Previously this service was provided free of charge by the Post Office. In this House last week - on 6 December - in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly)  about the downgrading of post offices, the Postmaster-General gave a reply. This is the one criticism I have of him personally. As reported at page 4373 of Hansard, he said: 
It is for that reason and because of the loss of $10m that is involved - and the only alternative way to make up the loss is continually to increase postal charges, which is something we do not wish to do and have not done - 
This is completely wrong. The present Government has increased postal charges, and it has increased them substantially. I want to illustrate that point. Before the last Budget it cost 7c to post a letter weighing up to 1 oz. For a letter weighing up to 2 oz. the rate was 12c. Since the Budget the new postage rate for a letter weighing up to 20 grams is 7c, representing an increase of more than 40 per cent over the previous rate, and for a' letter weighing up to 40 grams it is not 12c, not even 14c. but 15c, which is an increase of more than 75 per cent. I believe that the rates for priority paid mail, special deliveries and registration also have increased considerably. It is absolute nonsense for the Minister to claim that the Government has not increased postage rates. 
During the life of the last Government the Post Office reduced suburban deliveries in Melbourne - no doubt it did so in Sydney and in other capital cities also - from two per day to one per day. But it also increased postage rates. I am not blaming the Minister for this; it is a matter for his Department. I have found that many people have become increasingly dissatisfied with the service provided by the Post Office and increasingly critical of the Department. The fact is that while charges have increased substantially the service provided by the Post Office has deteriorated substantially. 
As the Postmaster-General will be aware, between 2 and 3 weeks ago Saturday mail deliveries ceased. I ask the Minister: Were postmen given the opportunity of voting on this proposal? Specifically, were all Melbourne postmen given the opportunity of expressing an opinion on this issue? If the answer is 'No, not all of them', what proportion of them were given a vote on this matter? 
The honourable member for Phillip  (Mr Riordan)  suggested that when members on this side of the House make charges they should have some basis to support them. I remind the honourable gentleman that the matter for discussion before the House now is: 
The failure of the Government to maintain adequate postal and post office services to the Australian community. 
I believe that I can substantiate this charge and 
I propose to do so. I believe that at a time when charges made by the PostmasterGeneral's Department are increasing the service is deteriorating. Let us examine mail deliveries first. Until recently mail was delivered on 6 days a week. Now it is delivered on 5 days a week because there is no delivery on Saturdays. It is a fact - I have experienced this at home and at my office - that the mail which we receive on Mondays is now delivered considerably later than it used to be delivered because 2 days' mail has to be sorted before that delivery can be made. 
Today I directed a question to the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr Lionel Bowen).  He referred to it when he spoke in this debate and he suggested that I asked about something else altogether - about overtime or something else. I have the green Hansard proof here and I shall read the question I asked the PostmasterGeneral. I asked: 
Were postmen given the opportunity of voting on this proposal? 
His answer was an unequivocal yes. I believe that someone has misled the PostmasterGeneral because I do not believe this to be the fact. I have been told by quite a number of postmen- 
I will tell you. I have been told by a number of postmen that they did not have the opportunity to vote. They just did not get a vote. They made the point that they had to make up the time that they lost on Saturday during the week and it was costing them up to $10 a week. I prefer to believe these postmen rather than the person who gave the information to the Postmaster-General. 
You must think I am naive. I name them and then they are victimised. 
You know very well. If they are willing to make statutory declarations to that effect, I will get them to do so. I am not accusing the Postmaster-General of doing anything wrong. I am saying that whoever told him that the postmen were given the opportunity to vote misled him because all of them did not get a vote. I quote the Postmaster-General again. In case I do him an injustice, this is a quotation from the 'West Australian' of 18 February 1974. The Postmaster-General, according to that newspaper, in referring to the staff of post offices stated: 
Their position could not be compared with postmen, who up to last week worked 40 hours in  Si  days with no overtime for compulsory Saturday work. 
Today he referred constantly to the overtime they are receiving. If that statement is incorrect he ought to say so. The point is that the postmen have told me themselves that they were receiving overtime, and this is why they will lose up to $10 a week for not working on Saturday. So that argument is not correct. 
What I am saying is not a criticism of the postmen, for whom I have the highest regard; it is a criticism of those who push them around, and if that cap fits any one at all I suggest that he wears it. The 'Australian' of 22 February said: 
Australia's 7,000 postmen will stop Saturday mail deliveries from tomorrow under an agreement with the Post Office. 
I would like to know by whom that agreement was made. It might have been made by  Mr Slater  from the union. The postmen suggested to me that he made the rules, on which they did not receive a vote. On 11 November last year during the adjournment debate I raised the matter of increased postal charges. I said that the Minister had stated in this House that postal rates had not been increased. He said that in answer to the honourable member for Wakefield  (Mr Kelly).  He repeated it to me. I do not have enough time to read the exact words but the fact is that prior to the last Budget up to 28 grams or 1 oz could be posted for 7c. Today it costs 7c to post up to 20 grams. This represents an increase of at least 40 per cent. One could have posted 2 oz or 56 grams for 12c. It now costs 15c to post 40 grams. This represents an increase of 75 per cent. The Minister claimed that a letter could still be posted for 7c and that there had been no increase. I suggest that he try convincing a housewife who buys breakfast foods or soap powders that, if she pays the same price but the contents in the carton are severely reduced, the price has not risen. Let him try convincing a person who smokes cigarettes that, if the price remains the same but the number in the packet is reduced, the price has not been increased. Let him try that. I think he will have a rude awakening. 
The Minister also said that Australian postal rates were better than those in most other countries. He pointed out that in this country first class mail goes by air and he said that there were very few countries which had to carry mail by air as far as we do here. He mentioned the distance from Sydney to Perth. Let us take the countries comparable in size with Australia or larger than Australia. In the United States of America, which has a slightly larger area, the rate for surface mail is equivalent to 6.7c Australian for 28 grams and 4.8c Australian for 20 grams. If they want to send it by air the rate is equivalent to 6.2c Australian for 20 grams, as compared with our rate of 7c. Let me cite Russia, a country which honourable members opposite are fond of citing. If the Minister doubts my figures let him talk to members of the delegation who are here today. In Russia it costs the equivalent of 4c Australian to post a letter by surface mail. The internal airmail rate costs 6c as against 7c here. In Canada, which is again of comparable size, it costs the equivalent of 5.5c Australian for 28 grams and 3.9c for 20 grams. In Canada all first class mail goes by air. The Minister can see that the story he told in regard to Australia's distances and rates is not accurate. 
For the information of the PostmasterGeneral, post offices are open on Saturdays in Russia, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. They have mail deliveries on Saturday in Russia and in the United Kingdom. I was not able to obtain up to date information for the United States, but until  2i  years ago, which was the time covered by the latest information I received, they were still delivering mail on Saturdays. I have taken countries - the United Kingdom still has 2 deliveries a day in London and the suburbs - which should be acceptable to the Government as examples and which are of a comparable size. 
The Minister referred to providing services to the public through milk bars. What did the great Amalagmated Postal Workers Union do? 
It threatened anybody who sold stamps in that way that if his telephone went out of order it would not be repaired, his milk bar would be boycotted and there would be no mail handled either to him or from him. I believe that the Postmaster-General's Department could provide a 6-day service to the public and still give the postmen a 5-day week by rostering the staff. It will interest the Postmaster-General to know that the information I obtained from the Russian Embassy was to the effect that not only are post offices in Russia open on Saturdays but they are open on Sundays also. They provide a 7 day a week service. 
The Sydney 'Daily Telegraph' of 17 February referred to the action of the unions in banning Saturday work. I say 'the unions' and not 'the postmen'. The article said: 
If others took the same approach there would be no power, no water, no public transport, no police, no shops, no flying, no entertainment, no petrol, no milk, no television, radio or newspapers - in fact, the community would come to a standstill. 
I would like to refer the Postmaster-General to an experience I had on Saturday night. He has said that one can still send telegrams by phone. What he did not say was that they will not be delivered. Perhaps he says: 'Yes. You pay a porterage charge'. In case anyone thinks that it is 50c or $1, let me tell him that the porterage charge is a taxi fare from the capital city to the place where the telegram is being sent. It may be 30 miles, 40 miles or even interstate. If it is the fact that the message could be delivered by telephone, the staff did not tell anybody. Before I sit down I want to point to the fact that during the speech of the last honourable member on the Government side, in addition to the Minister- 

 Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Scholes)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.  (Mr Fox continuing to speak)  - 
 Mr Speaker,  I crave your indulgence to express a point of view on this matter, particularly in view of the 'fact that a number of Opposition members also missed this division. First of all, the blue sheet which was circulated before lunch today set out very clearly the times at which the votes were to be taken. So I believe there was no excuse for any member, from either the Government side or the Opposition side, not being here for the vote. Secondly, I point out that Government members in particular knew that they had to have an absolute majority  -  63 members - in the House in order to carry the Bills; so there was less excuse for their not being present. Thirdly, I point to the voting figures in the division in question, which were 57 votes for the Government and 51 votes for the Opposition - indicating that in view of the fact that the Government had 67 members in attendance or, allowing for yourself  Mr Speaker,  66 votes, 9 Government members missed the division hut only 3 Opposition members missed it, as we had 3 members away due to their own illness or illness in the family and our Leader, the right honourable member for Bruce  (Mr Snedden),  did not vote at any time today. So 3 Opposition members missed the division and 9 Government supporters missed it. This matter ought to be noted because I think it is very disproportionate. 
I refer briefly to a matter which was introduced into this debate by the Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  and to which some reference was made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Lynch)  and the  Deputy  Leader of the Country Party  (Mr Sinclair),  namely, the volume of legislation which was passed in the last session of this Parliament. The Leader of the House seems to take a great deal of pleasure from, or perhaps I can accuse him of boasting of, the great volume of legislation which was passed. As the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition pointed out, surely we should be concerned with quality rather than quantity. 
The honourable member for Corio  (Mr Scholes)  said that the Leader of the House stuck rigidly to the 11 o'clock adjournment. He certainly did, but at what cost? At a cost to members who had a point of view to express. Earlier today the Leader of the House said that he was all in favour of giving honourable members the maximum amount of time possible in which to express their points of view. At the end of each session the government of the day, whichever it happens to be, issues a set of figures showing the volume of legislation passed, the days and hours on which the Parliament sat and so forth. I want to quote figures for the life of the 3 years of the previous Government and compare them with figures for the first year of the Labor Government. As honourable members can imagine, some of these figures have been provided by the present Government and probably by the Leader of the House. In the 3 years during which the previous Government was in office it applied the guillotine on 4 occasions. During one year only of the rule of the Australian Labor Party the guillotine was applied 10 times. Even yesterday, which was only the second day of sitting of this Parliament, the guillotine was used. During the 3 years of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government it used the gag on 223 occasions. Last year the Labor Party used it 103 times. When it comes to the use of the guillotine and the gag the previous Government was like a team of schoolboys playing in a big league. We were amateurs up against a team of professionals. I shall not refer, as did the 3 previous speakers, to the adjournment of sittings and the adjournment debate because that is the subject of the next motion on the notice paper and I will say something about this matter when that motion is before the House. 
I want to say on behalf of the Opposition that we are not opposing this motion, but I do want to point out quite a number of things. The Leader of the House  (Mr Daly)  said earlier today that he is in favour of improving the prospects of private members to express their point of view. I remind the House that when we on this side were last in government we gave a minimum of 2 hours each week for the adjournment debate. We had one hour between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock on Wednesday evenings and one hour between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock on Thursday evenings. The minimum time for the use of members was 2 hours. If they chose to take less, that was up to them. In the last session this Government reduced that period of 2 hours to13/4 hours by providing for the motion for the adjournment to be put at 10.45 on Tuesday night and at 10.15 on Wednesday night and Thursday night. So this Government cut down the speaking time on the adjournment debate from 2 hours to13/4 hours. This proposal cuts the time further to11/2 hours a week. This means that fewer members will be given an opportunity to speak on the adjournment debate because with only 30 minutes available each night only 3 speakers can participate in the debate. 
The Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant)  referred to a report of the Standing Orders Committee. That report has not yet been presented to the Parliament. There is no mention in this motion of any other speaking time so we have to take it on the basis that until something else is put forward speeches on the adjournment debate will last for 10 minutes. This means that only 3 speakers will be accommodated. Last night a motion to suspend the Standing Orders in order to facilitate the passage of certain Bills without delay meant that the House did not move to adjourn at 10.15 as should have happened. It was actually 10.47 when the motion was put and this meant there was only enough time for one  speaker  to speak on the adjournment. So 
I say that the Leader of the House speaks with 2 voices. His actions do not match his promises. He says he wants to provide the maximum amount of time for members to express a point of view. He should put it into practice by tacking on a quarter of an hour to restore the available time to 2 hours instead of reducing the time further by a quarter of an hour. 
Tonight I wish to refer to 2 matters in the adjournment debate. The first of these is the lack of parking facilities for staff at Parliament House. I told the Minister for the Capital Territory  (Mr Bryant)  that I intended to raise this matter tonight and I am glad to see him here. When I talk about the staff at Parliament House I am referring in particular to female staff. My secretary has been summonsed 11 times, each summons carrying a penalty of $4. She has received a final notice of $50. Another person, a member of the female staff on the Government side, has received 26 summonses, each carrying a penalty of $4, and a final notice of $50. Each of these girls has said that she would rather go to gaol than pay the fines. I am completely behind them in the stand that they have adopted. 
There are 2 parking areas in close proximity to Parliament House but both of these are used by persons who are employed in East Block and West Block. The people who are employed in those areas begin work at 8.30 in the morning whereas the staff at Parliament House begin work at 9 o'clock. By the time they arrive here most of the area available, if not all of it, has been taken. The only other area available is Camp Hill. There are 2 ordi nances which, if they were enforced, make parking on Camp Hill illegal. Fortunately, these ordinances have not been enforced. To the credit of the Minister, I want to say that when I drew his attention to this matter he told me that he would consider it favourably. 
I am concerned about what will happen in the future. Let us take the area of Camp Hill. Not only is it illegal to park there but also the area has a rough surface, it is not well paved, it is mainly unlit, there is a hedge which hides part of this area from the road, and quite a number of thefts have taken place in this area. I know that one employee of this House lost 4 wheels of his car. I am told that in recent months somebody else got into his car, started it, tried to drive it away and found that he could not. When he got out of it to inspect he found that the car hadbeen jacked up and that the 2 rear wheels had been taken. There have been other thefts of headlights, hub caps and petrol caps. 
Last year I placed on notice a question which I addressed to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (MrUren). In answer to me he advised that members of staff should make use of Commonwealth cars. He also said that they could use public transport. The point is that after 11 p.m. the public transport is not the best in this Territory anyway and for some of the outlying areas in which these girls reside public transport is practically non-existent after midnight. Cars will be and are provided for staff who want to go home at late hours of the night but they are not provided to bring people to work in the morning. If a person happens to live in Queanbeyan or in areas like that he has to drive himself to work. What is the good of going home in a government car or taxi if he has left his car behind here and has to get to work the next morning? So these people have to drive their cars home. 
If they did make use of Commonwealth cars this would place an even greater strain on the car pool which is already overstrained at peak hours. Honourable members themselves know that at times it is very difficult to obtain a Commonwealth car at the right time. I want to make it quite clear that if my daughter were employed in Parliament House I would not want her to have to go to her car between 11 p.m. and midnight if it were parked up on Camp Hill. I have given the reasons for this. The Government should not wait until one of thesegirls is molested before taking some action. I believe it is crazy that we provide parking areas, even though they are limited parking areas, for visitors to this Parliament. Some of them will be paying only one visit to Canberra and to Parliament House in their lifetime but we provide parking areas for them and we neglect the staff who work in Parliament House. I do not believe that the problem is insurmountable. When new buildings are built car parking space is provided. I think it is fairly generally accepted that this Parliament House building will have to suffice for another 10 years. 
Well, a minimum of 10 years. Even if they said the word 'go' tomorrow for a new parliament house the opinion is that it would be 8 to 10 years before that building would be ready for occupation. We ought to be providing parking space in proximity to Parliament House for the staff who work here now. We should not have to wait another 10 years. I am referring particularly to female staff. I do not want to have to wait until someone is molested before the Government does something about it. I presented a petition to the House this morning. I know that the Minister is sympathetic. I hope that he will give earnest consideration to this matter to see what can be done. 
The second matter to which I refer concerns the ringing of the bells of this House. I refer to the incident yesterday when the Government failed to obtain an absolute majority because the bells rang for only 1 minute and 26 seconds instead of for 2 minutes. I am satisfied that they rang for only that time because I listened to the tape myself. I put a stop watch on it. They rang for only 1 minute and 26 seconds. I want to make it quite clear that in what I am saying tonight I am not reflecting on you,  Mr Speaker.  I am not reflecting on the Clerks. I am not reflecting on Hansard. No reflection on anybody is intended. This is something that happened. I remember that 2 or 3 years ago when we were in Government we were counted out on one occasion because we failed to make a quorum within the 2 minutes allowed. I believe that 2 minutes is not long enough. I know that quite a number of honourable members find it difficult to reach the chamber within 2 minutes. I believe it is possible that on the occasion when we were counted out there was a malfunction. It is hard to explain but it could have happened. 

 Mr Speaker, I want you to carry out a further investigation so that the same thing does not happen again. You told the House yesterday,  Sir, that  after the investigation had been carried out the sandglass had been found to be operating correctly. There is no way in the world in which the sand could run through faster or slower than the normal 2 minutes. You made it quite clear on 2 occasions that you were not listening to the bells but were watching the sand. Theoretically, what should happen is that when  Mr Speaker  says Ring the bells' the sandglass is turned, and when the sand has run out  Mr Speaker  says Lock the doors'. This is what should happen. I do not know what went wrong and I do not want to reflect on anybody or make any accusations. All I am asking is that, for the future working of this House - it does not matter whether it affects the present Government or the present Opposition - you,  Mr Speaker,  make a further investigation so that the same thing does not happen again. 
On the last day of the final session of 1973 the Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  bored this House for H hours by talking of the achievements of himself and his Government. If he had spoken with the same verbosity and the same dedicated loquaciousness about what he and his Government had failed to do or had done badly his speech would have been much longer. Let me illustrate what I mean. Interest rates have never been higher, despite the fact that the Party in office - the Australian Labor Party - prides itself on being a low interest Party. As  Sir Henry  Bolte has inferred, the Labor Party has no doubt put up interest rates so that it will be able to make a good fellow of itself later on by reducing them. Inflation is at its highest level for more than 20 years. Who has to pay for this? It is not the present wage and salary earners because their wages and salaries are adjusted to meet the rate of inflation, although they are paying far too much in taxes at the present time. I know that cuts will be made later in the year. The Treasurer  (Mr Crean' has said that this will be done. But wage and salary earners are paying far too much at present and the proposed cuts will not  hi  made retrospective. The Leader of the Opposition  (Mr Snedden)  pointed out today that taxation collections from private income earners - not from companies - will increase by $ 1,500m over last year's figure. That represents $200 for every person in Australia who pays income tax. 
Today's Sydney 'Sun' carries a story on page 4 entitled "The Extra Hours You Work To Pay Your Bills'. It lists a whole host of food items and shows how their prices have increased between March 1972, when the Liberal-Country Party coalition was in government, and March 1974. The increases go to as high as 92 per cent for potatoes. Surely they are a very staple diet. The article also points out that people now have to work 30 per cent longer to pay the same food bill that they had to meet when the Liberal-Country Party Government was in office 2 years ago. The honourable member for Port Adelaide  (Mr Birrell),  who is interjecting, is all mixed up. He is like the fully clothed man who streaked through a nudist colony. The people who are feeling inflation most of all are those who retired on fixed incomes, whether they be superannuation or annuities, and those who left their money in banks or in some other form of liquid investment. They are watching the value of their savings steadily deteriorate. It is not of much use to them to receive 8 per cent or 10 per cent interest on their savings if the capital value is going down by 13 per cent or more each year. I am not suggesting that the actions of the present Government have been the sole cause of the inflation; that would be absurd. But I do believe that the Government has contributed to the present high rate of inflation in a big way. 
Just consider the effect of the interest rates I have already mentioned on the inflationary spiral. Add to that the increased Government charges as a result of the last Budget. To mention just a few, I refer to the increased petrol tax, the increased postal charges and the limitations placed upon taxation deductions for land taxes and for rates. Add to that the cost of the increase by the Government in the number of departments by the net figure of ten and the very much higher number of divisions in the Public Service. Add to that the cost of the 35-hour week proposal, the 4 weeks annual leave proposal, the equal pay proposal and the 17i per cent Christmas loading as well as the increased wages. All those things are all right provided there is increased production, but without increased production there has to be inflation. Add to that the cost of industrial strikes, which has been very much higher during the period that the Labor Party has been in office than they were when the LiberalCountry Party coalition was in governme.it, and the consequential loss of wages. Add to that the cost of the Prime Minister and his Ministers and their retinue tripping around the world. Is it any wonder that the  rat3  of inflation is so high? 
The Government has not only greatly increased interest rates, which has made it very much harder for persons to buy their own homes, but also has kicked the young people in the teeth by phasing out the home savings grant scheme that was introduced by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. It is of no use the Government saying: 'But we are going to give an allowable deduction for interest paid on the purchase of a home', because we on this side of the House also promised that in our policy speech. If we had been returned to government we would have introduced concessions with respect to the interest paid on the purchase of homes which would have benefited the poorer sections qf the community to a much greater extent than Labor's scheme. The important thing to remember is that the Labor Party did not say in its policy speech when it announced these concessions that it proposed to phase out the home savings grants scheme that, as I have said, the previous Liberal-Country Party Government introduced. I believe that the Labor Party pulled a confidence trick on the young people of Australia. It is not only gradually depriving them of this grant but also has pushed interest rates to a figure which has made it very much more difficult for young people to buy homes. Perhaps that is because the .Labor Party still believes in the philosophy it followed years ago, that to encourage people to own their own homes is to create a race of liberal capitalists. The young people who fell for this confidence trick in December 1972 will not forget it when the Prime Minister chooses to give the people another chance to express themselves. 
The Government has made a very big deal about the reduction in tariffs on domestic appliances. On 23 January of this year the Prime Minister issued a statement about this matter. For those honourable members who want to check it I point out that the number of the statement is 177. Leaving aside the fact that a reduction in the tariffs on imported goods could endanger the jobs of some Australian workmen, I believe that the Australian people were entitled to believe that they would be able to purchase imported domestic appliances at a lower price. What the Government did not tell the public was that at the time it reduced tariffs on a wide range of items from most countries it pushed up the tariff rates on goods imported from the United Kingdom. This fact has been brought to my notice by a Melbourne firm which imports from the United Kingdom refrigerators of a size which is not made in any quantity in Australia. I refer to 1, H, 2, 2i and 3 cubic foot refrigerators and the horizontal type refrigerator rather than the vertical type. The duty on them was increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. So anyone purchasing a refrigerator manufactured in the United Kingdom will pay more, not less, for it. Last night I received a telephone call from a friend who is importing 3-dimensional pictures from Japan. They are not being manufactured in Australia. He hired a team of Japanese photographers to photograph beauty spots in all States of Australia for reproduction of 3-dimensional pictures 11 inches by 14 inches. These people have taken their pictures and have returned to Japan. Because this man believed that the prices could go up this year he placed orders for his entire reequirements for 1974 during 1973. The rate of duty on them was 7 per cent. When it introduced its tariff cuts the Labor Government cut the rate of duty to 6.25 per cent, but only very recently it increased the rate to 35 per cent, which is 5 times as great as the original duty. I wish the Government would tell the people what it really means when it talks of tariff cuts. 
The Government has reduced the value of Commonwealth secondary scholarships. It has made the means test so much harder to meet that it is almost impossible for a family in which the wife chooses to work to qualify because the family income is taken into consideration. The Labor Government talks about an assessed, seasonal or adjusted family income, which allows for a deduction of $300 for every child undergoing full time primary or secondary education. One can also take off a car allowance. This means that a person on an adjusted income of $4,545 per annum or $87.40 a week, which is very much below the average weekly male earnings, receives a Commonwealth secondary scholarship of the magnificent sum of $15 per annum. But the Government requires people who. are applying for them to fill in 5 pages of information before they can qualify. It asks them to estimate their income for 1974. I ask: How can anyone estimate what his income will be in a time of inflation that is as high as applies under the present Government? It is absolutely ridiculous. That is what is happening under a government that pretends it represents the battler. The Liberal-Country Party Government provided secondary scholarships to the total value of $400 of which $150 was free of means test. It has reduced the total value of a scholarship to $304 and has introduced a very tight means test. I believe that the answer to the problem lies here. We, in our last year of office, spent $8,500,000 on Commonwealth secondary scholarships. On the Government's own figures, its estimated expenditure for this year on Commonwealth secondary scholarships is $3m. 
I am sure that the primary producers will not forget the desire of this Government to phase out the bounty payable on superphosphate. By doing this it will be adding further to inflation because it will make primary produce more expensive. It will make food manufactured from primary produce more expensive. I am sure that people in country areas will not forget the inconvenience to which they have been put by the elimination of Saturday mail deliveries. The Post Office does not even sort mail on a Saturday so that people who pay for private mailboxes might obtain their mail deliveries as usual on Saturdays. The curtailment of mail deliveries on Saturdays affects all people whether they live in cities or in country towns. But many people in the country depended on the mail delivery on Saturdays to receive their local newspapers. Now they have to wait until Monday to receive them. 
I am sure that the people generally will not forget the greatly increased postage charges imposed on all types of mail nor the closing of post offices on Saturday. I pointed out when a matter of public importance was being debated in the House that in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics which members of the Government are fond of citing opens its post offices on Saturdays and Sundays to give a 7-day week service to its clients. People will not forget that the Post Office will no longer hold mail or redirect mail without imposing a charge for this service which was previously provided free of charge. Migrants will not forget the door knocks which followed the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation fiasco last year when the Attorney-General  (Senator Murphy)  raided ASIO headquarters. 
Recently the Government caused a poll to be conducted of 60,000 people to find out what tune or composition they favoured for the Australian national anthem. The Government now boasts that the people voted overwhelmingly in favour of 'Advance Australia Fair'. I have nothing against that song. But why did not the Government give the people an opportunity to vote on whether they wanted a new national anthem? It did not do so for 2 good reasons: Firstly, big brother in the form of the Australian Labor Party Government decided that it wanted a new national anthem. Secondly, the Government was afraid of the result of the poll. It knew that the people would vote overwhelmingly in favour of the present national anthem. The next thing that the Government probably will want to do is to change the design of the Australian flag. 
I hear an honourable member interject: 'That is right'. If it does I am quite sure that it will not give the people the opportunity of voting on whether they want to retain the present flag or not. During last year the Government sounded out the prospect of altering the form of observance for Anzac Day. But the Australian ex-servicemen made it very clear that they did not want a bar of the change proposed by the Government. Probably the next move of the Government in the direction of altering all presently accepted traditions will be to try to change the date of Australia Day. I say to honourable members opposite: Ask one of your Ministers if you do not believe this. If this is to be contemplated I hope that the people will be given a chance to vote on it. The Government is prepared to hold 5 referenda in conjunction with the forthcoming Senate election. If it is so fond of seeking people's opinions on a host of matters, why does it not put its own credibility to the test and its future on the line by holding an election for the House of Representatives on the same day as the next Senate election? The Prime Minister wants to alter the Constitution to do this and he can do it now. This would give the Australian people a good opportunity to say whether or not they wanted to give a mandate to the present Government. But again, I suggest the Government is not going to put its performance on the line or its credibility to the test. 
The Government has not been game to take a stand against the Aboriginal embassy on the lawns outside Parliament. I want to make it clear at the outset that I have nothing whatever against the Aboriginal people. I believe that they are entitled to battle for a far better deal than they are curenntly receiving. This does not mean that I believe that merely increasing the amount of expenditure is the answer to the problem. It is the questions of where the money is spent and how it is spent that really count. I "believe that the Aboriginal community ought to be consulted much more than is being done on matters affecting the welfare of that community. But it is my opinion that the erection of a number of unsightly tents on the lawns in front of Parliament House is a disgrace. 
I make a suggestion to the pensions of Australia who are far from happy with the deal that they are presently receiving in view of the fact that the Government promised to increase the rate of pension to 25 per cent of average weekly male earnings. I suggest to pensioners that they also erect a number of tents on the lawns in the front of this building so that they can effectively protest. Why should not anybody or any organisation camp in this area without being molested? Surely the Government has given the green light to camping on the lawns outside Parliament House. Perhaps when tents stretch across the entire frontage of this building and right down to the lake the Government might be persuaded to find the courage to take effective action. 
Before I resume my seat, I would like to bring some welfare matters to the notice of the Government. If it is prepared to do something about some of them it might help to repair its already badly dented image. The Royal Australian Air Force Veterans Trust Fund provides money to build homes for ex-members of the Royal Australian Air Force who are in necessitous circumstances. But, incredibly, members of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force are not eligible because of the way in which the Defence Service Homes Act is worded. The present Government made an alteration to the Act to make national servicemen eligible for defence forces homes. This is something with which no one could quarrel. But I fail to see why the Government did not take the opportunity to include eligibility for WAAFs who, during the last war, volunteered to serve anywhere. 
They served alongside men of the Air Force. Many of them did the same jobs. They lived under the same conditions. Why should ex-servicemen be eligible for Trust homes but not ex-servicewomen? I point out that men who enlisted for overseas service but who were not sent overseas are eligible. Women who also enlisted to serve anywhere but who were not sent overseas are ineligible. I do not believe that this is fair. I have been informed by one of these ex-servicewomen that a recent advertisement for the recruitment of WAAFs stated that they will become eligible for defence service homes. I ask: Why should women who serve in peacetime be eligible for these homes whilst those who served in time of war are not? I suggest that this is an anomaly which ought to be corrected immediately. 
Recently, the Morrabbin Association for the Intellectually Retarded' purchased a property to use as a day training centre for about 100 retarded children. The State Government is giving a $4 for $1 capital grant towards this project. But because of the priorities within the Victorian Mental Hygiene Department and its lack of funds this organisation will have to wait 3 years to get this money. In the meantime, it has had to borrow $80,000 for a period of 3 years. It has to pay interest on this money at the rate of 10 or 11 per cent. This means that virtually $25,000 of the funds of a charitable organisation is going down the drain. I have written to the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden)  about this matter asking whether he will be able to do something to make money available at a much lower rate of interest than 10 or 11 per cent. Personally, I would like to see the organisation get the money interest free. But if that is not possible any reduction in the rate of interest being paid will be appreciated. 
This Government has a number of convictions. In addition to those to which I have referred, I could have referred to Labor's broken promises with respect to defence spending and the visit of the Vietcong representatives during Anzac Week which I believe to be an insult to Australian exservicemen. I could have referred to the taxpayers' money which is going down the drain in drilling holes in the search for oil when the money could have been better spent by spreading it around a number of companies. I could have referred to the amount of money which is being spent on a pipeline which could have been provided without cost to the taxpayers. I could have mentioned a great many other things, but time is running out. I believe that I have mentioned quite enough to show that the Government ought to be ashamed of itself and it ought to be prepared to face the Australian people at the very earliest opportunity. 
The first of the matters I wish to bring to the attention of the Government tonight relates to the present completely unacceptable road toll. I left a message with the office of the Minister for Transport  (Mr Charles Jones)  that I would be raising this matter tonight. There is nothing critical of the Minister or his Department in what I have to say. The Oakleigh Lions Club, which is within my electorate, has for a year or more been conducting a road safety campaign. It has been particularly active in this area. I have made a number of attempts, through the Parliamentary Library, the National Library and the Victorian Department of Transport, to obtain 35 millimetre films and slides on road safety, but they are practically unprocurable. The Minister for Transport will be aware that young drivers are very much involved in road accidents. They are even more involved in fatal road accidents. It is a fact that there is a captive audience of young car drivers at drive-in theatres, and I believe that the showing of road safety films at those theatres could do no other than benefit young drivers. However, such films are just not available and I ask the Minister to consider instructing his Department to produce 35 millimetre films on road safety which could be shown at drive-in theatres throughout Australia. I am quite sure that nothing but good could come from such a move. 
Yes, I have tried every known source. One film is available but there is a limit to the number of times that it can be shown. As the honourable member for Robertson knows, many films are available in 16 millimetre size but they are just not available in the 35 millimetre size. If road safety films could be produced in the 35 millimetre size 
I am sure that their showing would do a lot of good at drive-in theatres to which young people drive their cars. While they are waiting for the main films to be shown they watch advertising slides and I feel that if road safety films were shown at that time it would be the best way of getting to the people who are most concerned in fatal accidents. 
The second matter to which I wish to refer concerns the Royal Australian Air Force base at Butterworth in Malaya. I advised the Minister for Defence  (Mr Barnard)  that I would be raising this matter and I am very glad to see that he is now in the chamber. I have heard 2 rumours and I would like the Minister's advice on whether there is any truth in them. The first rumour is that the Australian Government is to hand over the Butterworth base to the Malayan Government. The second rumour, so I have been informed, is even more disturbing to RAAF personnel. Men who have served at Butterworth over a period of years have established a yacht club there. They have heard rumours that the club, which is theirs and does not belong to the RAAF, is also to be handed over. I understand that the RAAF has not contributed to the cost of the club. I had a call from a person who is very disturbed about the rumours and I would like to be able to assure him that there is no truth in the rumours. If there is some truth in them I would like the Minister to make a statement about them. 
The third matter to which I want to tefer relates to something about which I wrote to the Minister for Social Security  (Mr Hayden),  that is, wheel chairs. I believe that the Government provides artificial limbs free of charge to amputees. Wheel chairs are virtually artificial limbs to paraplegics, who include a great many sufferers from multiple sclerosis. I am raising this matter on behalf of a sufferer from multiple sclerosis who receives only an invalid pension. He has no other money and has suffered from multiple sclerosis for more than 20 years. I suppose that he is lucky to be alive. I have been trying to obtain a wheel chair for him through Lions Clubs and other charitable organisations in Victoria, but because he weighs about 16 stone or 17 stone he requires a particularly heavy wheel chair. So far it just has not been possible to obtain one for him. I should like to see the Government make wheel chairs available free of charge to paraplegics in the same way as it makes artificial limbs available free of charge to amputees. 
The last matter I wish to raise is also a matter for the consideration of the Minister for Social Security. I have written to him about this. I have asked him to give special consideration to the provision of hostel accommodation for spastics. It is my belief that the elderly, the mentally retarded and the ill are all far better catered for than are the spastics. I believe that their cause is deserving and their need is urgent. I hope that the Government will be able to do something to provide greater assistance for spastic sufferers, particularly in the form of financial help towards the provision of hostel accommodation.
