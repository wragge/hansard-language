    <p>Was the Tullamarine Airport site originally chosen on the basis that the buffer zone surrounding the Airport was adequate to preserve the neighbouring amenity in respect of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from noise associated with aircraft operations? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700618_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If not, does this not indicate that the Australian Labor Party condones the aggression against Cambodia by the North Vietnamese and, at the same time, consistently does not support <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is all very well to talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> but each and every one of us must always bear in mind that we should do our utmost to see that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country is not destroyed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>ls it a fact that academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has, in some instances, become academic licence in our universities, with some members of the university staffs overstepping their basic function of teaching by taking part in political activity and, in the process, inciting students to disregard constitutional authority? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some 2,000 years ago Christ died so that men may live, yet we have a heretic in this chamber who is repudiating all Christian principles and advocating kilting, all in the cause of so-called justice or <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The trade union movement has such aims because it is not possible otherwise to get all sorts of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710818_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-113-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Did not you say that you believed in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of mergers and the economy of size? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Was a decision taken at the 53rd Session of the ‘International Labour Organisation that a representative of the Director-General of the Organisation should visit Australia and hold discussions with the Australian Government, in an endeavour to have Convention 87 relating to <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association and protection of the right to organise’ ratified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Australian Government have any objection to the existence in Australia of organisations of former overseas nationals from countries under dictatorships, such organisations supporting the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and autonomy of their country, provided that they do not resort to violence and do not break the laws of this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721025_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might argue that TransAustralia Airlines is a commercial enterprise operating in a competitive, commercial environment and that it should have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to determine such matters as the salaries of its senior executives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721031_senate_27_s54/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If they are opposed to joining trade unions I believe that they have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to refuse to join, but if they do refuse they have no more right to continue to work in an industry that has benefited from the activity of trade unions than a person entering primary production has to ignore a board set upto market his product.If persons are honest in refusing to join a trade union they have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to enter industries that are not covered by trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730301_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>True it is that there are incidents like those that happened at Prague and Budapest, but by and large the young people in European countries have certainly much further advanced in what we regard as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> a lot further than they were at the zenith of the Stalin era. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730411_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we believe in a doctor’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to provide a personal service based on personal responsibility within a system based on quality rattier than quantity, as opposed to an impersonal service in which doctor and patient lose their identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730830_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reactionary capitalist forces of the world had built up Hitler and he in turn was able to suborn others of his ilk like Mussolini and the powers in Japan in order to form a triumvirate or a troika, or whatever one likes to call the trio that challenged the rights of man to live in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> on this earth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730913_senate_28_s57/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Whatever the differences between countries, however the balance between authority and liberty is resolved in these different countries, the free peoples- those who seek to elevate the dignity of man, to laud him for what he is and for what he is able to achieve- will reflect, I believe, the measure of their own value of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by the consistency with which they defend <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in their own countries and likewise challenge those who would deny <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What this exercise is all about is to give the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to a young man in a foreign country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the hope that questions asked in the Senate might advance the possibility that this young man will have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to whether he remains in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Human Rights and civil liberties and are therefore unable to express their will, we the undersigned Australian citizens of Baltic origin humbly petition the Senate to express its moral support to the rights of the Baltic States to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740813_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-0-6">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some people could say that he had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the evidence which has come out since in relation to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of  Mr Ermolenko  to migrate to this country, apparently free of restrictions, proves the stand which was taken by  Senator Willesee  and demonstrates and places on record the justification for and vindication of the approach which he took at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>Senator Guilfoyle  said that the current technical education program tends to restrict the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the States but I already have dealt with that matter in my reply in the second reading debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is, for example, demonstrated by its ratification in 1973 of ILO <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention 1948 (No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-66-5">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the fact that under new United States legislation, the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act, citizens have the statutory right to see their Federal Bureau of Investigation file, whether or not they have been charged with a crime or are under suspicion, will the Minister for Police and Customs assure the Australian people that such a right will be guaranteed in the legislation now being drafted for the Australian police force? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-16-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does not the Government accept that changes in government in this country occur through orderly constitutional processes and elections conducted by secret ballot in conditions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751023_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, we did not consider that there was evidence of sufficient malpractice to justify disrupting the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement between our two countries which the arrangements allow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760907_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-49-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I appeal to the Minister, through you,  Mr Chairman,  to give some guarantee to the Committee and to the people of Australia that there will be true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the citizens of Australia to change from one fund to another, thus promoting the true competition between funds which is the desire of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the information of honourable senators, I present the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Policy Proposals for <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Legislation, together with the text of a statement by the Attorney-General relating to that report. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761209_senate_30_s70/#debate-66">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it ought to be made clear at least by someone that the action taken by you,  Mr President,  may be viewed as an action which can intimidate the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of those who represent the Press to write reports and to disseminate news without some fear that they may be brought before the Presiding Officers of the Parliament to explain their actions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are merely saying that these people have a right to live in peace and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, in view of the Government’s oft repeated concern for community involvement and parent choice in education, what action will the Minister take to see that the parent organisations of all those Queensland schools which have sought to retain the MACOS program will not be denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in this matter? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is my hope that through the efforts of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the existing channels of communication between representatives of the peoples as parliamentarians can be maintained and expanded, that through the further development of opportunities for exchange programs in the Commonwealth will come a clearer understanding of the methods of achieving a life of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, dignity and material sufficiency for all our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the Government’s announced policy of providing for general <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, will the Minister undertake to make the report available to the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780502_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-5-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are opposed to the enshrining of the principle of business confidentiality above the requirement for the Supervising Scientist to have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to report any information that may be of interest to the Minister or the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, looking at clause 5, I wonder whether it is envisaged that the Federal Government whilst giving the States the perfect <span class="highlight">freedom</span> outlined in the second reading speech will be able to obtain a report from the respective State Ministers about the effect of a particular grant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780607_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment to clause 8 is designed to give the Council more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in performing its functions so that it will not be a total tool of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved this amendment quite seriously because it is designed to give the Council some <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in performing its functions rather than make it a total tool of the Minister. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are interested to know also why the Government, which is apparently so dedicated to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for health funds, will not allow a fund which desires to retain a bulk billing system to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, the undersigned librarians at the Dixson Library, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, are gravely concerned at the following aspects of the ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978’: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780914_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and (3) It is my understanding that the advice to the Minister in respect of increases in telegram charges for the year 1977-78 was not a document of a class for which exemption would be sought in terms ofthe present <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill as now drafted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will ask the Australian Telecommunications Commission to reconsider its attitude on this matter in the light of the Government’s commitment to the principles embodied in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1 978, should any further request be made for a copy of the report concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781017_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790322_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I thought that my comments on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation covered the issues raised in clause 57 ( 1 ) (a) and (b). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 1908  President  Gould referred to the very thing that  Senator Georges  has said will ruin the ability of senators to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790529_senate_31_s81/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is prompted by  Senator Carrick  ‘s excursions on the subject of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the inappropriateness of any such notion in the context of this debate and the Opposition’s arguments about the effect of these clauses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, governmental use of money and other powers to control student organisations- as a precedent for imposing limitations upon genuine academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is always a danger that future governments might see such an action as a precedent for imposing limitations upon genuine, academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#debate-76">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The arguments against conclusive certificates in fields such as this were set out very persuasively in the report of the Senate’s Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even with the best will in the world and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which we choose to assert as honourable senators, I do not think we can ignore the fact that we need to work in conjunction with another place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another aspect that concerns me greatly is the growing trend in this country - a trend that 1 feel is a danger to the democracy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we have won over the years, and a trend that is condoned by many - to buck authority, the laws of the land and our law making institutions under the guise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, the rights of the individual and the rights of minorities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Would the Diem regime, or any other political party in South Vietnam, have been granted complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to campaign in North Vietnam? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would they have been granted complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in North Vietnam at a time when the Communist government of North Vietnam was engaged in a massacre of tens of thousands of North Vietnamese whom the Communists regarded  as enemies of Communism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its immediate consequences must be a Communist takeover of South Vietnam snuffing out the hope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and of democratic independence in that country and extending the area of Communist control closer to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700304_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will the Leader of  the Government in the Senate state what action the Government has taken about the member of the Liberal Party who has made public statements, which have not been retracted, that he supports trampling upon the human rights of the people of Rhodesia and that he supports legislation which is anathema to democracy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> loving people all over the world? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700305_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our purpose in Vietnam is, along with our allies, to see that the people of South Vietnam have the right - the sort of right that he and 1 have - and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to select a form of government of their own choosing, lt is deplorable for the honourable senator to draw such an inference from a statement made by a gallant soldier who represents a gallant battalion of men coming back to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As there is a feeling among a number of honourable senators that there could be a serious inhibition of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, particularly on matters of foreign affairs, if we were taken to assume that in future it is not possible to criticise the Prime Minister of a friendly country, I ask whether you,  Mr President,  will deliver a ruling on this matter to the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700311_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Is it unjust to go to the aid of a country whose people desire to have a government of their own choice and to live in some form of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as they evolve it and which is being menaced by another country that seeks to impose the Communist yoke upon them? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>does protest solemnly against the way in which the armistice has been concluded and the conditions of this armistice, without taking into account the deep aspirations of the Vietnamese people, and it reserves its full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action in order to safeguard the sacred right of the Vietnamese people to territorial unity, national indepedence and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700312_senate_27_s43/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The honourable senator developed his point to such an extent that he put that this action would limit the people who could operate on the stock market, that  it  was an affront to anybody’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to buy or sell shares because of the set minimum of $1,000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700317_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it a fact that the Vietnam Moratorium scheduled for 8th, 9th and 10th May is an attempt to create, for political purposes, a dislocation of the right and opportunity for Australians to go about their lawful purposes by stoppages in industry and transport and by impeding the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in the streets? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We have consistently said that the National Service Act is a bad law and that all of the restrictions on civil liberties that exist in this country are bad laws because if one has not the sense of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the sense of democracy at heart, if one is not prepared to speak up for one’s fellow men, then all democracy is lost. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we sometimes hear from honourable senators opposite that we should go all the way with LBJ and how we ought to imitate the American alliance, one of the things I do wish they would try to imitate from the United States is the constitutional guarantees to people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and the refusal to smear people which is engaged in by people like  Senator Greenwood  and  Senator Rae. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700415_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-77-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This debate arises in connection with a particularly vital experience for Australia, that is, this conflict in Vietnam which is probably unprecedented, either in its purpose or in its quality, it should be apparent to those who discuss the Vietnamese conflict that there has been there simply a resolution on the part of the South Vietnamese forces, aided by the American, Australian and New Zealand forces, to guard 2 things - the territory of South Vietnam and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the South Vietnamese people so as to give them a right to express for themselves, if they so decide, their choice of government, lawfully constituted, instead of having one imposed upon them by the Vietcong or the Communist forces from Hanoi. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700506_senate_27_s43/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I recall to the minds of those honourable senators who remember the last World War that, when Britain was on her knees because of the fight that she and her allies were putting up for democracy and for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people, she had to sell a lot of her assets in America in order to pay her commitments to America. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As if lo ensure that the Corporation has complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of manoeuvre to do just what it likes wilh Australian business,  there  is the truly amazing and most extraordinary clause of all in the Bill, designed obviously lo put it completely beyond any legal challenge. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-32-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to discuss each matter fully, and it is a very important <span class="highlight">freedom</span> - it is very important that this be done by a legislative chamber - it means that if it is all done in the I chamber then we cannot deal with very much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700604_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said before, there is one very good reason why this amendment should not be agreed to at the moment, and that is that at this stage Australia is in the position of having to negotiate in the international sphere and 1 do not think that any encumberance should be placed on Australia’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to negotiate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700611_senate_27_s44/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Does the Minister representing the Attorney-General believe that the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of members of parliament and the democratic rights of individuals are being eroded when a member of parliament who makes a statement supporting the policy of his federal leader is tried and suspended from his party and is not permitted to attend a meeting of that parliamentary party although he has appealed against his expulsion? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700616_senate_27_s44/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I feel that today <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is being challenged in many parts of the world and not the least in our own country because there is perhaps an over- enthusiasm for the pursuit of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the degree that we tend to lose our sense of definition and perhaps we are accepting permissiveness and unbridled licence in the guise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I reiterate these 5 points: The security and strength of the family unit; the provision of ever greater equality of opportunity; the maintenance of a profit motive within a properly constructed and developed and generous legal system of restraint; a careful attitude to our real understanding of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; and a suggestion that we should temper our concern for pure theory with social and political considerations lest we become slaves to ivory towered conceptions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fourth is the constant examination of the significance of true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the recognition that it is a disciplined state of affairs and is vastly different from anarchy which is just through a shallow barrier from <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view he gave expression to the very highest principles when he said that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is a disciplined way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has resulted from the evolution of several centuries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700902_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attack on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia involved in  the  Government’s refusal to  allow  Mr  Dick  Gregory to enter  this  country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have moved this motion as a matter of urgency in order that the Senate can consider the further attack which has been made on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are getting a reputation all over the world for being racist and for denying the freedoms which are accepted elsewhere as the heritage of ail humans - the basic human rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This repressive Government is destroying the freedoms to which we are entitled. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says: ‘This is Australia’s message to the rest of the world: You can come here, you are free to engage in political discussion and you can have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression so long as you say what we want you to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion and expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That right includes <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I want my country to stand in the same light as other countries, such as Canada, and be regarded as a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> loving country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government talks about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the free world, but decision after decision is being made in this country which would not be made in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>How is it that the standard of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which is the right of citizens of the United States is denied to citizens of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s refusal to grant a visa is not merely a denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to  Mr Gregory;  it is a denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to all of us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is set out in the Declaration of human rights, as it has been set out in the other great documents through history, that we are entitled to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech is a 2-way thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think Australians will tolerate this constant erosion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why is this Government entitled to abuse the powers which have been given to it for certain purposes in order to deny <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is this refusal of entry but a simple denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, a denial of the right of Australians to hear what this man has to say? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe, without foundation, false and indeed most damaging to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which we believe should be enjoyed by all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy is to allow the maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of travel to Australia and people are not prevented from visiting Australia just because their political views may differ from those of the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running through it was the underlying theme of what I suppose we could call a sort of British way of life and a concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me turn now to the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to which  Senator Murphy  referred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suppose that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech is something that  Senator Murphy  may well be able to speak about because, if I remember correctly, it was the Party to which  Senator Murphy  belongs which prevented his exercising his right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech at a recent conference in New South Wales and which caused him to go to Victoria so that he could have a platform on which to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the people who are protesting about <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the Party whose members are standing here today complaining about the Government’s restriction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly not <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have the people who are supposedly the supporters of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and peace protested about the shelling of this orphanage? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is what the people who are supposedly the supporters of peace and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> are doing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this way the people of Australia will be able to decide the type of law and order and the type of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that there should be in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It refers to the attack on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia involved in the Government’s refusal to allow  Mr Dick  Gregory to enter this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immediately we see that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> within this country when on the floor of the Parliament the actions of the Federal Government can be challenged by the Opposition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Murphy’s  motion refers to the attack on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia involved in the Government’s refusal to grant an entry permit to Gregory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 am quite certain that the Opposition would agree with me when I say that it is to the forefront in’ advocating great <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He indicates that he is a member of a party which allows great <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we think about this question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the Labor Party’s adherence to its principles regarding the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals, we quickly come to the matter of Captain Sam Benson. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at the matter one sees a party advocating <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, but there is absolutely no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the Labor Party when it comes to voting in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is, in actual fact, no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of voting within the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not care whether these strikes disrupt the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are being deprived of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> because the Labor Party says that a strike is a good thing and that it will achieve something for somebody in the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt is a deprivation of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of some individuals - this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which honourable senators opposite suggest will be eroded if Dick Gregory is not allowed into this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Members of the Labor Party would support the right of those individuals to trespass on property and attempt to deprive others of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet theirs is the Party which says that in our community we must have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for Dick Gregory to come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When businesses were forced to close during the last Moratorium Campaign there was no discussion of the rights or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of those individuals who were not associated with the Moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party says that it will force its views on the community and will let the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual go to the winds unless the individual supports the Labor Party view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition members of the Labor Party support compulsory unionism, with no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the individual to make up his own mind on whether he should join a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today we have witnessed an exhibition of double standards by an Opposition which, when it desires to preach <span class="highlight">freedom</span> can be very eloquent in defence of that concept. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But on other occasions when it wants to deny <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to people within its own ranks, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual Australian Labor Party members is subordinated to what the Labor Party regards as the greater good of the Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has said that as far as possible this country encourages <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of people to the country and from the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Labo, Party says that there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country and there is no opportunity to put a viewpoint different from that which the Government puts forward then it is only because it imposes upon itself a silence which is unnecessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are arguing about with lbc Labor Party today is the allegation that this refusal of entry to 1 individual is an attack on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whose <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia is being affected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will concede that  Mr Gregory  is a person whose <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement is affected, but he is a national of the United States of America and the Australian Government has no obligation to promote the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of nationals of other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought, first of all, that it cannot bc predicated that there is an absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, an absolute right for persons to move throughout the world as they please. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All freedoms must have some limitations imposed upon them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we start on the basis that man is in a naturally free condition then it is due to the development of his own instincts and his own reason and the necessity of his own association with others that there should be some common bonds which limit his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> so that others can have the type of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which he possesses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me that is basic in any appreciation of what is involved in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The laws which are passed in this country are laws which are essentially designed to promote the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the greatest number and because they involve restrictions on some they enlarge the freedoms and abilities of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So it is - as it appears to me - with the ability of people to move in and out of this country; that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> must be subject to law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this community there are all sorts of people who are in favour of absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for their side and no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> at all for the other side when they happen to have the numbers, lt is a matter of numbers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see why people should be prohibited from using the streets of the city by people who say that they are all out for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason why the United States of America still retains some allegiance and support from a great many people throughout the world is because it has stood for certain guaranteed rights of citizens, in particular the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>in reply - This debate has been very important because it has been concerned with the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In opening the debate, I said that what the Government has done could be described as an attack on personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech that we have in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are entitled to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My Party stands firmly for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the mistakes which my Party makes on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or on other questions are mistakes for which we will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we deny fundamental freedoms, my Party will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Liberal Party denies these fundamental freedoms to its own members, it will suffer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been said on occasions that the Lok Sabha in India allows members more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> than we do in relation to questions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this is just a sort of initiation of the process of curtailing the rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of members of the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700903_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For all they knew they might even have been joined by one or more honourable senators from this side of the chamber because we have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vote how, when and where we like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700915_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-51-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The type of matters asked about by the honourable senator could have been developed, for instance, in debates such as the Budget debate which ranges very widely and permits great <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Australian Government’s activities in that country are being carried out in the name of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in an endeavour to let those people enjoy the right of selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This would not have given me the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> 1 want to attend the meeting of what T consider to be the most important committee sitting at the time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Some honourable senators have chosen not to serve on the Committees because they want a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to discuss any of the estimates of expenditure and propose to do this in the debate on the Appropriation Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 believe the time is opportune now to abbrogate the 1923 <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the sea conventions and say to the companies: ‘After November any oil tanker which does not have substantial coverage will not be given port facilities.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700917_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Obviously the draftsman intended that there should be greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the payment of the allowance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In a free society, while the economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual is important, the social <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the personal dignity of the citizen is equally important. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this case not only has the economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and viability of a group of aged people in the community been gravely impaired but the personal dignity of these people is being brought under grave criticism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700923_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister aware that a number of well known supporters of the Government’s policy on Vietnam, to wit, Professor Owen Harries and persons such as Richard Krygier of the Association for Cultural <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>, were responsible for a letter in yesterday’s ‘Sydney Morning Herald’ in which he stated - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, refers to the appeal made by Professor David Armstrong and other members of the Association for Cultural <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> - all supporters of the Government’s war policy in Vietnam - and the call for an inquiry into all the circumstances relating to the disturbances associated with the Sydney Moratorium. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In view of the latter part of the statement by Professor Armstrong and his colleagues in the Association for Cultural <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>, and in view of the Minister’s earlier answer, does he believe that these people are members of a conspiracy dedicated to discrediting Australian police forces and destroying law and order in this country? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If some of the above have not accepted this responsibility, does the Government intend abrogating the 1923 ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of the Sea Convention’, which would deny port facilities to these operators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not propose to refuse <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access to its ports, nor does it propose to cease to be a party to the 1923 Convention and Statute on the International Regime of Maritime Ports merely for the purpose of inducing tanker owners to join this voluntary organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700924_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am delighted to hear him, or any Opposition member, suggest that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of private enterprise is something which should be applauded and something which makes it desirable to take away from the control of the Government the administration of a department such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700929_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the financial side the Post Office now enjoys the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of detailed financing of its operations as do many statutory corporations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19700930_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That they question the simplistic view that nations ‘perish’ because of a so-called ‘internal moral decay’ unless such ‘decay’ is taken to include an increasing unwillingness to face the facts of life in open discussion and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Honourable Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled will seek to ensure that Commonwealth legislation bearing on Alms, literature and radio and television programmes is so framed and so administered as to give the maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to adults to choose what they will watch, read and listen to, even in the face of pressure from those who seek to impose their ideas and morals on others who do not share them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701001_senate_27_s45/#subdebate-3-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Common criticisms of price control by governments are that it constitutes undue interference with business <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and tends to produce uniformity and to damp down competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the very thing against which people are fighting for their liberty and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in many countries today and the sort of activity that everybody condemns when it is applied to international airlines and somebody wants to hijack an aircraft and use it as a terrorist gesture against the rest of the community in order to gain his ends no matter what happens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If industry and commerce endeavour to prevent that free competition, then I agree wholeheartedly that steps should be taken to ensure that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Australian Labor Party appear to love compulsion, but 1 can assure them that the average Australian likes his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and intends to have his <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 made a deliberate decision that ] would not be a member of any committee because I wanted the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move from committee to committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701028_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However much  Senator Young  likes those nice words ‘freedoms’ and ‘democracy*, we will be moving amendments to the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It amazes me, because I remember that in 1948 the Press of this country said that the people ought to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to charge what they like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The decision may have been made in the cause of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy but, I believe that in respect of prices it was one of the worst decisions that people of this country ever made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>wonder how far one can take these freedoms when they have placed the wool industry in the position it is in today. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why do honourable senators opposite  -  I say this without being offensive - mouth these shibboleths of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy when they know it would be practically impossible for  Senator Young  or any other wool grower to establish any person in the wool industry today at the current price of land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However much  Senator Young  might believe, in the Bill, he will forget all the nice words he uttered about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> because he will have to protect his own interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He will have to say that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is all right in theory but that in practice the wool industry needs organisations similar to those in other industries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701030_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think the phrase ‘as the Minister approves’ amounts to a complete interference with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and should not be in a Bill of this kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But if he is in debt to someone else he will probably have some <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and will be able to sell it for a quick return privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701102_senate_27_s46/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For the peoples of that area we have accepted rather reluctantly a responsibility which should have been accepted in full with a view to bringing to these people a society which would set an example to other similar societies throughout the world and to bringing to them a democratic system of government which would give them <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express themselves and to live a full life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In spite of the fact that Australia has spent so much money in the Territory and has done so much, by way of administration and service, including skills in various departments, the people of Papua and New Guinea have a right to develop their own political system and to establish their own political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without limitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1970/19701103_senate_27_s46/#debate-31">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Traditionally universities have enjoyed independence in internal matters and have been free from interference by outside bodies, lt is the maintenance of that unchallenged authority within internal matters that enables them to sustain that academic authority and that academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which most people believe is a prerequisite of uninhibited pursuit of scholarship and research. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710225_senate_27_s47/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Has the Government permitted its overseas shipping venture to be so tied in with a conference arrangement as to have serious limitations applied to its profitability and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of operation; if so, why was this permitted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710316_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many related factors are involved - the greater complexity of life presented by modern society, the decline in social controls on behaviour, the absence in many highly urbanised societies of the supports and sanctions of a well understood traditional culture, the opportunities provided by urbanised societies for anonymity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action, and an increase in criminal activity with a lower risk of detection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710330_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-84-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator has brought to notice in his question a very pertinent aspect of this matter, because complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has been preserved for sporting teams and performing companies to visit this continent from Communist countries without protest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that has been enjoyed by them will be accorded by Australia, I hope, to other people who come here for sporting reasons, although they may hold a different political outlook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ministers responsible for social welfare participating in the conference affirmed their commitment to the goal expressed in the Preamble of :he United Nations Charter ‘to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time, they recognised that respect for human rights and individual freedoms and the avoidance of any kind of discrimination constitute the indispensable basis of all social welfare development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710406_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>About 104 miles from Adelaide, at Cadell, where Charles Martin is imprisoned, last Sunday there was a motorcade or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> ride in which about 300 people participated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710407_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Therefore I reject this motion out of hand because it requires a government to do something which I believe is totally impracticable in the first place, because it weakens any bargaining position that Australia may have, and because it fetters the Australian capacity for diplomatic initiatives and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-22-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the other band, order without <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is tyranny ‘ and we will have none of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In short, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement must be qualified by reference to considerations affecting the overall public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In the result, the Government has decided that it should undertake the task of balancing the various interests - of making an effort to achieve a synthesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order, as the objective has been described - in a suitable, modern statute covering, but expressly limited to, matters within the area of Commonwealth legislative responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>introduced into this chamber as a libertarian measure designed, in the words of the Minister for Works  (Senator Wright)  to mitigate the severity of existing laws and to draw a clear, and sensible line between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order, whereas its true purpose is to impose additional restrictions on the right to dissent and at the same time to give the Government yet another opportunity to ham its favourite role of defender of the citizenry against the forces of anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The Bill fails lamentably to achieve the synthesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order which the Minister claimed for it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is no easy task, but I believe that the Government’s obsession with order has outweighed completely its concern for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if the Government sincerely held this view it would have directed its attention to one of the most glaring gaps in our legal structure - namely, the absence of any constitutional guarantee of the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of peaceful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is always assumed that we have these rights, but the fact is that there is no law and ho constitutional guarantee that we have a right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and a peaceful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To seek to make the lot of the demonstrator more difficult and to call that exercise ‘striking a balance between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order’, as the Minister put it, is in my view hypocritical in the ‘ extreme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of this history it can hardly be claimed that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country is marching forward with giant strides. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat: It is a nice exercise in hypocrisy for the Minister to claim that this Bill draws a clear and sensible line between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It leaves <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in its present legal straitjacket in fact it has tightened it up a little; it -will not strengthen order because bad legislation does not have that effect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill goes a long way to completely suppress <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another of the fundamental things is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of worship, and it is not impossible for an Attorney-General or a government with Fascist tendencies to distort this legislation in such a way as to prevent marches associated with religious worship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is one sentence of the former AttorneyGeneral with which I agree- com,pletely ‘We cannot take away this fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bill was devised to enable people to go about their own business, express their own wishes and to indulge in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the society which they, like the rest of us, have a reason to expect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been looking at the book entitled ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> in Australia’ by Enid Campbell and Harry Whitmore. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will always be difficult to strike the balance between public order on the one hand and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in public meetings on the other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be denied that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express individual opinions and ideas and to join with others in such an expression is a basic right in our democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A democratic society such as we pride ourselves upon must involve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express opinions and, where relevant, to criticise the authorities of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we indulge ourselves in the freedoms to which I have referred and if we are prepared to pay even lip service to the fact that they carry responsibilities, of necessity these responsibilities involve some restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These restrictions are essential in the interests of national <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, national security, public safety and public order and even go as far as the safeguarding of public health and protecting the rights of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The job done by our police forces in protecting the public and maintaining public order and the rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people is highly commendable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I despise those who would undermine our society by the attacks they make upon the police who endeavour to preserve the rights and freedoms of our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The quickest way to lose <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is to bring the law into disrepute, to cast aspersions on the administration of justice and to hinder the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Democracy must ensure that the right to change the law is maintained but the claim that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> depends on breaking the law must be rejected completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bill into effect we will remember that we are part of a world family of nations; that even though, in diplomatic language, we may have a difference with forms of government, at least we are prepared to respect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of others just as much as we claim that our own. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Here in Canberra last Sunday morning, the Reverend J. R.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, if we want to maintain <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we need to maintain in our society the fact that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> relies upon authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe that the general provisions and principles of this Bill will attract those people who wish to maintain a basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It attempts to maintain the right of dissent by the individual and the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression by the individual, and to see that people within the community do not prohibit others from going about their lawful business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the situation which we have in Australia I believe that people dislike some other person, persons or authority interfering with their right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let them express their view but if they want to take from me my right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement I shall endorse a Bill such as this which will prohibit them from doing that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a society such as ours it can be recognised that we have great <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who come from overseas tell us on many occasions of the great <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we have in this community compared with that which is found in other countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710428_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, we start from a position of absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We start from a position in which that absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has, in the circumstances of the organisation of society, to be restricted to an extent necessary to keep the balance in the community between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have the practical and factual situation, from which we proceed, that there is absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> except where it is restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He referred to the fact that, the 1936 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, section 125 guarantees <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The net result is that one returns to the principle that  it is  not a matter of guaranteeing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by words; it is a matter of guaranteeing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by system and by observance of that system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we have those freedoms in relation to the system, if we have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to exercise the right to speak in Parliament, if we have the right of Parliament to exercise supervision over the Executive, then again we have the practical day to day necessities for the preservation of the rights and liberties of individual subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is related to the question of the right of assembly and the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It does not give them the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do anything they like to make their protest effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that it is reducing the field of human rights, including <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and all those other freedoms without which man can never reach his estate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710429_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Bill is an onslaught upon the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and of peaceable assembly in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> is not total, nor is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> absolute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> must be granted within the framework of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everybody has a right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If there are no laws, if people have the right to intimidate those with whom they disagree, to interfere with the rights of others to go about their work or pleasure in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, without threats of violence or actual violence, this is anarchy- People who advocate this policy in fact are advocating anarchy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I repeat that noone has the right of absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time it has to strike a sensible balance to ensure that those who wish to dissent and those who wish to demonstrate are protected and given that right so long as this does not mean that they interfere with the rights and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does not erode <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, it does not erode the liberties of people or the right to demonstrate, but it lays down the rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have had, over the years, attacks on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of peaceful assembly and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Senate may be reminded that not so long ago each one of these freedoms was denied bv the Queensland Government during the Mount Isa affair. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We know that our Aboriginals have for a long time suffered encroachment on their personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in the rest of the community we have had examples again and again such as the Waddington case where the Returned Services League attempted to deny <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express political beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Streets, parks, and other public places are proper places tor the exercise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communicating information and disseminating opinion, and, although states and municipalities may appropriately regulate the privilege to the public interest, they may not unduly burden or proscribe its employment in such public places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From ancient times one of .the great rights of the citizen that he has had to assert constantly against the executive government is the right to peaceable assembly, as well as the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the founding of the United States  of  America, shortly after the Constitution was adopted, the people put into it Article  1  which provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech  or  of the Press or of the right of the people peaceably to assemble. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that there has been some cleaning up of old legislation, but it seems to me that, apart from this, this is an incursion on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It preserves the right of assembly, embodies <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and association and ensures that those who feel the need to give expression to a right to demonstrate and to dissent can do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said that the Bill was an onslaught upon the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nowhere in this Bill is there any reference to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and nowhere does it prevent an individual from saying what he has to say. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that it would be at the very bastion of our own rights of personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and personal property, yet this clause is castigated as a provision which is offensive to a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also seeks to clarify the law by indicating that there are certain limits beyond which a person, in expressing his right to demonstrate and his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to dissent, may not go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would think that one of the liberties of citizens would be to have a law castigating and imposing penalties on people who engage in that ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span>’ in any society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that persons are entitled to certain freedoms and are equally entitled to certain protections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The balance with which the Bill is concerned is a balance which ensures that people do not allow their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to become a matter of excess which denies the reasonable rights of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710504_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-69-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told in the second reading speech that one of the purposes of this definition was to draw a balance between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is another right, and if we are to believe that the Government is sincere in its desire to strike a balance between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order, one would have thought that some reference could be made to that right at the outset of this definition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said, first of all - this is what he referred to first in his judgment - that the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in the Bill of Rights does guarantee <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having established the principle that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly is guaranteed under the law of the United States, the law then must look at what restrictions must be imposed upon <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly so that the undesirable consequences, such as those which were referred to in the part of  Mr Justice  Black’s judgment which were quoted by the Minister could not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I repeat that the essential part of his judgment was the reference to the constitutional right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point that was made in upholding the appeal in this case was that the ordinance was so vague that it was not a proper ordinance and was an undue interference with the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator James  McClelland has said that there is no right given within this Bill - nor is there a right in any other legislation nor, as far as I know, is there a right even in common law - for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not a good provision to introduce into the law, especially when it is introduced as a curb on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very disturbing, when dealing with the issue of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and speech, to think that this kind of offence will be engrafted on our legislation so that people will be subjected to arrest, charge and conviction although they have committed no violence to any person and no damage to any property. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710505_senate_27_s48/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are concerned about is the fact that it can be used on occasions other than that and it can be used unduly to circumscribe the right of peaceful assembly and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If people felt that there ought to be a general <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move in and out of people’s property without let or hindrance, I dare say we would not have laws like this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The receiving State shall treat him with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that this is one of the problems which is quite serious here and which inhibits not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, as has been inhibited by so many other clauses in this Bill, but <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We are extremely indebted to him for telling us why he supports the Government and for telling us his stand on these great issues of peaceable assembly and the issue of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I do not regard as trifling any matter which concerns the liberty of the people, the right to peaceable assembly and the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Above all, the Bill provides no protection at all that might maintain the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and of peaceful assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710506_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite attention to paragraph (5) of Part II of the Schedule, which provides that the Authority shall have the discretion to determine the terms and conditions of any loan it may make up to a maximum repayment term of 20 years, in a number of cases an initial period of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from repayments of principal would be justified, depending on the circumstances of the case and the interest rate to be charged. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710513_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This matter has been brought to my attention by a friend who gave me some instances which illustrate that there are grave doubts about the meaning of certain clauses of the Bill, whether in fact the Bill as written will achieve the purpose of giving this right of portability of pensions to public servants and others, and whether they will in all instances enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement which it is suggested is the purpose behind the Government’s move in introducing the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710520_senate_27_s48/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is my view that if we are to start making it illegal to advertise a type of goods or services on television we will gradually reach the situation where there will be no <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-42-3">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I invite this Senate and the people of Australia to look at South East Asia - its instability, the gross threats to its security in 1963, 1964 and 1965- and then look at the infinitely greater stability today, the infinitely greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people and the self-determination of the people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said previously, the start to the solution to this problem is to try to understand the ground rules under which man can live with man in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and with the right to be different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710909_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Owners of the mass media talk of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that they take <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press as licence for the Press. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710914_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-70-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Emphasis is placed on the common needs principle … an approach relied on to maximise equality, social justice, and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>lt has given me a better appreciation of the country in which I live; the country that has given me <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty; the country that has given me the opportunity of doing something, feeble as though it may be and unrecognised as it will be for people I represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless I found that there was sufficient <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for a full discussion on any matter anyone wished to raise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the features of this chamber, particularly over recent years, has been the additional <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that exists for senators to express their views on all manner of subjects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously the Standing Orders of this chamber have been designed to give additional <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to honourable senators to express their views on matters relevant and irrelevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the proper and perfect system would be one in which there was no restriction of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of a member of Parliament to voice his opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of that man to speak for 4 hours is very important within the portals of Parliament where democracy exists, or is alleged to exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That statement takes <span class="highlight">freedom</span> away from members of the Government Parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this side of the chamber we are supposed to have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Probably some senators consider that they exercised that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I exercise my <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of conscience at all time and, therefore, I do not require a special free vote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was a genuine attempt to preserve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of democracy in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all, if we take away this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech now, tomorrow someone will bring in a recommendation to eliminate other things too. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710916_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-53-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the June meeting, the Commonwealth accepted the States’ need for some greater flexibility and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in revenue raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710928_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-90-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It does seem that this is an extremely serious matter which involves the rights of the individual, the rights of the public as television interviewers and those concerned with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, and the proper execution of powers under the Broadcasting and Television Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is an extremely serious matter which affects the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of stations and of persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important that as far as possible the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press be extended to radio and television. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But, in the circumstances, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of radio and television stations should be extended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively some explanation should be given of how this can be done in conformity with the Act in order that steps may be taken to ensure that what seems to be a breach of traditional freedoms of expression may be corrected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if one answers Yes’ one does not necessarily have to oppose the Bill; but, of course, it docs make a very great difference to one’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action as to whether one supports it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the same time we have had 12 speakers from the Government side and we have reflected what forever will mark the differences between our parties, namely, a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was saying that the parties on this side of the chamber have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and this debate has revealed that in striking fashion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710930_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Are you aware that members of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> From Hunger Campaign are currently conducting a fast in front of Parliament House; that yesterday campaigners were given permission to sit on the stairway at the front of Parliament House and that this permission was withdrawn today? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This morning when I arrived in Canberra I was informed by my officers that a group of persons associated with the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> From Hunger Campaign had arrived in Canberra with the intention of staging a fast of indefinite duration on the front steps of Parliament House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have also been informed that subsequent to being in that room  Mr Rooney  spoke to a person connected with the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> from Hunger <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that any Commonwealth legislator would accept the proposition that universities have autonomy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the purpose of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A true pacifist says: ‘The kind of peace that I want is not peace at any price, but peace with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity for myself and for my neighbours*. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The true pacifist when he believes that peace wilh <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity can only be obtained by defence puts the price of his life and limb on it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that no person in a democracy has the right to seek more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or liberty for himself than he is willing to grant to his neighbour. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy have been made, by corruption, words and weapons of war at this moment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711005_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But while hoping that there is as wide a recognition as possible of that position, I think we have all recognised that traditionally universities have been places in which there has been a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of inquiry and investigation and a breadth of opinion held which is in the interests of a developing community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would be a great misfortune if, because there was a resistance to authority, those freedoms of universities were sought to be challenged by the mass of the community who felt that students were going too far. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Georges  is a well known name in this country as a fighter for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But America responded and it was because of that response that we continue to enjoy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty which we have and for which so many noble men and women made the supreme sacrifice in many theatres of war during World War I and World War II and in Korea and Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711006_senate_27_s49/#subdebate-71-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>that  the rights of individuals in this Parliament, including that of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to the joining of a trade union, will he protected? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711012_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Britain has earned the right to do so through her sacrifices to preserve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the last war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those 250 million people have a right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, a right to separate identity and a right to have their voices heard. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711103_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can his rights, including that of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, be protected legally? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-19-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask the AttorneyGeneral, on the same subject, whether he recognises also the fundamental right of persons who are members of a voluntary association which is recognised by the law of this country and which represents them in endeavours to improve their wages and conditions, to say that as a matter of their own <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, they will decline to work with a person who accepts the benefit of what is obtained by the association but is not prepared to join it and pay a subscription to it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these considerations is that an individual has a basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which he should be able lo exercise in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That also is one of the freedoms in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What I think is the antithesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is when some people in an organisation decide that everybody must do what the organisation decides, irrespective of whether they have any say in it, and when people outside the organisation who have no wish to join it are denied employment if they do not join or are otherwise penalised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that while that situation exists and is supported by the honourable senator and the Party to which he belongs their protestations about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals are so much hot air. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We could argue about prices and about the manner in which they are determined, but the fact is that about 25 per cent of wool growers exercise a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and sell privately. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711104_senate_27_s50_C1/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Common criticisms of price control by governments are that it constitutes undue interference with business <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and tends to produce uniformity and to damp down competition. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711109_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The area of commercial activity, and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Commission to act in that area, are severely limited by the restriction to  biologicals  and the dependence upon revenue from products whose prices are fixed under the National Health Scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is the view of the Commission that there should be a re-appraisal of ils objectives and responsibilities, lt is necessary to give the Commission <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and positive assistance to operate in a wider area of activity if it is expected to continue to be largely financially self-sufficient. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All I desire to say is that the Government is as concerned as, if not more concerned than, the Australian Labor Party to promote a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and a development of competition under which the Australian community can prosper. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711110_senate_27_s50/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have become aware of the fact that black bans have been imposed by certain union organisations which apparently would deny to certain persons the right to engage in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of employment, which right has long been one of the things for which the trade union movement has fought.I think that not only is it a denial of ordinary freedoms of people to prevent them from continuing in their employment but also it is denial of what every Australian should regard as something basic to his country’s future and something which he would desire to protect. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711130_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are that we seek to combine the principle of public ownership, of a broad but not loo detailed public accountability, of a consciousness on the part of the undertaking that it is working for the nation and not for sectional interests, with the liveliness, initiative, and a considerable degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of a quick-moving and progressive business enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, particularly following the High Court decision invalidating State receipts duties as they applied to certain types of transaction, it  was  clear that, notwithstanding these large increases in Commonwealth revenue assistance, it would be desirable for the States to have access to a new source of taxation to give them greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence in revenue raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711202_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have to realise that we no longer live in a frontier world in which everybody’s rights and freedoms can be expressed, as they were 50 or 100 years ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may well be that some rights have to be sacrificed so that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of all to enjoy the total environment can be achieved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711207_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A meeting of Foreign Ministers of member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations - Thailand, The Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia - which took place in Kuala Lumpur on 26th-27th November 1971 adopted a declaration stating that they would seek to secure recognition of, and respect for, SouthEast Asia as a zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality, free from any form or manner of interference by outside powers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A public statement after the meeting by the Malaysian  chairman,  Tun Abdul Razak, indicated that it was the intention of the meeting that the proposed zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality should include, in addition to the participants, Burma, Laos, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Vietnam and North Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It has not been suggested either by the Governments which met at Kuala Lumpur or by the Australian Government that Australia should be included in the proposed zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that definite and prompt action has to be taken from time to time to ensure that success  is  achieved and that the settlers emerge to a position of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from control and direction in a given time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19711209_senate_27_s50/#subdebate-44-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Campbell and Whitmore in ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> in Australia’ give the following definition: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Was it a national disgrace in this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> loving community for  Mr Whitlam  to say, as he did: ‘lt is not for me to gel him’ - thai is,  Mr Johnston  - ‘before the court and it is not for the AttorneyGeneral to assert his guilt.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wonder whether this Government will ever learn to distinguish between the laws that are fundamental for good government and those that are antithetical to order and personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Douglas  McClelland said - this is a standard which one could never really test - that you have to make a distinction between laws which are necessary for good government and laws which are antithetic lo <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law and I believe that the law can be maintained only if people are vigilant to recognise the values which it has for society and the freedoms which it protects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will persist in that statement and I will use every forum, every platform, every debate and ever&gt; opportunity that 1 have to make sure that the people of Australia appreciate the values of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If that approach which I have indicated involves me in a party political partisanship it is only because those who would oppose the rule of law and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the rule of law must have their attitudes exposed so that they can be subjected to the spotlight of what is involved in the attitudes which they are putting forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is part of the philosophy of the Government to which I belong and, believe me, it is the credo of the Liberal and Country Parties which have governed this country for the last 20 years and have not imperilled or prejudiced <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law in that period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I assure the Senate that I shall protect the public interest, the rule of law and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under that rule of law which 1 believe to be the very heart and core of the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720301_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal system by its dispersions of power among many authorities and other diverse and defined areas of responsibility gives more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me, the principal value of the Federal system in its dispersion of power and responsibility, a Government in many areas closer to the daily needs of the people and a greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from arbitrary decisions in a centralist position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720302_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is nothing more disheartening than the fact that there are still so many intelligent and informed people who in most other respects will defend <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and yet are induced by the immediate benefits of an expansionist policy to support what, in the long run, must destroy the foundations of  a  free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720321_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone has the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to change his religion or belief, and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Any attempt to destroy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice must inevitably under these conditions be a socialisation or a nationalisation of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The device of approaching this matter on the basis of the needs and priorities of schools is an insidious device because, if a government has the power to discriminate between schools and to determine which ones shall be encouraged and which shall wither on the vine, that government has the power to wipe out the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720323_senate_27_s51/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The last two editions of National U have revealed the existence of an organisation known as Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>, ft became apparent that this group was co-ordinating a systematic attack on student governing bodies throughout Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>However, information has since been received which clearly illustrates that the extent of Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>’s activities and organisation range from the highest office in the land through a tightly knit organisation of politicians, academics, intellectuals, and journalists  in  all the Australian Stales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is a ridiculous assertion to suggest that a body which is concerned with Australia’s defence, the maintenance of Australia’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the alerting of the people of Australia to the menace of communism should in some way be regarded as manipulating democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would only say in respect of  Mr Cairns,  because the comment has been made, that I know and his colleagues know that he is a person who supports the Liberal Party, who supports democracy, who believes in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and who opposes communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What is alleged is that there is in existence an organisation called Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The goals of the Peace with <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> organisation appear to be political goals and they could be described fairly as being of an extreme right wing nature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Early in his speech he indicated that he did not like the organisation called Peace for <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> because most of his policies and the policies of his Party are directed towards peace, or rather the absence of struggle, against communist subversion or aggression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720426_senate_27_s52/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Did the Attorney-General receive correspondence which was delivered to his office by myself last week in which a number of draft resisters who had failed to register thanked the Attorney-General for giving them <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to walk around Canberra influencing other young lads to fail to register? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720427_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is one thing which attracts overseas companies to come to Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720509_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government and the State Governments are bound by section 92  -  I am referring to one of the notes that we made at the time - and it applies to any legislative or governmental action which operates to restrict the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to engage in interstate trade, commerce or intercourse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we all recognise that many people have come to this country to experience a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of living, a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from all the apparatus of tyranny and authoritarianism which characterises the Communist countries of this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are throughout the world millions of people who have left their homeland, to which naturally they would have desired to adhere, in order to secure a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which is denied to them by the Communist regimes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> in this country means that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech for those who are opposed to communism and for those who support communism and who would seek to destroy the very <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which allows them to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly have not only <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech but also <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to publish by the written word, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to disseminate views and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move around. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we seek to establish the widest possible <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication with other countries including the communist countries which, given the opportunity, would seek to deny that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication which we cherish in this land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, as I see it, we have to take the good with the bad because <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is meaningless unless we are prepared to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we were to adopt the course, which presumably we could adopt in the form of legislation, of stopping material coming into this country, I believe that we would be cutting down on a <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, we may cut down on a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> if it is necessary to preserve the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720510_senate_27_s52/#debate-32">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the need to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action by unions and employers, consistent with the need to protect the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720517_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have not seen the statement, but one of the beautiful things about the Government parties, unlike some other parties, is that members have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express their own views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At what stage should society say that the consumption of a drug is so harmful that it has to be prohibited, even though this action does deny certain freedoms to people to do what they want to do with their minds and their bodies? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand, the other consideration which has to be taken into account - this is part of the same problem - is at what stage, society is entitled to say that as the drug is harmful it is entitled to take away this man’s or that woman’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to indulge in it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 do not believe that the responsibility should be imposed on those who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to establish that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which they are advocating is nol harmful and never can be harmful in any circumstances. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In conclusion 1 wish to say only this: J believe that the function of the state is to guarantee liberties to the citizen and not to take his freedoms away from him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before any <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is taken away from any person it must be shown very clearly that there are overwhelming considerations relating to the interests of the society or the interests of the state which justify the deprivation of that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I deprecate the fact that, as a Victorian, he did not acknowledge that if Victoria were given <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to produce all of the milk products it wished to produce it could provide over and above what the Commonwealth of Australia would require. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There was no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for his Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I expressed my great concern that the Attorney-General should place the Commonwealth Police in the position in which they have been placed at his direction and also that the individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and civil rights of Chris Shanley were offended in this way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720518_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, this Government’s philosophy rates very highly the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to decide for themselves, within the broad framework of our democratic society, matters concerning their own well-being. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accordingly it is not recognised as a role of this Government to impose prohibitions on people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice except for the most compelling national reasons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720523_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government believes today - as it has always done - in a system of free enterprise under which citizens have as much <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as possible to participate in the production and distribution of the nation’s wealth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It makes consequential provision to ensure the effectiveness of undertakings in the loan and guarantee agreements regarding <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of payments from Australian taxation or restrictions imposed by Australian law and includes an appropriation of moneys required for the Commonwealth to make any payments under the guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Just listen to some of the grandiose thoughts on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in that Party’s constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Under (d) (iii) the following appears:  <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, religion and  association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party concept of a trade union is an organisation that seeks power for the trade union boss and no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for those people at the grass roots. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear Labor senators plead in this chamber for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the ordinary trade unionist, my heart will be glad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720524_senate_27_s52/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is contrary to international conventions adopted over the years concerning the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and the protection of the right to organise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many statements have been made on the rights and freedoms of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We hear in this chamber many discussions about how trade unions elsewhere are not free and about how Australia is providing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for its citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the provisions which traditionally have appeared in the conventions concerning the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and the protection of the right to organise? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workers’ and employers’ organisations shall have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Liberal-Country Party Government is consistently eroding the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the citizens, lt is doing this right now in regard to the trade unions, lt is setting precedents of the most dangerous kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seeks therefore to put limitations on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action of unionists and it is not hard to understand why the trade union movement reacts towards the Government as it does - why it opposes the Government on most if not all of its policies and supports the policies and activities of the Australian Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Twenty years ago the International Labour Organisation constituted a Committee of <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>87 which protects the rights of the trade union movement to organise and to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wonder whether this is a breach of the conditions adopted by the International Labour Organisation and its Committee of <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>87 guarantees to all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorisation, the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing; these organisations are to have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, without interference by the public authorities; they may not be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority; they shall have the right to form federations and confederations, and to affiliate with international organisations of workers and employers; those rights also apply to federations and confederations; the acquisition of legal personality by organisations may not be made subject to conditions restricting the exercise of these rights; in exercising them workers and employers and their respective organisations must respect the law of the land, but in turn the law of the land may not be such as to impair, nor may it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in the Convention; the extent to which the guarantees provided for in the Convention shall apply to the armed forces and the police is to be determined by national laws or regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We also remind the Government of ils obligation to the 1LO and its numerous conventions, a number of which emphasise the right of unions to organise, the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Their policy, at least in Victoria for many years, has been one of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vote, particularly in municipal elections. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government restricts the organisational <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of unions, in a way in which it does not restrict the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of other organisations, by imposing upon those unions all sorts of arbitrary rules which have not been agreed upon by the members of the unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720525_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They need advice on planning estates, arranging finance, the use of trust funds, entering into contracts, asserting citizen rights under the Constitution, defending themselves or their families in the courts of the land, fighting for their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty, and generally in asserting citizenship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I include parliamentarians in the comparison because it at least gives us a chance to compare the level of our salaries with those of a section of the Public Service whose salaries are adjusted at the same time as legislation is introduced to impose more restrictions on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of unions and organisations to make collective agreements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If restraint is to be applied let us not have the restraint that the Labor Party wants, which is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the union bosses and chairs for the union employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720526_senate_27_s52/#debate-33">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This Government has had a mighty record over 20 years in preserving the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we all possess. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Australia, a signatory to that convention, believes on the one hand in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to organise themselves into organisations while on the other, through the clauses contained in this Bill, interferes in trade onion activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I said previously that I sincerely believed that Australia is openly in conflict with what is subscribed to in the charter of that United Nations’ Organisation and is leaving itself open to examination by the Committee for <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association, a part of that Organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>1 appeal to them to pause, look at the sentiments expressed by the Committee of <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association of the International Labour Organisation and to think over the statements that I have made today that were advanced to the important Third United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held at Santiago, Chile, from 13th April to 19th May. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720530_senate_27_s52/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This will have the effect of reducing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of organisations and will cause an erosion of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In fact, I am simply exercising the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which is given to Liberal Party members of Parliament - a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which was so favourably commented upon by the Prime Minister  (Mr McMahon)  last Monday at the meeting of the Federal Libera) Party Council. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Gallup Polls have shown that the community wants its standards upheld against the advocates of porn and moral subversion, whose propaganda undermines the roots of ordered <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by the pollution of the people, and those in power would do well to give more heed to real public opinion than to mass media writers who do not reflect it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said earlier, this Bill is no attack on the integrity of the Minister for Customs and Excise; it is simply an exercise in that democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which Liberal parliamentarians enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The situation over many years has been that these sections of the media, along with the other sections, have enjoyed a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to engage in advertising as a form of revenue raising. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720531_senate_27_s52/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We remember that it was in the airways case that he established the essentials of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as outlined in section 92 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He further expounded those essentials, against strong dissent but with great perseverance, in the road transport cases, in which he declared that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> must insist upon opposing arbitrary government discretion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720815_senate_27_s53/#debate-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service whether at the 53rd session of the International Labour Organisation a decision was made that a representative of the Director-General of the ILO should visit Australia to have discussions with the Australian Government that could lead to Australia’s ratifying Convention 87 which deals with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the right to organise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720816_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The proposition was that just because there is an industrial dispute trade unionists should have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to ignore law which exists for the protection of property and other persons. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720823_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was only going to add that this is a remarkable privilege to be claimed by a Party claiming to be a democratic party, to give to one class in our community - organisations, trade unions - <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from any responsibility whatever in law or any action for anything in any way done in the course of an industrial dispute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  is consonant with  Senator Mulvihill’s  philosophy since obviously he does not believe in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In support of my proposition that the ABC is running a particular line in its current affairs programmes, I turn to an address given by  Mr Gerald  Stone, senior reporter of the ABC’s programme ‘This Day Tonight’, when addressing a seminar of the Australian Association for Cultural <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> on 27th May 1971. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On either, all I do is ask the people of Australia to understand that the Labour Party, which over the years has set out to destroy <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech outside and inside this chamber, tonight is using the same techniques, and it will not succeed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720830_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If fundamental requirements for more democracy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> were set out in a letter from the Government to  Mr Clunies-Ross  in 1968, why has the Government failed to ensure  Mr Clunies-Ross’s  compliance with those directives so that the islanders could be freed from this so-called benevolent despotism? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720831_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is quite apart from courtesy and the denial of what other people call <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which ought to be observed in this place if nowhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law and I believe that the law can be maintained only if people arc vigilant to recognise the values which it has for society, and the freedoms which il protects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will persist in that statement and I will use every forum, every platform, every debate and every opportunity that I have to make sure that the people of Australia appreciate the values of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I sought to make a statement when you had completed your reply, as I thought thatI had justification for making my attitude known, but there was not enough decency in the Government forces to permit me to have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which, we hoped, operated in this chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720913_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But let us assume that there are people who could establish, as of tonight, that they are entitled to their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and who, as of tomorrow are going to start proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720914_senate_27_s53/#debate-53">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is it wrong for a group of people to leave Australia and go to Yugoslavia, in their view, for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This triggered off bitterness and hatreds which gave rise to the development of the Ustasha and to the development of a number of groups of Croatian <span class="highlight">freedom</span> fighters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think that the word has been described as meaning rise up, uprising, get going, get up - signifying, really a call to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Croatia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That call to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was complicated and perverted by the fact that in 1941 Italy and Germany overran this tragic country again and then carved it up again into a group of countries, handing them out to the people around - giving a part to Bulgaria and so on, and giving to Croatia a form of independence during those World War IT years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Let us make this quite clear: We stand for the right of people to fight for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This does not mean that we scorn their ideas of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720919_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The emphatic answer ls no but I do express a concern and exercise the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which every honourable senator has to reply to the Press which, by and large, is answerable to nobody for the prejudice, slanting and selective reporting of particular issues upon which some newspapers have a particular line to put forward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course, if the Ordinance is disallowed the Aborigines or anyone else will have complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to erect a tent on unleased land simply on the basis of the right to organise in the appropriate manner or in a manner which the Aborigines think effective. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The reason for the Opposition moving for the disallowance of the Ordinance is to retain a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Aborigines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If that word is too harsh I say that it is a deliberate untruth because they do not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action at all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These parties have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to exist in this country although they do not have very much support from the Australian community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What has been stated about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> movements in this country is common to the Hungarians, to the Czeches and to the Rumanians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can take honourable senators to any one national group and show them <span class="highlight">freedom</span> movements, liberation movements which are of course endemic to the group, because they all live with the hope that one day the tyranny of the Iron Curtain will end and they can be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They will be thoroughly interested to know that the national aspirations of human beings to seek <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for their country from the tyranny of communism is being rejected by the Labor Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The AttorneyGeneral as the protector of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country has stood proudly in this Parliament to defend <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That movement embraces all those people who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence for Croatia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>’, and  Mr Luvokivic  used a form of words to this effect: ‘Including those who formerly followed the beliefs of the Ustasha because the Ustasha had as its goal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for Croatia’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While opposing violence, I ask that there be in Australia a human understanding that all people who have been forced out of Iron Curtain countries have, in their hearts, a natural hunger to form <span class="highlight">freedom</span> bodies in the hope that one day they will return to their countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can only say from my knowledge of the history of the Labor Party  in  this country that the Labor Party never downed or attacked the right of  people  to  condemn  tyranny in an overseas country  and it conceded  their right to form an organisation by peaceful means to advocate <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I draw attention to  Senator Douglas  McClelland’s statement that he believes that none of the migrants are entitled to work for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the countries whence they came. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of their own country so that it can get away from the iron heel of communism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720920_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-66-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I feel that newspapers have a tremendously important role to exercise a criticism and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which makes the democratic system work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720921_senate_27_s53/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I tell the Minister that while I believe that this great Australian company, the Australian Gas Light Co., should be permitted to buy wherever it desires - that it should have this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> - nevertheless in this case it appears to me quite strongly that Australian industry was not given sufficient and appropriate specification upon which to quote. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19720927_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Insofar as the description of it by  Senator Mulvihill  is a protest about inflammatory editorials in newspapers, I think we must recognise that in this country, providing the incitement involved in the newspapers does not offend against the law, there is an essential <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which we know does not exist in Yugoslavia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721010_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The number of occasions upon which Australian citizens are losing their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in visiting Yugoslavia is becoming far too numerous to be allowed to pass unnoticed or as some vague hoary allegation that they are members of some terrorist outfit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The purpose in raising this matter is to ask that some action be taken by our Government to protect the value of an Australian passport and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of an Australian citizen who has already been called up for military service in this country, so that when visiting any parts of Europe the members of our migrant community can feel that the Australian Government is behind them and will give them the same protection as it would give to any other Australian citizen who may be travelling abroad. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721012_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One might take into account the fact that the establishment of a national pipeline authority by the Australian Labor Party would still have to meet the test of the bar in section 92 of the Constitution to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of interstate trade and commerce. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721018_senate_27_s54/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A publication, which gives rise to my remarks tonight, called ‘On Target”, copies of which may be inspected in the Parliamentary Library, is a weekly commentary produced by the League of Rights, which has the very praiseworthy slogan which I am sure will commend itself to the Attorney-General: ‘The Price of <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> is Eternal Vigilance’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1972/19721024_senate_27_s54/#debate-62">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>May I indicate to honourable senators for their information that the Prime Minister some weeks ago announced that the Cabinet had authorised me to prepare a Bill for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, broadly following the concepts of the American <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act and to implement in Australia what was broadly then recommended by the Franks Committee in the United Kingdom, that is, to remove restrictions upon public servants and to clarify the areas in which they might not be permitted to speak out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In point of fact, it is most unlikely that the Labor Party’s so-called mandate could by any stretch of the imagination be extended to include the hurling of insults by Government Ministers at the  President  of a nation with which we have long, friendly and beneficial relations and which, in the final analysis, is the one nation which could guarantee our safety and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> if that need arose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730308_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I also seriously offended the Labor Party in that I dared to legislate for the appointment of an appeal board at a university, and I was charged with destroying the academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the university - yet nobody could tell me what academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I take pride in my membership of the Liberal Party in that over some 25 years I have exercised in regard to fundamental issues and not so fundamental issues that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which I think, if one wants to reflect upon it and look upon it, is one of the characteristics of the Liberal Party in this country - and long may those principles be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that indicates why, philosophically and intrinsically, the Liberal Party is superior to the Australian Labor Party which does not allow this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence of opinion which ought to be the hallmark of sophisticated, educated and intelligent legislators in the national interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730410_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-63-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is little doubt that as we develop our mineral resources and as the demand increases throughout the consuming countries of the world for our primary products, we will see even a greater demand from Japan for our products, particularly since the Japanese Government appears to be lifting some of its restrictions as to what the Japanese can buy, thus allowing them a great deal more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to purchase overseas goods. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730503_senate_28_s55/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I said in my speech in Sydney last Sunday that the Australian Government can help in providing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Press by assisting in removing the great ambiguities which exist as a result of different libel laws in the various States of Australia, especially in these days when the media generally - newspapers, radio and television - go well beyond State boundaries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The type of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to which I am referring in particular is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to provide the public with true information about the state of society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>While the Government is threatening to sub ject the combinations of business to the strict rigours of the criminal law, it is providing a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action to the amalgamations of unionism in a way which no society which expects its Government to hold the balance between the powerful economic groups in the community can possibly tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730606_senate_28_s56/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat that I have moved this amendment because, as the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Withers)  announced when the debate on this Bill commenced many months ago, the opportunity would be taken during the debate in the Committee stage of the Bill, because members of the Opposition had differing views on the matter and had a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vote as they pleased, to move amendments and identify areas in which it may be thought desirable that the death penalty be retained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730828_senate_28_s57/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have always spoken very strongly in favour of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of honourable senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is very important that our rules do protect us so that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech for everyone in this Senate and so that they all have the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He drew our attention to the wording of one of the Standing Orders but I do not think it referred to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, the subject about which he spoke. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730926_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The situation has now been reached where there is complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of trade, as we understand it, between the 2 countries without any protective barrier being available to the Australian industry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I say that here we have actions of unique and naked courage by 2 men who are projecting to the world a message which is not only a message that in Russia there is the supression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as well as physical <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- but a message which must be understood in its other implication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a message which says that other countries which deal with Russia, which make treaties with Russia, particularly defence treaties, are putting themselves and therefore the world in peril when they as countries with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought make pacts with a country which has total totalitarian organisation of human thought and action within itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sought within Russia to develop through the Soviet human rights committee intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is a man whose sons have been expelled from universities and whose son-in-law has been denied employment; a man who has spoken up despite all these threats because he believes that unless there is intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> not only Russia but the world will suffer; a man who is not willing to go outside Russia to attend scientific conferences at this moment because he knows that in common with his colleagues who have done so before he will be denied return, that he will be exiled if he does so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One, the author, speaking and pleading and placing his life at risk for intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of culture, for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of literature and for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of man to write; the other, the great physicist, placing his life at risk for the parallel <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, namely, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of scientists to talk freely about science, to exchange scientific knowledge and, therefore, to have true scientific <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have here pleas for both the great freedoms of communication. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This man walks with fear because there is growing evidence that suppression, which tragically has been a characteristic of Russia over the years, has been accelerating in recent years and today practically all intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is being wiped out. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Andrei Sakharov, who founded the Soviet Human Rights Committee, was one of the great leaders in establishing the underground Press called ‘Samizdat’ or ‘the Chronicle of Current Events’ through which vehicle dissidents- the men I have mentioned and others- who wanted to fight for intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> promulgated their ideas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are saying- we are asking the Senate to support us- is: ‘Please ask the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations to look into this matter because human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and human dignity in the Soviet Union must be as precious to us as human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and human dignity in our own country ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those of us who saw the further aggression against Hungary looked towards de-Stalinisation in the hope that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> would come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were then brought to abject misery by the further invasion of Czechoslovakia barely 5 years ago, the Dubcek incident and the repression of intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> throughout Czechoslovakia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking this because we believe it is the duty of every citizen, wherever he or she lives in the world, to pursue <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the body and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking it for 2 reasons, not only the reason I emphasise, which would be good enough but, also that inside Russia there is prima facie evidence of the total supression of intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are asking it not only because we should try to give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to these great men but because we have to treat with this nation which shares parity of power with America in this world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With that in mind and in the belief in human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and human dignity, in the belief that it is imperative that there should be an honesty and an integrity of purpose in the negotiation of great nations, I commend to the Senate the motion moved by  Senator Hannan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time I suggest- I do not do this in any contentious or partisan way- that when we are talking of human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we should be aware also of selective indignation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span>, of course, is a heady draught and the thaw, as is the nature of such things, largely got out of hand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that the Soviet authorities have had the dissident movement well and truly under control, and I believe that they could have have allowed a much greater amount of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> than they have done without any threat at all to the system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My views on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of culture and science are known to the Soviet leaders. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But putting people into psychiatric hospitals and administering to them mind destroying drugs which  Senator Carrick  has mentioned and which Solzhenitsyn particularly emphasises, is, I believe, the ultimate in human cruelty because it results in the destruction of the last refuge which man would have under these circumstances, and that is his free mind and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to exercise his mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was moved because throughout the Western world a feeling of repugnance and abhorrence is growing at the treatment which is being meted out to those few- that minute fraction which is less than 1 per cent of the Russian population- who seek an intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, a right to express views, a right to hold opinions and to act in accordance with them, which is not permitted by the total conformity of the communist system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It takes one view about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in certain countries and takes a totally different view about it in other parts of the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly, it is the mark of any civilisation that society should be concerned about the various essential freedoms of man- his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to voice opinions and generally his basic right to his humanity We know that in the interests of society there must always be some limitations which must be imposed upon absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In any society man must live with his fellows and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, in the context in which we use it and in the context in which we seek to preserve it, must involve some regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we do not have that regulation, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> amounts to licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People who talk of absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> are talking simply of the absolute right to do as they please. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we seek to protect the basic freedoms we acknowledge that the society in which an individual is part has some rights; indeed, it has some obligations in the interests of others to impose some limitation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The constant theme of every developing society is to balance the demands and the needs of authority as they are exercised in the interests of others and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or liberties of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The totalitarian countries, the fascist countries, the communist countries and the dictatorships limit <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in ways which are anathema to those who accept the traditions which are part of our way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19730927_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-66-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That Australian citizens place great value on their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose their own doctor in all aspects of medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That we believe in a doctor’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to provide a personal service based on personal responsibility within a system based on quality rather than quantity, as opposed to an impersonal service in which doctor and patient lose their identity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giving the Commission <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to take into consideration the degree of public interest affected would not alter the position. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731017_senate_28_s57/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Again, we gave our manpower, womanpower and our treasure in the interests of world <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731023_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I regard the question of ensuring <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the effects of industrial stoppages as being of vital importance to the State of Tasmania and its people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, the mandatory provision does not restrict the Government’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make changes of policy such as the recent 25 per cent reduction in tariffs, to negotiate changes in levels of assistance for the purpose of international trade agreements, or to extend preferential treatment to developing countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731024_senate_28_s57/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Even though ideally we would have liked more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action in the number of judges that we could appoint, I firmly believe that if the amendment sponsored by  Senator Little  is adopted by the Senate we will have gone a long way towards satisfying the pressing need for more judges in this court. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731025_senate_28_s57/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The test is whether we have achieved in this world an atmosphere or an environment in which by our actions our own country is more secure and more free and we are living in an atmosphere in our region in which there is stability and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and we are respected for the views we hold and because we are willing to stand up for the other fellow and his right to be different. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I refer to the continuation and preservation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to the type of education which should be given to children in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731107_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such action takes away the complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would say that they have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to collect money to assist them in their campaigns from wherever they come. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But when one speaks in the Parliament one speaks with all the advantage and responsibility of complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from defamation law, under parliamentary privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731108_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>1 ) That Australian citizens place great value on their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose their own doctor in all aspects of medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To dispel mounting concern in many areas of industry, can the AttorneyGeneral, as Leader of the Government in the Senate, give an assurance that no commodity which is freely salable according to law will be denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of advertising? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-17-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important factor here is the meaning of ‘a prior right’, because to have the right or the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do something must mean that one has the opportunity to do it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the only possible interpretation of ‘prior right’ or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Commission provides diversity, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and absence of discrimination, its influence will certainly be good. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is why, in any discussion of this Schools Commission Bill today, it is important to observe that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in the total education sphere is essential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I referred earlier to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement occasioned by the inclusion of the independent school sector within our education community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is very important to stimulate this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in educational thought by the involvement of educational and community interests in any proposed commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There are a dozen different ways of doing it without punishing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the pockets of the 94 per cent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731113_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Incidentally, it gives to the Minister a greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement; only a minority of the people are specified according to nominated categories. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Rae’s  amendment gives the profession an involvement which is an extremely valuable one and at the same time allows <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and flexibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731120_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is said to be more effective in ensuring <span class="highlight">freedom</span> than a Bill of Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite our supposed commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, we cannot be self-satisfied about what is happening in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I will not go through them all; they are concerned with such matters as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, the protection of individual privacy, the rights of a person charged with a criminal offence, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is what remains after one takes account of the laws relating to defamation, contempt of court, censorship, obscenity, offensive behaviour, sedition, official secrecy and the like. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of assembly is restricted by the scarcity of places in which people who wish to express a particular point of view can assemble without official permission from some authority or other. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is often muzzled by the laws that circumscribe <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression or by its ownership being concentrated in the hands of vested interests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many restrictions on individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> are necessary to protect the rights of others, or to prevent a crowded society from falling into chaos. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Part II of the Bill will establish in legislation of the Australian Parliament fundamental rights and freedoms in a number of extremely important areas which are not at present covered by formal legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A basic provision of the legislation is to provide that everyone is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the legislation, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Part II of the Bill then proceeds to deal with a number of important rights, including the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, conscience and religion, the right to hold opinions without interference, the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, the right to peaceful assembly, the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, the right, without unreasonable restrictions, to take part in the conduct of public affairs, vote at elections held by universal and equal suffrage and to hold public office, the right to liberty of movement, and the right to privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the provisions relating to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion, expression, assembly, association and movement, the legislation provides that these rights may be restricted in certain circumstances, such as where restriction is reasonably necessary to protect public safety or public health or constitute reasonable regulations, as to time, place and manner, of the right. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 8 makes it unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or perference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the political, economic, social, cultural or other field of public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731121_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In our view there must always remain not only a flexibility in interpretation of education but also <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for both parent and student, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opportunity for groups that wish to establish a school and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for teachers to express their vocation in any one of a number of educational systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731205_senate_28_s58/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The precise terms of the Covenant in regard to education escape me, but generally the covenant refers to the preservation of religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span>.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The legislation the Government is now proposing represents a sincere endeavour to build a new health benefits system in a way which will meet the expectations of the public for high quality health services to be readily accessible to all, which will expand rather than inhibit the opportunities for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, which will promote efficiency in the delivery of health services and which will assist in the upgrading of hospital and community based health facilities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It gives <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from fear cif the financial consequences of illness, it gives <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor and hospital and it does this in a way which does not levy a penalty on the sick and the economically less fortunate members of this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731211_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It also aims to preserve the dignity of the Australian people, their total <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in medical and hospital care, their personal privacy and to maintain the present quality of Australian health care which is recognised as being as high as any existing in the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Its costs are restrained and personal responsibility is retained, because the financial burden is partly borne by the patients themselves; cases of hardship attract Government subsidy; real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice exists in the selection of one’s doctor and private hospitalsboth religious and charitable- retain their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to contribute substantially to a dual system of hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the DLP believes that, given support by the Government and the other Opposition Parties, this Bill will provide fully adequate medical and hospital care, in which the patient is guaranteed his personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the maintenance of the present high standard of health in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our scheme, the scheme which exists at the moment, is a scheme which, in the interests of the preservation of a free society and of the right of choice and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctors, hospitals and health insurance, allows every Australian the opportunity to exercise that choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If doctors wish to see a situation in which there is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and in which there is an opportunity for competition, it is their duty to ensure that they comply with the annual determination which would be fixed by an independent tribunal comprising representatives of government, consumers and the medical profession, under the chairmanship of an independent person. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s proposal is to take away the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of up to 92 per cent of Australians, who now voluntarily insure with the fund of their own choice or who are covered by other aspects of health care, and to compel them, by a taxation mechanism, to insure, up to standard hospital ward care level in what can be described only in the terms which were used in many of the debates on this scheme as a monolithic Government insurance fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  Mr Hayden  wishes to direct attention towards covering the uncovered, he would have our full support, but instead he is attacking the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of Australians and upsetting the arrangements made and approved by an overwhelming majority of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this Bill in its present form and with its associated proposals will clearly do the following: It will lower the quality of medical care for Australian families; it will increase the total costs for the Government and thus for taxpayers; it will increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers, because they could only maintain the present quality of their health care by additional heavy commitments for private insurance; it will reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; it will jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and by design and intent it will be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The truth of the matter is that the Opposition has no desire to allow the members of the Australian community any real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the type of hospital and medical care they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition opposes the legislation and will vote against it because we believe that it will lower the quality of medical care for Australian families; that it will increase the total costs for the Government and thus the taxpayers; that it will increase total costs for the majority of taxpayers because they can maintain the present quality of their health care only by additional heavy commitments for private insurance; that it will reduce the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; that it will jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and by design and intent it will be the first stage of nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short they were the lower quality of medical care which is envisaged under Labor’s proposals, the greatly increased cost to the majority of the taxpayers, the loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice so far as the individual is concerned, the jeopardy to the whole future of religious, private and country hospitals and, what is more important to many of us, the first stage of Labor’s proposals for the nationalisation of health and medical care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It leaves to the citizen a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of selection of the type of hospitalisation he will have, the doctor of his choice and the method by which he will insure himself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If Labor has its way, there will be a lower quality of medical care in Australia, increased costs for the Government, increased total costs for the majority of taxpayers, rejection of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which exists at present, the jeopardy of the future of religious, private and country hospitals and the nationalisation and socialisation of medical health care in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I throw that right into the teeth of honourable senators opposite when they talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Treasury were to hand out money to people who refused on conscience to join a private enterprise health system it could be said that there was <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because we believe that the proposal of the socialist Minister will mean a downgrading of the medical service and a consequent lowering of the standards of health care to Australian families, because it will destroy the existing scheme, increase the total cost to the Government and for the majority of taxpayers, because it will mean the end of private and religious hospitals, and, above all because it will mean the end of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of patients with respect to their doctor or hospital, we totally reject the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731212_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if people wish to see the film- there are some very strong views that such films should be made available- it is my belief that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the citizen requires that he ought to be able to see such a film. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, there is room for the principle for which the Liberal Party stands, and that is that there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in education and that it is a fundamental concept in a free society that children should not be forced into one form of education which is controlled by the Government of the day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1973/19731213_senate_28_s58/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I stand, as do all my colleagues, behind a Liberal Party which does believe in individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, which does believe in the opportunity of every individual to make his own life in his own way so long as he does not offend or deny to others the rights which he claims to himself and who seeks to ensure that this will be a self-reliant nation in which individuals will be proud of. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740410_senate_28_s59/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It has always seemed very sad to me that this situation should arise in respect of a proposal to introduce a national health insurance scheme which will give universal coverage to those in the community for their medical, surgical and other needs, which will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the patient and the doctor and which will extend <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to pensioners. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It considers that governments should take no part in anything except the defence of the country and what it calls the preservation of individual freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By ‘preservation of individual freedoms’ this organisation, like all these organisations, means the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of one man to exploit another. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My concept and, I believe, my Party’s concept, of the future of this country and of the future of the individuals in this country is that people should have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the opportunity to realise their reasonable ambitions without being exploited by others or indeed without exploiting others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#debate-37">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The important point I make about the health insurance program and the changes which are taking place in the industrial relations field is simply that in both areas the Government’s policies represent an enlargement of the freedoms of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They remove the fear of the consequences of ill health for a very substantial proportion of our community and they allow <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association in industrial organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the last few months there has been much talk about threats to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual Australians, but there has been little analysis of the meaning of the word ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to give an indication of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we were guaranteed in this country under the previous government one needs only to refer to the denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to conscripts who were sent to Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That was the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that existed in practice 2 years ago under the previous government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there are other concepts involved in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and I will briefly refer to them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While much is said about <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, after 18 months of Labor Government not many people can really point the finger and say that this Government has in any way detracted from the civil liberties of Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, I believe that we, as a Government, have tried to instill into our community the idea that there is such a thing as economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in terms of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from unemployment, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make decisions about where you send your children to school and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make decisions about what you do with your leisure- all sorts of things which flow from a more equitable distribution of wealth in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the blight of unemployment and there is the question of equality of opportunity in education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are new and real freedoms which the Government has started to give to the Australian people in the last 18 months. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, let us look at what the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> really means in real terms for the Australian people and not for certain selected individuals in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is sometimes stated by Opposition spokesmen that in some peculiar way which has never been explained to my satisfaction, the existing federal structure in Australia provides a bulwark for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have all the indications that in this country one of the freedoms which we are to be allowed to enjoy is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> not to have a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think that one of the freedoms which we should have in this country is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to have a home. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of our senators talked tonight of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> to be disemployed; <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to be retrained and reshuffled like a pawn; <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to submit to the industrial anarchy urged on by  Mr Clyde  Cameron and his Labor colleagues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Whitlam Government has failed to come forward with any comprehensive or concerted plan for delimiting and reducing inflation or for maintaining effective full employment with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have the Labor Party endorsing doctrinaire socialism as if the removal of the right of people to choose their own jobs is not a great loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and as if the destruction of a great electrical industry in Australia is not one of the most serious threats not only to employment but also to the security and defence of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740710_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perverted logic also enables conservatives to pose as champions of civil liberty and individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> while simultaneously voting for conscription, sometimes with enthusiasm and apparently without embarrassment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740711_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to whether  Mr Langer  ‘s publicly stated political beliefs should prevent his employment by the Australian Post Office- or for that matter, any other department- I point out that this Government believes in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of political beliefs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In summary, these health Bills would remove the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice from the patient in regard to the hospital, doctor and type of care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This Bill promises that it will give the patient <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from worry and fear about the financial consequences of illness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They would rather have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to where they put their money-into their homes, holidays or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Labor Party will take away that right and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend their money where they wish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By Government decree it will take the right and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740717_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Bills promise the patient <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from  the fear of the financial consequences of illness ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will remember that I told the story of migrants, living within the area of my practice, who wished not to have insurance cover and wanted <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend their money in the way they desired. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The introduction of these Bills would take away that right and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the migrants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, it was said that the Government’s scheme removes from the patient the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question of the absence of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice under the Government’s scheme was recognised by the shadow Minister,  Mr Chipp. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private hospital beds in Australia are at their most expensive in those States where people have no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in their hospitalisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For  Senator Guilfoyle  to say that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the present hospital system is nonsense in Victoria and New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of choice under those circumstances is ludicrous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The AMA agrees with us on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for doctor and patient, and it also agrees on the inclusion of pensioners in the service, which stops pensioners being treated as second class citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This was the concession to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice that the Liberal and Country Parties gave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the patient to pick the doctor of his choice at first attendance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also suggest that what I call the absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as far as a doctor within a hospital is concerned will disappear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore it seems to me that it is extremely unlikely that under the Government’s scheme there would be full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice within hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to say to the doctor: ‘The onus is on you. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet honourable senators opposite get up on their feet and have the gall to talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They aim to force away <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of people who may wish to have intermediate or private wards and to force standard wards on them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is this part of humanity, a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from terror? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here we have 96 per cent of the people well equipped with all the characteristics of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, belonging to funds and being able to go, by right, to a private doctor of their choice or to a hospital of their choice, and some 4 per cent or 5 per cent with difficulties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The proposed scheme will cost substantially more for everyone than the existing scheme and will be one which robs them of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Grimes  interjects, in a fit of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, that they can join a private fund if they want to. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government wants private wards or private hospitals why does it not write into its present scheme the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to receive a tax deduction for the fees they pay for intermediate or private ward accommodation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fundamentals are that this scheme aims to demolish <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for voluntary health and medical schemes and to substitute a single national health insurance scheme with a second layer in which a patient can receive some private treatment and some paramedical treatment which the Government scheme does not provide, if a patient reinsures in another way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact this will make <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the patient infinitely more restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The effect of this would be ultimate government control and therefore the destruction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice under a system of health delivery which has no equal in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is a scheme which costs more for a poorer service and no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an attack on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The patient can go to a doctor or not, reject a doctor or not, and the doctor is responsive to that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has resulted in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor and hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would have thought that the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice should apply right through. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740718_senate_29_s60/#debate-64">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one shall be subject to coercion which will impair his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to have or to adopt a belief or religion of his choice, be amended to read further and no revenue derived in any way from any Australian citizen shall be appropriated by the Australian Government, or by a State Government, or by a Municipal <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740724_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I remind the AttorneyGeneral that as long ago as 10 January 1973 he made a public statement acknowledging the Government’s intention to introduce a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill along the lines of the United States <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act and detailed in his statement the major features of such legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I think I indicated once publicly, the first persons to benefit from the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and better knowledge about government affairs would be the members of the Ministry. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from obstruction in the coming to or the going from the House is part of the law of Parliament and I believe that, although the Houses of Parliament at Canberra do not state the right by Sessional Orders, it is a privilege that belongs to the Commonwealth Parliament by virtue of section 49 of the Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may be salutary if this Senate made its own Sessional Order, as at Westminster, making known honourable senators’ right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from obstruction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It covers arrangements in accordance with which a supplier of goods or services has entered into an arrangement with a person acquiring those goods or services from him and the effect of the arrangement is to limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of that person to deal as regards persons or places. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740730_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to set interest rates is really the means by which these financial institutions conduct their business and survive or fail. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That clause provides very great power and might well sound the death knell of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise that has developed in these other financial institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740731_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is to continue as an institution of free speech, able and willing to face the challenges it is meeting from elsewhere to its capacity, its authority and even to its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of debate it will need the support of all our people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740806_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is based on equity; it is based on a sense of justice; it will ensure that every person in this community is covered for health insurance purposes; and, most certainly, it is based on a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the private medical practitioner that one cares to use and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose the type of hospital treatment that one cares to draw upon. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are the benefits that the community stands to gain: For individual citizens our health, insurance program will mean an automatic health insurance cover that is based on a more equitable system of payment and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the doctor and the type of hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government says: ‘We will grab the lot of you and take away your <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have said, as  Mr Chipp  continued to say today, that we were going to nationalise medicine; we were going to prevent <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; we were going to destroy the doctorpatient relationship; we were going to wreck the hospital system; we were going to give much less service at far greater cost; we were going to socialise, centralise and bureaucratise; and we were going to reduce proud, vigorous and individualistic Australians to mere ciphers on some remote computer roll. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example I refer to the allegation that we are out to destroy the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which exists in the present scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It cannot be repeated too often that the charge about destruction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is simply untrue. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, far from restricting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice the new scheme will expand it in many important respects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They cannot, on the one hand, say that the public desperately wants to preserve its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor but then say on the other hand that for the sake of an after-tax contribution of less than $ 1 a week they will desert their private doctors, desert that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in a great stampede for the standard wards. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The points we made were, firstly, that it would lower the quality of medical care to Australian families; second, that it would increase the total cost to the Government and thus to the taxpayer; third, that it would increase the cost to an individual because, in addition to increased taxation, expensive additional private insurance would be required to maintain health care standards; fourth, that it would reduce the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctors and hospitals; fifth, that it would jeopardise the future of religious, private and country hospitals; and, sixth, that it would be the first stage of nationalisation of health care in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first point concerns <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and religious hospitals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the Government’s claim that it will not restrict <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice if a person does not have the right to go to a private or religious hospital if he so chooses? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Acting Chairman,  the Government should stop its senseless, socialist stampede for a costly, unworkable scheme that will reduce health care standards, reduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and put many of our hospitals at peril. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which will expand <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice; which will promote efficiency in health services and which will upgrade hospital and community health centres. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are some freedoms that are basic to the Australian way of life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I submit that the right to good health is a basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that medical treatment should not rest on ability to pay. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To pretend that this is a system which will give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is to overlook so many facets which have to be explored. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is not to provide a diminished health service, then, of course, there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for us as to what the rate will be next year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government has talked about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose a doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these false criticisms have been centred on the issue of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pensioner will have his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice extended to treatment outside a hospital as he can be referred to a specialist in his surgery. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more one looks into the matter the more it seems that the important <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the Opposition is that of the consultant to get his fee for service from the patient who is forced, because of the application of the means test, into the private or intermediate ward. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the doctor and the patient, and it will allow people to insure against the cost of private hospital care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of all this there are people from one end of Australia to the other asking themselves why the Government is trying to throw out a health scheme which the overwhelming majority of them have found perfectly satisfactory, which has given them good quality health care at reasonable cost with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor and hospital and health insurance fund, and with speed and compassion, and in which they have genuine confidence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all variations on a theme and they all come from the magnificent promise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from cost and worry, mainly from politicians in order to curry favour and win votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are looking forward to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of having that part of the business of living looked after for them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#subdebate-0-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The measure of the government in a democracy surely must be its capacity and performance in preventing exploitation, whether it be exploitation of individuals, groups of individuals, of resources or indeed of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740807_senate_29_s60/#debate-4">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There has been a denial of human rights because one of the freedoms which we, in this country, accept and which we seek to extend to other persons in this country who want to exercise the rights of Australians is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to say whether one will stay or whether one will leave. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am interested also to find that  Senator Greenwood  is such a recent convert to the doctrines of civil liberties and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, because I remember some years ago- in fact, it was very early on the morning of Boxing Day of one year- there was a ring at my front door, and what did I find there? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I find it very interesting that  Senator Greenwood,  who sent in the Commonwealth Police to arrest demonstrators at the Melbourne University, and who sent the Commonwealth Police to investigate and interrogate members of this Parliament for exercising this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which he believes is so essential in the Soviet Union but which at least in the past he did not think was of any value in this country, has today emerged as the champion of human rights, the champion of civil liberties and the man who says that a person should be able to get up and say what he likes whenever he wants to say it and that he should not be interrogated by the police, that he should be free to insert advertisements in newspapers and should be free to demonstrate at the Melbourne University or at the Perth airport or anywhere else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Carrick has just treated the Senate to a most bizarre exercise in logic which went something like this: He said that because I spoke in this place last year against the suppression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Russia I must conclude, without evidence, that Ermolenko was taken prisoner in Perth by the Russian secret police and prevented from exercising his free will as to whether he would stay in Australia or leave for Russia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No less a person than his colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when trying to defend his feeble action in relation to the Baltic states, said: ‘They have never had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as we understand it. ‘ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, representing this Government, is prepared to say that, because the people of the Baltic states have never had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> ‘ as we understand it’, they should never have it or have an opportunity to have it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I repeat what has already been said on this side of the Senate today: There is a long arm of memory in relation to these people, and there is always the uncertainty and the question mark relating to his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that of his family. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The work of obtaining more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in international arrangements and understandings which had been achieved by the Western powers has been greatly undermined. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Anyone who has had anything to do with the Baltic communities will know that the emphasis which these groups place on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is an example to all Australians, and their reminder of the price to be paid for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> has been completely disregarded by this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a vital matter of human rights and of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we believe that it is completely wrong for a Minister of the Crown to say that in his view a person is not being held under duress and to deny to the courts an opportunity to make that decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the fundamental basis of the Opposition’s motion which says that the Minister is deserving of censure because a promise to uphold the ideal of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, cherished by people who came to this country and by their descendants, was utterly and shamefully repudiated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740918_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-1-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the long term the threat to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Australia is much greater if a centralised bureaucracy is established having control of all facets of government than if the principle is followed- it was the principle to which  Senator Martin  referred in her speechthat power should rest as nearly as possible with the people who are directly affected by the decisions that are being made by government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19740925_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 23 September the Greek Government issued a decree which restored <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action to all political parties in Greece. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Greek Government is also reported to have announced its intention to restore <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly throughout the country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relatively high degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of international trade and capital movement that now exists means that economic developments in any major country radiate through the whole international system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741001_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we do not speak out fairly soon we may well lose our prosperity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and it will be all because we would not stand up and fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of private enterprise which all of us cherish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741002_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe this is an attack on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of Australians of both occupation and place of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If they want a situation in which there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the area of education, as in any other area, that is their business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those societies which have chosen to leave the production of goods and services largely in the hands of private individuals and companies also enjoy a degree of personal liberty and political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that has been rare in history. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expression of these attitudes and aspirations is largely possible because of that personal liberty and political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> inherent in private enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741003_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think the honorable senator ought to accept that there is a widespread feeling that the concepts of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press ought to be able to live together with legal provisions which guarantee against unreasonable invasion of privacy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Men and women who offend against the laws of society, as we accept them, must pay for their social sins but we have no right in a so-called civilised society to treat those who have been deprived of their liberty and personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with physical punishment and undignified procedures that label them as less than animals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741015_senate_29_s61/#debate-51">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In summary, the policies of the Australian Government in respect of Aboriginal people might be described as seeking: to encourage and strengthen the capacity of Aborigines to manage their own affairs and to increase their economic independence; to enable Aborigines to have a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice about their life style and the extent to which, particularly in the more remote communities, they maintain their traditional customs and culture- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which can be exercised to the extent that communities have local authority, in particular through land ownership; to make equality a reality for Aboriginal Australians by working to overcome those handicaps which generally face them in fields such as housing, health, education, employment and civil liberties; in doing this, to help Aborigines themselves to provide services designed to overcome handicapsfor instance, through Aboriginal housing societies, medical services and legal services- and to act in the closest consultation with Aboriginal communities and individuals at both the national and the local levels. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to the benefits of a high capacity line and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from interruptions to the service by floods provided for the Northern Territory by this line, further advantage will come from the construction of the standard gauge link from Adelaide to Crystal Brook which is the subject of separate legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> to legislate with respect to social security, health matters, transport costs and transport charges has been a very difficult problem for those Tasmanian governments which have been in power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741016_senate_29_s61/#debate-44">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I rise on an issue which I think is of vital importance to this Senate and of vital importance to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of speech is the right of all Australians. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which is subject, of course, to some regulation, but it is a regulation measured in terms of the consequences which can be adjudicated upon in the courts and not imposed by a censoship dictated by an executive. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which acknowledges that if a citizen is defamed he has a right to restore his reputation by court action. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In Parliament the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to speak one’s mind ought to be absolute. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are always instances which can be demonstrated to establish that rights and freedoms can be misused to achieve objectives opposite to the objectives for which these rights and freedoms are maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A classic example is the way in which throughout the world over many years communists have used <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and all the democratic traditions under which they can work to undermine democracy and liberty and to establish their own dictatorship. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is one other way in which <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech can be prevented and that is by the use of the procedures of the court to stop <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, which although it is the truth is hurting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After a writ has been issued and before it is discontinued or determined there is a constant plea of sub judice which is able to be used to prevent or limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of those who want to discuss matters of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It can be a denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But equally important is the ability to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion about matters of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Why have I introduced this matter in the context of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I certainly say that if it is a stop writ and if it is used for the purpose of stifling or attempting to stifle discussion, in those circumstances it is a matter of the fundamental rights of every honourable senator in this place to ensure that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion takes priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that more important than so-called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this chamber- if what we have listened to for the last half hour is called <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, I will have to revise my definition of it- is that persons who consider that they have been wronged and who have a case at law to pursue should not be inhibited by such rantin as we have heard tonight from pressing their claims. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741024_senate_29_s61/#subdebate-51-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I suggest that it behoves us when we get the rare opportunity of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of decision to exercise it carefully and wisely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741029_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If I were to rise and respond to what  Senator Everett  has said and say that the viewpoint that he expressed was a viewpoint consistent with support for communist aggression against people who wanted to lead a life of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, it would invoke the catcalls and the noise which I am now getting from Government senators, because that is the way in which they respond. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741113_senate_29_s62/#debate-39">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 25th anniversary of which was celebrated on 10 December 1973, proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set out in the declaration, without distinction of any kind, in particular as to race. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741127_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Following the decision of the Federal Council of the Australian Journalists’ Association ‘that to remove any doubts on the amended Act being able to be used to stifle <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in news and current affairs programs, the Act contains a clause affirming the principle of a right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in news and current affairs programs’, can you– <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>This Bill has been presented by some members of the media, pursuing their ‘right’ to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to write what they like, as a Bill which was brimful of ministerial control- ‘the Juggernaut’, as the ‘Age’ writer described it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We do and should continue to cherish the freedoms of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Control itself should be exercised only by laws, but within those laws we can still have our rights and our freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In having and applying those rights and freedoms we should be able to live within the law and to be protected by the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the main freedoms in this country is our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time we should never put it at risk in any way, because as far as I am concerned, God help this country when we no longer have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think for a moment that he would be a man who would abuse that control, but the Minister in charge of this portfolio at present will not always be the Minister in charge of it and it is the responsibility of this Parliament to legislate in such a way that the rights of the people and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech are protected. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Once there is interference in programming the Government is doing more than just having a say in the operation; it is interference in basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the process of protecting those rights- I refer to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in this country- I have no alternative but to accept my responsibilities and to oppose this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These things give me the impression- it is a sinister impressionthat the Government is up to no good with regard to the total <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press and other media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741203_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we did have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move amendments in this Senate, one would certainly move one to control the amount of broadcasting time which is occupied by one individual in this chamber, as it was last Wednesday and as it has been again this Wednesday. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In dealing with the question of federalism as the responsible exercise of power, I refer to that sort of issue as showing something of the ill conceived nature of the view that State governments are somehow efficient in the interests of Australian people and are somehow the bulwarks of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the individual against authoritarianism. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At end of motion, add-  but the Senate is of the opinion that the provisions of the Bill which reduce the limit on deductions for education expenses from $400 to $150 seriously restrict the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which now exists in the Australian education system, are a contravention of the Government’s election undertakings and will impose unwarranted burdens on parents with children attending both public and private schools and, further, that the Bill specifically: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741204_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But a fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that this Senate is pledged to maintain is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- the right to choose a state school, the right to choose a nonstate school, the right to choose a Catholic parochial school and the right to choose an independent non-Catholic school. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems to me to be very much a contradiction that on the one hand we should claim <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action for the Corporation in pursuit of its commercial, industrial and wool industry activities and yet, on the other hand, we stipulate that its funds shall be put into a trust fund which will have some disciplinary effect as to how that money can be used. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741205_senate_29_s62/#debate-57">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite what has been said, this is not an election issue and I hope the Opposition will reconsider its attitude and enable us to have unanimity on this legislation which is to ensure the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of the Aboriginal people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why cannot the same freedoms apply in Queensland as apply in other parts of Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are trying to say is that there ought to be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Aborigines to do their own thing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I strongly contest the argument that there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For Opposition senators to say that the Aboriginal people do not want anything is to attempt to find some excuse for their own attitude of not giving to Aborigines on reserves in Queensland the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as they want for white people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Will he go to the Queensland Aboriginal people and say: ‘I am the person who stopped you from getting the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which I have got because I do not live on a reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is the person today who has to go back to Queensland and say to the person he was talking to who was thrown off Palm Island: ‘You could have had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> next week to go on to Palm Island but I stopped you ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He cannot get over this: The one who is stopping an Aboriginal who wants to go on to a reserve from having the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as  Senator Bonner  has is  Senator Bonner. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least Aboriginals have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of entry in Wilcannia, but they have not got it in Normanton at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-53-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not like provisions in this Bill and given the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do so in differing circumstances we would have sought to have amendments of our own and we could have at least considered the amendment which  Senator Hall  has moved, but we do believe it is important that this money be available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#debate-54">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By acting as I have suggested the nursing homes will improve the services that they are able to provide and will provide them in a much more congenial atmosphere, in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and in control of their own destinies and in the finest religious and charitable principles and traditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741210_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In fact, there will be an extension of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctors in that in public hospitals patients, regardless of means, will be able to elect to be treated by a salaried doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They have been concerned about Bills in various parts of Australia and overseas which can threaten the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press, which can challenge the liberties of the subject, and which can take away citizens’ liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1974/19741211_senate_29_s62/#debate-93">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Most of those recommendations attempted to take away the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that honourable senators had in this place when I first came here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750211_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If Opposition members want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, such as the individual going from job to job, they should say so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator McLaren may not think that is necessary but most Australians believe that respect for the law, its institutions and its personnel is basic to the survival of democracy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750212_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we know the features of poverty in other groups, if we take into account income, housing conditions, loss of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and racial discrimination it is clear that Aboriginals are worse off in Queensland than in other States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>At Federation the principal source of revenue of the States was customs duties, and one of the prime purposes of Federation was to eliminate the customs barriers between States and to create the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of trade throughout the nation as it is enshrined in the famous section 92 of our Constitution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750213_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind honourable senators that taxation remission or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from taxation existed in the Northern Territory, I think, from 1 945 to 1 950. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750218_senate_29_s63/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Of course that gives the lie to any suggestion that this is a commission which might have any independence or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of viewpoint, and certainly any reflection of the viewpoint of the people of Darwin. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750219_senate_29_s63/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is not a program to nationalise medical and hospital services, nor does it reduce any of the freedoms which patients, doctors or hospitals now enjoy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators will know that the medical plan gives everyone automatic coverage for private practice, fee-for-service, medical treatment and that there will be complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor by patients and of place and type of practice by doctors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Among the reams of sophistry which the Opposition has presented as an apology for a case against this Bill, there are a number of references to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the voter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is suggested, in some way which is never spelled out, that passing this legislation will impinge upon the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the voter to record a free and secret vote and so on, and upon the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to stand for Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One may have a genuine respect for people who genuinely respect the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual even when the alleged threats to that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> are so remote that they would seem to be innocuous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the Opposition- members of the Liberal and Country Parties- who enacted a conscription law in 1964 talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, they should be and will be greeted with ridicule and contempt. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the eyes of members of the Opposition, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They will put a great advertisement in a newspaper on behalf of a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> league claiming that this Government is socialist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s attempt in the Senate to give an Aboriginal at least that right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go on to his own land was defeated and the pertinent clause was removed from the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750220_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time it recognises that a measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is needed to optimise opportunities for artistic achievement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We want to uphold the rights of everyone to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of artistic expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In matters of staff and finance it will have the widest <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of operation compatible with considerations of public accountability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750225_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After all that, in this cranky system that this Bill seeks to magnify and mushroom, he started an action in the Federal courts and persuaded a single judge of the Federal court to say that there was a Federal element in the case associated with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, and one judge, 7 years after the State litigation began, negatived all the processes of 4 appeals in the State courts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He said the  Morrel  constructions constituted nonverbal communication intended to express a viewpoint- in this case, an antiwar position- and thus  Mr  Radich  was entitled to protection under the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech provision of the First Amendment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750226_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But it is propping up the health funds as if there were some particular sanctity about them, still talking about doctor-patient relationships and no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of doctor, and opposing this <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister has claimed not once but many times that under Medibank, and under this Bill and all the ancillary Bills, the freedoms of choice of doctors and patients will be preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would say straight away that there will be no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for pensioners if the pensioner medical service is abolished and the Government has not made adequate plans for its replacement in the meantime. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to that there will be no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the people if they are faced with an even more complex claim form than that to which they have had to face up to now. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill will not give extra <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the people who have to pay their doctors’ bills and then get the money back from the Health Insurance Commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for me, as a user of health services, if I cannot find somewhere at which to lodge my claim. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally on the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for doctors facing the possibility of salaried employment under this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He did not tell us that under the Medibank scheme pensioners will have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice that they have never had before. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I happen to like the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to who will operate on me in a hospital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Although it is proposed under this Bill that in the initial stages, I understand, there will be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in respect to a person ‘s general practitioner - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750227_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has said also that if there is a refusal on the part of a public servant to go, and of course there is complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for an individual to refuse to go, the position held in the Public Service department which will then be concentrated in Monarto will have to be filled by someone else. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750305_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It became evident that, given complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to develop and build, Adelaide’s population would grow in an objectionable sprawl from its present size of 870 000, at June 1974, to approximately 1 300 000 by the year 2000. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750306_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We consider that the power that the Minister has under the Bill to use the special account, the outcome of which would deprive the chronically ill of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to use private or intermediate hospital accommodation with the accompanying <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of surgeon or physician, driving them into public ward accommodation, is also an undesirable feature. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750408_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Its immediate consequence must be a communist takeover of South Vietnam snuffing out the hope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and of democratic independence in that country and extending the area of communist control closer to this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750409_senate_29_s63/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Prime Minister said the policy of the Government and the Labor Party was that restrictions on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression of public servants and former public servants should be reduced to the minimum necessary for the conduct of affairs of state. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750415_senate_29_s63/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When they finally wanted not to give to society but for society to give to them, when the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> they wished was the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They realise that if the preference exchanges were less effective when people were given the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to whether they would exercise a preference down to the last candidate they would then have to come to a mutual arrangement as to whether Liberal Party candidates would contest a particular seat and Country Party candidates would contest another seat and which Party’s candidates would contest which particular seats. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is the real reason why the Opposition is opposing this measure: It wants to limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice that is available to the electorate; it wants to compel electors to continue to have to vote for every candidate; and it is frightened to embrace any change because that would reduce the effectiveness of its vote and lead to an almighty squabble between the two Opposition parties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750514_senate_29_s64/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I emphasise that because I recognise that the Bill contains features which are repugnant to the rule of law and to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amongst those rights is the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, conscience and religion and the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion and expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech of the individual is to be restricted by the measures of the Act no more than by the restriction imposed by our laws of defamation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To my mind the Racial Discrimination Bill 1975 that is before us is, in its present form, in many aspects of the over-government type and is restrictive of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australian citizens to express their opinions freely and to conduct their own affairs in accordance with the dictates of their consciences. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750515_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Ministers reaffirmed the ASEAN commitment to the objective of a zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality in South-East Asia and agreed that its relevance for the region was now more evident. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750520_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-24-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Eventually that view was overruled and it was established that transport was part of trade in relation to section 92 and required <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then one has been devilled in trying to apply the further exegesis- I think that would be the word of the doctorate of Judge Dixon- that, notwithstanding the requirement of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, transport is subject to an obligation consistent with section 92 to pay its way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the antithesis of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and free enterprise that could never be accepted in those bald terms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The practical difficulty in securing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of interstate trade does not arise mainly from the risk of invalid legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is not a question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech; it is a question of getting members of the Opposition to speak and not avoid speaking by adjourning legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the requirement that trade, commerce and intercourse among the several States should be absolutely free, the High Court, in the exercise of the power which was conferred upon it, declared to be unlawful those legislative and administrative acts which it regarded as contrary to that guarantee of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We now have reached a stage, of course, where if there is an area of activity which is within that broad concept of interstate trade, commerce or intercourse and there are legislative or administrative acts which impose a burden upon that interstate trade, commerce or intercourse, that is an infringement of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I know that in regard to the difficult area of the usage which interstate road operators make of the roads of the Commonwealth the High Court has imposed an exception, namely, that if there is a charge made which relates to the maintenance of the road, and that is a reasonable charge related to the upkeep of the roads, it is not an infringement of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the High Court thereby bound to accept the Inter-State Commission’s decision as binding upon the High Court; or could we have the curious situation arising that what the Inter-State Commission says is unfair is declared by the High Court to be fair and not an infringement of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750521_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has given them <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and a flexible curriculum and the result has been that they are now improving their school performance; they are improving their motivation; and they have been encouraged to go back and become involved in achievement in the kind of education system in which we work. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am advised that in fact the States’ <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend funds as they wish will not be reduced by the passage of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Greenwood  criticised the Bill on the ground that by forbidding the incitement to racial hatred or the dissemination of racist propaganda it infringed the right of free speech, of absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of publication and of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However,  Senator Greenwood  did not bother to mention that the laws of defamation already provide substantial constraints against an absolute <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and of publication, nor did he explain why if the Bill is objectionable on those grounds the Government of which he was a member in 1966 voted for the United Nations Convention on Racial Discrimination which is appended to this Bill and which provides for exactly the same prohibitions against incitement to racial hatred and the publication or dissemination of racist propaganda. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clause 9 states:  lt is unlawful for a person to do any act involving a distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of any human right or fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750522_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>So it is imperative that communities always take the opportunity to provide an atmosphere for people to develop their personalities, to exercise their talents and to maintain proper standards and always through all of these things it is important that our society provide machinery for people to maintain their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is worth noting, particularly in the light of the Bill introduced by the Government and which is before the Senate now, that in a similar measure the United States of America reserved the right not to implement sections of the Convention which, as the Americans put it, contradicted America’s own constitutional provision for the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750527_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the circumstances of Australia, at least there is a very large measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and at least there is the propulsion of the profit motive within the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>They represent, I presume, an alternative, and that, after all, is what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is all about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The preamble of that Act said that, under the prevailing economic conditions developed with the aid of Government authority for owners of property to organise in the corporate and other forms of ownership or association, the individual unorganised worker was commonly helpless to exercise actual liberty of contract to promote his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of labour and thereby obtain acceptable terms and conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was therefore deemed proper that, although the worker should be free to decline to associate with other workmen, he should have full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, selforganisation and his own choice of representative to negotiate terms and conditions of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Sub-paragraphs (vii) and (viii) of paragraph (d) refer to the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, conscience and religion and to the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion and expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The fact that we are attempting to deal with matters of racial discrimination in this country does not affect the fact that people who consider themselves to be aggrieved by our laws will avail themselves of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to criticise us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The other aspect to which  Senator Greenwood  referred was the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression of opinion and peaceful assembly and association in Article 5. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750528_senate_29_s64/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To remit the maintenance of constitutional right to the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the rock to the sand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having regard to the high constitutional principles involved here, I submit that this Committee ought not to trespass again upon the constitutional right which is, as the House of Lords pertinently reminded us, the fundamental guarantee of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that judicial proceedings in some measure should be the subject of publicity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can say this to you,  Mr Temporary Chairman,  because you would know that I intend no offence at all: Unless you are to usurp my senatorial right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to propose an amendment and to speak to it- I remind you that Lord Shaw said that the judges below had usurped an important constitutional right- you surely will not rule that an amendment which does not introduce a single word but seeks the omission of words that the House of Representatives has used in its amendment is not relevant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To detract and subtract from their juridical tribunals the methods by which the citizen can have some kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> against the increasing menace of direct Government prosecution, if you like, or interference in the habits of people through so-called administative tribunals is to encourage nothing more or less than those hateful things known as sniffersout that imposed an iron will on Scotland for 200 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We pride ourselves upon the fact that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is one of the great liberal achievements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the security of the state will always permit us the widest possible <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whatever be those considerations, the basic objection which the Opposition has is that this clause is an infringement of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression which ought not to be seen in a Bill of this character which is directed towards improving human relations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole tradition of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech that we have means, I think, that at times we have to live a little dangerously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The position in Australia is nowhere near so serious in this field that we should risk the possibility of a real incursion into <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have maintained that we must read this Convention in the line and in the light of our appropriate means, because we are obliged to use only appropriate means, and we are required under the Convention to preserve the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression of opinion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise what this Bill means so far as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to write are concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I imagine that it could lead to a limitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech which would be most undesirable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While this may not at the present time meet the requirements of the United Nations convention as to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of an individual, it would meet the requirements subject to the land being handed over to Aboriginal communities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said in reply to a question, the Premier of Queensland has informed me that on certain conditions he is not opposed to the handing over of land to Aboriginal communities and this may then permit us to abide by the United Nations convention on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of an individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He expressed appreciation that at last we have given to Aborigines the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of selfdetermination, and if an injustice is done to an Aborigine he has the right to receive legal aid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of selfdetermination that the Aborigines have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here is an example of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of self determination that exists in Queensland when an instruction is given by the Queensland Department to serve notices on those people who have only a monthly permit to remain on the reserve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may very well be that the administration of the day is seeking information, the development of information services or the development of statistical services which might very well be described as cutting across personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, privacy and in particular the personal concerns of a citizen of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The safeguard against any intrustion into personal privacy, against any intrusion into a person’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, against the restriction of anybody’s movement and against the compulsion for somebody to divulge some fact which he does not wish to divulge is in the pattern of Parliament, because Parliament is the representative of the people, is the safeguard of the people and is the protection of the people from the bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750529_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reason for that, as was given over many decades, was that such a system as is embraced within this Bill ran counter to the concept of the rule of law, and the argument went that the rule of law implied the absence of wide discretionary powers in the Government affecting the personal liberty, the private property rights and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of contract of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-64-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does this apply unreservedly to those persons with entitlements to benefits under the Repatriation Act; if not, is the statement misleading to the extent that Repatriation patients may not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to attend any medical practitioner and to receive Medibank benefits for the services provided. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750603_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-66-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government also would hope that in accordance with the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of international trade and as another step towards peace and harmony in the Middle East the Egyptian Government also before long will open the Canal to Israeli ships and cargoes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is one of the fundamentals of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we Britishers have under the law not to be required by any authority to give an answer which may incriminate us. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Australian Development Assistance Agency co-ordinates such activities in conjunction with the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), which includes such organisations as AUSTCARE, Australian Council of Churches, Australian Catholic Relief, Federation of Jewish Welfare Societies, <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> from Hunger and Vietnam Orphans Fund. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750604_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps I should qualify all of them by saying that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech has always been regarded as precious in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of expression goes further than just the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Within certain guidelines that can be laid down we must have protection of the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression for individuals and for the various sections of the media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those guidelines should not be so narrow, restrictive or repressive that they interfere in any way with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press or, more importantly, allow areas for government interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I take strong exception to certain people who were given <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression which they are abusing at the present time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If these Bills are to be used as the basis for a double disssolution we would welcome it on the basis of the simple and easily understood attitude to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say this because to suggest that there can be editorial <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is to be totally unrealistic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the statements of government in the past have been related to control of the outlet of television and radio, control that can be exercised through programming with regard to Australian content, for instance, or programming which would perhaps require a station to have a particular news session- all the things that infringe editorial <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as it would need to be managed and sifted through those people who are presenting the daily news to the people of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are things that we regard as absolutely fundamental in this society and we do not for one moment suggest that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press can be taken for granted because we have seen too often ways in which it can be jeopardised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These are things that sometimes are taken for granted but which, through legislation introduced by socialist or Labor Party governments, can impinge very much on a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that has been exercised in the past and should continue into the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of them today used that oftused expression ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, against public interest, some of these people often interpret ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media’ to mean ‘unrestricted licence’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They selected for criticism individual or single attempts at change and defined these individual changes as snide bids to deny them <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In closing let me once again record the view of the Opposition that the OTC has had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and with that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action it has proved a most efficient and effective organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750611_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have seen the news item referred to by the honourable senator and, as one who has had occasion to criticise the Soviet Union for its restrictions on international <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, I welcome the evidence of a loosening of such restrictions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750612_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of members from pressure by the Executive was fought and won years ago, and it must be defended against attack even if that attack should be cloaked under anxiety for the national safety. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750716_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is well settled that, in the public interest, such documents should be written with the utmost candour and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, that such candour and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression might be impaired if such documents could be ordered to be produced in an action, and that accordingly their production would be so much to the prejudice of the public interest, that, however pertinent they might be to the issues in an action, they ought not to be produced. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>What has happened to these ideas that there should be a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for public servants to make comment? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have seen now that public servants are not to have that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> when it is essential in regard to mighty important matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, do honourable senators recall that only a few weeks ago I asked  Senator James  McClelland what had happened to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because today we have heard from  Senator Button  that the Government is backtracking on these questions of open government and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we can see a return to the pre-open government, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750717_senate_29_s64/#subdebate-1-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is not allowing a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to ask that every question on notice be answered orally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the individual but not for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for that individual to choose between private and public enterprise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750820_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What  Mr Daly  wants is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Government to use taxpayers’ money to buy votes and limitations on everyone else so that they cannot compete, even though their funds are provided voluntarily. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750821_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I refer to a question which I asked of the Minister on 28 May 1975 relating to the proposed <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, the machinations of an interdepartmental committee in relation to the Bill and to the Bill’s disappearance from public view. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750826_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In 1972 we had the total <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the stock market to behave as it wanted- 3  Vi  years later we are still hearing rumblings from that- and at the same time we had a different sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for young Australian men who were conscripted to fight in Vietnam. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Let us analyse the good stuff because  Mr Fraser  quite clearly understands that the notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the notion of equality are closely interwoven. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr Fraser  went on to say that people should have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose what kind of education they wanted for their children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice be limited to a few people-  Mr Fraser  ‘s friends- or should that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice be available to the whole Australian community? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is an exercise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by those people which they never had previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is an exercise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which will lead to greater equality- not enforced equality -of opportunity in this community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is their exercise of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which they did not have the capacity to exercise before this Government came to power. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As a result of that exercise of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which has been made available to them for the first time there will be, I hope, greater equality in this country; but it is not enforced equality- it is the fulfilment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the opportunity to have the same chance as everybody else in this society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clearly what  Mr Fraser  means when he talks about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in education is that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to send their children to private schools with the benefit of big concessions which favour the rich. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of wealthier people, in the context of this Budget, to gain a disproportionate benefit of life insurance concessions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is that sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> about which he is concerned; but that is not the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> about which this Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not the sort of equality of opportunity about which this Government is concerned and it is not the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or equality of opportunity which thousands of Australians who benefited from these programs in education, health and matters of that kind have achieved in the last two or three years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>This is a trendy senator from Victoria saying that  Mr Fraser  ‘s views on equality and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> are well stated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In society it means minimum controls in the pursuit of alternative life styles which are themselves compatible with human <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, and human dignity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The substance of that part of his speech is: ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> means choice in the hands of individuals’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Does <span class="highlight">freedom</span> mean choice in the hands of a few select individuals or does it mean choice in the hands of the whole of the Australian people? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does it mean the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from fear which a million Australians have now been guaranteed by the introduction of Medibank- the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from fear of the consequences of sickness? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with which this Government is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is quite apparently not the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with which the Liberal Party is or will be concerned in the future if the philosophy which is espoused in this speech is indeed the philosophy of the Opposition in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course it does, but it means that that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice should be available to every Australian citizen and not to a select few. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>State conferences within the last month passes motions again demanding the reintroduction of conscription- surely only a Party that is capable of producing that sort of fundamental contradiction and a Leader who sent conscripts into the war in Indo China and waffles about personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- only a Party and a Leader such as that could describe a growth rate of more than 20 per cent in the money supply as highly irresponsible when they presided over a growth rate of 34 per cent - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750827_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Indeed, the danger in the future is that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> will be taken away from us to an even greater extent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750903_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Workers Party advocates that Government power should be gradually reduced till the Government is responsible only for the defence of Australia (non-existent at present), for the protection of honest Australians against criminals (at present the police are handicapped by unnecessary laws which restrict individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>), and the maintenance of a legal system to protect individual liberty and the rights of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They tend to proclaim individual freedoms, that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual means all, but then they bay for harsh censorship laws, conscription, restricted immigration based on racial grounds, and the flogging and gaoling of people like homosexuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think the most significant thing about them is that they demand <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, but it is always <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for those who can afford it and they deny <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice or even <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opportunity to the poor and to those who cannot afford it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr Fraser,  in his philosophical discourse to the National Press Club, informed us that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one’s income is just as important as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, of religion and of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But the people described by Professor Henderson in his report, the people described for years by the Brotherhood of St Laurence, and more recently by the Social Welfare Commission and other organisations, have no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend their income because it is so low they have only sufficient or less than sufficient for their most rudimentary needs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Even former  Senator Murphy  acknowledged in his early speeches in the field of legal aid that it is fundamental to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and it is fundamental to the democratic system in Australia that people should have access to legal services which are quite independent of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19750910_senate_29_s65/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For 3 years this great upholder of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the country, this great upholder of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the electoral laws was able to cling to power as the leader of the majority party because he was able to secure at the previous poll the total of 19 per cent of the votes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751008_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a great pity also that the Australian Press cannot be relied on to be as outspoken on behalf of Australian citizens as apparently the Canadian Press was outspoken on behalf of Canadian citizens when their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and their rights were denied to them in another country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>One is left with the conclusion that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Press itself and not the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of other people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751009_senate_29_s66/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I remind him that on 30 July 1974, 28 May 1975 and again in August 1 975 I asked the AttorneyGeneral or his representative in the Senate why the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill promised by this Government since early 1973 had not been seen publicly and seems to have disappeared without trace. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1975/19751021_senate_29_s66/#debate-12">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Despite present difficult circumstances I believe, as the Governor-General said yesterday, that we have a unique opportunity to establish in Australia a truly liberal and humane society where <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, equality and dignity prevail and where the disadvantaged have first call on our resources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have always regarded the Australian Parliament as the symbol of liberty, <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, democracy, free speech, and indeed quiet thought. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the reverse of the policy of the present Government which, as the GovernorGeneral stated yesterday, is:   to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have a maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measures to deal with this crisis will advance Australia towards the long term goal of a society based on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and on the mutual respect <span class="highlight">freedom</span> makes possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, that word ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span>’ is emphasised and re-emphasised. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is to encourage development of an Australia in which people have maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways they decide … the Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760218_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The people exercised their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vote on the matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During the last Parliament I took a lot of interest in the progress with the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill about which I have had a number of representations since the former Parliament was brought to an end. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760219_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, we must seek to provide a measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They will have a measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that it is relevant to our assessment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that there is no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> without a real measure of discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> is meaningless if it is not related to discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australians to choosewithout exploitation- the kinds of goods, services, and styles of life they want, and to minimise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection of resources through the Government’s bureaucracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760224_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‘Fraserology’ as I interpret it from reading the collected wisdom of that man, enunciated in various speeches, involves a rather Leaving Certificate standard statement or dissertation on notions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and equality in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make that somewhat derogatory remark about it because the point about which we are concerned is simply this: It is no good to say that people can have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in Australia and that people who are on the pension can have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, if that pension is inadequate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is no good to say that poor men in Australia have the same <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as rich men and think that is the end of the problem. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> is a notion which involves a deal of conceptual thinking. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Both in his National Press Club address last year and in the Governor-General’s Speech,  Mr Fraser  has indicated quite clearly that he has no understanding of the notion of economic and social <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which we, as a Party, have tried to put to the people of Australia in the last few years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, that is like mother’s milk; we all believe in all that stuff- that people should have initiative and should have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to solve their own problems as much as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I illustrate the point about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by instancing another State government-that of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That first of those objectives is to contribute to the development of an economic and social order in which people can live with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and material well-being in conditions of economic security and equal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Married women should have a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice but they should not be forced through economic circumstances- and that is the situation at present- to go out to work in order to maintain a decent standard of living. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760225_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other reason, of course, which has been emphasised is the greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that senators enjoy from constituency work in comparison to members of the House of Representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is interesting to consider the passage of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act in America and to consider what that means in terms of the democratic rights of a great many of the activists in the political movements in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But nowhere near the danger that existed before the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act was written. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760302_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs aware of statements made recently on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program  AM  by  Mr Barry  0 ‘Hagen from the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> from Hunger organisation characterising the Government’s policy of reducing foreign aid appropriations as ‘objectionable and reprehensible’? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is it not right that the States which are close to the people in relation to education, health, housing, the law, police and municipal affairs should have the right to adequate money and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action in spending that money? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760303_senate_30_s67/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are working towards an Australia with maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for individuals to pursue their own goals in ways of their own choosing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760304_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-67-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The authority surely must have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move teachers, to determine staffing needs, provisionally promote, and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australians to choosewithout exploitation - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760316_senate_30_s67/#debate-55">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Senate is a place in which there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and, of course, a question directed, as the honourable senator has directed her question, to the conduct of a magistrate who declined to commit a person for trial is in order. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other point I want to make while I am talking about this aspect is that in the old days of the Labor Government- it was a good government, in spite of some of the statements that  Senator Davidson  made a few moments agothe people who administered the various government departments had a greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to take action and a greater opportunity to express themselves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general proposition that the Government should not intervene in the market place but should allow consumers and others maximum <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in distributing their dollars and in deciding how their incomes should be spent is frequently enunciated by the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  but very rarely implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760317_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australians to choosewithout exploitation- the kinds of goods, services and styles of life they want . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We need to be alert to opportunities to increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of all Australians, including our female citizens, to choose without exploitation the style of life that they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760318_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask you,  Mr President,  to take this into consideration because any such investigation on your part, not knowing that there are many honourable senators who disagree with  Senator Chaney  ‘s views, may lead indirectly to some limitation of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press in this place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today I heard, amongst other things, our friend  Senator Carrick,  as the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications  (Mr Eric Robinson),  express the opinion on behalf of the present Government that whilst there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of independence on the part of the Commission that did not mean  ipso facto  that there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While ever honourable senators opposite say that the Department of the Media was established merely as a weapon of propaganda and for the purpose of not giving publicity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression to the people of Australia the sadder and sorrier this nation will be. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760323_senate_30_s67/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this place we are used to receiving lectures from those who sit opposite us concerning the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the independence of certain institutions and of the Press and concerning the necessity for Press councils to protect the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression of all sorts of people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was because we on this side of the Parliament are so aware of the fact that there ought to be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, whether or not it hurts us, that it was part of our policy to get rid of that department previously known as the Department of the Media. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the point of accreditation I refer to the United States of America, the land of free enterprise, the land of the free where, we are told, individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is precious above all things. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not hear much about complaints in the United States against these accreditation schemes in terms of abrogation of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we shall succeed in getting a proper health service in this country and we will stop the arguments that have been carried on over the years about funding and about individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That conference declared as its first principle that man had the fundamental right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, to equality and to adequate conditions of life in an environment of quality, permitting a life of dignity and well being with a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760324_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>And we further unanimously resolve: to place our claims before the United Nations and to appeal to all the peoples of the world who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and justice for moral and financial support in the fight for our peoples ‘ rights, to call upon the Australian Aboriginal people and the Torres Strait Islanders to unite behind their Congress, and, as never before to fight as one to secure and preserve our ancient heritage, and we announce our resolve, with the support of our people, to build up the strength of the Congress, to conduct the next congress elections in September 1976, and to ensure that the claims of our people for a free and better way of life are pursued vigorously and without fear. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It would be a very strange and sorry thing if the left and right were to combine so vigorously- I refer to the South Australian Parliament and to the Liberal Administration here- in suppressing individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760325_senate_30_s67/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest that those honourable senators opposite who so frequently like to talk about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, the importance of initiative in business, and so on, should welcome the initiative shown and the choice offered by the most recent successes of the ABC. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-37-11">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Government’s pOliCY is directed towards gradual restructuring of local manufacturing to achieve increased competitiveness, and more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for consumers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>This left manufacturers little <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vary their product mixes in accordance with changing market demand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Vehicle builders thus have a greater degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> required to purchase components from the most economic source while still being required to obtain most of their requirements from local manufacture. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760330_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We will get into trouble when we embark on such an examination, because one of the first matters that will be raised is academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one looks at what happens within university or college departments or faculties and seriously questions it and says to somebody: ‘I think you ought to be responsive to public opinion’, that person says: ‘If we are responsive to public opinion we will lose our academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to reach top decibel level on something that has come to my attention recently as a result of the practice of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that, if I as an individual were to go to the person responsible in this case and say: ‘I as a member of Parliament think that what you have done is intolerable’, he would turn around and say: ‘I am going to plead academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we challenged it, academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> would be pleaded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The playing of that sort of game behind the facade of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is something that we should not tolerate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760331_senate_30_s67/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The one aspect of that Party of which I am most proud is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of its members to exercise their votes in accordance with the dictates of their conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am proud to be able to get up in this place and to put a point of view which in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of my Party I am able to do but which members of the Opposition have no right to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At least members of the Liberal and National Country Parties have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to operate in the Senate as members of a House of review. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I simply say to those who designed and those who currently make up the Liberal and National Country Parties: Thank God for that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; thank God for the opportunity for us to express a view which is different from a view of the House of Representatives, the House of Government, and to ask that this matter be reviewed, which is what we do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I point out to  Senator Sim  and his colleagues who are attempting to interject and who claim that they have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to vote as they like in this place while Opposition senators do not that there is a very great difference between the way in which the Parties of the honourable senators opposite would have considered this Bill and the way in which we would have considered it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>First of all, let me say again that it is a recognised principle of the Liberal Party that members of the Party have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of our conscience. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This country chose the repatriation system a long time ago as its means of repaying in part those who defended this country in war and who went away to protect our <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But at the same time he has reduced the spending capacity of the pensioners in this country, on his own admission, by some $3 1 m. I believe that it is sad to hear the Prime Minister proclaim that his Government will give people more independence in the use of their money and more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend their money as they wish and then deprive those in the community who, through no fault of their own, have the least financial independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All the Government is providing in this Bill is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to starve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the Minister can explain to me what the procedure will be and what is the position with regard to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760427_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Minister for Administrative Services must know that there is no real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for the Cocos Malay people between Home Island and West Island. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is given to the States by the modification of the provisions relating to expenditure so that major items of expenditure only, both in the case of government and nongovernment schools, will need to be reported upon and expenditures which might be described as ‘ minor only ‘ will be made at the discretion of the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760504_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Could the Minister advise whether there is any Commonwealth law to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of blind persons with guide dogs? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would I be in order if I asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development whether there is provision in Commonwealth law for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for guide dogs in Australia? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We well know that they are prepared to give lip service to democratic institutions, to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and to self-determination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What attitude did members of the previous Government take to the Baltic States- an end to <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; an end to democracy; an end to selfdetermination. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But what I am concerned about- I referred to it earlier- is that perhaps the Minister listens to strange voices which may try to divert him from what I believe is a very sincere purpose, namely, to see that the program which we introduced and which is concerned with the rights, individuality and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression of every Australian child is carried forward and to insist upon and fight for the development of a program which will help to widen the horizons of every child in this country and which will help to enhance and enrich our greatest resource. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe the individual can benefit most from the educational process if there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in schooling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe encouragement of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of selfdevelopment and striving for excellence in education is the foundation for a truly pluralistic society and an enterprising nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760505_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am quite sure that the Australian people would be eager to see and to hear interviews with a man such as Solzhenitsyn who must be one of the most courageous men of massive integrity alive in the world today and also one of the great fighters for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760518_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-18-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everything should be done to help voluntary bodies to sustain themselves, with the maximum amount of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> possible being allowed to enable them to operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760520_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies will be allowed much greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in setting the times when noteholders may exercise an option to convert their loan into share capital. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This gives them the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which is implicit in the philosophy which we on this side of the chamber espouse. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In providing that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice we are doing no more than we promised the electors of Australia on 1 3 December that we would do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure that with the Fraser Government we will be able to build a country full of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which will give expression to the wishes of every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator O’Byrne,  who had an illustrious Air Force career, who suffered in the horror camps in Europe as a prisoner-of-war to protect people like the honourable senator opposite and who fought for their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, rose tonight to take issue with the remarks by  Senator Lajovic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am proud to have him as a comrade for the efforts that he put in to defend not only the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of Australians but also the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people like  Senator Lajovic. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760525_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-46-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a nice judgment of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media how it exercises that good taste. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one adds to that the cuts which have been made in government expenditure in a large number of areas, we feel that that again is an inhibiting factor on the capacity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals to spend. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I speak for myself when I say that I am concerned that the essential philosophy behind tax indexation is the belief which has been expressed by the Prime Minister,  Mr Malcolm  Fraser, on a number of occasions but perhaps most eloquently in the phrase which he used at the National Press Club luncheon last year when he said that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one ‘s own income is as important as the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that there would be no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice under Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the excuses is that people should have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, for goodness sake, between 2 health insurance funds, that is, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to who is going to pay your medical bills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anybody seriously give a damn about that sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, about who is going to pay your medical bills? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is that an important <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in our society? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which people are being offered, even if <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to the payment of medical bills was a relevant factor in a contemporary society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that what the Government has done and contemplates doing will preserve the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which, in our ideological view, is the right of every Australian taxpayer. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe further in the course of action taken by the Government in seeking to provide <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the Australian people between the private health institutions or Medibank, or some sort of balance between the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Jessop  was speaking about an hour ago he mentioned again the alleged commitment that he and his Party have to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760526_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-As I understand it, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a statutory corporation and is given the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of a statutory corporation in order that it may produce objectivity of decision-making and comprehensive and adequate programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760527_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-15-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will also seek to further our own deeply held values of democracy, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and respect for the individual at every opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The aspects of the international situation which give rise to concern are: Firstly, the continued readiness of some states to pursue their interests by the use of force- by the growing influence on the international scene of countries opposed to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and respect for the individual persons on which our own democratic system is based. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a development would not merely be dangerous to our security; it would greatly restrict our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action across the whole range of our foreign policy objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760601_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-59-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They also questioned whether the International Labour Organisation Convention on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, which the Australian Government had ratified, would not be contravened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These proposals have been introduced with the excuse that there is some necessity to cut government expenditure in the field of health insurance and under the phoney pretence that the new proposals will provide <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in the field of medical care. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for the Government’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No explanation is given why this distinction is drawn or in relation to the denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of choice seems to be the holy grail of the Government parties this year. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government believes in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, that choice should be between the payment of the same amount of money to private funds or to the Government fund for equal services. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does that indicate in any way that they wanted <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hold no particular brief for benefit funds in this debate but I do say that, consistent with the philosophy of people on this side of the chamber and of those people who sent us here, people should have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choosing their own doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Tehan  made a statement also- I hope I heard him correctly- that people would have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose their own doctor. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears to me now that Medibank will not continue in the style that the people have accepted but will be mauled in the name of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and also to achieve savings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will detail more about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice later. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They do not want to be confused by false concepts of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, as my colleagues have said previously. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the concepts which has been much discussed during the course of the debate relates to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the three or four years leading up to the introduction of Medibank there was continual discussion in the Australian community about what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in terms of health care meant. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was suggested by the then Opposition that, as a result of the introduction of Medibank, people would be denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of health care choice not only at the hospital level, where there is an argument to be put on that score, but also at the private practitioner level. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it very strange that after this period there is once again a discussion about what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to health insurance in Australia means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not one Government senator who has contributed to this debate has really said anything about this question; rather honourable senators opposite have uttered ba-ba sorts of slogans about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice about which they are talking? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which is being offered by the Government in this legislation is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of the private health funds to rip it off Australian citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is the only new <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which is being offered by this legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He is still waffling away about this alleged <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which the Liberal Party proposes to offer the Australian people in relation to their health insurance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No doubt in later debates  Senator Baume  again will get back to that concept because the Liberal Party, as he pointed out, has this curious belief that it is the only political party in Australia- indeed probably the only political party in the whole of the Western world- which understands what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice means. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us look at the sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to health insurance which was offered by the private health funds in Australia prior to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact of the matter is that it was the Nimmo Committee which talked about the private health funds in these terms: That they were inefficient; that they were undemocratic insofar as their members were concerned; that they offered no genuine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to the Australian people; that there were too many competing funds, and that they were wasteful for that very reason. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is what the Nimmo Committee, which was appointed by the Liberal-Country Party Government, said about the private health funds, and it is the private health funds to which this Government now is offering <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No honourable senator opposite can really tell us what genuine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice is being offered to Australian citizens by the changes which will be made to Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as it has been expounded is an utter phoney. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second is that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, if it exists, is being offered to the private health funds, and the Nimmo Committee so eloquently expressed the capacity which the funds had to offer that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760602_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is need for a determined campaign by all Australians- and that means all parties and all senators who have some understanding of the problem- by all those who value liberty and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of people, to see that this grave miscarriage of justice is not ratified and that the incorporation does not take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760603_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, where this condition is not found both in us judicial institutions and in their constant exercise’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760604_senate_30_s68/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is time the Opposition realised that, unless we in Australia have voted out socialism once and for all and have shown that our country has full confidence in democracy, the people of Australia will lose the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> they have taken for granted for so long. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760825_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I say that there has been a lot of publicity about it because there is much criticism in terms of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to advertise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conclusion drawn, by a majority of three to one, is that Australians equate <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to advertise with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to advertise and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to speak, which I believe crosses party lines, is relative. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All these sorts of freedoms are relative and must, in a sense, be examined on their merits. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760826_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Minister will be aware of statements made by the GovernorGeneral,  Sir John  Kerr, at the annual congress of the Returned Services League earlier this week to the effect that certain forces were trying to destroy notions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy among the young and were campaigning to convert students to political ideologies that ran against our traditional system of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are forces at work in society today aimed directly at young people, which are calculated to influence in a fashion adverse to our traditional system of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and democracy, and adverse to our normal methods of democratic discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The whole purpose of Parliament is to express the views of society in terms of a free democracy in which people can come together in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, without any fear of intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other words, the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to demonstrate should not connote the right to obstruct others in their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to associate or their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express their views. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is not they who are protesting; it is a handful of people who see the weapons of obstruction and the weapons of violence as weapons of intimidation against <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me make it clear that whoever may be involved in Australia, any citizen of this country who may be involved, will have the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and the rights of access to any campus to express that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The system is eminently workable and, above all, it is providing individual Australian with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which appropriately fits the Government’s financial objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The final point I make concerns at aspect that  Senator Sheil  raised while I was in the Senate, that is, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When members of the Liberal Party raise the argument of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice they usually look back upon the preMedibank system of health insurance as some sort of ideal or model which ought to be followed in respect of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That situation is held up by the Liberal Party and still seems to be held up by  Senator Sheil  as an ideal, as a model of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ultimate hypocrisy is for anyone who belongs to and supports any of the political parties which on the basis of lies told by a Liberal Government conscripted Australian youths to fight in Vietnam to talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I heard a number of Government senators say that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice- the private health fund system- is the best. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If we are talking about a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, let us be candid. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>So let us not talk about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Medibank scheme introduced by this Governmentthis competent Government- gives the Australian community <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which I am sure to all Australians is the basis of democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we were in Opposition we considered that the original Medibank concept did away with the basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I said earlier, that is a very important thing to the Australian, who is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> lover, who likes to be able to make his own choice and who likes to be able to feel that he is free to do within the law the things that he wants to do. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I listened with interest to  Senator Bonner  who spoke at great length on two premises, one that nothing is free and the other that Australians value <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it quite ironic that it is from the Government that speaks so much about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the rights of the individual that we have this system which locks people into one or other health insurance system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would also like to point out while I am talking about choice that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice was not the top priority of the Labor Government when it set up its Medibank scheme. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of choice was not our major priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would like to draw attention to other organisations which have complained bitterly that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice has been restricted by the new arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So we have one of the major union bodies of this country representing many thousands- perhaps millions- of taxpayers complaining specifically that its members have been denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice by the new Medibank arrangements of this Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seems to me that that is a very serious interference with what the present Government likes to call’ <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760922_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ostensible objectives of the Federal Government’s changes to the national health insurance scheme was to offer greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So much for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We were told that there was this great <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many of my constitutents have said to me: ‘There is no real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe them because if there were real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice there would be 3 choicesMedibank, private funds and the choice to opt out altogether. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us not overburden the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice argument. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The 2 questions to which I referred at the outset bear upon the limit or ceiling on the amount of levy payable and the right of the citizens of Australia to a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to change over from one system to another without a waiting period. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask  Senator Cotton,  who is the Minister in charge of the Bill, in his reply to this debate to give a guarantee to the Senate and to the Australian community that people who retain their membership in a private health fund will enjoy real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice enabling them to transfer to Medibank Private or to opt for the levy system if the charges of the private health funds rise above those of Medibank. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conversely, I ask the Minister to guarantee that those who choose to sign up now with Medibank Private will have the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, about which Government members so freely express themselves, as to whether they will change from Medibank Private to a private health fund if the price of Medibank skyrockets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be an important point to members on the other side who give us so many lectures about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and about competition between funds. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19760923_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The advantages of this practice will be twofold- to provide a better and faster information flow to the Government by providing a means through which difficulties will be detected as soon as they arise, and by aiding Aboriginal people to become more confident of themselves in managerial procedures and administration as they are given more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and responsibility in handling programs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have just recently received a letter which was written by Lord Fenner Brockway, a Labor member of the British House of Lords, a man who for many years advocated <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for India. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I also believe that all senators should hope that the Indian state of emergency will be lifted, that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and association will be restored and that the national elections that are set down for February 1977 will take place. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761005_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-52-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Why does not the Government look at the proposition of introducing a realistic home maker’s allowance to be paid to all mothers and home-makers and which will give to those mothers who are forced into the work force and who do not desire to stay there a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761006_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All we had was an attempt to try to damage in some way the fact that the Fraser Federal Government has provided for local government, not by this legislation, but by another means, a source of growth funds significantly larger than in the past, giving local government more <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and more of a place in the sun. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761019_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>However, I would just like to say that it is usual for  Senator Keeffe  and other Queensland Labor senators in debates on matters involving the Queensland Government to make snide references to the Premier, some of the ministers or some of the Liberal Party and National Party members of the Parliament and suggest that there is now a lack of democracy or <span class="highlight">freedom</span> or something or other in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761020_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-37-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The figures that I have obtained on this- they relate to the position a few months ago and there is a fair bit of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for interpretation of and speculation about such figures- show no evidence that from the first week in March, which was when the levy was repealed, there had been an increase in prices to beef producers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761102_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He tells me that he has a certain amount of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that he is able to go out and talk to groups of Aborigines to see whether they have any problems, simply to sit and have a cup of tea with them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to think that he will be able to retain that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, that he will not be loaded down with work which will keep him tied behind a desk, because that type of communication is one way in which to break down the barriers of bureaucracy with people who feel that they are disadvantaged and who find it difficult to communicate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761104_senate_30_s69/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On the contrary, the Commonwealth Government is determined that there shall be set up and maintained statutory bodies which not only have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to carry out their work but also have an objectivity of purpose to bring about what the Broadcasting and Television Act says is their major task- that is, the provision of adequate and comprehensive programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1976/19761109_senate_30_s70/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But again, I respectfully suggest that the only way to deal with recommendation (2) in Item 1 is to oppose it because it will impose further fetters on free debate in this place, upon <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and, worst of all, it will take away a lot of the authority of the  President. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770315_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs and refers to Polish born Australian citizens who fought for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> during the last war and, in particular, those Polish ex-servicemen who fought side-by-side with Commonwealth forces and were awarded British campaign medals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the heart of my Government’s policies lie a commitment and a concern: commitment to increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, opportunity and equality of the Australian people; and concern with enhancing people’s ability to make their own choices and live their own lives in their own way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Speech should have said that the Government had a commitment to increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people except their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to change their jobs, and a commitment to increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to make their own choices except a choice about the sort of employment in which they are to engage. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In contradiction of what spokesmen for the Government have said, the Government’s program is not one which is designed to increase the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, opportunity and equality of the Australian people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770316_senate_30_s72/#debate-42">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I make a very quick comment in the general area of political <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and so on to talk about individual liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Apart from a few shibboleths, such as ‘increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, opportunity and equality of the Australian people’ and acknowledging some of the Government’s band-aid approaches to the problems of our society, the speech told us nothing and gave us only cliches. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What commitment to increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of citizens currently unemployed has this Government made? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> to starve is the only <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for these people, particularly those who, through regulations, are no longer eligible for unemployment benefits; and there are many of them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I see it as an instrument of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which might help to give people some <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to live within the law as they are entitled to do in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first thing to which I think we can point with considerable satisfaction is the renewed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of local government in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We all know that they have been used to reduce substantially the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the discretion of the States to make their own policies and to spend money in the way they think fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770317_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If the Liberal Party and the National Country Party now believe they will do everything to give assistance to the struggle for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in South Africa and Rhodesia and that they will make it clear that we are aligned with those people against the governments of South Africa and Rhodesia I am delighted to hear it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They won their <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770322_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Naturally, there is very broad <span class="highlight">freedom</span> within individual unions in this respect but each registered industrial organisation has such rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This commitment has been demonstrated in a wide range of reforms: The rapid advance to statehood of the Northern Territory, now underway; the granting of a greater degree of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory; active support for the participation in the Hobart Constitutional Convention; the decision to put to the electorate the 4 referendums on 2 1 May; our undertaking to introduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation; and our fiscal policies of tax sharing and tax indexation which will render State governments and the Commonwealth government more accountable to the electorate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The next point in the statement was:  our undertaking to introduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>While the size of the sample was relatively small, the survey gave a clear indication of the relatively liberal attitudes of the community in the Australian Capital Territory to a woman’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as to whether or not she will have an abortion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770324_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think probably the first test case relating to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move was taken out recently in the courts in Cairns. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770329_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Certainly it ought to look towards <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in movement of Aborigines back towards their traditions, forward into our western culture or to a fairly continuous movement between the two. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prohibit this generally would be an infringement of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770330_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask: In view of the statement in  Her  Majesty’s Speech at the opening of this parliamentary session on 8 March that a Bill relating to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information would be placed before the Parliament and bearing in mind statements by senior Ministers that the Budget deficit will have to be cut by another $2000m, thus affecting employment opportunities within the Commonwealth Public Service, is the Minister now prepared to make public the staff ceilings that have been imposed on the various departments of the Commonwealth Public Service? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These arrangements will assist the Commission in its coordinating role, while at the same time enabling each Council to have a significant measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to decide and act within its own area of specialisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paragraph 13 of the report relates to individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent an individual from carrying on any particular activity involves some restriction on his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> particularly if it affects his livelihood, but the curtailment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> involved in the prohibition of what can at most be an intermittent activity of recruiting mercenaries in the United Kingdom is a minor one and does not require a high degree of danger to the public interest in order to justify it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the other hand although, as will later appear, we do not think there are any means by which it would be practicable to prevent a United Kingdom citizen from volunteering while he is abroad to serve as a mercenary and from leaving the United Kingdom to do so, we should regard any attempt to impose such a prohibition upon him by law as involving a deprivation of his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to do as he will which would require to be justified by a much more compelling reason of public policy than the prohibition of active recruiting of mercenaries within the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He did not quote paragraph 10 of that report which dealt particularly with individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To prevent a United Kingdom citizen from accepting service as a mercenary abroad is a restriction upon his personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which could only be justified on grounds of public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The conclusion arrived at by the Government was that the recommendation, so far as it referred to publication of a news item, represented an infringement of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Press and would seem to be an unnecessary precaution. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things which must be taken into account by government is the right of its citizens to their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action, as far as is consistent with its policies against terrorism throughout the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That was their struggle for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> at that time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Bearing in mind the responsibility of the administering Power to undertake all efforts to create conditions enabling the people of Portuguese Timor to exercise freely their right to self-determination, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence and to determine their future political status in accordance with the principles of the Charter and the Declaration, in an atmosphere of peace and order, <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Calls upon all States to respect the inalienable right of the people of Portuguese Timor to self-determination, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence and to determine their future political status in accordance with the principles of the Chaner of the United Nations and the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770331_senate_30_s72/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of the people who are responsible for this action which has been taken against Paths to Peace would be the very people who would be the first to cry McCarthyism if anybody were to do anything to limit their right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770420_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make the point that the industrial relations policies which are being debated before the Senate today are a sort of legislation which has within it the protection of the individual the protection of groups of individuals, the right of people to find, not necessarily as individuals, some sort of representation in the courts, and the right of people to object to matters which they believe are not relevant to their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as members of a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must be aware that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country as anywhere alse must be related to discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whether a person is in an industrial circumstance or a commercial circumstance, without a measure of discipline no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> will exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We on this side of the chamber believe that individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is more important than that and that an employee should not be made to join a union and to abide by that union’s decisions whether good or bad, right or wrong. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We believe in individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that this Bureau will be an industrial ombudsman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe in the complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, that the individual’s right must be protected and that each and every member of the community is entitled to the same protection under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A large part of those freedoms which I have just mentioned is the right of the individual to choose his own employment and to choose to join or not to join any organisation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  Senator Wriedt  says, I believe that it is fundamental to the working of this mechanism that they should be given that kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in the first place to report on priorities within financial and other guidelines, and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to dream further or to comment further than that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#debate-27">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bill provides that the councils shall do virtually the same work that the Commissions do today, that is, statutory bodies with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to seek and to find, to investigate, to dream, to report beyond the guidelines and the confines of the Government of the day but also equally within those confines. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770421_senate_30_s72/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add that neither the existing legislation nor the proposed amendments to it unduly restricts the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals or companies in Australia to obtain insurance cover overseas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770503_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The protection of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, which is of great value in this community, is achieved by setting up universities and councils as statutory bodies in which they make their own rules. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us take this matter in a sober fashion, bearing in mind that there are very real dangers if governments, State or Federal, should attempt to intrude their legislative powers to restrict on a campus, student or other action, political or otherwise, because it is very hard to decide what is true academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and what is intimidation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770504_senate_30_s73/#debate-20">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are a Bill  to set down  standard procedures for Commonwealth adjudicative tribunals, in line with the recommendations of the Kerr Committee, and a <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, which will entitle persons to have access to documents in the possession of Commonwealth agencies, subject, of course, to certain exceptions designed to protect the public interest in the confidentiality of certain documents and proceedings. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Liberal ideas and ideals, which originally emerged in opposition to autocratic power and entrenched privilege, are of the greatest relevance to the issues and problems facing contemporary society; to the problems of human <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; to the problems of the relationship between the individual and the l arge organisations that dominate our society; to the problems of inequality and disadvantage; and to the problems of achieving meaningful change and reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have acted to increase individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and choice, to provide effective assistance to people who are disadvantaged or in need - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Members of the Government have mentioned in speeches in this House their disappointment at the inaction of the Government in accepting its responsibility towards the East Timorese people; the families of the 5 Australian journalists who were killed in East Timor; people like Jim Dunn and other people who have travelled to Portugal to get evidence from East Timorese who left their country, their homes and their families behind to live in some sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> rather than live under the oppression of an Indonesian tyranny which has taken over their country, and virtually stripped it of all the good and supplanted it with all the evil. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770524_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Because of this success, and because of its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from income tax and profit payments, the Corporation has accumulated substantial reserves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770525_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>That is why the Government is pressing on with legislation in 2 areas; firstly, for proper archives legislation and, secondly, for a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such access will be made possible under a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In responding the Commonwealth Minister for Transport mentioned: the budgetary and economic problems facing the Commonwealth; the flexibility allowed the States in proposing reallocation of Commonwealth grants between road categories, and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with which they can shift their own road funds around; that the Prime Minister would shortly be writing to the Premier of Western Australia to attempt to resolve the State’s problems on quota expenditures from its own sources. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770527_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They are independently governed so that academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> may be maintained. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We are told also that the Government has in hand a Bill to provide standard procedures for Commonwealth tribunals and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We await both of these Bills with interest, particularly the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I note also there are more elaborate provisions in respect of the ability of the Attorney-General to give a certificate in respect of matters which he regards as undesirable to disclose and that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from disclosure is something which is allowed to be put to the Tribunal where it would prejudice security, defence or international relations or would disclose proceedings in cabinet. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Likewise, I think that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which is soon to come before the Parliament will make this legislation much more valuable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770530_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That is the very essence of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the society in which we live. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is quite ridiculous, as I said earlier, to assume that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under the law can exist if the law cannot be implemented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770601_senate_30_s73/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>

    <p>Restrictions placed on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of mail for manual processing- i.e. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But they are entitled to exercise their rights in an atmosphere of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, not under the draconian legislation that is being introduced by means of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770819_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is this pursuit of equality in the world which, I think, in many respects is more important now to many people than the traditional pursuit of the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770823_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In regard to overseas borrowing controls the Government has decided that it is prepared to provide, in respect of major projects, longer term assurances of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from future adverse changes to the controls on overseas borrowings which might prejudice forward plans for funding subject to the following conditions: The assurances would apply only to projects involving estimated capital expenditure of $500m or more; applicants would be required to demonstrate that there is a very high probability of the project being commenced within three years; and no assurances would be given in respect of overseas borrowings with a repayment term of less than four years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We of the Labor movement accept the proposed policy of the Government, wherein the Minister states, in respect of major projects involving estimated capital expenditure of $500m or more, that longer term assurances of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from future adverse changes to the controls on overseas borrowings will be guaranteed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770824_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-40-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I ask: Does the Government intend to carry out its stated intention of introducing a Bill relating to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information during the present session of this Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill, I think as recently as the opening of the Australian Legal Convention in Sydney round about 4 July the Prime Minister again said that the Bill would be brought into Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770906_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Australian exports have achieved an excellent reputation in overseas markets for their presentation and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from residues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770908_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-36-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think all honourable senators will agree that if there is one fundamental principle underlying the practices on university and college campuses it ought to be the total right of people to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, whether their views are acceptable or totally odious. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The maintenance of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is not achieved when one believes the views of the other fellow but, as Disraeli said so much better than I long ago, it is preserved when one disagrees with him entirely and, in fact, finds his views objectionable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a very serious breach of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The same principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech should be observed everywhere in Australia, not only on campuses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a sad thing that they give our institutions a bad name but it is now doubly important that those who walk on the campuses and those with authority on the campuses should insist that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> be observed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the past the Government has invited the authorities on the campuses to uphold the rule of law and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech to ensure that there is no intimidation or threats of violence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Basically the universities and colleges are set up as independent statutory organisations primarily for the protection of their right to academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and inherent in that is the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth Government, through myself as Minister for Education, has in fact discussed the matter of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action on campuses with vice-chancellors and principals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770920_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recently in another place the Prime Minister was asked whether he knew that a group calling itself the Australia <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> Group had released the names and addresses of the entire staff of the Joint Intelligence Organisation, claiming that this material had been leaked by the Australian <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wish to inform the Attorney-General that I looked in the directory and found nine names without addresses, whereas the list being circulated by the Australia <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> Group or ASIO or whoever has 286 names and addresses. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They were therefore subject to Australian laws and rights, including what I regard as the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, to self-determination, to compulsory education, to official legal tender and to comparable conditions of employment including wages and certain standards of health, hygiene and housing. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I mentioned that provisions would be introduced to permit <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for members of the Cocos community and also that provision for granting Australian citizenship to Cocos Islanders born there before 1955 and who did not apply for citizenship in the prescribed time would be reviewed with a view to making it easier for the citizens of Cocos to take out such citizenship if they wished to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the same as the Labor statement of September 1975.  there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and communication within the Territory; <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770921_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the honourable senator would further know, and as would be known particularly by  Senator Messner,  who has a very deep interest in taxation measures, the Government has also announced that it has extended the investment allowance for two years and, in respect of major projects, has decided to provide long term assurances of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from future adverse changes to controls on overseas borrowings subject to certain conditions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Collard  had better make up his mind whether he supports the new federalism, with its professed objective of maximising the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for State governments and thereby imposing no such restrictions, or whether he supports the policy entailed in this Bill, for which he also commended the Minister, of stipulating that a given proportion-  Senator Collard  said a higher proportion- would be applied to rural local roads. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Walsh  does not seem to understand the difference between road classifications and the greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that this Government has given to the States to allocate road funds to the various road classifications.Certainly it is well within the right and responsibility of this Federal Government to recommend allocations to the various classifications but the States are completely free to allocate funds within those classifications as they see fit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government boasts that its federalism policy gives <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the States, but here we have legislation that is taking it completely away. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19770922_senate_30_s74/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This one was a leap into the unknown, purely and simply for <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the Bantus gained great respect for these hardy white men and women who were fiercely honest and prepared to fight to the death for their rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and,  Mr President,  they still are. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is the suppression of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and access to information, and the second is the presence in this country of an operative of a declared illegal regime- the paid agent of that regime operating in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first one requires little consideration because I do not think anyone in this chamber would argue for the suppression of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech or access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are relative also to a recognition that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is a meaningless circumstance unless it is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> within a measure of restraint, within a measure of discipline, a discipline which is the discipline of the majority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We heard quite a few remarks from the previous  speaker  in this debate,  Senator Scott,  about the importance of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, equality of opportunity and things of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771004_senate_30_s74/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We were told by the then Attorney-General,  Mr Ellicott,  that the main purpose of the human rights commission would be to investigate and report on the extent to which legislation in Australia conformed with international conventions purporting to protect individual liberties, particularly in the area of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from exploitation and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771005_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The broad details of Australia’s Cocos policy are as follows: a representative form of local government for the Cocos community to be established with the ultimate aim being the creation of a fully elected body; arrangements to be made allowing a transfer to the Cocos community of the village area ofHome Island; the replacement of token money by Australian currency; establishment of a new form of fund to assist the financing of community activities’, there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and communication within the Territory; the improvement of education and health facilities and general upgrading of living standards; the framing and implementation of laws which could be clearly applied and enforced, taking into account local institutions and customs; the progressive introduction of a wages economy appropriate to Cocos conditions; appropriate means by which Australian citizenship can be provided to residents of the Territory who wish to take up Australian citizenship; the provision of financial assistance to Cocos Malays who wish to move from Cocos to Australia; and the ownership by the Australian Government of all land on which its facilities are located. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Clunies Ross estate provide for direct payment of appropriate sums of money in Australian currency to the Cocos community; a separate Cocos community fund be established for this purpose to be administered by and for the sole benefit of the community; the use of token money eventually be discontinued and replaced by Australian currency, taking into account the complexities involved; provision be made to issue local ordinances and establish better facilities for the administration of justice; health and education services be extended; rates of pay and employment conditions on Cocos aligned progressively with Australian practice and International Labour Organisation conventions; provisions be introduced to permit <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for members of the Cocos community and provision for granting Australian citizenship to Cocos Islanders born there before 1955 who did not apply for citizenship in the prescribed time with a view to making it easier for the citizens of Cocos to take out such citizenship if they wished to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771006_senate_30_s74/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In order to ensure our own political and economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we will need the greatest possible flexibility and skill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771011_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we have done in recognising land rights for Aboriginals is to offer the universal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of personal liberty and private dignity inherent in Liberalism to Aboriginals so that they may choose their own life styles and live by their own culture and enjoy the same freedoms as all other citizens of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771013_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-52-34">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I direct the attention of the Attorney-General to reports that the Government is now deliberately delaying the introduction of legislation on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and ask him, first: Is that the case? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771018_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Federal Government has decided that a better course of action is to allow the State governments more <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, despite the facts and despite what we have already seen. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The primary <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that they wanted was the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to keep slaves. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not want to deride their great national traditions or the sacrifices they made in moving there; but the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that they were fighting for was the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to deny another man his <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When they demand <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for themselves and the rights to preserve their own culture they say that they are entitled to achieve this end by denying to other people who live within the Republic of South Africa the same rights that they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Senator Withers,  in his wisdom, has said many times that Liberal Party senators in this place have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771019_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>A second trend is that, in pursuing economic and social objectives- in seeking to give effect to their broader aspirations- trade unions have sought to extend their strength and influence by intensive recruitment activity and have endeavoured to impose greater restrictions on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individual employees and, indeed, non-employees. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771020_senate_30_s75/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Can the Minister confirm that academic staff of the Australian National University are affected by the Commonwealth employees legislation and that therefore the academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Australian National University would be eroded by the operation of the legislation? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The honourable senator raised the question of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether the honourable senator is confusing academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with licence of academics. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not see how academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> can be attacked if a person who does not work is not paid for just attending his place of employment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not know whether academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> means that one need have no regard for the taxpayers who provide almost all of the income received by academics or whether it means that academics need have no regard for the students who one would imagine would be their first responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peculiarly enough, I have never ever heard them say they are concerned about academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> because they have it and they exercise it properly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>No society can continue to exist with effect as the Australian society has done, and will do with prosperity and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, unless we ensure that trade unions, incorporated companies or classes of superior position and opportunity are under the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The old idea of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and the old British concept of trade unions are being knocked bit by bit. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>There is the record but today people talk about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to join or to refuse to join a union. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the Government is honest with itself as regards <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, it must say that it is against human rights for a court to be able to say to a person: ‘You want to belong to that organisation, you want that organisation to protect your rights but we are saying that you cannot belong to the organisation’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite are so concerned about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, I ask them to hark back a few years and think about what happened during the period from 1965 to 1972. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It seems a strange confusion to suggest that something which seeks to allow the individual a greater measure of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and to allow him to take action behind an authority which he may not seek to take as an individual for various and proper reasons is dictatorial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771021_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I am concerned that in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission and in particular in relation to what has happened m Melbourne there is another example of the grey palsied hand of conservatism resting on a great national institution with very grave and detrimental effects to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and the dissemination of news in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771026_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Every time members of the Opposition interrupt to support the Denis Freneys of this world they underline their stance as disrupters in this community; they come on side with what is called low level terrorism, that is, the use of threat and intimidation to destroy <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Fundamentally, that means they will uphold <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, whether it be from the Left or the Right, and not selectively, only when it comes from the Left and the far Left. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771101_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-27-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-I refer the AttorneyGeneral to the proposed <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill, which has been the subject of long and intense study and recommendations by many honourable senators and honourable members, including  Senator Tehan,  the  Chairman  of the Government Parties’ law and government committee,  Senator Knight  and other honourable senators on this side of the chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Earlier in this session my predecessor,  Mr Ellicott,  was in the United States of America and had some very useful discussions with officials in that country on the subject of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and the Bill which had been prepared for introduction into this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771107_senate_30_s75/#debate-16">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Is the Minister aware that, as a result of disclosures under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act in the United States of America, reports have revealed that there is a substantial danger of causing cancer in the use of chloroform in various forms? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the forcing of this process denies <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-13-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In recent times, the Premier has forbidden the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People can no longer go in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in my State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is quite a reprehensible attitude because one should cultivate the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the light of the impending, and I hope soon to be introduced, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and also in the absence of the broadcasting information office, the establishment of which has been recommended in the report of the Tribunal concerning self-regulation and which I hope will come on the scene, I feel that much of the criticism of the secrecy provisions in that they are rather too strong is justified. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When one considers proposed section 106B to which  Senator Missen  referred and considers this legislation in the light of the much vaunted <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which we keep hearing about, one thinks that it is a nice and interesting question what sort of documents would be confidential. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadcasting is a public concern, it uses public air ways, and the suggestion that disclosure of information should be subject to the sort of penalty set out in proposed section 106B is an extraordinary provision in the light of a Parliament which beefs about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and which already has a Crimes Act on its statutes. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771108_senate_30_s75/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the employees are to be dismissed because they hold political views different from those of the Queensland Premier, is this not a suppression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual political rights of the two employees? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We remind the Government that public standards regarding <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and accessibility to information have changed in Western democracies and are changing in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1977/19771109_senate_30_s75/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One notion, which the Government has been trying to express for a long time, was the importance of economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  has frequently espoused this and has expressed it in terms of an individual ‘s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make and spend his own money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should have thought that that was totally inconsistent with the well-being of the majority of the community as a whole and totally inconsistent with the very frequent references in the Governor-General’s Speech to the civil liberties or the individual political and social <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the citizens of this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point, which I shall reiterate for  Senator Wright’s  benefit, is simply this: The notion of economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> does not necessarily lie well with the notion of individual liberty and individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Really, what has been attempted is to lard over the notion of an individual ‘s economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with some lip service notions of civil liberties. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He saw that as an essential <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What he was really saying, of course, was that in his occupation he was advancing the cause of human <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second matter which is pointed out in this section of the Speech is that the Government will introduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which will give members of the public a right of access to government documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope the Government will introduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which will give citizens access to government documents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a common, public secret that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which will be introduced is a sort of anatomical freak. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>that a better society can only be realised by giving the men and women of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ways to achieve that power, that choice and that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is through the acquisition of useful information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information legislation is very much in the final stages of preparation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But I do not agree with his comments regarding other aspects of the Government ‘s programfor example, the announcement about the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It brought experts from overseas to look into the preparation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation, but it never reached the position of actually putting any legislation before the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The significance of the document is that in many cases, irrespective of the type of government from which people are seeking <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, it is very hard to define in advance whether people really are political refugees or whether, to use the term usually adopted by our Foreign Affairs people, they are subject to political duress. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> in any aspect does not exist. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780222_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phrases like ‘individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>’ were used constantly throughout the address by the Governor-General. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have a government which talks at great length about individual rights and freedoms, about increasing the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, about putting money into people ‘s pockets and enabling people the choice of how that money is spent and so forth. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, several speakers in the Address-in-Reply debate- not all those speakers have been from this side of the chamber- have pointed out that there is a very serious and distressing disparity between what a Fraser Government is prepared to say about individual freedoms and liberties and what it in fact does on this matter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which we require in a society such as ours is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to earn a living, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go out and get a job and to have income to dispose of as one wills. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have no <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice whatsoever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If they do not have their own income they do not have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in this basic way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here in the Australian Capital Territory, of course, we have a very clear example of the various failures of the Government to provide that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice which comes from having a job. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let me describe now in some specific detail the unemployment situation in the Australian Capital Territory and let honourable senators judge for themselves whether or not the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to work really exists here in this Commonwealth territory. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, the opportunity of persons to earn their living in the private sector has been significantly reduced by the actions of a government which likes to speak of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and extol the virtues of the free enterprise system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780223_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that we set up tertiary institutions in Australia, giving them autonomy, in order to protect academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government has invited all of the institutions to amend their ordinances and regulations to provide the kind of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that  Senator Wright  quite correctly has in mind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is necessary to take further action in order to reach the goal of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the individual and the right of the individual to opt out, the Government will not be hesitant to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Terrorist acts are a violent assault upon the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of each and every Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second provision relates to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of scientific investigation and co-operation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The real position is that, as in every other sphere of social and political life, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice should be available to married women in this situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The economy should be geared to give a genuine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to a married woman to tend a machine, work in a factory or stay at home and care for her husband and children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information legislation will be introduced to give members of the public a right of access to Government documents where these can be made public without harm to any overriding public interest. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780228_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 wish that the National Library could have greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for development than is presently available to it and that the Parliamentary Library, with its legislative research service, dealing as it does with a wide range of mattersincluding the matter of its futures, following very hard on the heels of the Congressional Research Service in Washington- could be developed not just for the convenience of members of parliament but also to facilitate an effective appraisal of policy matters and their inferences for members of the community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780301_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pass system will not alter the existing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, or the existing restrictions upon movement, within the building of persons permitted to enter the non-public areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But in view of the volume of comment on the Bill and because a number of other Bills introduced last year by my predecessor also have been the subject of a great deal of commentI refer to the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and the Human Rights Commission Bill- it has not been possible to process the legislation to the stage where I am in a position to make to the Government any further recommendations in regard to the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#debate-14">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They have also become aware that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and many other freedoms which are sometimes glibly spoken of can be found only in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They merely need the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to follow the course or the dream they choose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the provision of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and capacity to follow whatever course one seeks to follow. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fourthly, I suggest that we should examine the real meaning of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in our society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do all sorts of things in the name of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Eventually we reach a point where we are confusing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> with licence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point I make is that if our sort of democracy is to survive we must recognise that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> itself is a somewhat meaningless word unless it is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> within a measure of discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a tremendous movement in the Australian community, a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, a real integration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That is, the Government’s fundamental belief-  is that a better society can only be realised by giving the men and women of Australia a greater measure of choice, power and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If those programs are adopted the majority of married women in the work force who, according to recent surveys such as those conducted by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Electrical Trades Union, have been forced to enter the work force through economic pressure will have a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the option to leave jobs, thus creating employment opportunities for the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It referred to innovations in the field of human rights and civil liberties, the establishment of a human rights commission and to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which I hope will be given priority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is the zone of peace, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and neutrality that has been proposed by the Association of South East Asian Nations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When has it been accepted that life and limb should be placed above the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and association of the individual? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the matter is put in the balance, is it a reasonable result to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> raised up if on the other side of the balance our security is weighed down by overprotection? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think any person’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> should be limited for either  Senator Wright’s  protection or my protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-The people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move into their Parliament should not be limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The limitation of our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move may extend to the limitation of other people’s <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780302_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>To prohibit this generally would be an infringement of individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have listened tonight with interest to what  Senator Harradine  has said and I support the need to ensure that individuals, be they independents or members of minority parties, have the right to be heard and the opportunity for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in the Senate chamber. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780307_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The current policy of the Government is to permit private organisations considerable <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in relation to the nature of benefits provided under supplementary benefits tables provided that the Minister for Health is satisfied that the tables are financially viable. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-14-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are seeking to prevent recruitment, as subsequent clauses of this Bill will do, but we are not seeking to stop people from having the right and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to join the armed forces of other countries if they wish to do so. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780308_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the comments which I quoted, Lord Denning had nothing in particular to say on the question of privacy and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion because he was not, in laying down principles, concerned with those issues. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780309_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-39-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In general, Australia is committed to the maximum possible <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in media activities and the flow of information and news. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We favour <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and competition in the provision of news, both nationally and internationally, as we do in other fields. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-31-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to quote the words of Arthur Lewis, M.P., who was  chairman  of the British Parliamentary Committee for <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We do not have that sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The right of peaceful <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly was guaranteed by a thousand years of English common law tradition, and in an interview when he arrived in Brisbane for that function  Mr Hodgman  said that he found most degrading  Mr Bjelke-Petersen’s  McCarthyist outbursts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780314_senate_31_s76/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for the Aurukun people to decide the rate and pace and direction of their own development. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for them to respond to the impact of white society at their own pace and in their own direction, that is what it ‘s about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780315_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pass system will not alter the existing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, or the existing restrictions upon movement, within the building of persons permitted to enter the nonpublic areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is euphemistically described as security in that sense might well be dangerous from the point of view of securing that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of members of parliament to have, as it were, anonymous guests or visitors come to the building if they so desire. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a risk of insecurity is to be removed there is a corresponding infringement on the civil liberties- on the privileges- of members of parliament if that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access and movement is in any way curtailed by a pass system and there is a collection of bureaucrats of one kind or another standing at the doors of Parliament House asking people for their passes and who they are when they come in and go out of the building. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I could put it in a very blunt and obvious form, if a public servant wants to come and, in colloquial parlance, wants to leak something to a member of the Opposition- reprehensible as that may be regarded in general political terms- the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of that person to do that and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the member of Parliament to receive that information might be curtailed by a pass system such as is used in the Bantu lands or in certain airline establishments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not say that that sort of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> does not have to be sacrificed to some degree in the interests of security but these proposals represent a change because they affect the lives of members and their day to day movement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If members are not told about this there is a very real risk that the limitations of the members’ <span class="highlight">freedom</span>- as they are used to it- will cause friction and dissatisfaction among members of the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As members of parliament we should be prepared to take that risk in the interests of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of access into this place for ourselves, our families and our constituents. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all can lament the limitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that it means, but we have to realise that we have a particular responsibility. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#debate-47">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the ramifications of that legislation which has been a source of concern to the Council of the Australian National University is its implication on academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of academics in the community to pursue both their chosen vocation and their right to express views about a great variety of controversial issues with which the community is confronted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not think they will give in easily to petty attempts at restrictions on the autonomy of an institution which has reached its standing as a result of its <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, given to it in the original Bill and maintained by the Parliament thereafter. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The way in which a nation is willing to guarantee academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is important to the character of the nation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780316_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is important to underline the fact that the traditional <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the public to have access to the building in that sense has been preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What we are seeking to do when looking at our privileges as members of Parliament is simply to ensure that we retain the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to carry out our duties as elected representatives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I agree that when we impose a system of controls we are of necessity raising the possibility of some restriction of that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of which members of Parliament are very jealous. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not so much concerned with the so-called privileges and rights of members of parliament as they affect me, provided I am able to work efficiently and provided I have proper access to the Parliament, to have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and access to the people whom I am supposed to represent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my opinion, that is of great importance but, likewise, security is of great concern, because within that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> we are able to exercise our rights and perform our duties as members of parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important, as the  President  said in his statement, that the pass system does not alter the existing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement, or the existing restrictions upon movement within the building, of persons permitted to enter the non-public areas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I regard <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement in this place as one of my privileges that ought not be jeopardised without my being consulted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Yet over the past few weeks we have accepted lightly measures which limit us and limit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of people to operate and associate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the sake of our well being- I believe that it depends upon our attitude to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement and associationwe should quickly consider whether it is necessary for a person having reached his place of operation to continue to wear his pass. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are supposed to be the exponents and the champions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some people in some parts of the world- in a fairly significant number of parts of the world- have taken it into their minds to abuse the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which exists in a number of countries and to impose terror and restrictions which will lead to the achievement of their objectives. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are doing that with a view to destroying <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and imposing systems of authoritarianism so that they can take over the control of those authoritarian systems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Security is important but so, too, is <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> must always involve risks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the things that are happening from the point of view of the imposition of an authoritarian attitude by governments make me feel that our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the preservation of our democracy may be at risk. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We all know that murder, muggings, holdups, rapes and other types of attacks on personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty and the right to the preservation of personal integrity, take place; but what we try to do as a society is create a balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A free society is something which in every possible way we should attempt to uphold and preserve with its full freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think we have the opportunity to lead the world back to a system of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, sanity and balance. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When I hear people say that the introduction of a pass system of the sort that has been referred to is an infringement of our <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, or the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of our electors who have lawful occasion to come here, the most parallel precedent in history that I can bring to mind is the debates in the House of Commons when Canning and  Sir Robert  Peel were introducing legislation for the establishment of a civilian police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were at that time, 150 years ago, vehement cries of invasion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, because the House of Commons was proposing to establish and support a civilian police force. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I say, prima facie, a system of security is overdue and, from what I can see, so far from infringing <span class="highlight">freedom</span> it strengthens the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of members who have lawful occasion to come and go. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780404_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This derives from a number of factors: Firstly, its importance to public information, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and expression is crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therein lies our basic approach as regards broadcasting planning and policy implementation, expressed in the following philosophic terms: That government involvement in Australian broadcasting must be directed to ensure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in all forms of communication available to Australian society, particularly radio and television, and that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is best served by diversity of structures and outlets. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, we also believe that facilitation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise in broadcasting must be consistent with the onus upon government to make the necessary planning and administrative provisions, to obviate the risk of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and enterprise for one sector, or group, being indulged at the expense of others, or of the system as a whole. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mr President, the Government is mindful of the inherent relationship between <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and a free society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He spoke of the importance to the public of information, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the Minister even said that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression is crucial. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should say by way of comment that the Opposition, and I think the general community also, has cause from time to time to question the credibility of the Government when it speaks of the importance of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were some unfortunate episodes in the recent past when it appeared that the Government was not adhering to the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression in broadcasting. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So when the Minister and the Government express as their first priority with regard to a public broadcasting service the sentiment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression, we hope that they are genuine in that sentiment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780405_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is not such a practice inconsistent with the Government’s declared policy on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and its intention to legislate effectively in this area? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-3-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The hijackers were described by an ethnic broadcaster on station 2EA as ‘courageous seekers of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> ‘. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The role of the Church within the community be defined to the satisfaction of the Church, and that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the Church to appoint staff sufficient for that role be guaranteed by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would provide for selfdetermination so that the Aboriginal people and Islanders have the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go where they want. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He has enhanced his <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence accordingly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780406_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I merely add that the honourable senator would well know that the Government is committed to introducing a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we are all Australians we should have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move; there should be no restriction on people so far as this country is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780407_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst we may gain some publicity or some better communication of what was being said in adjournment debates I think we would lose some of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we have to address the Senate in our own way for as long as we think is necessary and with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which we think is appropriate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780410_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government could get into a lot of international trouble if, as has occurred, reports going to international bodies from the Women’s Affairs Bureau of the Department, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, put forward the concept that the Union of Australian Women and the Women’s International League for Peace and <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> are the only organisations in Australia dealing with women’s affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780411_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inherent in that, because we trust that council and put it together in a particular way, is our giving to it <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to go about its business. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the honourable senators think that that is simply a casual or simplistic answer, I want to say that in the broader sense I am  conscious that  the community feeling- I suggest it is also the parliamentary feeling- is that whilst in relation to statutory corporations, particularly educational bodies, we should be zealous to preserve academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, we, as a Parliament, have a responsibility for the correct discharge of our duties, particularly in the administrative sense and in the sense of efficiency in terms of money. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand we uphold this principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the rights of the statutory authorities and yet, as all honourable senators will know, this Parliament- I think, rightly- is seeking more and more the right to probe. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For my part, I have no objection at all to the most searching scrutiny by Parliament- I could not have objection anyhow- but I would encourage it, because I believe that it in no way interferes with the essence of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780412_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-35-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have informed the Senate in recent days, there have been discussions between the Premiers and the Commonwealth about a method of development of infrastructure borrowing which would conform with the 1927 Financial Agreement, and the gentlemen’s agreement, yet perhaps enable wider <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement by the States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780413_senate_31_s76/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I thought the honourable senator believed in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780505_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-8-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This practice is followed by delegations from countries such as ours, where there is a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for expression, and all our delegates concurred in the decision. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#debate-38">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Prime Minister reconcile this apparent failure to provide information with the Government’s public commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780509_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-46-10">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Aboriginal people want self-management; they want some <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; they want the chance to stand up, the chance to run their own lives, to make their own mistakes and to establish their own lifestyle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They want <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from a repressive government that treats them like idiot children. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-34-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again that is an important statement because it is implicit in that statement that at times Aborigines will make choices which will not suit other people; but they will be choices which they make in their own <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to make them, to follow their own lifestyles and to live their own lives on their own land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, this legislation offends demonstrably against concepts of civil liberty and it offends grievously against this Government’s professed interest, which has been continuing for a long time now, in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Honourable senators on the Government side told me to wait until I saw their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have seen numerous Bills come before the Senate which show not the slightest reflection of an understanding of the concept of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, such vetting would err on the side of greater security and less individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the danger of a new  McArthyism  is real. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information is vital, the Parliament cannot, and will not, tolerate attempts to prevent the carrying into execution of carefully-planned defence projects. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must understand that the Parliament operates in a society in which there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion and debate on these matters and that persons involved in that process of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion and debate should not be subjected to the sort of pernicious powers which are available to the Government under the Atomic Energy Act and which will be available to the Government if the Environment Protection (Nuclear Codes) Bill is passed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  also gave it away at the finish of his speech when he talked about empty rhetoric, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of discussion and debate and the pros and cons concerning uranium mining. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It seemed to me that so long as there was an opportunity for the expression of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of opinion about uranium mining in Australia,  Senator Button  would have no objection to it other than that he would not have used the vehicle of the Atomic Energy Act for this purpose. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780510_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wherever questions arise as to what might be regarded as excesses or abuses within the media, there is a general tendency to defend those abuses on the grounds of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Government believes that there is at least a contending <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and that is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the general population of this country to maintain what it regards as the normal standards of behaviour and not to have thrust upon it by way of assault, standards which it abhors. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This proposed legislation compares very poorly with nuclear regulatory processes in the United States where public rulemakings hearings are mandatory and public access to information is guaranteed by <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For boycotting or threatening to boycott such projects, or for publishing about or advocating the boycotting or threatening boycott of such projects, the penalties are up to a year in jail and a $10,000 fine, h could have an impact on press <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as well as the rights of trade unions, workers and other citizens. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780511_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then we heard from that great mistress of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action,  Ms Horan,  who first of all attacked  Senator Bonner  by asking him whether he had gone all black. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Parliament not yet having before it a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill and, clearly, being in the process of considering a change in the area of confidentiality of government documents, I hope that we will soon find ourselves with legislation which is effective in regard to restricting the amount of confidentiality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This relates to the point I made earlier in regard to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and the proper disclosure of commercial documents and information which ought, surely, to be within the public scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It relates also to such fundamental issues as the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association with particular causes which may be seen to be worthy or the decision not to associate with causes which might be considered unworthy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They relate to the powers of university authorities and the associations that exist on campuses; they relate also to the meaning, I believe, in this case in particular, of conscientious objection; and to the significant issue of the fundamental freedoms of individuals to which I referred at the outset, such as the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#debate-63">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Minister reconcile this apparent failure to provide information with the Government’s commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-23">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bearing in mind the Government ‘s announced policy of providing for general <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, will the Minister undertake to make the report available to the Parliament? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It would not be the Goverment ‘s wish to limit that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in any way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780524_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-64-37">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fifthly, there will be appropriate guarantees for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement for ships and aircraft in the area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the Protected Zone provisions permitting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement by the local people in the carrying on of traditional activities, the treaty will provide for cooperation on immigration, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treaty will contain provisions covering appropriate guarantees of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of navigation, passage and overflight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treaty will contain provisions which safeguard traditional activities, including in particular traditional fishing, by the people of the Torres Strait area, that is the Torres Strait Islanders and Papua New Guineans who live in the adjacent coastal area, and which provide for continued <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement about the Zone in pursuit of these traditional activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In relation to the Protected Zone provisions which will permit the continued performance of traditional activities by the local peoples and continued <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement about the Zone for that purpose, there will be cooperation on immigration, customs, health and quarantine arrangements, although each country will retain the right to implement national controls to prevent abuses or other possible adverse effects of the Protected Zone provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The treaty will contain appropriate guarantees of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of navigation, passage and overflight in the Torres Strait area. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In particular, the protected zone provisions of the treaty will permit <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement by the local people within the protected zone, but at the same time the treaty will provide for immigration, customs, health and quarantine arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As we establish the Kakadu Park, as we set up mechanisms to ensure the preservation of the ecology, as we define the sacred lands, surely we build the dignity, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the fulfilment of the Aborigine. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another part of the report says that many more species probably remain unrecorded because the species in the lessaccessible parts of the park, in parts of the plateau and some permanently wet areas were not collected as thoroughly as they should have been; some species were not known previously; regions are notable for their present relative <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from introduced species. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is very hard to see from the Bill how much <span class="highlight">freedom</span> the Supervising Scientist will have to act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780525_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How does the Minister reconcile this apparent failure to provide information with the Government’s public commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-56-4">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most of these vessels have been fishing in accordance with the concept of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the high seas. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is necessary to have an industrial or health inspector or any other kind of authority to monitor and restrain the activities of a corporate body, surely the least we can do is to give that authority the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that is extended to industrial inspectors and other authorities who have a responsibility, by virtue of their public position, not to disclose information irresponsibly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-34">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment would prohibit the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action necessary to do that. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780526_senate_31_s77/#debate-36">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What consequences to our export market does he see if Canada or some other large trading country should secure <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from this disease before Australia does? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-28-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, the use of section 44 of the Atomic Energy Act which relates to communication of restricted information with intent to prejudice defence, contravenes Articles 18, 19 and 21 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, which deal with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the one hand, the Covenant proclaims these basic rights of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, whilst, on the other hand, the Atomic Energy Act as it is applied to Ranger would impose a penalty of 20 years imprisonment for a person communicating certain aspects of the Ranger development to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The matter that I shall debate is one of the basic tenets of Australian democracy, namely, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the course of my comments today I shall outline how, whilst this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> theoretically exists, certain Australians find that their ability to nominate for Federal office is severely limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Removal of this constitutional requirement would allow public servants the same basic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to nominate for political office as is enjoyed by other Australian adults. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780529_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those who have the courage to speak out in defence of national and human rights in Ukraine are dealt with by the Moscow government in a manner which is abhorrent to every <span class="highlight">freedom</span> minded Australian. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-1">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I give the Senate a specific example: It seems to us extraordinary that a Government presided over by Malcolm Fraser, a Prime Minister who talked in his policy speech about what I think he called the fifth <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, namely, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to spend one’s own earnings as one wishes- a government which is committed to that sort of principle- should countenance legislation such as this. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although since 1972 there have been fewer such demonstrations of the wish for greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> on the part of the Lithuanian people- fewer overt signs- I believe that these feelings are no less present and are perhaps stronger now than ever. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Honourable senators will recall the occasion when a Lithuanian sailor, Simas Kudirka, sought refuge on a United States coastguard vessel in 1970 and was later sent back and sentenced to 10 years hard labour for having made an attempt at <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have raised this matter this evening because this month marks the sixth anniversary of those events in Lithuania and elsewhere in the Baltic States when the people of the Baltic States took a stand for their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence and, through those events, made their views known to the world. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>On 14 May, in one of the squares of Kaunas, Romas Kalanta (born 1953), who had finished secondary education and was the son of a college lecturer died by selfimmolation, under the banner ‘<span class="highlight">Freedom</span> for Lithuania’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780531_senate_31_s77/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He has argued that what is necessary is that the States be given <span class="highlight">freedom</span> by way of more access to taxing themselves, if they so desire, and for them therefore to use the independence that they would have from that to gain their sovereignty. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-2-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When the Commonwealth and State governments, in this case proudly, accept that responsibility to provide that money for the secular delivery of compulsory education in those sectors of the community that by conscience and by <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice elect to support non-government schools, we are not in any way infringing principles; we are in fact providing secular education inside non-government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secondly, can the Minister say whether it is a fact that the measures which he has now announced are to ensure individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> on university campuses, particularly the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, and to ensure that those sorts of freedoms are in fact preserved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of  course,  the principle is one which aims at <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association on the campus. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780602_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-23-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Nothing in what I said in any way argues against the premise of what is being done now, which directs itself purely to the socio-political activities of students and their right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association on the campus in those activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill represents a major initiative by the Government in its program of administrative law reform. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although a number of countries have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation, this is the first occasion on which a Westminster style government has brought forward such a measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The basic principles of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill are simple: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The crucial element in drafting the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill has been to strike the appropriate balance between openness and secrecy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for this balance was expressed in the report on the United States <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time that a broad philosophy of ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information’ is enacted into law, it is necessary to protect certain equally important rights of privacy with respect to certain information in Government files, such as medical and personnel records. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, for example, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation in the United States operates in a quite different administrative context. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a good deal in common in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information laws in other countries in the kinds of information protected from mandatory disclosure, notwithstanding differences in the constitutional and administrative structures within which those laws operate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill operates on a wider scope than any of the existing means of obtaining access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill will require Ministers or departments seeking to withhold information to justify their decisions to deny access to information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, together with other recent reforms in administrative law, thus emphasises the administrative accountability of Ministers and their departments. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The necessary publication must be made within 12 months of the commencement of the clause and must be in a form approved by the Minister administering the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are those who say that the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill should apply to all documents, and not only to those to be brought into existence in the future. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In enacting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation within a Westminster-based system of government, the matter of the final authority to decide whether the giving of access would be contrary to the public interest is clearly of central concern. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is thought that the imposition of a more rigid time limit would impose undue strains on the administration of departments, and require the diversion of an undue amount of departmental resources to dealing with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The time limit applies to a request that is identified as being made under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act and that is sent to the agency concerned at an address of the agency specified in the regulations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have indicated, the Government believes that the principles on which the Bill has been drafted are the proper principles on which to base a <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>DOCUMENTS THAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE <span class="highlight">FREEDOM</span> OF INFORMATION BILL 1978 <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The following documents are examples of the kinds of documents that would ordinarily be made available to the public under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The relevant provisions of the Archives Bill and the measures contained in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation have been carefully coordinated in order that together they should constitute comprehensive arrangements covering the public accessibility of the widest range of Commonwealth documentation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Broadly speaking, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information covers material which is thirty years old or less, while the arrangements under Archives legislation relate to records more than thirty years old. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Inevitably, however, in the interests of personal privacy, good government and security, some exemptions will have to be applied and these will be very similar in principle to those provided for under <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-44-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>For example, it gives a much greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to the State housing authorities to determine what they will do with the funds, lt also places a much greater emphasis on home ownership rather than on the provision of rental housing, ft provides for  much more  flexible mortgage conditions than have applied in the past, lt makes adjustments to interest rates which have applied in the past and it provides that any surplus generated by the. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I briefly recapitulate the arguments in favour of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In countries such as the United States the provision of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation has been seen as a solution to some of these problems. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think you,  Mr Acting Deputy President,  will recall that when this matter was first discussed by Government senators in this chamber some 18 months ago- with a degree of excitement- I described the legislation on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information to be introduced by this Government as being an anatomical freak, that is, it was a gelding before it was born. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my view there was no hope of this Government introducing legislation for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information which would have any significant teeth and which would go anywhere near as far as did the legislation in that unusual and, in a way, great democracy, the United States, where legislation of this kind was first brought into existence after the Scandinavian countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps for those honourable senators who come from States which have already introduced <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation this is a unique opportunity for them to represent the views of their States in this chamber and adopt the sort of position which their State governments have adopted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>On 12 June this year he said that there were strong and compelling reasons for the referral of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill to a Senate committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I refer now to  Senator Missen  who has been diligent in the pursuit of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>His  degree of diligence has taken him to the United States of America to study the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation there. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen has made six or seven other points of a similar kind in articles in the Melbourne  Age  and elsewhere which go right to the heart of the notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Affairs, which at least is composed of elected members of Parliament and not of officials who presumably would be concerned about the consequences of any <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This extremely high degree of the people’s political responsibility for the affairs of state could only be reached by experience and practice, rooted in the soil of the communities with their innate sense of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One element that has been drawn to the attention of Liberal senators in this Parliament is the fact that our Liberal Party platform specifically issues a warning in regard to the purposes for which economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is to be seen to be existing and strengthened. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Liberalism aims to create a society in which individual economic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780822_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As democratic socialists- we bear the label proudly- we stand for the values of equality, liberty and democracy: greater real equality in the distribution of wealth, income, power and status in the community; full respect for the personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity of the individual; the fullest possible opportunity for democratic participation by every individual in all the major decisions that affect his or her life in the work place and in the local community as much as in the larger political sphere. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780823_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-32-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The debate concerns social control by someperhaps those in government- on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For example, I would not want it to be thought that I recommend complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of use of narcotics, although I note that all narcotics- opium, morphine and heroin- at one time were freely available across the counter in this country and in most Western countries. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the programs I have mentioned were adopted, they would provide a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and the option for those people to leave jobs, thus creating job opportunities for the young. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I believe that there should be a true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice but not by virtue of the fact that there are not sufficient supportive policies of the Government to provide that true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for married women with dependent children, to take the economic pressure off them and to enable them to become full-time homemakers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the Soviet Union a system which denies fundamental human freedoms, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of thought, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780824_senate_31_s78/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My advice is that the Government has submitted to the International Labour Organisation’s Committee on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association its observations on the allegations made by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association concerning the compatability of the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act 1977 with ILO Convention No. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I understand this convention, it was designed to guarantee workers’ <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and the right to organise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association will then issue its decision in the form of a report to the ILO governing body. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have, however, reconsidered the decision and while the Government does not propose to make available documents of this kind, the report will be examined in accordance with the principle that, so far as departmental resources permit, material that is not exempt within the meaning of the parliamentary paper and the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill will be segregated and made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-7">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In my consideration I have had regard to the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978 and in particular to clause 30 of the Bill which provides that documents the disclosure of which would constitute an unreasonable disclosure of the personal affairs of a person are to be exempt from mandatory disclosure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-8">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>and (3) Whatever might be the legal position with respect to the disclosure of a document such as that referred to in the question to a member of the public upon request made by him if the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill in its present form became law, the question whether a member of the Public may be allowed to inspect the report must be considered in the light of the law as it now stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780912_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-56-9">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>As the Minister responsible for funding tertiary institutions, does not the Minister think that this case reflects very gravely upon the concept of academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> as practised by the University of New South Wales, the fact that one can get justice only if one has the money, and the failure of the State Labor Government to end compulsory membership of student unions? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, my Government has conveyed to every State Premier its views and a request that the States themselves might, as Victoria and Western Australia have done, take action to provide for such a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which, after all, is inherent in the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations Charter and which therefore ought to be acceptable to all. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Commonwealth believes that, consistent with the rights of institutions to maintain their academic freedoms, they should demonstrate their responsibilities to maintain the democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individuals within those institutions, because those individuals in the institutions should be as free as other individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, it must regret that any individual should be threatened with the lack of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to pursue studenthood simply because that individual refuses to pay a fee that has no relationship whatsoever to studenthood. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780913_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is indeed my conviction that most Australians believe in the system of free enterprise democracy which is based on the family unit, which admits the profit motive within the law as being satisfactory to the desires and the dictates of human nature, which admits equality of opportunity, which admits that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is a relatively meaningless concept unless it is experienced within a properly conceived and majority held and enforced discipline. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780920_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Consistent with the spirit of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which is currently before the Senate, and the Government’s policy on access to official information, the Bill repeals the official secrecy provision contained in section 3 1 of the principal Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780921_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I trust that the implementation of those measures has been done with the least possible intrusion on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780926_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-12-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The main purpose is to adhere to the principle enshrined in the Declaration of Human Rights that there should be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action and that no one should be compelled to sponsor or to back causes which are obnoxious to him. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780927_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-20-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that at a time when there is debate throughout the community and in the Parliament on the matter of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and a great demand by the public and members of parliament for increased access to information it is not appropriate for information available to senators and members in their Parliamentary Library to be restricted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So there is a question of the physical liberty and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement of the subject involved here. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-45-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Archives Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible, in so far as the Bill relates to issues common to or related to the inquiry into the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Archives Bill was presented to the Senate at the same time as the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It contains issues relating to the national archives which, in the view of some honourable senators at least, involve the same principles in relation to the disclosure of documents and the methods by which the disclosure of documents may be brought about as those in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I envisage that the major inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs would be directed towards the provisions of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation, and it may be that after the members of the Committee determine what principles they think should apply in relation to that legislation they could as a more supplementary matter examine the terms of the Archives Bill to see whether they think that those principles are appropriate for application to legislation of that kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government will not oppose the motion as amended now by  Senator Button  to refer the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and the Archives Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There has already been a good opportunity for the public to consider both the principles on which the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill is based and its detailed provisions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I mentioned in my second reading speech, the tabling at the end of 1976 of the interdepartmental committee report on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation provided an opportunity for public debate on the principles. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The departments, as part of an exercise, reassessed the questions in the light of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allowing for differences demanded by the fact that the legislation will operate within a Westminster-based system of government, the Bill compares well with the legislation in the few countries that have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need to protect internal working documents has been recognised in every country that has <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Canadian Government, for example, has gone no further than to publish a Green Paper on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In a White Paper, published only in July 1978, on the revision of the United Kingdom Official Secrets Act, the United Kingdom Government- a Labor government- expressed its view on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information and an open government in the following terms: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the Bill was introduced I have had an opportunity to see at first hand some of the administrative problems arising from the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation in the United States. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government does not believe that departmental resources should be unreasonably diverted from the ordinary work of departments to answering <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information requests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Senator Button  has made out a case for the reference of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, the exemptions are basically the same as those contained in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1 978 although they are fewer in number. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has even greater objections to the exemptions contained in the Archives Bill than to those contained in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill because of the age of the material- 30 years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I will not comment on that except to say that no doubt we will be looking among other subjects with interest at the reaction to those questions and to other questions in regard to matters relevant to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So far as the amended motion is concerned, one recognises that one of the two Bills before us- the Archives Bill- is only partially relevant to the subject of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information generally. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill has been on public display for a few months and, of course, it has had a period of some five years in gestation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We will urge them to put in submissions that are directly related, of course, to the way in which <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information might operate in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a vast amount of material to be looked at in regard to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By this I have in mind the possibility that there is some lack of knowledge both in this Senate and in the community as to what <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information might involve. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-I support the reference of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and the associated Archives Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I am a member. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I acknowledge at the outset, however, that it may be with some alarm that supporters of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation view the prospect of the referral of these Bills to yet another committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The history of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill has after all been littered with the devoted attention of committees, albeit not parliamentary committees and what unsatisfactory history it has so far been. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the original initiative was taken and the commitment made to introduce <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation by the Whitlam Labor Government the matter was referred, as I suppose is inevitable whenever the Public Service sees its institutional interests immediately involved, to an interdepartmental committee of public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regrettably, however, that greater intensity of effort did not result in any more sensitive appreciation of the kind of legislation that is needed if <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation is to justify that name. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the two IDCs however, it can be said that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information idea was not just strangled but in fact bludgeoned into insensibility, then garrotted and drawn and quartered for good measure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whilst the present <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill does not mirror exactly the terms of that second IDC report- it is only to be expected, I suppose, that there would be some modification when it took a further 18 months for that IDC report to be transmitted into the present legislation, which was introduced in June this year- certainly it can be said that the Bill preserves the spirit of that 1976 committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But by and large the Bill is at best, to any objective observer, a very grave disappointment and, at worst, an absolutely counterproductive travesty of everything that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation is supposed to be about. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is possible to produce good tough <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which will balance the rights and interests of the community generally against the necessary demands of government, and I am confident that this is what will be recommended by the Committee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am sure, in all charity, that  Senator Lewis  has gone back to his room to prepare a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs about the issues involved in this debate on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact, I do not think I am revealing any secrets when I say that he accused me in a not unfriendly way earlier this evening of trying to deny the people of Australia the benefits of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill as drafted by his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can do so politically in the knowledge that the vast masses of the people of Australia are not as yet as concerned as they might be about the contents of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, but perhaps that will come in time. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780928_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-54-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Finally, does the Minister agree that a most important consideration in this matter is the best interests of the Australian public, that is, Australian travellers being able to enjoy large reductions in air fares and full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to air carrier? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With respect to the particular matter mentioned by the honourable senator, that is the Australian people being able to enjoy a reduction in fares and full <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of air carrier, I agree that they are important considerations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have decided that the three accident reports may now be made available subject to the deletion of certain matter identifying persons from whom statements were taken, the release of which I consider would have a substantial adverse effect on staff management interests of the Australian National Railways within the meaning of clause 29 of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It will be noted that the exceptions mentioned are similar to, although not necessarily identical with, the exemptions contained in paragraph 32 ( 1 ) (a) and paragraph 35 (b) of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978 now before the Senate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781010_senate_31_s78/#subdebate-65-2">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I repeat that all honourable senators will share the Government’s abhorrence of any situation in which the ordinary <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual is restricted because of religious discrimination, whether anti-semitic, as in this case, or otherwise. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-4-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I could not think of anything more abominable in terms of human <span class="highlight">freedom</span> than to forget about the rights of individuals to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In Australia today there are cases of people being denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice-, which is part of the very freedoms that are in the Declaration of Human Rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-6-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This part of s. 116 emphasises the principle of religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let us dwell for just a moment on this question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from religious tests. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Certainly, as regards Jews, it was in only 1 846- a short time ago- that the Toleration Act of 1688 was extended to give Jews <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in English law and the kind of toleration which allowed them to enter into the full communal life in that country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the Australian Constitution was written, we took steps to try to extend religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> here and to exclude tests based on one’s religious beliefs forever from the way in which the Government proceeded and, I would hope, from the way in which its instrumentalities and agencies proceeded. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What we are finding hard to stomach is the calm acceptance by Qantas of these restrictions, contrary to any beliefs we have in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, as  Senator Baume  has mentioned, the one fundamental human right that is mentioned in our Constitution- we do not have a Bill of Rights- is the right to religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and the unacceptability of discrimination on grounds of religion or faith. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a person anywhere in the world tries to book on Qantas and indicates that he or she wants to fly via Damascus the question will have to be asked and that can only reflect poorly on this country whose Constitution mentions the right to religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-30-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I wish to quote from a letter that was sent to the  Australian  on 17 July 1974 by  Senator Withers  about honourable senators opposite having a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781018_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If honourable senators opposite have any intestinal fortitude, as  Senator Chipp  has said they ought to have, and if they have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which they always claim they have, they will cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party to defeat this clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781019_senate_31_s79/#debate-48">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, therefore humbly pray that the Senate will fulfil the pledge of a Member State of the United Nations and take steps to remove the compulsion from the Electoral Act in order to allow <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression for everyone who has the right to vote for Senators. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, what is currently the status of the proposal to introduce a voucher system of education funding to individual families which would have advantages by way of greater accountability in schools, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice and greater incentive for schools to achieve basic educational standards? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, I stress that another real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice option is before the Senate, that is, the provision within the States Grants (Schools) Act of a sum of funds to the States for pilot studies to allow <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as between government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One of the things that we could do in the Territories and in the States is to develop first of all a real <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice as between government schools and then as between the two streams of education. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-21-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think that the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs  (Mr Fife)  should call in the representatives of United Artists and say to them: You people are very good in your own country when it comes to talking about the American way of life and you are very good when it comes to talking about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> but this does not give you an open licence.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781108_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The time to examine that <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the time to take that responsibility, is before they have intercourse, before there is any likelihood of a child eventuating. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The other conflicting philosophy mentioned by  Senator Button  was the right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice of a woman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I recognise readily that a woman in circumstances of not wanting to have a child has a right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When  Senator Button,  according to  Senator Chipp,  poses the dilemma of the right to life versus the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, then I think we have to face the fact that we are in an awkward situation in that if we accept the concept of a living foetus then we have to accept the concept that one of the parties involved does not have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>If a person accepts the separate life of a foetus, that comfortable <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to choose for himself or herself is barred. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thirdly, and perhaps the most important of all, it is an action which, if supported, will give women even greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for it is an extension of women ‘s rights to have control over their own bodies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of those in favour, 55 per cent saw such laws as giving women ‘<span class="highlight">freedom</span> to decide one’s self or as ‘enhancing women’s personal choice’. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These responses were to a completely open-ended question and showed the concern of the majority of people in the Australian Capital Territory to give women greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and control over their own lives and bodies and futures- a right which they should exercise themselves and which the law should protect and guarantee. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If we support, as I believe many honourable senators in this chamber say they support, the principle of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice, then we ought to give to the women of the Australian Capital Territory <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in relation to these matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781109_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Mr L. J.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All he said was that the decision of the High Court will be taken into account in the debate in relation to the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and will be the subject of a good deal of discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#debate-19">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the animal and plant health fields, I am sure all honourable senators appreciate that Australia’s rural production and the advantages we enjoy on overseas markets for our livestock and agricultural products depend critically on our comparative <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from serious pests and diseases. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781121_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-62-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That in order to ensure complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association within universities, and to ensure the automony and intellectual <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of student bodies the prevailing system should not be done away with. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-0-1">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Would the Minister contemplate establishing a judicial inquiry to report on the activities of these cults in Australia ensuring, firstly, that no intrusion into or harrassment of genuine and non-harmful groups by the inquiry is permitted and that true <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to worship is not impaired in any way and, secondly, that the criteria of such an inquiry includes the following: Whether the sect requires from members compulsory financial contributions to the cult or its ‘spiritual’ leader; whether physical or mental damage is exerted or threatened to cult members or their families; whether undue influence is placed on family structures to induce family breakups; and any other associated matters which the Government in its wisdom considers appropriate? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781122_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-11-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, I would like to say that the Government believes, as I certainly do, that in the future development of quality in education it is essential that there be a partnership involving the government, the education system, the parents, the community and the school and that, wherever possible, that there be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice within that situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-25-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I mention that because in a sense it is a summation of a very important view expressed in this report which goes to another question of the claim by many commercial television operators in Australia that the notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the media carries with it the notion that the media should be free to show whatever they like without any prospect of government intervention. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781123_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus one of the basic tenets of Australian democracy, namely the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament, is severely limited for public servants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19781124_senate_31_s79/#subdebate-99-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In view of recent Press comment on the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice in government schools, will the Minister inform the Senate what progress has been made in this area by the Commonwealth Government both in the Territories and in co-operation with the States? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The matter has quickened in more recent times by an initiative from the Schools Commission, which has the Government’s full support, and that is to set up pilot programs in the various States to see whether we can get a degree- if possible a maximum degree- of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice for the parent as between individual government schools. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790222_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-7-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>lt seemed fairly obvious to many members of the Labor Party back in the early sixties- I cannot recall the date- that when a low frequency radio station was being installed at North West Cape in Western Australia we were selling out our rights, our heritage and our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move in any global conflict. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790227_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we hear such words from a leading statesman we must remember that we should develop, in the words of  Senator Wheeldon  when he was speaking on the subject, a distinct foreign policy of our own, a foreign policy that we can declare to the world and in which we can act in solidarity with others in the world to achieve this peace and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> about which Herr Brandt talks. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790306_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That the Senate believes that the unjustly imprisoned members and affiliates of the Soviet Helsinki group should be granted their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and allowed to pursue their lawful activities on behalf of basic human rights without further harassment, and that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should express at every suitable opportunity and in the strongest terms the opposition of Australia to the imprisonment of members of the Helsinki group. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>To return to the Helsinki group and the associated denials of what we regarded as the minimum of rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, one asks why the KGB operates to quash any sign by anyone to exert his rights. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790308_SENATE_31_S80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone who lives in a democracy would support the argument that it is the most desirable form of government because it should maximise the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual in society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790320_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-43-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But the view that has been taken by my predecessor and by me is that these matters impinge very much upon the question of religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and belief and such activities. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>

    <p>It was felt that the matter should be tackled in that way rather than by taking direct action against any particular organisation because, as I have said, such action would impinge on the fundamental questions of religious <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If it is extended to drug detection, it is likely to get out of hand, lead to abuses of power along the lines experienced in America, have little, if any effect on crime detection, inhibit <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of communication by law abiding citizens and be gradually extended to areas of crime detection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I have been discussing in this Senate the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation, and the varying degrees of concern and rhetorical commitment to that concept, but in essence we are concerned here with the same sort of debate in relation to the degree of information that is withheld. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I do not want to go into it now but from some recent experiences I have been having, I am not entirely sure that the United States <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act is quite as effective as some of its enthusiastic admirers might believe, well intentioned though it is. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790321_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-37-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We think that too great a responsibility to protect individual freedoms is imposed by the Bill as it stands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, a vital Bill, is quite properly being given full consideration, largely due to the work of  Senator Missen  and others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790327_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Having put those general views, I want to turn to the question of what I might call the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information implications of this Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As  chairman  of a committee of this Senate which is at present looking into the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill I am certainly concerned with this aspect of the legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It may, of course, be that ASIO either in whole or in part is excluded so far as its records are concerned from the operations of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>He refers to the submissions made based upon the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act in the United States of America and he points out that even under that Act many of the records of ASIO would be confidential information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When we consider the final <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill we may want to have a greater disclosure of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When we look at the clauses in this Bill, we realise that there is certainly a difference in approach in the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Bill to that which is contemplated in the present proposed wording of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Of course, the present wording of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill may not continue to be its final form. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>These are important questions of privacy with which the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill is concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Other clauses of the Bill also contain <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information implications. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A general remark I make about these clauses is that the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, as presently drafted, requires, in clause 28, that the only existing secrecy clauses that will continue are those that are prescribed by regulation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some later stage we will have to consider in this Parliament under the provisions of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act, as I hope it will then be, whether such provisions in this legislation cought to be continued in that form or whether they are too extreme in accordance with our views of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Finally, we must bear in mind in respect of this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information area what  Mr Justice  Hope said in the small part of his third report which was disclosed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We must bear those comments in mind when we look at the parts of this Bill which relate to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope also that the Attorney-General can indicate in his reply to this debate whether he would be prepared to reconsider the terms of this Act when the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill comes into law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-42-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The ideal of the principle and practice of voluntary <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association no longer exists. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compulsory unionism is with us in the form of blatant compulsion or is camouflaged under the cloak of preference at the point of employment, or by intimidation of waiverers or by rendering ineffective conscientious or other objection by an obligation on claimants to show cause why they should be allowed the privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of voluntary association. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Personal freedoms have become negotiable in industrial relations matters and the case that I have outlined has confirmed that they do not - <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790328_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I think we are nearing the time when, with the restrictions on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and liberty in Queensland, there shall be greater violence in that State than we have experienced in other States of Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790329_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Liberal Party vigorously advocates individual liberty and the fundamental rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, organisation, assembly, procession, religion and non-violent dissent. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The recent American <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act, the Church report and the Pike report all show the direction which the United States is taking to deal with this very question. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Those of us who are in the radical movement surrender to no one our defence of the principles of liberty and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, of the right of assembly or of any of the principles that are embodied in the platform of the Liberal Party. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>One of the conditions of democracy is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>How can we preserve secrecy without endangering constitutional law and individual <span class="highlight">freedom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have referred already to the need for secrecy counterbalancing the need to preserve our <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-48-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Thus, the right to strike constitutes a fundamental <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in a democratic society. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>My response was that Australia would not countenance that kind of action; that it strongly deplored the importation and perpetuance of old quarrels, but that action involving restraints on the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of individuals in Australia would only be taken as provided by Australian laws. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790403_senate_31_s80/#subdebate-52-7">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Considering that every person has the right freely to hold and to express his convictions and the obligation to extend a like <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to others, the objects of Amnesty International shall be to secure throughout the world the observance of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-41">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The provisions and rules of the ACTU constitution, of course, are historical but their application is in accordance with the International Labor Organisation objective for the establishment of an economic and social order in which persons can live with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and dignity, and pursue both their spiritual development and material well-being in conditions of economic security and equal opportunity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790404_senate_31_s80/#debate-50">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I queried the extent to which they are secrecy provisions which, I take it, should the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill be passed by the Senate in its present form, or anything like it, would be proscribed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I endeavoured to obtain from the Attorney-General some indication as to whether, if and when <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation is enacted, he proposes to reconsider these secrecy clauses in the light of any changed circumstances that might arise from that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I ask whether these clauses will be seriously reconsidered by the Government in the light of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation, if it becomes law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How does the Attorney-General see this provision and the other provisions in relation to a future <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such provisions, by and large, as  Senator Missen  said, are incompatible with the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information principle. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I hope that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation that ultimately emerges from the deliberative processes of Parliament will embody some substantial reduction in the scope and operation of the secrecy clauses, including in particular section 70 of the Crimes Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>He sees those clauses as being related to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I find it easier to identify an immediate relationship with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information in clause 57 rather than clause 18. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nevertheless, clause 18 obviously has connections with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The relationship between the Australian Security Intelligence Organization and any <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation which ultimately may be enacted has not yet been resolved. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any relationship between this legislation and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation is one to which the Government will give further consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it is generally conceded that any <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation would preserve secrets relating to defence, security and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790405_senate_31_s80/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it is true, would legislation along the lines of the New South Wales legislation not only be a major departure from this Government’s commitment to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information but also make it even harder to get information about government administration than has ever been the case in the past? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information is a different question and does not concern the production of documents in a court or the balancing of interests as between litigants in a court and the need for certain documents to remain confidential in the hands of a government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s policy in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information has been put down in its <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I add that the definition of government documents in the New South Wales legislation seems to be a lot wider than the exemptions granted in relation to these documents in the Commonwealth <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I have said, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation has been referred to a Senate committee for a very full investigation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790502_senate_31_s81/#debate-24">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If we are to get through the crises that will confront us in the next decade, surely we must have <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express reasonably our dissent and our differences of viewpoint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790508_senate_31_s81/#debate-45">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>By way of preface I refer to the Liberal Party doctrine of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When does the Minister expect to have a report from  Sir John  Moore, the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which may devise a formula which will give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice to trade unions which desire to remain in the various State industrial tribunals? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790509_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-9-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>In considering the material that has been tabled today, the Committee sought to formulate recommendations which were feasible and practicable, which could be implemented by the Government and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal without encroaching on the rights of the licencees of television stations to make profits and to have a very high degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in their choice of programming. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We say that this is the very issue that was involved in the Sankey case where the High Court took the view that it was appropriate for a judicial tribunal to make its own mind up whether the interests of justice in a particular case were such as to outweigh the interests in maintaining the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from disclosure of Cabinet deliberations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The question raised by the Opposition’s amendment is, I think, one at which the Government will look generally in the light of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation wash-up. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government policy, as indicated in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and in this and similar legislation, has been to protect absolutely documents of the character of those set out in clause 57 ( 1 ) (a) and (b)- in particular, of course, defence secrets, Cabinet documents and that type of document. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As I have said, we have included a similar provision in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and we are awaiting the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on that legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Therefore, I would prefer that the clause be passed now, subject to my undertaking that it and similar clauses will be reviewed in the light of the final outcome of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I do not presume to prejudge or even trespass upon the possible breach of privilege by commenting on what the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs recommend regarding access to personal files and documents when it comes to dealing with the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Bill, insofar as concern has been expressed about them, are not unrelated to another inquiry which  Senator Missen  ‘s Committee is currently conducting, namely, that into the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>For example the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, in its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information reference, has been taking evidence and deliberating now for something of the order of at least 20 days, which would represent approximately 1 20 hours of consideration. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790510_senate_31_s81/#debate-60">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As the staff of the ABC has, I believe, experienced many frustrations in recent years, particularly about the management and role of the ABC, I take this opportunity to say that I hope that every <span class="highlight">freedom</span> will be given to staff members so that the people who are working to produce a national broadcasting service can contribute to the inquiry and can make improvements as a result of it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>It is not as if this policy of immunity from Australian legislation is being carried through to its logical, conclusion; namely, either complete independence from Australia, which is one solution and one logical way of dealing with the kind of approach that the Government seems to have in mind; or something less than that but nonetheless quite substantial- a system of complete selfgovernment where the Norfolk Islanders would have complete responsibility for their domestic affairs and complete <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from Australian Government interference. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790523_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I would like to emphasise that the provisions of the treaty to a very large extent incorporate recommendations made by the Committee in its earlier report on the Torres Strait boundary, namely: That the Torres Strait Islands should remain part of Australia; that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of passage for Australians and Papua New Guineans should be guaranteed in the protected zone; that mining and drilling in the seabed should be prohibited until agreement is reached between all interested parties; and that new commercial ventures should not be permitted in the area unless they are compatible with the environment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>People with an interest in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information- a large number of honourable senators have worked very hard on the proposed <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill of this Government, which in many ways is deficient and needs to strengthen the right of the public to examine documents- will also be surprised at that attitude being adopted in New South Wales. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790531_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-55-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We have a vision of a liberal society of free, independent people with a pride in being able to do things for themselves- an Australia of growing strength, unequalled as a place to bring up a family, unequalled in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and unequalled in opportunity; a nation creating our own distinctive culture, our own identity out of the culture and history that so many people have brought to us from so many different lands. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790605_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That IDC- God help us if it turns out to be like the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information IDC- has been moleing away at the legislation and the one major result of its labours, so far as I am aware, is that it has recommended the complete emasculation of the role of the Ombudsman in the particular investigation of complaints scenario which the Australian Law Reform Commission so thoughtfully recommended. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790607_senate_31_s81/#subdebate-60-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As I said at the outset, it is better than nothing, but clause 5 appears to limit very much <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of examination of a Bill, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> which I believe is both desirable and necessary. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790823_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-33-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>In the session of the British Parliament which came to an end only with the decision of  Mr Callaghan  finally to submit himself to the inevitable judgment of the British population, a Bill on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information had been introduced by the Liberal member for the Isle of Ely,  Mr Clement  Freud. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The Senate Committee which presented the report which is before the Senate, namely, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, is almost at the stage of being able to bring to the Parliament its final report on the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill which was introduced into the Parliament by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack)  some time ago. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information, which by and large has been resisted in most Westminster parliaments- certainly, by and large, it has been resisted in this Parliament and it has been resisted, in particular, in the United Kingdom Parliament- nevertheless came forward in the British Parliament as the subject of a private member’s Bill which engendered a great deal of debate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Her  maiden speech was made introducing a private member’s Bill, one very much along the lines of a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Bill because it was a Bill which sought to provide that meetings of local government councils throughout the United Kingdom could be held only in public and that the Press and members of the public should have access at all times to all aspects of local government meetings in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I raise this subject as a Christian member of parliament and as one who believes in the democratic right of an individual to have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of spiritual expression. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Jessop  has referred to one element of that, the questions of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression within our society, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of travel. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But this also raises the question of the right to travel which in turn raises the more general issue of personal liberty or any possible curtailment of the right of citizens in this country to participate in such organisations and their right to basic democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> such as <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As the Senate would know, I have expressed considerable caution about what action it would be appropriate to take because these matters do raise very fundamental questions about <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion- religious belief, religious activity. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790830_senate_31_s82/#debate-56">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>All of us, whether we have children or whether we do not have children, have a responsibility to see that the next generation of our citizens have opportunities, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to express themselves, the capacity to develop their talents and the opportunity to move into places which the preceding generation leaves so that all that is good in society may be carried on and expanded and all that is undesirable in society may be corrected and, if possible, eliminated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790913_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-61-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is patently pathetic to think that a government- certainly this coalition Government- would have any interest by way of the socio-economic measures that are contained in this Budget in destroying the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, productivity and development of this great land. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#debate-40">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>-Tonight I bring to the attention of the Senate an area which I think is of great importance to us and to people in this country who believe in <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We then were investigating in another part of the world under another kind of political system the same kind of systematic imprisonment, denial of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and denial of due process. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790919_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-41-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Firstly, there is no inconsistency between the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech in Parliament, that is, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from question or interference by any court or other authority outside Parliament, and the rules of order which each House imposes upon its members in relation to the language they may use. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>But this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from external influence or interference does not involve any unrestrained licence of speech within the walls of the House. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790920_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-43-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the opinion is that there should not be this auditing of expenditure, let me say that this <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from accountability is growing to such an extent in this Parliament that the Parliament should be taking a good look at itself. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790925_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-49-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The British journalist, William Shawcross, recently published a book entitled  Sideshow- Kissenger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia,  which was based on information obtained under the American <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act about the role of the American Government in that Cambodian war. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19790926_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-36-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>We need to be assured that to the greatest extent possible the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to move abroad, which has been recognised internationally in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in our own tradition since the promulgation of Magna Carta in 1215, is fully recognised in our community. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is admirable to the extent that the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of movement- the right to travel, to enter, to leave from and return to one’s own country- is too important to be left to unfettered ministerial or bureaucratic whim, which is exactly the situation that has prevailed until now, with a general discretionary power being vested in the Minister with respect to refusals to issue passports and the cancellation of passports. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual is recognised, but it is qualified, as it must always be, within our own society and within our own nation as subject to the rights of others as we see them- the rights of the spouse, the rights of the child, the rights of the law in terms of breaches of the law- and subject to international rights and obligations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>What I said was that we subscribe fully to the notion of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual, but that we recognise that under the rule of law, which  Senator Tate  understands, that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is subject to the rights of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I now get back to the discussion of the great philosophers of the eighteenth century, the balance of freedoms and so on. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791011_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The New Federalism has given the States significant <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from the dictates of Canberra. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791016_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-51-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that we enjoy in this country, as opposed to the way of life in communist countries, is something for which we must fight. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual to behave just as he pleases is mistaken for democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791017_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I think most of us interpreted that to mean that the chap who did not have the SS man alongside his lathe had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to negotiate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I read it three or four times a year to keep me abreast of what justice is required for <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association not only in trade unions but also in employer organisations. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But now, with this unprecedented situation in the country where a former  President  of the Court, a justice, 25 commissioners and, the final climax,  President Sir John  Moore have expressed opposition to the Bill, I think the time is opportune to refer to the document which is entitled ‘The Protection of Trade Union Rights: Twenty Years Work by the Committee on <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Association.’ <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>87  guarantees to all workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever and without previous authorisation, the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing; these organisations are to have the right to draw up their constitutions and rules, to elect their representatives in full <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, without interference by the public authorities; they shall have the right to form federations and confederations, and to affiliate with international organisations of workers and employers; these rights also apply to federations and confederations; the acquisition of legal personality by organisations may not be made subject to conditions restricting the exercise of these rights; in exercising them workers and employers and their respective organisations must respect the law of the land- <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>I suggest to honourable senators opposite that after they have read  Senator Missen  ‘s speech they should read the relevant sections of the International Labour Organisation’s conventions regarding <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association not only for trade unions but also for employers. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In so doing, it was fairly clear that  Senator McAuliffe  sees this legislation as an attempt somehow to undermine the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association of trade unions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point is that in his speech there was no indication of any attempt in this legislation to cut across the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association of any trade union, whereas the core of this legislation is to provide an opportunity for particular workers and individual members of a trade union to express their views in a free way. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791018_senate_31_s82/#subdebate-47-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But I and the Opposition believe that departmental reports of this kind make a very important contribution to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-43">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>If transmit powers of 20 watts were to be utilised, it is considered that it would be most difficult to obtain the agreement of administrations which might be expected to offer <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from interference to earth station reception in Australia if the low power services employ the same nominal orbital positions as those assigned to Australia in the Plan. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#debate-49">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>A summary of it can be conveniently found in Campbells and Whitmore ‘s book  <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> in Australia,  Second Edition, pages 194 to 196, or any reputable constitutional law textbook. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791023_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-53-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>At the same time there are prohibitions against the export of our products to other countries which, incidentally, are quite vocal on requiring that we give <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of entry to their particular products. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791024_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-26-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other matters referred to the Committee relate to the questions whether the imprisonment of  Senator Georges  was as a result of civil matters and whether the privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from arrest in civil causes was infringed by his arrest and imprisonment. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report discusses the privilege of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from arrest and concludes that the matters leading to  Senator Georges  ‘s imprisonment were not such as to attract that privilege. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Therefore, if there has been an offence under (a), (b) or (c)- if a person refuses to take the action that the Director-General considers is reasonable for him to take in order to terminate or reduce the extent of his incapacity; however minor the offence against one of those sections may be- the Director-General now does not have a <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791025_senate_31_s83/#debate-58">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>-On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, I present a report on the Committee ‘s reference on the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978 and related aspects of the Archives Bill 1978, together with the transcript of evidence taken. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subject matter of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information concerns not only the rights of individuals but the whole structure and machinery of modern Australian government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>1 ) That the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That the Archives Bill 1978 be referred to the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for inquiry and report as soon as possible, in so far as the Bill relates to issues common to, or related to, the inquiry into the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill 1978. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The need for an effective <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act was accepted by nearly all written submissions, with the striking exception of the Premier of Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The view which the Committee formed, that the present <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and the access provisions of the Archives Bill are inadequate, has found overwhelming support from the public discussion. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In regard to implications for the present system of government, the Committee has examined and reports at length on the alleged detrimental effects of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information on the Westminster system of government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Committee has concluded that there is nothing intrinsic to that system that justifies sweeping limitations and exceptions to the basic principles of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information such as are contained in the present Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The greatest area of public dissatisfaction with the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill is in the range and extent of exemptions enumerated in the Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our proposal includes the opportunity, by way of a reverse <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information proceeding, to allow the supplier to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to prevent disclosure. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have urged that all agencies, and particularly the Public Service Board and Attorney-General’s Department, give urgent attention to the planning and implementation of programs to train and develop staff in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It will be evident that the Committee envisages an enlarged role for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We believe he should play an extended role as investigator, conciliator and monitor of the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this regard, we recommend that section 6 (3) of the Ombudsman Act, which would preclude him from investigating a matter which is also the subject of an appeal to the Tribunal, should not apply in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information matters. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the purposes of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, ministerial decisions should also be within his jurisdiction. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In his role of monitoring the legislation, the Ombudsman should be empowered to advise agencies, at their request, as to their obligations under the legislation and, in his reports to Parliament, to offer suggestions for improvement and reform in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information in general. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A number of our recommendations involve the widening of the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information appeals. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Substantial sections of our report deal with the practical operation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation and the facilities which make public participation possible. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I draw attention to our various recommendations on access, on manuals and directories and the regular updating of them, on the availability of the internal law of agencies, on the need for informative <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information handbooks explaining rights and procedures, on language requirements and ready availability. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have applied the same basic principles as we have done in reference to similar provisions of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government’s initiative in the field of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information is most welcome and is a worthwhile commencement point. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incidentally, his contribution to making <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information a public issue in this country can hardly be underestimated. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The findings could be summarised succinctly but, I think, accurately as follows: Firstly, despite what has been said by so many Government spokesmen, the Westminster system does not justify extensive limitations on the scope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information; secondly, many claims about the resource implications of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation have been undoubtedly greatly exaggerated, and the Public Service can and should be able to cope with legislation much less narrow than that which has so far been proposed; thirdly, the present <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill allows much too much information to escape the net entirely, containing as it does too many unnecessarily restrictive exceptions and exemptions; fourthly, the Bill provides insufficient safeguards against administrative, procedural and financial obstruction of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information requests- too many obstructive powers rest with agencies; fifthly, the Bill does not impose sufficiently clear and precise guidelines for agencies to publish directories, indexes, manuals and guides on the operation of the legislation; and sixthly, the present review and appeal procedures are both too cumbersome and too limited. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it has recommended a reduction in the capacity of the bureaucracy to put procedural and financial obstacles in the way of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information applicants. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I certainly want a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information Act. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The community wants <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But we do not want any old <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill enacted. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We certainly do not want a Bill like the present one which is pregnant with the danger of doing more to undermine <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information than to advance it. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>-(Victoria)-by leave-This report, like the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill with which it deals, is one of the most important matters to be laid before this Senate in recent years. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should like to say, with regard to the problem of security documents, a subject on which I have some professional experience, that our recommendations will not only improve <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, but also markedly improve the national security arrangements. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is for the Parliament, not for the Executive, and certainly not for the Public Service to decide the details of a Bill such as the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill was clearly the product of the bureaucracy, with some minor Ministerial input. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I feel quite sure that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information would go a long way in this community to taking away that tremendous cynicism about government and about parliamentarians of which we hear so much. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We have also been informed that on the advice of his Department the Prime Minister  (Mr Malcolm Fraser)  will want to have the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill and this report referred to an interdepartmental committee, which would mean, firstly, that it would be buried completely. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondly, it would mean that it would be watered down at the hands of the same Public Service Departments which have made submissions to the Committee opposing greater <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information- because of not enough staff, because it was not practical or was unworkable- but who were in fact unable to justify in a rational way just what it was that would make it more difficult for them, where the extra workload would come in. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think it will be seen that one of the most valuable aspects of the report, apart from its recommendations about the Australian piece of legislation, will be found in the bibliography which is an integral part of this report identifying the areas of debate and discussion, and identifying the sources pf debate and discussion on the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On page 55 of the Committee’s report, at paragraphs 4.62 and 4.63, will be found its conclusions about the operation of the Westminster system of government and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The report reads: 4.62 We value the Westminster system of government; we do not seek to change it; nor do we believe effective <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation would change it A great deal of the talk about the Westminster system and how it would be altered by <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation has been obscured and misleading. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Very often people have alleged that the Westminster system is under attack by <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation when what is actually under attack is their own traditional and convenient way of doing things, immune from public gaze and scrutiny. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information legislation does not alter this one iota. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other features of the Westminster system which we have identified will either not be significantly changed by our <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information proposals or else will, we believe, be changed for the better. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>4.63 <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of information legislation does not relate to any specific system of government, be it a Westminster, presidential or any other system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any political system which holds that the people are entitled to a maximum degree of information about how their government operates, so that it can be made more responsive and accountable to them, will welcome an effective <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have no hesitation in saying that the witnesses who appeared before our Committee- the permanent heads of the Department- of the Treasury and of the Department of Prime, Minister and Cabinet- appeared without qualification to be most opposed to the effective operation of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The other public servant quite clearly indicated the extent to which he regarded <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information to be an intrusion upon the procedures of his Department. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I believe that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information is capable of making an important change in the way in which Australian government operates and in restoring something that has been substantially lost in the last couple of years in Australia and in other Westminster systems: That the control of legislation and of the shape of government lies in the hands of Parliament and that the purpose for which that control is exercised is the better government of the people of the country concerned. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-45-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>It is a world in which they do not have equal rights to education, employment, health services or even the restrictive freedoms that other Queenslanders have. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> is less than others because of the pre isions of the Aborigines Act, the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the regulations and by-laws associated with those two Acts. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I suggest that the exposure of that so-called confidential information, in particular the remarks of the Queensland Minister, indicate that, until the Commonwealth Government stops soft pedalling with Queensland, there will never be <span class="highlight">freedom</span> for anybody there who is less than white. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791106_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>That <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of learning and teaching cannot be maintained unless tertiary institutions can operate autonomously, free from the threat of government control. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-2-4">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Under these conditions, suppliers experience a high degree of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> in price setting and manufacturing costs do not appear to be a significant factor determining a company ‘s competitiveness. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-38-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, we will be supporting, in I hope its new and burnished form, the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill when it comes again before this Parliament. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791107_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-50-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Our relationship with neighbouring countries like Indonesia is, of course, important, but the sensitivities of the Indonesian Government should not be considered more important than the lives, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>, the self-determination and the health of the men, women and children of East Timor who have been sorely abused for centuries by a neglectful colonial power, who have been abandoned in the wake of a revolutionary change in that colonial power and who were then taken over by a neighbour obsessed with unreal fears that a hostile power could develop amongst the 600,000-odd people on the edge of its own country of 1 30 million people. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>East Timor presents a typical tragedy of modern times; of people who initially were denied <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and development by their colonial power, then were denied self-determination by a neighbour and then, despite the willingness of others to help and despite the good will which existed, perverse national pride prevented the Indonesians admitting until now that a problem existed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-40-1">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We learnt that contrary to the Helsinki Accords, to which the Soviet Union is a party, there is not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion, there is not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, there is not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly and there is not <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of migration, even when it is a case of the reuniting of families. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>We are talking about a struggle of ideas between thosewhatever their views might be on economic policy, health services, nationalising banks or something else- who believe in a system in which there is <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the people to change their government, and those who do not believe in those freedoms. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-57-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first is that the Bill does nothing to actually change the law in any of areas such as police powers, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, voting rights and all the rest of them, where civil rights are very obviously in need of specific legal protection. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of assembly, to take one example in making the point, is denned in Article 21 of the Covenant- the Covenant is conveniently incorporated in the Human Rights Commission Bill by way of a schedule- as being legitimately subject to restrictions:   . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>in the interests of national security or public safety, public order  (ordre  public),  the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That set of permissible exceptions from the scope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly contained in Article 2 1 of the Covenent- particularly insofar as it includes the wide-ranging French expression, ordre public, which is much more extensive in its connotations than the English expression ‘public order’- appears to allow the survival of even a street march law such as that which exists in Queensland. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Putting it simply, a Bill of rights is a document which identifies fundamental rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and requires that they be respected and perhaps sets out some mechanism for their enforcement. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Civil liberties depend with us upon nothing more obligatory than tradition and upon nothing more inflexible than the principles of interpretation and the duty of courts to presume in favour of innocence and against the invasion of personal <span class="highlight">freedom</span> under colour of authority. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The common law has therefore not fared well as a course of basic principles and rules on the protection of rights and <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Secrecy’ clauses, in general, are at present being reconsidered by all Government Departments at the Government’s direction to see whether they should be preserved or not when the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Act comes into operation: yet, here we are creating a new secrecy clause. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday in this chamber the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill was presented. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am suggesting that even if we had <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information legislation similar to that in America it would enable people- the Aborigines and negotiating parties- to gain access to information such as that contained in these documents, which never sees the light of day. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The report goes on to say that there has been discrimination in employment, the provision of goods and services, the availability of accommodation, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association and the use of facilities available to the public. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Many of our colleagues have pointed out that our countries are democratic and are deeply impregnated with a sense of <span class="highlight">freedom</span>; they believe in morality and in natural law . <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>When times are normal and fear is not stalking the land, English law sturdily protects the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of the individual and respects human personality. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final thing that I say on this particular point is that if one turns to the recently produced magnificent volume entitled  <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information  brought down yesterday in the Parliament, one will find on pages 60 to 62 a discussion about conclusive Ministerial certificates. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One would hope one would plead with the AttorneyGeneral, that, having this report before him now and having before him a report from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs- which seeks in terms of the Sankey judgment and other matters to argue as precisely as it can argue on those pages against the system of conclusive Ministerial certificatesunless he expects the members of the Consitutional and Legal Affairs Committee and other members of the Senate not to believe that this report is being treated with monumental contempt, he will make some sort of attempt to come to grips with the question of whether conclusive certificates, which this Committee recommends, ought to be subject to a number of qualifications and appeals which should not appear in the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill or the Archives Bill and, equally should not appear in the Human Rights Commission Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Here a confusion, I must say, entered the remarks of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick  because, in saying that a judicially enforceable Bill of rights is perhaps not the immediate answer to Australia’s situation, I agree only in a sense of that expression, namely, that the judges should not be given as their basic raw material a Bill of rights which is drafted so widely, so ambiguously, as to allow them the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of interpretation which was the concern of both  Senator Missen  and  Senator Puplick. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791108_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-77-2">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Everyone shall have the right to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of expression; … to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a fact, as has been pointed out by honourable senators, that most violations of human rights- perhaps up to 95 per cent, according to documents circulated by  Senator Missen-  occur within State jurisdictions and have to do with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of assembly, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, the rights that one has when a criminal investigation is carried out by the police, and that type of situation. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It ought not to be left to the courts to have the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> to interpret very widely and vaguely drawn expressions of human rights which might be compatible with some philosophical treatise expressing the yearnings of the human spirit that were dwelt on by  Senator Puplick  for the greater part of his speech. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What it does is to rely on an understanding of the law, which was perhaps excusable even at the time of the drafting of this Bill and of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill; namely, an understanding as to the almost sacrosanct character of the conclusive certificate issued by the Executive such as would prevent an independent, impartial body such as a court or commission from inquiring into the reasons which might have led the Executive to decide to withhold a particular document from that court or commission. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information report recently tabled by the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in relation to clauses which were of similar structure in that they simply relied on conclusive certificates of the Executive to prevent documents being obtained under the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill, it was decided by the Committee that nevertheless reasons for non-disclosure need to be given to an impartial tribunal so that it can decide on the relative strength of the claims made by the Executive for non-disclosure as against, in that case, the need for a full disclosure in accordance with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information philosophy; in other words, let an independent tribunal judge where the public interest lies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of clause 15, I think one need to go no further than to ask the Government, as representd here by the Attorney-General  (Senator Durack),  not to proceed with this clause until it has come to a publicly announced response to the findings and recommendations of the Senate Committee in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>Senator Missen  has pointed out some substantial procedural defects in the present Bill: The lack of any enforcement power by the Human Rights Commission; the power given to the Minister to by-pass the Commission and give its power to the States; the possible conflict of the revised <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill which I thought dealt very effectively with the undesirability of conclusive certificates by Ministers; and the undesirable introduction in the Human Rights Commission Bill of the legal concept of standing to preclude people without sufficient interest from making a complaint. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>As a State  Senator I  am an ardent defender of the decentralisation of power where it is appropriate for administrative efficiency or political <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>They include: The National Socialist Party of Australia; the White Christians League; the Hungarist Movement- the World Association of National Socialist Hungarians; and the Australian League of Rights and its related bodies such as the Christian Institute for Individual <span class="highlight">Freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>But any political passion for equality wrecks any hope of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> because natural law springs from two principles; firstly, self-preservation; and, secondly, a natural repugnance to unwarranted infliction of pain and death. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>The first was for religious toleration, <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech, and the right of assembly. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-73-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most States, not only Queensland and Western Australia, although they have become the most notorious in this respect, have on their statute books legislation which, if enforced in a ham-handed way, is manifestly offensive to rights of public assembly and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, assembly and political protest in the public domain. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

  <li>
    <p>There is also the treatment of trade unions, which is quite offensive to the historical notion of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association of labour which has manifest itself in a number of ways, most recently in the essential services legislation in that State. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#debate-75">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>Of course, the principles of universal suffrage, the Bill of Rights enacted in 1688 and <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of religion are some of the great achievements of parliament and parliamentary democracy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791113_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-75-0">[More…]</a></p>

    <p>I quote from page 24 of the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information report of one of our own committees, where it says: <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I think there is a very good case not only in respect of this particular piece of legislation but also as part of the general principle of trying to establish in a more principled way the role of the Parliament so that the sort of information which we will be talking about in another piece of legislation- the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill- can be made available. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-65-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having recently presented a report on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, the members of that committee hope that there will be very substantial work done by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in that area of the law. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I was given a lecture by  Senator Evans  recently about his report on <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, that without further ado or consideration the Government should implement all the recommendations that were made. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-71-15">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of learning and research is fundamental to democratic societies. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a degree of sadness that we have before us this sort of situation in relation to one of our great institutions, let me just say that it is my pride that I have enjoyed 10 years’ association with it, and that I have great faith in the Council of the University to be able to make decisions which are reasonable and responsible and which do take into account some of the fundamental considerations of what is important to the Australian way of life, considerations which include an absence of compulsion and a <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of choice. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is easy to say that <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association, a concept with which I am obviously in complete accord, implies, as a necessary corollary to it, the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> not to associate. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-74-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has been associated with the legislation in Victoria and in other Liberal jurisdictions which has been aimed at limiting <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of action of student organisations and the autonomy of the universities in controlling them. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are quite insensitive to university autonomy and, if we want to put this way, to the academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that is integrally associated with the notion of university autonomy. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the whole, the Bills represent a small step towards the practice of voluntary <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of association on the campuses of two eminent Australian tertiary institutions. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that over a growing number of years the community, in a very articulate fashion, and the students have expressed the view that it is repugnant to democratic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> that students on campus should be compelled to join organisations to which they are philosophically opposed and that they should be compelled to provide money out of their pockets to benefit organisations to which they are opposed. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Opposition has argued that the Bill represents an attack on academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is the duty of government to legislate to set up the framework of a statutory body within which academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> shall flourish. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no attack at all on academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Does anyone suggest that that was an interference with academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span>? <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fact the interference with academic <span class="highlight">freedom</span> was the restraint of the student against re-enrolling. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791115_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-76-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact is that the decision as to whether an individual parliamentarian acts with <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of conscience and free of all outside influence is a matter of the honesty and integrity of that individual. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-10-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The amendment proposed would provide that unless the kind of principles which the Government has already accepted in its <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill apply- that is, that a hearing in public would prejudice the investigation of the law or the fair trial of the person and the several other matters then set out- the hearing should be held in public and not in private. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#debate-46">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To me the objective is the creation of a regulatory framework which is intended to provide for the operation of a free, fair, open and efficient capital market and which is designed to ensure the enjoyment of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of enterprise in the same way that our traffic laws provide for the enjoyment of our right of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of passage over our public highways. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791119_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-46-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By the same token, no Parliament can work unless there be an acknowledgement of past practice, together with an observation of the Standing Orders, which have been set out for no other purpose than to ensure the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of honourable senators to express themselves in parliamentary language and to enable democracy to operate in our parliamentary system. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791121_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-56-0">[More…]</a></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Government to be proposing to vest such powers in a narcotics bureau which was itself then under a serious cloud, with unanswered allegations outstanding in respect of both its competence and, more particularly and more seriously still, its integrity and its <span class="highlight">freedom</span> from corruption of an internal kind. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-58-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs came to the same conclusion in its report on the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Government is likewise concerned with the proposed amendment to delete pans of Clause 1 S ( because of their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information implications). <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs has submitted a major report on the <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> of Information Bill which raises these matters for debate and consideration by the Government. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In other debates this year, in which the same question has arisen- for instance, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation- I have said that the Government, when it determines its policy in relation to <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information, will reconsider these types of clauses in various measures. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They are all bound up with, and relevant to, the question of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information but at this stage, pending that policy’s being determined by either the Government or the Parliament, the Government believes that this clause, which is similar to clauses in other legislation, should stand. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I make only one further comment and that is that it might not be as effective as one would like, even within its own terms, to the extent that the Opposition would regard it desirable not only that an aggrieved individual or group be able to litigate but also that the Human Rights Commission have the power to initiate litigation on behalf of someone so aggrieved, as was a provision in the Human Rights Bill 1973 and as has been recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in respect of the enforcement of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of information matters by the Ombudsman. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#debate-61">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In which of these countries do human rights, in terms of the practical constitutional <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of citizens, approach the standards: (a) laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and ( b) enjoyed by the average Australian in Australia. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-49">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All States are well on target and in fact, it is anticipated that the interim objective of nationwide Provisional <span class="highlight">Freedom</span> (ie 2 infected cows per 1,000 cows) by 1984, will be achieved earlier. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1979/19791123_senate_31_s83/#subdebate-63-93">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Bill is an onslaught upon the rights of <span class="highlight">freedom</span> of speech and of peaceable assembly in this country. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1971/19710422_senate_27_s47/#subdebate-29-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If it had embarked upon that course it could not be accused of interfering in the <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence of universities, as it will be accused as a result of this statement and the legislation which, presumably, is to follow in the Budget session. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780601_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-52-0">[More…]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Acts and their regulations and by-laws be abolished forthwith, and that Land Rights be established, believing that only when these two demands arc fulfilled will Aboriginals and Torres Strait Island people begin to have their <span class="highlight">freedom</span> and independence. <a href="https://historichansard.net/senate/1978/19780609_senate_31_s77/#subdebate-0-2">[More…]</a></li>
